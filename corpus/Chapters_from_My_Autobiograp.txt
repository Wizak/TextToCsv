chapters from my autobiography north american review no dxcviii september chapters from my autobiography i by mark twain prefatory note mr clemens began to write his autobiography many years ago and he continues to add to it day by day it was his original intention to permit no publication of his memoirs until after his death but after leaving pier no he concluded that a considerable portion might now suitably be given to the public it is that portion garnered from the quartermillion of words already written which will appear in this review during the coming year no part of the autobiography will be published in book form during the lifetime of the author editor n a r introduction i intend that this autobiography shall become a model for all future autobiographies when it is published after my death and i also intend that it shall be read and admired a good many centuries because of its form and method a form and method whereby the past and the present are constantly brought face to face resulting in contrasts which newly fire up the interest all along like contact of flint with steel moreover this autobiography of mine does not select from my life its showy episodes but deals mainly in the common experiences which go to make up the life of the average human being because these episodes are of a sort which he is familiar with in his own life and in which he sees his own life reflected and set down in print the usual conventional autobiographer seems to particularly hunt out those occasions in his career when he came into contact with celebrated persons whereas his contacts with the uncelebrated were just as interesting to him and would be to his reader and were vastly more numerous than his collisions with the famous howells was here yesterday afternoon and i told him the whole scheme of this autobiography and its apparently systemless system only apparently systemless for it is not really that it is a deliberate system and the law of the system is that i shall talk about the matter which for the moment interests me and cast it aside and talk about something else the moment its interest for me is exhausted it is a system which follows no charted course and is not going to follow any such course it is a system which is a complete and purposed jumble a course which begins nowhere follows no specified route and can never reach an end while i am alive for the reason that if i should talk to the stenographer two hours a day for a hundred years i should still never be able to set down a tenth part of the things which have interested me in my lifetime i told howells that this autobiography of mine would live a couple of thousand years without any effort and would then take a fresh start and live the rest of the time he said he believed it would and asked me if i meant to make a library of it i said that that was my design but that if i should live long enough the set of volumes could not be contained merely in a city it would require a state and that there would not be any multibillionaire alive perhaps at any time during its existence who would be able to buy a full set except on the instalment plan howells applauded and was full of praises and endorsement which was wise in him and judicious if he had manifested a different spirit i would have thrown him out of the window i like criticism but it must be my way i back of the virginia clemenses is a dim procession of ancestors stretching back to noahs time according to tradition some of them were pirates and slavers in elizabeths time but this is no discredit to them for so were drake and hawkins and the others it was a respectable trade then and monarchs were partners in it in my time i have had desires to be a pirate myself the reader if he will look deep down in his secret heart will find but never mind what he will find there i am not writing his autobiography but mine later according to tradition one of the procession was ambassador to spain in the time of james i or of charles i and married there and sent down a strain of spanish blood to warm us up also according to tradition this one or another geoffrey clement by name helped to sentence charles to death i have not examined into these traditions myself partly because i was indolent and partly because i was so busy polishing up this end of the line and trying to make it showy but the other clemenses claim that they have made the examination and that it stood the test therefore i have always taken for granted that i did help charles out of his troubles by ancestral proxy my instincts have persuaded me too whenever we have a strong and persistent and ineradicable instinct we may be sure that it is not original with us but inherited inherited from away back and hardened and perfected by the petrifying influence of time now i have been always and unchangingly bitter against charles and i am quite certain that this feeling trickled down to me through the veins of my forebears from the heart of that judge for it is not my disposition to be bitter against people on my own personal account i am not bitter against jeffreys i ought to be but i am not it indicates that my ancestors of james iis time were indifferent to him i do not know why i never could make it out but that is what it indicates and i have always felt friendly toward satan of course that is ancestral it must be in the blood for i could not have originated it and so by the testimony of instinct backed by the assertions of clemenses who said they had examined the records i have always been obliged to believe that geoffrey clement the martyrmaker was an ancestor of mine and to regard him with favor and in fact pride this has not had a good effect upon me for it has made me vain and that is a fault it has made me set myself above people who were less fortunate in their ancestry than i and has moved me to take them down a peg upon occasion and say things to them which hurt them before company a case of the kind happened in berlin several years ago william walter phelps was our minister at the emperors court then and one evening he had me to dinner to meet count s a cabinet minister this nobleman was of long and illustrious descent of course i wanted to let out the fact that i had some ancestors too but i did not want to pull them out of their graves by the ears and i never could seem to get the chance to work them in in a way that would look sufficiently casual i suppose phelps was in the same difficulty in fact he looked distraught now and then just as a person looks who wants to uncover an ancestor purely by accident and cannot think of a way that will seem accidental enough but at last after dinner he made a try he took us about his drawingroom showing us the pictures and finally stopped before a rude and ancient engraving it was a picture of the court that tried charles i there was a pyramid of judges in puritan slouch hats and below them three bareheaded secretaries seated at a table mr phelps put his finger upon one of the three and said with exulting indifference an ancestor of mine i put my finger on a judge and retorted with scathing languidness ancestor of mine but it is a small matter i have others it was not noble in me to do it i have always regretted it since but it landed him i wonder how he felt however it made no difference in our friendship which shows that he was fine and high notwithstanding the humbleness of his origin and it was also creditable in me too that i could overlook it i made no change in my bearing toward him but always treated him as an equal but it was a hard night for me in one way mr phelps thought i was the guest of honor and so did count s but i didnt for there was nothing in my invitation to indicate it it was just a friendly offhand note on a card by the time dinner was announced phelps was himself in a state of doubt something had to be done and it was not a handy time for explanations he tried to get me to go out with him but i held back then he tried s and he also declined there was another guest but there was no trouble about him we finally went out in a pile there was a decorous plunge for seats and i got the one at mr phelpss left the count captured the one facing phelps and the other guest had to take the place of honor since he could not help himself we returned to the drawingroom in the original disorder i had new shoes on and they were tight at eleven i was privately crying i couldnt help it the pain was so cruel conversation had been dead for an hour s had been due at the bedside of a dying official ever since half past nine at last we all rose by one blessed impulse and went down to the street door without explanations in a pile and no precedence and so parted the evening had its defects still i got my ancestor in and was satisfied among the virginian clemenses were jere already mentioned and sherrard jere clemens had a wide reputation as a good pistolshot and once it enabled him to get on the friendly side of some drummers when they wouldnt have paid any attention to mere smooth words and arguments he was out stumping the state at the time the drummers were grouped in front of the stand and had been hired by the opposition to drum while he made his speech when he was ready to begin he got out his revolver and laid it before him and said in his soft silky way i do not wish to hurt anybody and shall try not to but i have got just a bullet apiece for those six drums and if you should want to play on them dont stand behind them sherrard clemens was a republican congressman from west virginia in the war days and then went out to st louis where the james clemens branch lived and still lives and there he became a warm rebel this was after the war at the time that he was a republican i was a rebel but by the time he had become a rebel i was become temporarily a republican the clemenses have always done the best they could to keep the political balances level no matter how much it might inconvenience them i did not know what had become of sherrard clemens but once i introduced senator hawley to a republican mass meeting in new england and then i got a bitter letter from sherrard from st louis he said that the republicans of the north no the mudsills of the north had swept away the old aristocracy of the south with fire and sword and it ill became me an aristocrat by blood to train with that kind of swine did i forget that i was a lambton that was a reference to my mothers side of the house as i have already said she was a lambton lambton with a p for some of the american lamptons could not spell very well in early times and so the name suffered at their hands she was a native of kentucky and married my father in lexington in when she was twenty years old and he twentyfour neither of them had an overplus of property she brought him two or three negroes but nothing else i think they removed to the remote and secluded village of jamestown in the mountain solitudes of east tennessee there their first crop of children was born but as i was of a later vintage i do not remember anything about it i was postponed postponed to missouri missouri was an unknown new state and needed attractions i think that my eldest brother orion my sisters pamela and margaret and my brother benjamin were born in jamestown there may have been others but as to that i am not sure it was a great lift for that little village to have my parents come there it was hoped that they would stay so that it would become a city it was supposed that they would stay and so there was a boom but by and by they went away and prices went down and it was many years before jamestown got another start i have written about jamestown in the gilded age a book of mine but it was from hearsay not from personal knowledge my father left a fine estate behind him in the region round about jamestown acres when he died in he had owned it about twenty years the taxes were almost nothing five dollars a year for the whole and he had always paid them regularly and kept his title perfect he had always said that the land would not become valuable in his time but that it would be a commodious provision for his children some day it contained coal copper iron and timber and he said that in the course of time railways would pierce to that region and then the property would be property in fact as well as in name it also produced a wild grape of a promising sort he had sent some samples to nicholas longworth of cincinnati to get his judgment upon them and mr longworth had said that they would make as good wine as his catawbas the land contained all these riches and also oil but my father did not know that and of course in those early days he would have cared nothing about it if he had known it the oil was not discovered until about i wish i owned a couple of acres of the land now in which case i would not be writing autobiographies for a living my fathers dying charge was cling to the land and wait let nothing beguile it away from you my mothers favorite cousin james lampton who figures in the gilded age as colonel sellers always said of that land and said it with blazing enthusiasm too theres millions in it millions it is true that he always said that about everything and was always mistaken too but this time he was right which shows that a man who goes around with a prophecygun ought never to get discouraged if he will keep up his heart and fire at everything he sees he is bound to hit something by and by many persons regarded colonel sellers as a fiction an invention an extravagant impossibility and did me the honor to call him a creation but they were mistaken i merely put him on paper as he was he was not a person who could be exaggerated the incidents which looked most extravagant both in the book and on the stage were not inventions of mine but were facts of his life and i was present when they were developed john t raymonds audiences used to come near to dying with laughter over the turnipeating scene but extravagant as the scene was it was faithful to the facts in all its absurd details the thing happened in lamptons own house and i was present in fact i was myself the guest who ate the turnips in the hands of a great actor that piteous scene would have dimmed any manly spectators eyes with tears and racked his ribs apart with laughter at the same time but raymond was great in humorous portrayal only in that he was superb he was wonderful in a word great in all things else he was a pigmy of the pigmies the real colonel sellers as i knew him in james lampton was a pathetic and beautiful spirit a manly man a straight and honorable man a man with a big foolish unselfish heart in his bosom a man born to be loved and he was loved by all his friends and by his family worshipped it is the right word to them he was but little less than a god the real colonel sellers was never on the stage only half of him was there raymond could not play the other half of him it was above his level that half was made up of qualities of which raymond was wholly destitute for raymond was not a manly man he was not an honorable man nor an honest one he was empty and selfish and vulgar and ignorant and silly and there was a vacancy in him where his heart should have been there was only one man who could have played the whole of colonel sellers and that was frank mayo it is a world of surprises they fall too where one is least expecting them when i introduced sellers into the book charles dudley warner who was writing the story with me proposed a change of sellers christian name ten years before in a remote corner of the west he had come across a man named eschol sellers and he thought that eschol was just the right and fitting name for our sellers since it was odd and quaint and all that i liked the idea but i said that that man might turn up and object but warner said it couldnt happen that he was doubtless dead by this time a man with a name like that couldnt live long and be he dead or alive we must have the name it was exactly the right one and we couldnt do without it so the change was made warners man was a farmer in a cheap and humble way when the book had been out a week a collegebred gentleman of courtly manners and ducal upholstery arrived in hartford in a sultry state of mind and with a libel suit in his eye and his name was eschol sellers he had never heard of the other one and had never been within a thousand miles of him this damaged aristocrats programme was quite definite and businesslike the american publishing company must suppress the edition as far as printed and change the name in the plates or stand a suit for he carried away the companys promise and many apologies and we changed the name back to colonel mulberry sellers in the plates apparently there is nothing that cannot happen even the existence of two unrelated men wearing the impossible name of eschol sellers is a possible thing james lampton floated all his days in a tinted mist of magnificent dreams and died at last without seeing one of them realized i saw him last in when it had been twentysix years since i ate the basin of raw turnips and washed them down with a bucket of water in his house he was become old and whiteheaded but he entered to me in the same old breezy way of his earlier life and he was all there yet not a detail wanting the happy light in his eye the abounding hope in his heart the persuasive tongue the miraclebreeding imagination they were all there and before i could turn around he was polishing up his aladdins lamp and flashing the secret riches of the world before me i said to myself i did not overdraw him by a shade i set him down as he was and he is the same man today cable will recognize him i asked him to excuse me a moment and ran into the next room which was cables cable and i were stumping the union on a reading tour i said i am going to leave your door open so that you can listen there is a man in there who is interesting i went back and asked lampton what he was doing now he began to tell me of a small venture he had begun in new mexico through his son only a little thing a mere trifle partly to amuse my leisure partly to keep my capital from lying idle but mainly to develop the boy develop the boy fortunes wheel is ever revolving he may have to work for his living some day as strange things have happened in this world but its only a little thing a mere trifle as i said and so it was as he began it but under his deft hands it grew and blossomed and spread oh beyond imagination at the end of half an hour he finished finished with the remark uttered in an adorably languid manner yes it is but a trifle as things go nowadays a bagatelle but amusing it passes the time the boy thinks great things of it but he is young you know and imaginative lacks the experience which comes of handling large affairs and which tempers the fancy and perfects the judgment i suppose theres a couple of millions in it possibly three but not more i think still for a boy you know just starting in life it is not bad i should not want him to make a fortune let that come later it could turn his head at his time of life and in many ways be a damage to him then he said something about his having left his pocketbook lying on the table in the main drawingroom at home and about its being after banking hours now and i stopped him there and begged him to honor cable and me by being our guest at the lecture with as many friends as might be willing to do us the like honor he accepted and he thanked me as a prince might who had granted us a grace the reason i stopped his speech about the tickets was because i saw that he was going to ask me to furnish them to him and let him pay next day and i knew that if he made the debt he would pay it if he had to pawn his clothes after a little further chat he shook hands heartily and affectionately and took his leave cable put his head in at the door and said that was colonel sellers mark twain to be continued footnotes copyright by harper brothers all rights reserved correction it was above it appears raymond was playing colonel sellers in and along there about twenty years later mayo dramatized puddnhead wilson and played the title role delightfully north american review no dxcix september chapters from my autobiography ii by mark twain ii my experiences as an author began early in i came to new york from san francisco in the first month of that year and presently charles h webb whom i had known in san francisco as a reporter on the bulletin and afterward editor of the californian suggested that i publish a volume of sketches i had but a slender reputation to publish it on but i was charmed and excited by the suggestion and quite willing to venture it if some industrious person would save me the trouble of gathering the sketches together i was loath to do it myself for from the beginning of my sojourn in this world there was a persistent vacancy in me where the industry ought to be ought to was is better perhaps though the most of the authorities differ as to this webb said i had some reputation in the atlantic states but i knew quite well that it must be of a very attenuated sort what there was of it rested upon the story of the jumping frog when artemus ward passed through california on a lecturing tour in or i told him the jumping frog story in san francisco and he asked me to write it out and send it to his publisher carleton in new york to be used in padding out a small book which artemus had prepared for the press and which needed some more stuffing to make it big enough for the price which was to be charged for it it reached carleton in time but he didnt think much of it and was not willing to go to the typesetting expense of adding it to the book he did not put it in the wastebasket but made henry clapp a present of it and clapp used it to help out the funeral of his dying literary journal the saturday press the jumping frog appeared in the last number of that paper was the most joyous feature of the obsequies and was at once copied in the newspapers of america and england it certainly had a wide celebrity and it still had it at the time that i am speaking of but i was aware that it was only the frog that was celebrated it wasnt i i was still an obscurity webb undertook to collate the sketches he performed this office then handed the result to me and i went to carletons establishment with it i approached a clerk and he bent eagerly over the counter to inquire into my needs but when he found that i had come to sell a book and not to buy one his temperature fell sixty degrees and the oldgold intrenchments in the roof of my mouth contracted threequarters of an inch and my teeth fell out i meekly asked the privilege of a word with mr carleton and was coldly informed that he was in his private office discouragements and difficulties followed but after a while i got by the frontier and entered the holy of holies ah now i remember how i managed it webb had made an appointment for me with carleton otherwise i never should have gotten over that frontier carleton rose and said brusquely and aggressively well what can i do for you i reminded him that i was there by appointment to offer him my book for publication he began to swell and went on swelling and swelling and swelling until he had reached the dimensions of a god of about the second or third degree then the fountains of his great deep were broken up and for two or three minutes i couldnt see him for the rain it was words only words but they fell so densely that they darkened the atmosphere finally he made an imposing sweep with his right hand which comprehended the whole room and said books look at those shelves every one of them is loaded with books that are waiting for publication do i want any more excuse me i dont good morning twentyone years elapsed before i saw carleton again i was then sojourning with my family at the schweitzerhof in luzerne he called on me shook hands cordially and said at once without any preliminaries i am substantially an obscure person but i have at least one distinction to my credit of such colossal dimensions that it entitles me to immortality to wit i refused a book of yours and for this i stand without competitor as the prize ass of the nineteenth century it was a most handsome apology and i told him so and said it was a longdelayed revenge but was sweeter to me than any other that could be devised that during the lapsed twentyone years i had in fancy taken his life several times every year and always in new and increasingly cruel and inhuman ways but that now i was pacified appeased happy even jubilant and that thenceforth i should hold him my true and valued friend and never kill him again i reported my adventure to webb and he bravely said that not all the carletons in the universe should defeat that book he would publish it himself on a ten per cent royalty and so he did he brought it out in blue and gold and made a very pretty little book of it i think he named it the celebrated jumping frog of calaveras county and other sketches price he made the plates and printed and bound the book through a jobprinting house and published it through the american news company in june i sailed in the quaker city excursion i returned in november and in washington found a letter from elisha bliss of the american publishing company of hartford offering me five per cent royalty on a book which should recount the adventures of the excursion in lieu of the royalty i was offered the alternative of ten thousand dollars cash upon delivery of the manuscript i consulted a d richardson and he said take the royalty i followed his advice and closed with bliss by my contract i was to deliver the manuscript in july of i wrote the book in san francisco and delivered the manuscript within contract time bliss provided a multitude of illustrations for the book and then stopped work on it the contract date for the issue went by and there was no explanation of this time drifted along and still there was no explanation i was lecturing all over the country and about thirty times a day on an average i was trying to answer this conundrum when is your book coming out i got tired of inventing new answers to that question and by and by i got horribly tired of the question itself whoever asked it became my enemy at once and i was usually almost eager to make that appear as soon as i was free of the lecturefield i hastened to hartford to make inquiries bliss said that the fault was not his that he wanted to publish the book but the directors of his company were staid old fossils and were afraid of it they had examined the book and the majority of them were of the opinion that there were places in it of a humorous character bliss said the house had never published a book that had a suspicion like that attaching to it and that the directors were afraid that a departure of this kind would seriously injure the houses reputation that he was tied hand and foot and was not permitted to carry out his contract one of the directors a mr drake at least he was the remains of what had once been a mr drake invited me to take a ride with him in his buggy and i went along he was a pathetic old relic and his ways and his talk were also pathetic he had a delicate purpose in view and it took him some time to hearten himself sufficiently to carry it out but at last he accomplished it he explained the houses difficulty and distress as bliss had already explained it then he frankly threw himself and the house upon my mercy and begged me to take away the innocents abroad and release the concern from the contract i said i wouldnt and so ended the interview and the buggy excursion then i warned bliss that he must get to work or i should make trouble he acted upon the warning and set up the book and i read the proofs then there was another long wait and no explanation at last toward the end of july i think i lost patience and telegraphed bliss that if the book was not on sale in twentyfour hours i should bring suit for damages that ended the trouble half a dozen copies were bound and placed on sale within the required time then the canvassing began and went briskly forward in nine months the book took the publishing house out of debt advanced its stock from twentyfive to two hundred and left seventy thousand dollars profit to the good it was bliss that told me this but if it was true it was the first time that he had told the truth in sixtyfive years he was born in iii this was in i was fourteen years old then we were still living in hannibal missouri on the banks of the mississippi in the new frame house built by my father five years before that is some of us lived in the new part the rest in the old part back of it the l in the autumn my sister gave a party and invited all the marriageable young people of the village i was too young for this society and was too bashful to mingle with young ladies anyway therefore i was not invited at least not for the whole evening ten minutes of it was to be my whole share i was to do the part of a bear in a small fairy play i was to be disguised all over in a closefitting brown hairy stuff proper for a bear about half past ten i was told to go to my room and put on this disguise and be ready in half an hour i started but changed my mind for i wanted to practise a little and that room was very small i crossed over to the large unoccupied house on the corner of main and hill streets unaware that a dozen of the young people were also going there to dress for their parts i took the little black slave boy sandy with me and we selected a roomy and empty chamber on the second floor we entered it talking and this gave a couple of halfdressed young ladies an opportunity to take refuge behind a screen undiscovered their gowns and things were hanging on hooks behind the door but i did not see them it was sandy that shut the door but all his heart was in the theatricals and he was as unlikely to notice them as i was myself that was a rickety screen with many holes in it but as i did not know there were girls behind it i was not disturbed by that detail if i had known i could not have undressed in the flood of cruel moonlight that was pouring in at the curtainless windows i should have died of shame untroubled by apprehensions i stripped to the skin and began my practice i was full of ambition i was determined to make a hit i was burning to establish a reputation as a bear and get further engagements so i threw myself into my work with an abandon that promised great things i capered back and forth from one end of the room to the other on all fours sandy applauding with enthusiasm i walked upright and growled and snapped and snarled i stood on my head i flung handsprings i danced a lubberly dance with my paws bent and my imaginary snout sniffing from side to side i did everything a bear could do and many things which no bear could ever do and no bear with any dignity would want to do anyway and of course i never suspected that i was making a spectacle of myself to any one but sandy at last standing on my head i paused in that attitude to take a minutes rest there was a moments silence then sandy spoke up with excited interest and said marse sam has you ever seen a smoked herring no what is that its a fish well what of it anything peculiar about it yes suh you bet you dey is dey eats em guts and all there was a smothered burst of feminine snickers from behind the screen all the strength went out of me and i toppled forward like an undermined tower and brought the screen down with my weight burying the young ladies under it in their fright they discharged a couple of piercing screams and possibly others but i did not wait to count i snatched my clothes and fled to the dark hall below sandy following i was dressed in half a minute and out the back way i swore sandy to eternal silence then we went away and hid until the party was over the ambition was all out of me i could not have faced that giddy company after my adventure for there would be two performers there who knew my secret and would be privately laughing at me all the time i was searched for but not found and the bear had to be played by a young gentleman in his civilized clothes the house was still and everybody asleep when i finally ventured home i was very heavyhearted and full of a sense of disgrace pinned to my pillow i found a slip of paper which bore a line that did not lighten my heart but only made my face burn it was written in a laboriously disguised hand and these were its mocking terms you probably couldnt have played bear but you played bare very well oh very very well we think boys are rude unsensitive animals but it is not so in all cases each boy has one or two sensitive spots and if you can find out where they are located you have only to touch them and you can scorch him as with fire i suffered miserably over that episode i expected that the facts would be all over the village in the morning but it was not so the secret remained confined to the two girls and sandy and me that was some appeasement of my pain but it was far from sufficient the main trouble remained i was under four mocking eyes and it might as well have been a thousand for i suspected all girls eyes of being the ones i so dreaded during several weeks i could not look any young lady in the face i dropped my eyes in confusion when any one of them smiled upon me and gave me greeting and i said to myself that is one of them and got quickly away of course i was meeting the right girls everywhere but if they ever let slip any betraying sign i was not bright enough to catch it when i left hannibal four years later the secret was still a secret i had never guessed those girls out and was no longer expecting to do it nor wanting to either one of the dearest and prettiest girls in the village at the time of my mishap was one whom i will call mary wilson because that was not her name she was twenty years old she was dainty and sweet peachbloomy and exquisite gracious and lovely in character and i stood in awe of her for she seemed to me to be made out of angelclay and rightfully unapproachable by an unholy ordinary kind of a boy like me i probably never suspected her but the scene changes to calcutta fortyseven years later it was in i arrived there on my lecturing trip as i entered the hotel a divine vision passed out of it clothed in the glory of the indian sunshine the mary wilson of my longvanished boyhood it was a startling thing before i could recover from the bewildering shock and speak to her she was gone i thought maybe i had seen an apparition but it was not so she was flesh she was the granddaughter of the other mary the original mary that mary now a widow was upstairs and presently sent for me she was old and grayhaired but she looked young and was very handsome we sat down and talked we steeped our thirsty souls in the reviving wine of the past the beautiful past the dear and lamented past we uttered the names that had been silent upon our lips for fifty years and it was as if they were made of music with reverent hands we unburied our dead the mates of our youth and caressed them with our speech we searched the dusty chambers of our memories and dragged forth incident after incident episode after episode folly after folly and laughed such good laughs over them with the tears running down and finally mary said suddenly and without any leading up tell me what is the special peculiarity of smoked herrings it seemed a strange question at such a hallowed time as this and so inconsequential too i was a little shocked and yet i was aware of a stir of some kind away back in the deeps of my memory somewhere it set me to musing thinking searching smoked herrings smoked herrings the peculiarity of smo i glanced up her face was grave but there was a dim and shadowy twinkle in her eye which all of a sudden i knew and far away down in the hoary past i heard a remembered voice murmur dey eats em guts and all at last ive found one of you anyway who was the other girl but she drew the line there she wouldnt tell me footnote that house still stands iv but it was on a bench in washington square that i saw the most of louis stevenson it was an outing that lasted an hour or more and was very pleasant and sociable i had come with him from his house where i had been paying my respects to his family his business in the square was to absorb the sunshine he was most scantily furnished with flesh his clothes seemed to fall into hollows as if there might be nothing inside but the frame for a sculptors statue his long face and lank hair and dark complexion and musing and melancholy expression seemed to fit these details justly and harmoniously and the altogether of it seemed especially planned to gather the rays of your observation and focalize them upon stevensons special distinction and commanding feature his splendid eyes they burned with a smouldering rich fire under the penthouse of his brows and they made him beautiful i said i thought he was right about the others but mistaken as to bret harte in substance i said that harte was good company and a thin but pleasant talker that he was always bright but never brilliant that in this matter he must not be classed with thomas bailey aldrich nor must any other man ancient or modern that aldrich was always witty always brilliant if there was anybody present capable of striking his flint at the right angle that aldrich was as sure and prompt and unfailing as the redhot iron on the blacksmiths anvil you had only to hit it competently to make it deliver an explosion of sparks i added aldrich has never had his peer for prompt and pithy and witty and humorous sayings none has equalled him certainly none has surpassed him in the felicity of phrasing with which he clothed these children of his fancy aldrich was always brilliant he couldnt help it he is a fireopal set round with rose diamonds when he is not speaking you know that his dainty fancies are twinkling and glimmering around in him when he speaks the diamonds flash yes he was always brilliant he will always be brilliant he will be brilliant in hell you will see stevenson smiling a chuckly smile i hope not well you will and he will dim even those ruddy fires and look like a transfigured adonis backed against a pink sunset there on that bench we struck out a new phrase one or the other of us i dont remember which submerged renown variations were discussed submerged fame submerged reputation and so on and a choice was made submerged renown was elected i believe this important matter rose out of an incident which had been happening to stevenson in albany while in a bookshop or bookstall there he had noticed a long rank of small books cheaply but neatly gotten up and bearing such titles as daviss selected speeches daviss selected poetry daviss this and daviss that and daviss the other thing compilations every one of them each with a brief compact intelligent and useful introductory chapter by this same davis whose first name i have forgotten stevenson had begun the matter with this question can you name the american author whose fame and acceptance stretch widest in the states i thought i could but it did not seem to me that it would be modest to speak out in the circumstances so i diffidently said nothing stevenson noticed and said save your delicacy for another time you are not the one for a shilling you cant name the american author of widest note and popularity in the states but i can then he went on and told about that albany incident he had inquired of the shopman who is this davis the answer was an author whose books have to have freighttrains to carry them not baskets apparently you have not heard of him stevenson said no this was the first time the man said nobody has heard of davis you may ask all around and you will see you never see his name mentioned in print not even in advertisement these things are of no use to davis not any more than they are to the wind and the sea you never see one of daviss books floating on top of the united states but put on your diving armor and get yourself lowered away down and down and down till you strike the dense region the sunless region of eternal drudgery and starvation wages there youll find them by the million the man that gets that market his fortune is made his bread and butter are safe for those people will never go back on him an author may have a reputation which is confined to the surface and lose it and become pitied then despised then forgotten entirely forgotten the frequent steps in a surface reputation at surface reputation however great is always mortal and always killable if you go at it right with pins and needles and quiet slow poison not with the club and tomahawk but it is a different matter with the submerged reputation down in the deep water once a favorite there always a favorite once beloved always beloved once respected always respected honored and believed in for what the reviewer says never finds its way down into those placid deeps nor the newspaper sneers nor any breath of the winds of slander blowing above down there they never hear of these things their idol may be painted clay up then at the surface and fade and waste and crumble and blow away there being much weather there but down below he is gold and adamant and indestructible v this is from this mornings paper mark twain letter sold written to thomas nast it proposed a joint tour a mark twain autograph letter brought yesterday at the auction by the merwinclayton company of the library and correspondence of the late thomas nast cartoonist the letter is nine pages notepaper is dated hartford nov and it addressed to nast it reads in part as follows hartford nov my dear nast i did not think i should ever stand on a platform again until the time was come for me to say i die innocent but the same old offers keep arriving that have arriven every year and been every year declined for louisville for st louis gold for two nights in toronto half gross proceeds for new york boston brooklyn c i have declined them all just as usual though sorely tempted as usual now i do not decline because i mind talking to an audience but because travelling alone is so heartbreakingly dreary and shouldering the whole show is such cheerkilling responsibility therefore i now propose to you what you proposed to me in november ten years ago when i was unknown viz that you should stand on the platform and make pictures and i stand by you and blackguard the audience i should enormously enjoy meandering around to big towns dont want to go to little ones with you for company the letter includes a schedule of cities and the number of appearances planned for each this is as it should be this is worthy of all praise i say it myself lest other competent persons should forget to do it it appears that four of my ancient letters were sold at auction three of them at twentyseven dollars twentyeight dollars and twentynine dollars respectively and the one above mentioned at fortythree dollars there is one very gratifying circumstance about this to wit that my literature has more than held its own as regards money value through this stretch of thirtysix years i judge that the fortythreedollar letter must have gone at about ten cents a word whereas if i had written it today its market rate would be thirty cents so i have increased in value two or three hundred per cent i note another gratifying circumstance that a letter of general grants sold at something short of eighteen dollars i cant rise to general grants lofty place in the estimation of this nation but it is a deep happiness to me to know that when it comes to epistolary literature he cant sit in the front seat along with me this reminds me nine years ago when we were living in tedworth square london a report was cabled to the american journals that i was dying i was not the one it was another clemens a cousin of mine dr j ross clemens now of st louis who was due to die but presently escaped by some chicanery or other characteristic of the tribe of clemens the london representatives of the american papers began to flock in with american cables in their hands to inquire into my condition there was nothing the matter with me and each in his turn was astonished and disappointed to find me reading and smoking in my study and worth next to nothing as a text for transatlantic news one of these men was a gentle and kindly and grave and sympathetic irishman who hid his sorrow the best he could and tried to look glad and told me that his paper the evening sun had cabled him that it was reported in new york that i was dead what should he cable in reply i said say the report is greatly exaggerated he never smiled but went solemnly away and sent the cable in those words the remark hit the world pleasantly and to this day it keeps turning up now and then in the newspapers when people have occasion to discount exaggerations the next man was also an irishman he had his new york cablegram in his hand from the new york world and he was so evidently trying to get around that cable with invented softnesses and palliations that my curiosity was aroused and i wanted to see what it did really say so when occasion offered i slipped it out of his hand it said if mark twain dying send five hundred words if dead send a thousand now that old letter of mine sold yesterday for fortythree dollars when i am dead it will be worth eightysix mark twain to be continued north american review no dc october chapters from my autobiography iii by mark twain vi tomorrow will be the thirtysixth anniversary of our marriage my wife passed from this life one year and eight months ago in florence italy after an unbroken illness of twentytwo months duration i saw her first in the form of an ivory miniature in her brother charleys stateroom in the steamer quaker city in the bay of smyrna in the summer of when she was in her twentysecond year i saw her in the flesh for the first time in new york in the following december she was slender and beautiful and girlish and she was both girl and woman she remained both girl and woman to the last day of her life under a grave and gentle exterior burned inextinguishable fires of sympathy energy devotion enthusiasm and absolutely limitless affection she was always frail in body and she lived upon her spirit whose hopefulness and courage were indestructible perfect truth perfect honesty perfect candor were qualities of her character which were born with her her judgments of people and things were sure and accurate her intuitions almost never deceived her in her judgments of the characters and acts of both friends and strangers there was always room for charity and this charity never failed i have compared and contrasted her with hundreds of persons and my conviction remains that hers was the most perfect character i have ever met and i may add that she was the most winningly dignified person i have ever known her character and disposition were of the sort that not only invites worship but commands it no servant ever left her service who deserved to remain in it and as she could choose with a glance of her eye the servants she selected did in almost all cases deserve to remain and they did remain she was always cheerful and she was always able to communicate her cheerfulness to others during the nine years that we spent in poverty and debt she was always able to reason me out of my despairs and find a bright side to the clouds and make me see it in all that time i never knew her to utter a word of regret concerning our altered circumstances nor did i ever know her children to do the like for she had taught them and they drew their fortitude from her the love which she bestowed upon those whom she loved took the form of worship and in that form it was returned returned by relatives friends and the servants of her household it was a strange combination which wrought into one individual so to speak by marriage her disposition and character and mine she poured out her prodigal affections in kisses and caresses and in a vocabulary of endearments whose profusion was always an astonishment to me i was born reserved as to endearments of speech and caresses and hers broke upon me as the summer waves break upon gibraltar i was reared in that atmosphere of reserve as i have already said in another chapter i never knew a member of my fathers family to kiss another member of it except once and that at a deathbed and our village was not a kissing community the kissing and caressing ended with courtship along with the deadly pianoplaying of that day she had the heartfree laugh of a girl it came seldom but when it broke upon the ear it was as inspiring as music i heard it for the last time when she had been occupying her sickbed for more than a year and i made a written note of it at the time a note not to be repeated tomorrow will be the thirtysixth anniversary we were married in her fathers house in elmira new york and went next day by special train to buffalo along with the whole langdon family and with the beechers and the twichells who had solemnized the marriage we were to live in buffalo where i was to be one of the editors of the buffalo express and a part owner of the paper i knew nothing about buffalo but i had made my household arrangements there through a friend by letter i had instructed him to find a boardinghouse of as respectable a character as my light salary as editor would command we were received at about nine oclock at the station in buffalo and were put into several sleighs and driven all over america as it seemed to me for apparently we turned all the corners in the town and followed all the streets there were i scolding freely and characterizing that friend of mine in very uncomplimentary words for securing a boardinghouse that apparently had no definite locality but there was a conspiracy and my bride knew of it but i was in ignorance her father jervis langdon had bought and furnished a new house for us in the fashionable street delaware avenue and had laid in a cook and housemaids and a brisk and electric young coachman an irishman patrick mcaleer and we were being driven all over that city in order that one sleighful of those people could have time to go to the house and see that the gas was lighted all over it and a hot supper prepared for the crowd we arrived at last and when i entered that fairy place my indignation reached highwater mark and without any reserve i delivered my opinion to that friend of mine for being so stupid as to put us into a boardinghouse whose terms would be far out of my reach then mr langdon brought forward a very pretty box and opened it and took from it a deed of the house so the comedy ended very pleasantly and we sat down to supper the company departed about midnight and left us alone in our new quarters then ellen the cook came in to get orders for the mornings marketing and neither of us knew whether beefsteak was sold by the barrel or by the yard we exposed our ignorance and ellen was fall of irish delight over it patrick mcaleer that brisk young irishman came in to get his orders for next day and that was our first glimpse of him our first child langdon clemens was born the th of november and lived twentytwo months susy was born the th of march and passed from life in the hartford home the th of august with her when the end came were jean and katy leary and john and ellen the gardener and his wife clara and her mother and i arrived in england from around the world on the st of july and took a house in guildford a week later when susy katy and jean should have been arriving from america we got a letter instead it explained that susy was slightly ill nothing of consequence but we were disquieted and began to cable for later news this was friday all day no answer and the ship to leave southampton next day at noon clara and her mother began packing to be ready in case the news should be bad finally came a cablegram saying wait for cablegram in the morning this was not satisfactory not reassuring i cabled again asking that the answer be sent to southampton for the day was now closing i waited in the postoffice that night till the doors were closed toward midnight in the hope that good news might still come but there was no message we sat silent at home till one in the morning waiting waiting for we knew not what then we took the earliest morning train and when we reached southampton the message was there it said the recovery would be long but certain this was a great relief to me but not to my wife she was frightened she and clara went aboard the steamer at once and sailed for america to nurse susy i remained behind to search for a larger house in guildford that was the th of august three days later when my wife and clara were about halfway across the ocean i was standing in our diningroom thinking of nothing in particular when a cablegram was put into my hand it said susy was peacefully released today it is one of the mysteries of our nature that a man all unprepared can receive a thunderstroke like that and live there is but one reasonable explanation of it the intellect is stunned by the shock and but gropingly gathers the meaning of the words the power to realize their fall import is mercifully wanting the mind has a dumb sense of vast loss that is all it will take mind and memory months and possibly years to gather together the details and thus learn and know the whole extent of the loss a mans house burns down the smoking wreckage represents only a ruined home that was dear through years of use and pleasant associations by and by as the days and weeks go on first he misses this then that then the other thing and when he casts about for it he finds that it was in that house always it is an essential there was but one of its kind it cannot be replaced it was in that house it is irrevocably lost he did not realize that it was an essential when he had it he only discovers it now when he finds himself balked hampered by its absence it will be years before the tale of lost essentials is complete and not till then can he truly know the magnitude of his disaster the th of august brought me the awful tidings the mother and the sister were out there in midatlantic ignorant of what was happening flying to meet this incredible calamity all that could be done to protect them from the full force of the shock was done by relatives and good friends they went down the bay and met the ship at night but did not show themselves until morning and then only to clara when she returned to the stateroom she did not speak and did not need to her mother looked at her and said susy is dead at half past ten oclock that night clara and her mother completed their circuit of the globe and drew up at elmira by the same train and in the same car which had borne them and me westward from it one year one month and one week before and again susy was there not waving her welcome in the glare of the lights as she had waved her farewell to us thirteen months before but lying white and fair in her coffin in the house where she was born the last thirteen days of susys life were spent in our own house in hartford the home of her childhood and always the dearest place in the earth to her about her she had faithful old friends her pastor mr twichell who had known her from the cradle and who had come a long journey to be with her her uncle and aunt mr and mrs theodore crane patrick the coachman katy who had begun to serve us when susy was a child of eight years john and ellen who had been with us many years also jean was there at the hour when my wife and clara set sail for america susy was in no danger three hours later there came a sudden change for the worse meningitis set in and it was immediately apparent that she was deathstruck that was saturday the th of august that evening she took food for the last time jeans letter to me the next morning the brainfever was raging she walked the floor a little in her pain and delirium then succumbed to weakness and returned to her bed previously she had found hanging in a closet a gown which she had seen her mother wear she thought it was her mother dead and she kissed it and cried about noon she became blind an effect of the disease and bewailed it to her uncle from jeans letter i take this sentence which needs no comment about one in the afternoon susy spoke for the last time it was only one word that she said when she spoke that last time and it told of her longing she groped with her hands and found katy and caressed her face and said mamma how gracious it was that in that forlorn hour of wreck and ruin with the night of death closing around her she should have been granted that beautiful illusion that the latest vision which rested upon the clouded mirror of her mind should have been the vision of her mother and the latest emotion she should know in life the joy and peace of that dear imagined presence about two oclock she composed herself as if for sleep and never moved again she fell into unconsciousness and so remained two days and five hours until tuesday evening at seven minutes past seven when the release came she was twentyfour years and five months old on the d her mother and her sisters saw her laid to rest she that had been our wonder and our worship in one of her own books i find some verses which i will copy here apparently she always put borrowed matter in quotation marks these verses lack those marks and therefore i take them to be her own love came at dawn when all the world was fair when crimson glories bloom and sun were rife love came at dawn when hopes wings fanned the air and murmured i am life love came at eve and when the day was done when heart and brain were tired and slumber pressed love came at eve shut out the sinking sun and whispered i am rest the summer seasons of susys childhood were spent at quarry farm on the hills east of elmira new york the other seasons of the year at the home in hartford like other children she was blithe and happy fond of play unlike the average of children she was at times much given to retiring within herself and trying to search out the hidden meanings of the deep things that make the puzzle and pathos of human existence and in all the ages have baffled the inquirer and mocked him as a little child aged seven she was oppressed and perplexed by the maddening repetition of the stock incidents of our races fleeting sojourn here just as the same thing has oppressed and perplexed maturer minds from the beginning of time a myriad of men are born they labor and sweat and struggle for bread they squabble and scold and fight they scramble for little mean advantages over each other age creeps upon them infirmities follow shames and humiliations bring down their prides and their vanities those they love are taken from them and the joy of life is turned to aching grief the burden of pain care misery grows heavier year by year at length ambition is dead pride is dead vanity is dead longing for release is in their place it comes at last the only unpoisoned gift earth ever had for them and they vanish from a world where they were of no consequence where they achieved nothing where they were a mistake and a failure and a foolishness there they have left no sign that they have existed a world which will lament them a day and forget them forever then another myriad takes their place and copies all they did and goes along the same profitless road and vanishes as they vanished to make room for another and another and a million other myriads to follow the same arid path through the same desert and accomplish what the first myriad and all the myriads that came after it accomplished nothing mamma what is it all for asked susy preliminarily stating the above details in her own halting language after long brooding over them alone in the privacy of the nursery a year later she was groping her way alone through another sunless bog but this time she reached a rest for her feet for a week her mother had not been able to go to the nursery evenings at the childs prayer hour she spoke of it was sorry for it and said she would come tonight and hoped she could continue to come every night and hear susy pray as before noticing that the child wished to respond but was evidently troubled as to how to word her answer she asked what the difficulty was susy explained that miss foote the governess had been teaching her about the indians and their religious beliefs whereby it appeared that they had not only a god but several this had set susy to thinking as a result of this thinking she had stopped praying she qualified this statement that is she modified it saying she did not now pray in the same way as she had formerly done her mother said tell me about it dear well mamma the indians believed they knew but now we know they were wrong by and by it can turn out that we are wrong so now i only pray that there may be a god and a heaven or something better i wrote down this pathetic prayer in its precise wording at the time in a record which we kept of the childrens sayings and my reverence for it has grown with the years that have passed over my head since then its untaught grace and simplicity are a childs but the wisdom and the pathos of it are of all the ages that have come and gone since the race of man has lived and longed and hoped and feared and doubted to go back a year susy aged seven several times her mother said to her there there susy you mustnt cry over little things this furnished susy a text for thought she had been breaking her heart over what had seemed vast disasters a broken toy a picnic cancelled by thunder and lightning and rain the mouse that was growing tame and friendly in the nursery caught and killed by the cat and now came this strange revelation for some unaccountable reason these were not vast calamities why how is the size of calamities measured what is the rule there must be some way to tell the great ones from the small ones what is the law of these proportions she examined the problem earnestly and long she gave it her best thought from time to time for two or three days but it baffled her defeated her and at last she gave up and went to her mother for help mamma what is little things it seemed a simple question at first and yet before the answer could be put into words unsuspected and unforeseen difficulties began to appear they increased they multiplied they brought about another defeat the effort to explain came to a standstill then susy tried to help her mother out with an instance an example an illustration the mother was getting ready to go downtown and one of her errands was to buy a longpromised toywatch for susy if you forgot the watch mamma would that be a little thing she was not concerned about the watch for she knew it would not be forgotten what she was hoping for was that the answer would unriddle the riddle and bring rest and peace to her perplexed little mind the hope was disappointed of course for the reason that the size of a misfortune is not determinate by an outsiders measurement of it but only by the measurements applied to it by the person specially affected by it the kings lost crown is a vast matter to the king but of no consequence to the child the lost toy is a great matter to the child but in the kings eyes it is not a thing to break the heart about a verdict was reached but it was based upon the above model and susy was granted leave to measure her disasters thereafter with her own tapeline as a child susy had a passionate temper and it cost her much remorse and many tears before she learned to govern it but after that it was a wholesome salt and her character was the stronger and healthier for its presence it enabled her to be good with dignity it preserved her not only from being good for vanitys sake but from even the appearance of it in looking back over the long vanished years it seems but natural and excusable that i should dwell with longing affection and preference upon incidents of her young life which made it beautiful to us and that i should let its few small offences go unsummoned and unreproached in the summer of when susy was just eight years of age the family were at quarry farm as usual at that season of the year haycutting time was approaching and susy and clara were counting the hours for the time was big with a great event for them they had been promised that they might mount the wagon and ride home from the fields on the summit of the hay mountain this perilous privilege so dear to their age and species had never been granted them before their excitement had no bounds they could talk of nothing but this epochmaking adventure now but misfortune overtook susy on the very morning of the important day in a sudden outbreak of passion she corrected clara with a shovel or stick or something of the sort at any rate the offence committed was of a gravity clearly beyond the limit allowed in the nursery in accordance with the rule and custom of the house susy went to her mother to confess and to help decide upon the size and character of the punishment due it was quite understood that as a punishment could have but one rational object and function to act as a reminder and warn the transgressor against transgressing in the same way again the children would know about as well as any how to choose a penalty which would be rememberable and effective susy and her mother discussed various punishments but none of them seemed adequate this fault was an unusually serious one and required the setting up of a dangersignal in the memory that would not blow out nor burn out but remain a fixture there and furnish its saving warning indefinitely among the punishments mentioned was deprivation of the haywagon ride it was noticeable that this one hit susy hard finally in the summing up the mother named over the list and asked which one do you think it ought to be susy susy studied shrank from her duty and asked which do you think mamma well susy i would rather leave it to you you make the choice yourself it cost susy a struggle and much and deep thinking and weighing but she came out where any one who knew her could have foretold she would well mamma ill make it the haywagon because you know the other things might not make me remember not to do it again but if i dont get to ride on the haywagon i can remember it easily in this world the real penalty the sharp one the lasting one never falls otherwise than on the wrong person it was not i that corrected clara but the remembrance of poor susys lost hayride still brings me a pang after twentysix years apparently susy was born with humane feelings for the animals and compassion for their troubles this enabled her to see a new point in an old story once when she was only six years old a point which had been overlooked by older and perhaps duller people for many ages her mother told her the moving story of the sale of joseph by his brethren the staining of his coat with the blood of the slaughtered kid and the rest of it she dwelt upon the inhumanity of the brothers their cruelty toward their helpless young brother and the unbrotherly treachery which they practised upon him for she hoped to teach the child a lesson in gentle pity and mercifulness which she would remember apparently her desire was accomplished for the tears came into susys eyes and she was deeply moved then she said poor little kid a childs frank envy of the privileges and distinctions of its elders is often a delicately flattering attention and the reverse of unwelcome but sometimes the envy is not placed where the beneficiary is expecting it to be placed once when susy was seven she sat breathlessly absorbed in watching a guest of ours adorn herself for a ball the lady was charmed by this homage this mute and gentle admiration and was happy in it and when her pretty labors were finished and she stood at last perfect unimprovable clothed like solomon in all his glory she paused confident and expectant to receive from susys tongue the tribute that was burning in her eyes susy drew an envious little sigh and said i wish i could have crooked teeth and spectacles once when susy was six months along in her eighth year she did something one day in the presence of company which subjected her to criticism and reproof afterward when she was alone with her mother as was her custom she reflected a little while over the matter then she set up what i think and what the shade of burns would think was a quite good philosophical defence well mamma you know i didnt see myself and so i couldnt know how it looked in homes where the near friends and visitors are mainly literary people lawyers judges professors and clergymen the childrens ears become early familiarized with wide vocabularies it is natural for them to pick up any words that fall in their way it is natural for them to pick up big and little ones indiscriminately it is natural for them to use without fear any word that comes to their net no matter how formidable it may be as to size as a result their talk is a curious and funny musketry clatter of little words interrupted at intervals by the heavy artillery crash of a word of such imposing sound and size that it seems to shake the ground and rattle the windows sometimes the child gets a wrong idea of a word which it has picked up by chance and attaches to it a meaning which impairs its usefulness but this does not happen as often as one might expect it would indeed it happens with an infrequency which may be regarded as remarkable as a child susy had good fortune with her large words and she employed many of them she made no more than her fair share of mistakes once when she thought something very funny was going to happen but it didnt she was racked and torn with laughter by anticipation but apparently she still felt sure of her position for she said if it had happened i should have been transformed transported with glee and earlier when she was a little maid of five years she informed a visitor that she had been in a church only once and that was the time when clara was crucified christened in heidelberg when susy was six she noticed that the schloss gardens were populous with snails creeping all about everywhere one day she found a new dish on her table and inquired concerning it and learned that it was made of snails she was awed and impressed and said wild ones mamma she was thoughtful and considerate of others an acquired quality no doubt no one seems to be born with it one hot day at home in hartford when she was a little child her mother borrowed her fan several times a japanese one value five cents refreshed herself with it a moment or two then handed it back with a word of thanks susy knew her mother would use the fan all the time if she could do it without putting a deprivation upon its owner she also knew that her mother could not be persuaded to do that a relief most be devised somehow susy devised it she got five cents out of her moneybox and carried it to patrick and asked him to take it downtown a mile and a half and buy a japanese fan and bring it home he did it and thus thoughtfully and delicately was the exigency met and the mothers comfort secured it is to the childs credit that she did not save herself expense by bringing down another and more costly kind of fan from upstairs but was content to act upon the impression that her mother desired the japanese kind content to accomplish the desire and stop with that without troubling about the wisdom or unwisdom of it sometimes while she was still a child her speech fell into quaint and strikingly expressive forms once aged nine or ten she came to her mothers room when her sister jean was a baby and said jean was crying in the nursery and asked if she might ring for the nurse her mother asked is she crying hard meaning cross ugly well no mamma it is a weary lonesome cry it is a pleasure to me to recall various incidents which reveal the delicacies of feeling that were so considerable a part of her budding character such a revelation came once in a way which while creditable to her heart was defective in another direction she was in her eleventh year then her mother had been making the christmas purchases and she allowed susy to see the presents which were for patricks children among these was a handsome sled for jimmy on which a stag was painted also in gilt capitals the word deer susy was excited and joyous over everything until she came to this sled then she became sober and silent yet the sled was the choicest of all the gifts her mother was surprised and also disappointed and said why susy doesnt it please you isnt it fine susy hesitated and it was plain that she did not want to say the thing that was in her mind however being urged she brought it haltingly out well mamma it is fine and of course it did cost a good deal but but why should that be mentioned seeing that she was not understood she reluctantly pointed to that word deer it was her orthography that was at fault not her heart she had inherited both from her mother mark twain to be continued north american review no dci october chapters from my autobiography iv by mark twain when susy was thirteen and was a slender little maid with plaited tails of coppertinged brown hair down her back and was perhaps the busiest bee in the household hive by reason of the manifold studies health exercises and recreations she had to attend to she secretly and of her own motion and out of love added another task to her labors the writing of a biography of me she did this work in her bedroom at night and kept her record hidden after a little the mother discovered it and filched it and let me see it then told susy what she had done and how pleased i was and how proud i remember that time with a deep pleasure i had had compliments before but none that touched me like this none that could approach it for value in my eyes it has kept that place always since i have had no compliment no praise no tribute from any source that was so precious to me as this one was and still is as i read it now after all these many years it is still a kings message to me and brings me the same dear surprise it brought me then with the pathos added of the thought that the eager and hasty hand that sketched it and scrawled it will not touch mine again and i feel as the humble and unexpectant must feel when their eyes fall upon the edict that raises them to the ranks of the noble yesterday while i was rummaging in a pile of ancient notebooks of mine which i had not seen for years i came across a reference to that biography it is quite evident that several times at breakfast and dinner in those longpast days i was posing for the biography in fact i clearly remember that i was doing that and i also remember that susy detected it i remember saying a very smart thing with a good deal of an air at the breakfasttable one morning and that susy observed to her mother privately a little later that papa was doing that for the biography i cannot bring myself to change any line or word in susys sketch of me but will introduce passages from it now and then just as they came in their quaint simplicity out of her honest heart which was the beautiful heart of a child what comes from that source has a charm and grace of its own which may transgress all the recognized laws of literature if it choose and yet be literature still and worthy of hospitality i shall print the whole of this little biography before i have done with it every word every sentence the spelling is frequently desperate but it was susys and it shall stand i love it and cannot profane it to me it is gold to correct it would alloy it not refine it it would spoil it it would take from it its freedom and flexibility and make it stiff and formal even when it is most extravagant i am not shocked it is susys spelling and she was doing the best she could and nothing could better it for me susy began the biography in when i was in the fiftieth year of my age and she just entering the fourteenth of hers she begins in this way we are a very happy family we consist of papa mamma jean clara and me it is papa i am writing about and i shall have no trouble in not knowing what to say about him as he is a very striking character but wait a minute i will return to susy presently in the matter of slavish imitation man is the monkeys superior all the time the average man is destitute of independence of opinion he is not interested in contriving an opinion of his own by study and reflection but is only anxious to find out what his neighbors opinion is and slavishly adopt it a generation ago i found out that the latest review of a book was pretty sure to be just a reflection of the earliest review of it that whatever the first reviewer found to praise or censure in the book would be repeated in the latest reviewers report with nothing fresh added therefore more than once i took the precaution of sending my book in manuscript to mr howells when he was editor of the atlantic monthly so that he could prepare a review of it at leisure i knew he would say the truth about the book i also knew that he would find more merit than demerit in it because i already knew that that was the condition of the book i allowed no copy of it to go out to the press until after mr howellss notice of it had appeared that book was always safe there wasnt a man behind a pen in all america that had the courage to find anything in the book which mr howells had not found there wasnt a man behind a pen in america that had spirit enough to say a brave and original thing about the book on his own responsibility i believe that the trade of critic in literature music and the drama is the most degraded of all trades and that it has no real value certainly no large value when charles dudley warner and i were about to bring out the gilded age the editor of the daily graphic persuaded me to let him have an advance copy he giving me his word of honor that no notice of it would appear in his paper until after the atlantic monthly notice should have appeared this reptile published a review of the book within three days afterward i could not really complain because he had only given me his word of honor as security i ought to have required of him something substantial i believe his notice did not deal mainly with the merit of the book or the lack of it but with my moral attitude toward the public it was charged that i had used my reputation to play a swindle upon the public that mr warner had written as much as half of the book and that i had used my name to float it and give it currency a currency so the critic averred which it could not have acquired without my name and that this conduct of mine was a grave fraud upon the people the graphic was not an authority upon any subject whatever it had a sort of distinction in that it was the first and only illustrated daily newspaper that the world had seen but it was without character it was poorly and cheaply edited its opinion of a book or of any other work of art was of no consequence everybody knew this yet all the critics in america one after the other copied the graphics criticism merely changing the phraseology and left me under that charge of dishonest conduct even the great chicago tribune the most important journal in the middle west was not able to invent anything fresh but adopted the view of the humble daily graphic dishonestycharge and all however let it go it is the will of god that we must have critics and missionaries and congressmen and humorists and we must bear the burden meantime i seem to have been drifting into criticism myself but that is nothing at the worst criticism is nothing more than a crime and i am not unused to that what i have been travelling toward all this time is this the first critic that ever had occasion to describe my personal appearance littered his description with foolish and inexcusable errors whose aggregate furnished the result that i was distinctly and distressingly unhandsome that description floated around the country in the papers and was in constant use and wear for a quarter of a century it seems strange to me that apparently no critic in the country could be found who could look at me and have the courage to take up his pen and destroy that lie that lie began its course on the pacific coast in and it likened me in personal appearance to petroleum v nasby who had been out there lecturing for twentyfive years afterward no critic could furnish a description of me without fetching in nasby to help out my portrait i knew nasby well and he was a good fellow but in my life i have not felt malignant enough about any more than three persons to charge those persons with resembling nasby it hurts me to the heart i was always handsome anybody but a critic could have seen it and it had long been a distress to my family including susy that the critics should go on making this wearisome mistake year after year when there was no foundation for it even when a critic wanted to be particularly friendly and complimentary to me he didnt dare to go beyond my clothes he never ventured beyond that old safe frontier when he had finished with my clothes he had said all the kind things the pleasant things the complimentary things he could risk then he dropped back on nasby yesterday i found this clipping in the pocket of one of those ancient memorandumbooks of mine it is of the date of thirtynine years ago and both the paper and the ink are yellow with the bitterness that i felt in that old day when i clipped it out to preserve it and brood over it and grieve about it i will copy it here to wit a correspondent of the philadelphia press writing of one of schuyler colfaxs receptions says of our washington correspondent mark twain the delicate humorist was present quite a lion as he deserves to be mark is a bachelor faultless in taste whose snowy vest is suggestive of endless quarrels with washington washerwomen but the heroism of mark is settled for all time for such purity and smoothness were never seen before his lavender gloves might have been stolen from some turkish harem so delicate were they in size but more likely anything else were more likely than that in form and feature he bears some resemblance to the immortal nasby but whilst petroleum is brunette to the core twain is golden amberhued melting blonde let us return to susys biography now and get the opinion of one who is unbiassed from susys biography papas appearance has been described many times but very incorrectly he has beautiful gray hair not any too thick or any too long but just right a roman nose which greatly improves the beauty of his features kind blue eyes and a small mustache he has a wonderfully shaped head and profile he has a very good figure in short he is an extrodinarily fine looking man all his features are perfect except that he hasnt extrodinary teeth his complexion is very fair and he doesnt ware a beard he is a very good man and a very funny one he has got a temper but we all of us have in this family he is the loveliest man i ever saw or ever hope to see and oh so absentminded he does tell perfectly delightful stories clara and i used to sit on each arm of his chair and listen while he told us stories about the pictures on the wall i remember the storytelling days vividly they were a difficult and exacting audience those little creatures along one side of the library in the hartford home the bookshelves joined the mantelpiece in fact there were shelves on both sides of the mantelpiece on these shelves and on the mantelpiece stood various ornaments at one end of the procession was a framed oilpainting of a cats head at the other end was a head of a beautiful young girl lifesize called emmeline because she looked just about like that an impressionist watercolor between the one picture and the other there were twelve or fifteen of the bricрbrac things already mentioned also an oilpainting by elihu vedder the young medusa every now and then the children required me to construct a romance always impromptu not a moments preparation permitted and into that romance i had to get all that bricрbrac and the three pictures i had to start always with the cat and finish with emmeline i was never allowed the refreshment of a change endforend it was not permissible to introduce a bricрbrac ornament into the story out of its place in the procession these bricрbracs were never allowed a peaceful day a reposeful day a restful sabbath in their lives there was no sabbath in their lives there was no peace they knew no existence but a monotonous career of violence and bloodshed in the course of time the bricрbrac and the pictures showed wear it was because they had had so many and such tumultuous adventures in their romantic careers as romancer to the children i had a hard time even from the beginning if they brought me a picture in a magazine and required me to build a story to it they would cover the rest of the page with their pudgy hands to keep me from stealing an idea from it the stories had to come hot from the bat always they had to be absolutely original and fresh sometimes the children furnished me simply a character or two or a dozen and required me to start out at once on that slim basis and deliver those characters up to a vigorous and entertaining life of crime if they heard of a new trade or an unfamiliar animal or anything like that i was pretty sure to have to deal with those things in the next romance once clara required me to build a sudden tale out of a plumber and a bawgunstrictor and i had to do it she didnt know what a boaconstrictor was until he developed in the tale then she was better satisfied with it than ever from susys biography papas favorite game is billiards and when he is tired and wishes to rest himself he stays up all night and plays billiards it seems to rest his head he smokes a great deal almost incessantly he has the mind of an author exactly some of the simplest things he cant understand our burglaralarm is often out of order and papa had been obliged to take the mahoganyroom off from the alarm altogether for a time because the burglaralarm had been in the habit of ringing even when the mahoganyroom was closed at length he thought that perhaps the burglaralarm might be in order and he decided to try and see accordingly he put it on and then went down and opened the window consequently the alarm bell rang it would even if the alarm had been in order papa went despairingly upstairs and said to mamma livy the mahoganyroom wont go on i have just opened the window to see why youth mamma replied if youve opened the window why of coarse the alarm will ring thats what ive opened it for why i just went down to see if it would ring mamma tried to explain to papa that when he wanted to go and see whether the alarm would ring while the window was closed he mustnt go and open the window but in vain papa couldnt understand and got very impatient with mamma for trying to make him believe an impossible thing true this is a frank biographer and an honest one she uses no sandpaper on me i have to this day the same dull head in the matter of conundrums and perplexities which susy had discovered in those longgone days complexities annoy me they irritate me then this progressive feeling presently warms into anger i cannot get far in the reading of the commonest and simplest contract with its parties of the first part and parties of the second part and parties of the third part before my temper is all gone ashcroft comes up here every day and pathetically tries to make me understand the points of the lawsuit which we are conducting against henry butters harold wheeler and the rest of those plasmon buccaneers but daily he has to give it up it is pitiful to see when he bends his earnest and appealing eyes upon me and says after one of his efforts now you do understand that dont you i am always obliged to say i dont ashcroft i wish i could understand it but i dont send for the cat in the days which susy is talking about a perplexity fell to my lot one day f g whitmore was my business agent and he brought me out from town in his buggy we drove by the portecochрёre and toward the stable now this was a single road and was like a spoon whose handle stretched from the gate to a great round flowerbed in the neighborhood of the stable at the approach to the flowerbed the road divided and circumnavigated it making a loop which i have likened to the bowl of the spoon as we neared the loop i saw that whitmore was laying his course to port i was sitting on the starboard side the side the house was on and was going to start around that spoonbowl on that lefthand side i said dont do that whitmore take the righthand side then i shall be next to the house when we get to the door he said that will not happen in any case it doesnt make any difference which way i go around this flowerbed i explained to him that he was an ass but he stuck to his proposition and i said go on and try it and see he went on and tried it and sure enough he fetched me up at the door on the very side that he had said i would be i was not able to believe it then and i dont believe it yet i said whitmore that is merely an accident you cant do it again he said he could and he drove down into the street fetched around came back and actually did it again i was stupefied paralyzed petrified with these strange results but they did not convince me i didnt believe he could do it another time but he did he said he could do it all day and fetch up the same way every time by that time my temper was gone and i asked him to go home and apply to the asylum and i would pay the expenses i didnt want to see him any more for a week i went upstairs in a rage and started to tell livy about it expecting to get her sympathy for me and to breed aversion in her for whitmore but she merely burst into peal after peal of laughter as the tale of my adventure went on for her head was like susys riddles and complexities had no terrors for it her mind and susys were analytical i have tried to make it appear that mine was different many and many a time i have told that buggy experiment hoping against hope that i would some time or other find somebody who would be on my side but it has never happened and i am never able to go glibly forward and state the circumstances of that buggys progress without having to halt and consider and call up in my mind the spoonhandle the bowl of the spoon the buggy and the horse and my position in the buggy and the minute i have got that far and try to turn it to the left it goes to ruin i cant see how it is ever going to fetch me out right when we get to the door susy is right in her estimate i cant understand things that burglaralarm which susy mentions led a gay and careless life and had no principles it was generally out of order at one point or another and there was plenty of opportunity because all the windows and doors in the house from the cellar up to the top floor were connected with it however in its seasons of being out of order it could trouble us for only a very little while we quickly found out that it was fooling us and that it was buzzing its bloodcurdling alarm merely for its own amusement then we would shut it off and send to new york for the electrician there not being one in all hartford in those days when the repairs were finished we would set the alarm again and reestablish our confidence in it it never did any real business except upon one single occasion all the rest of its expensive career was frivolous and without purpose just that one time it performed its duty and its whole duty gravely seriously admirably it let fly about two oclock one black and dreary march morning and i turned out promptly because i knew that it was not fooling this time the bathroom door was on my side of the bed i stepped in there turned up the gas looked at the annunciator and turned off the alarm so far as the door indicated was concerned thus stopping the racket then i came back to bed mrs clemens opened the debate what was it it was the cellar door was it a burglar do you think yes i said of course it was did you suppose it was a sundayschool superintendent no what do you suppose he wants i suppose he wants jewelry but he is not acquainted with the house and he thinks it is in the cellar i dont like to disappoint a burglar whom i am not acquainted with and who has done me no harm but if he had had common sagacity enough to inquire i could have told him we kept nothing down there but coal and vegetables still it may be that he is acquainted with the place and that what he really wants is coal and vegetables on the whole i think it is vegetables he is after are you going down to see no i could not be of any assistance let him select for himself i dont know where the things are then she said but suppose he comes up to the ground floor thats all right we shall know it the minute he opens a door on that floor it will set off the alarm just then the terrific buzzing broke out again i said he has arrived i told you he would i know all about burglars and their ways they are systematic people i went into the bathroom to see if i was right and i was i shut off the diningroom and stopped the buzzing and came back to bed my wife said what do you suppose he is after now i said i think he has got all the vegetables he wants and is coming up for napkinrings and odds and ends for the wife and children they all have families burglars have and they are always thoughtful of them always take a few necessaries of life for themselves and fill out with tokens of remembrance for the family in taking them they do not forget us those very things represent tokens of his remembrance of us and also of our remembrance of him we never get them again the memory of the attention remains embalmed in our hearts are you going down to see what it is he wants now no i said i am no more interested than i was before they are experienced people burglars they know what they want i should be no help to him i think he is after ceramics and bricрbrac and such things if he knows the house he knows that that is all that he can find on the diningroom floor she said with a strong interest perceptible in her tone suppose he comes up here i said it is all right he will give us notice what shall we do then then climb out of the window she said a little restively well what is the use of a burglaralarm for us you have seen dear heart that it has been useful up to the present moment and i have explained to you how it will be continuously useful after he gets up here that was the end of it he didnt ring any more alarms presently i said he is disappointed i think he has gone off with the vegetables and the bricрbrac and i think he is dissatisfied we went to sleep and at a quarter before eight in the morning i was out and hurrying for i was to take the train for new york i found the gas burning brightly full head all over the first floor my new overcoat was gone my old umbrella was gone my new patentleather shoes which i had never worn were gone the large window which opened into the ombra at the rear of the house was standing wide i passed out through it and tracked the burglar down the hill through the trees tracked him without difficulty because he had blazed his progress with imitation silver napkinrings and my umbrella and various other things which he had disapproved of and i went back in triumph and proved to my wife that he was a disappointed burglar i had suspected he would be from the start and from his not coming up to our floor to get human beings things happened to me that day in new york i will tell about them another time from susys biography papa has a peculiar gait we like it seems just to sute him but most people do not he always walks up and down the room while thinking and between each coarse at meals a lady distantly related to us came to visit us once in those days she came to stay a week but all our efforts to make her happy failed we could not imagine why and she got up her anchor and sailed the next morning we did much guessing but could not solve the mystery later we found out what the trouble was it was my tramping up and down between the courses she conceived the idea that i could not stand her society that word youth as the reader has perhaps already guessed was my wifes pet name for me it was gently satirical but also affectionate i had certain mental and material peculiarities and customs proper to a much younger person than i was from susys biography papa is very fond of animals particularly of cats we had a dear little gray kitten once that he named lazy papa always wears gray to match his hair and eyes and he would carry him around on his shoulder it was a mighty pretty sight the gray cat sound asleep against papas gray coat and hair the names that he has given our different cats are realy remarkably funny they are namely stray kit abner motley fraeulein lazy bufalo bill cleveland sour mash and pestilence and famine at one time when the children were small we had a very black mothercat named satan and satan had a small black offspring named sin pronouns were a difficulty for the children little clara came in one day her black eyes snapping with indignation and said papa satan ought to be punished she is out there at the greenhouse and there she stays and stays and his kitten is downstairs crying from susys biography papa uses very strong language but i have an idea not nearly so strong as when he first maried mamma a lady acquaintance of his is rather apt to interupt what one is saying and papa told mamma that he thought he should say to the ladys husband i am glad your wife wasnt present when the deity said let there be light it is as i have said before this is a frank historian she doesnt cover up ones deficiencies but gives them an equal showing with ones handsomer qualities of course i made the remark which she has quoted and even at this distant day i am still as much as half persuaded that if that lady had been present when the creator said let there be light she would have interrupted him and we shouldnt ever have got it from susys biography papa said the other day i am a mugwump and a mugwump is pure from the marrow out papa knows that i am writing this biography of him and he said this for it he doesnt like to go to church at all why i never understood until just now he told us the other day that he couldnt bear to hear any one talk but himself but that he could listen to himself talk for hours without getting tired of course he said this in joke but ive no dought it was founded on truth mark twain to be continued north american review no dcii november chapters from my autobiography v by mark twain susys remark about my strong language troubles me and i must go back to it all through the first ten years of my married life i kept a constant and discreet watch upon my tongue while in the house and went outside and to a distance when circumstances were too much for me and i was obliged to seek relief i prized my wifes respect and approval above all the rest of the human races respect and approval i dreaded the day when she should discover that i was but a whited sepulchre partly freighted with suppressed language i was so careful during ten years that i had not a doubt that my suppressions had been successful therefore i was quite as happy in my guilt as i could have been if i had been innocent but at last an accident exposed me i went into the bathroom one morning to make my toilet and carelessly left the door two or three inches ajar it was the first time that i had ever failed to take the precaution of closing it tightly i knew the necessity of being particular about this because shaving was always a trying ordeal for me and i could seldom carry it through to a finish without verbal helps now this time i was unprotected but did not suspect it i had no extraordinary trouble with my razor on this occasion and was able to worry through with mere mutterings and growlings of an improper sort but with nothing noisy or emphatic about them no snapping and barking then i put on a shirt my shirts are an invention of my own they open in the back and are buttoned there when there are buttons this time the button was missing my temper jumped up several degrees in a moment and my remarks rose accordingly both in loudness and vigor of expression but i was not troubled for the bathroom door was a solid one and i supposed it was firmly closed i flung up the window and threw the shirt out it fell upon the shrubbery where the people on their way to church could admire it if they wanted to there was merely fifty feet of grass between the shirt and the passerby still rumbling and thundering distantly i put on another shirt again the button was absent i augmented my language to meet the emergency and threw that shirt out of the window i was too angry too insane to examine the third shirt but put it furiously on again the button was absent and that shirt followed its comrades out of the window then i straightened up gathered my reserves and let myself go like a cavalry charge in the midst of that great assault my eye fell upon that gaping door and i was paralyzed it took me a good while to finish my toilet i extended the time unnecessarily in trying to make up my mind as to what i would best do in the circumstances i tried to hope that mrs clemens was asleep but i knew better i could not escape by the window it was narrow and suited only to shirts at last i made up my mind to boldly loaf through the bedroom with the air of a person who had not been doing anything i made half the journey successfully i did not turn my eyes in her direction because that would not be safe it is very difficult to look as if you have not been doing anything when the facts are the other way and my confidence in my performance oozed steadily out of me as i went along i was aiming for the lefthand door because it was furthest from my wife it had never been opened from the day that the house was built but it seemed a blessed refuge for me now the bed was this one wherein i am lying now and dictating these histories morning after morning with so much serenity it was this same old elaborately carved black venetian bedstead the most comfortable bedstead that ever was with space enough in it for a family and carved angels enough surmounting its twisted columns and its headboard and footboard to bring peace to the sleepers and pleasant dreams i had to stop in the middle of the room i hadnt the strength to go on i believed that i was under accusing eyes that even the carved angels were inspecting me with an unfriendly gaze you know how it is when you are convinced that somebody behind you is looking steadily at you you have to turn your face you cant help it i turned mine the bed was placed as it is now with the foot where the head ought to be if it had been placed as it should have been the high headboard would have sheltered me but the footboard was no sufficient protection for i could be seen over it i was exposed i was wholly without protection i turned because i couldnt help it and my memory of what i saw is still vivid after all these years against the white pillows i saw the black head i saw that young and beautiful face and i saw the gracious eyes with a something in them which i had never seen there before they were snapping and flashing with indignation i felt myself crumbling i felt myself shrinking away to nothing under that accusing gaze i stood silent under that desolating fire for as much as a minute i should say it seemed a very very long time then my wifes lips parted and from them issued my latest bathroom remark the language perfect but the expression velvety unpractical apprenticelike ignorant inexperienced comically inadequate absurdly weak and unsuited to the great language in my lifetime i had never heard anything so out of tune so inharmonious so incongruous so illsuited to each other as were those mighty words set to that feeble music i tried to keep from laughing for i was a guilty person in deep need of charity and mercy i tried to keep from bursting and i succeeded until she gravely said there now you know how it sounds then i exploded the air was filled with my fragments and you could hear them whiz i said oh livy if it sounds like that i will never do it again then she had to laugh herself both of us broke into convulsions and went on laughing until we were physically exhausted and spiritually reconciled the children were present at breakfast clara aged six and susy eight and the mother made a guarded remark about strong language guarded because she did not wish the children to suspect anything a guarded remark which censured strong language both children broke out in one voice with this comment why mamma papa uses it i was astonished i had supposed that that secret was safe in my own breast and that its presence had never been suspected i asked how did you know you little rascals oh they said we often listen over the balusters when you are in the hall explaining things to george from susys biography one of papas latest books is the prince and the pauper and it is unquestionably the best book he has ever written some people want him to keep to his old style some gentleman wrote him i enjoyed huckleberry finn immensely and am glad to see that you have returned to your old style that enoyed me that enoyed me greatly because it trobles me susy was troubled by that word and uncertain she wrote a u above it in the proper place but reconsidered the matter and struck it out to have so few people know papa i mean realy know him they think of mark twain as a humorist joking at everything and with a mop of reddish brown hair which sorely needs the barbars brush a roman nose short stubby mustache a sad careworn face with maney crows feet etc that is the way people picture papa i have wanted papa to write a book that would reveal something of his kind sympathetic nature and the prince and the pauper partly does it the book is full of lovely charming ideas and oh the language it is perfect i think that one of the most touching scenes in it is where the pauper is riding on horseback with his nobles in the recognition procession and he sees his mother oh and then what followed how she runs to his side when she sees him throw up his hand palm outward and is rudely pushed off by one of the kings officers and then how the little paupers consceince troubles him when he remembers the shameful words that were falling from his lips when she was turned from his side i know you not woman and how his grandeurs were stricken valueless and his pride consumed to ashes it is a wonderfully beautiful and touching little scene and papa has described it so wonderfully i never saw a man with so much variety of feeling as papa has now the prince and the pauper is full of touching places but there is most always a streak of humor in them somewhere now in the coronation in the stirring coronation just after the little king has got his crown back again papa brings that in about the seal where the pauper says he used the seal to crack nuts with oh it is so funny and nice papa very seldom writes a passage without some humor in it somewhere and i dont think he ever will the children always helped their mother to edit my books in manuscript she would sit on the porch at the farm and read aloud with her pencil in her hand and the children would keep an alert and suspicious eye upon her right along for the belief was well grounded in them that whenever she came across a particularly satisfactory passage she would strike it out their suspicions were well founded the passages which were so satisfactory to them always had an element of strength in them which sorely needed modification or expurgation and were always sure to get it at their mothers hand for my own entertainment and to enjoy the protests of the children i often abused my editors innocent confidence i often interlarded remarks of a studied and felicitously atrocious character purposely to achieve the childrens brief delight and then see the remorseless pencil do its fatal work i often joined my supplications to the childrens for mercy and strung the argument out and pretended to be in earnest they were deceived and so was their mother it was three against one and most unfair but it was very delightful and i could not resist the temptation now and then we gained the victory and there was much rejoicing then i privately struck the passage out myself it had served its purpose it had furnished three of us with good entertainment and in being removed from the book by me it was only suffering the fate originally intended for it from susys biography papa was born in missouri his mother is grandma clemens jane lampton clemens of kentucky grandpa clemens was of the ffvs of virginia without doubt it was i that gave susy that impression i cannot imagine why because i was never in my life much impressed by grandeurs which proceed from the accident of birth i did not get this indifference from my mother she was always strongly interested in the ancestry of the house she traced her own line back to the lambtons of durham england a family which had been occupying broad lands there since saxon times i am not sure but i think that those lambtons got along without titles of nobility for eight or nine hundred years then produced a great man threequarters of a century ago and broke into the peerage my mother knew all about the clemenses of virginia and loved to aggrandize them to me but she has long been dead there has been no one to keep those details fresh in my memory and they have grown dim there was a jere clemens who was a united states senator and in his day enjoyed the usual senatorial fame a fame which perishes whether it spring from four years service or forty after jere clemenss fame as a senator passed away he was still remembered for many years on account of another service which he performed he shot old john browns governor wise in the hind leg in a duel however i am not very clear about this it may be that governor wise shot him in the hind leg however i dont think it is important i think that the only thing that is really important is that one of them got shot in the hind leg it would have been better and nobler and more historical and satisfactory if both of them had got shot in the hind leg but it is of no use for me to try to recollect history i never had a historical mind let it go whichever way it happened i am glad of it and that is as much enthusiasm as i can get up for a person bearing my name but i am forgetting the first clemens the one that stands furthest back toward the really original first clemens which was adam from susys biography clara and i are sure that papa played the trick on grandma about the whipping that is related in the adventures of tom sayer hand me that switch the switch hovered in the air the peril was desperate my look behind you aunt the old lady whirled around and snatched her skirts out of danger the lad fled on the instant scrambling up the high board fence and dissapeared over it susy and clara were quite right about that then susy says and we know papa played hookey all the time and how readily would papa pretend to be dying so as not to have to go to school these revelations and exposures are searching but they are just if i am as transparent to other people as i was to susy i have wasted much effort in this life grandma couldnt make papa go to school no she let him go into a printingoffice to learn the trade he did so and gradually picked up enough education to enable him to do about as well as those who were more studious in early life it is noticeable that susy does not get overheated when she is complimenting me but maintains a proper judicial and biographical calm it is noticeable also and it is to her credit as a biographer that she distributes compliment and criticism with a fair and even hand my mother had a good deal of trouble with me but i think she enjoyed it she had none at all with my brother henry who was two years younger than i and i think that the unbroken monotony of his goodness and truthfulness and obedience would have been a burden to her but for the relief and variety which i furnished in the other direction i was a tonic i was valuable to her i never thought of it before but now i see it i never knew henry to do a vicious thing toward me or toward any one else but he frequently did righteous ones that cost me as heavily it was his duty to report me when i needed reporting and neglected to do it myself and he was very faithful in discharging that duty he is sid in tom sawyer but sid was not henry henry was a very much finer and better boy than ever sid was it was henry who called my mothers attention to the fact that the thread with which she had sewed my collar together to keep me from going in swimming had changed color my mother would not have discovered it but for that and she was manifestly piqued when she recognized that that prominent bit of circumstantial evidence had escaped her sharp eye that detail probably added a detail to my punishment it is human we generally visit our shortcomings on somebody else when there is a possible excuse for it but no matter i took it out of henry there is always compensation for such as are unjustly used i often took it out of him sometimes as an advance payment for something which i hadnt yet done these were occasions when the opportunity was too strong a temptation and i had to draw on the future i did not need to copy this idea from my mother and probably didnt still she wrought upon that principle upon occasion if the incident of the broken sugarbowl is in tom sawyer i dont remember whether it is or not that is an example of it henry never stole sugar he took it openly from the bowl his mother knew he wouldnt take sugar when she wasnt looking but she had her doubts about me not exactly doubts either she knew very well i would one day when she was not present henry took sugar from her prized and precious old english sugarbowl which was an heirloom in the family and he managed to break the bowl it was the first time i had ever had a chance to tell anything on him and i was inexpressibly glad i told him i was going to tell on him but he was not disturbed when my mother came in and saw the bowl lying on the floor in fragments she was speechless for a minute i allowed that silence to work i judged it would increase the effect i was waiting for her to ask who did that so that i could fetch out my news but it was an error of calculation when she got through with her silence she didnt ask anything about it she merely gave me a crack on the skull with her thimble that i felt all the way down to my heels then i broke out with my injured innocence expecting to make her very sorry that she had punished the wrong one i expected her to do something remorseful and pathetic i told her that i was not the one it was henry but there was no upheaval she said without emotion its all right it isnt any matter you deserve it for something youve done that i didnt know about and if you havent done it why then you deserve it for something that you are going to do that i shant hear about there was a stairway outside the house which led up to the rear part of the second story one day henry was sent on an errand and he took a tin bucket along i knew he would have to ascend those stairs so i went up and locked the door on the inside and came down into the garden which had been newly ploughed and was rich in choice firm clods of black mold i gathered a generous equipment of these and ambushed him i waited till he had climbed the stairs and was near the landing and couldnt escape then i bombarded him with clods which he warded off with his tin bucket the best he could but without much success for i was a good marksman the clods smashing against the weatherboarding fetched my mother out to see what was the matter and i tried to explain that i was amusing henry both of them were after me in a minute but i knew the way over that high board fence and escaped for that time after an hour or two when i ventured back there was no one around and i thought the incident was closed but it was not henry was ambushing me with an unusually competent aim for him he landed a stone on the side of my head which raised a bump there that felt like the matterhorn i carried it to my mother straightway for sympathy but she was not strongly moved it seemed to be her idea that incidents like this would eventually reform me if i harvested enough of them so the matter was only educational i had had a sterner view of it than that before it was not right to give the cat the painkiller i realize it now i would not repeat it in these days but in those tom sawyer days it was a great and sincere satisfaction to me to see peter perform under its influence and if actions do speak as loud as words he took as much interest in it as i did it was a most detestable medicine perry daviss painkiller mr paveys negro man who was a person of good judgment and considerable curiosity wanted to sample it and i let him it was his opinion that it was made of hellfire those were the cholera days of the people along the mississippi were paralyzed with fright those who could run away did it and many died of fright in the flight fright killed three persons where the cholera killed one those who couldnt flee kept themselves drenched with cholera preventives and my mother chose perry daviss painkiller for me she was not distressed about herself she avoided that kind of preventive but she made me promise to take a teaspoonful of painkiller every day originally it was my intention to keep the promise but at that time i didnt know as much about painkiller as i knew after my first experiment with it she didnt watch henrys bottle she could trust henry but she marked my bottle with a pencil on the label every day and examined it to see if the teaspoonful had been removed the floor was not carpeted it had cracks in it and i fed the painkiller to the cracks with very good results no cholera occurred down below it was upon one of these occasions that that friendly cat came waving his tail and supplicating for painkiller which he got and then went into those hysterics which ended with his colliding with all the furniture in the room and finally going out of the open window and carrying the flowerpots with him just in time for my mother to arrive and look over her glasses in petrified astonishment and say what in the world is the matter with peter i dont remember what my explanation was but if it is recorded in that book it may not be the right one whenever my conduct was of such exaggerated impropriety that my mothers extemporary punishments were inadequate she saved the matter up for sunday and made me go to church sunday night which was a penalty sometimes bearable perhaps but as a rule it was not and i avoided it for the sake of my constitution she would never believe that i had been to church until she had applied her test she made me tell her what the text was that was a simple matter and caused me no trouble i didnt have to go to church to get a text i selected one for myself this worked very well until one time when my text and the one furnished by a neighbor who had been to church didnt tally after that my mother took other methods i dont know what they were now in those days men and boys wore rather long cloaks in the wintertime they were black and were lined with very bright and showy scotch plaids one winters night when i was starting to church to square a crime of some kind committed during the week i hid my cloak near the gate and went off and played with the other boys until church was over then i returned home but in the dark i put the cloak on wrong side out entered the room threw the cloak aside and then stood the usual examination i got along very well until the temperature of the church was mentioned my mother said it must have been impossible to keep warm there on such a night i didnt see the art of that remark and was foolish enough to explain that i wore my cloak all the time that i was in church she asked if i kept it on from church home too i didnt see the bearing of that remark i said that that was what i had done she said you wore it in church with that red scotch plaid outside and glaring didnt that attract any attention of course to continue such a dialogue would have been tedious and unprofitable and i let it go and took the consequences that was about tom nash was a boy of my own age the postmasters son the mississippi was frozen across and he and i went skating one night probably without permission i cannot see why we should go skating in the night unless without permission for there could be no considerable amusement to be gotten out of skating at night if nobody was going to object to it about midnight when we were more than half a mile out toward the illinois shore we heard some ominous rumbling and grinding and crashing going on between us and the home side of the river and we knew what it meant the ice was breaking up we started for home pretty badly scared we flew along at full speed whenever the moonlight sifting down between the clouds enabled us to tell which was ice and which was water in the pauses we waited started again whenever there was a good bridge of ice paused again when we came to naked water and waited in distress until a floating vast cake should bridge that place it took us an hour to make the trip a trip which we made in a misery of apprehension all the time but at last we arrived within a very brief distance of the shore we waited again there was another place that needed bridging all about us the ice was plunging and grinding along and piling itself up in mountains on the shore and the dangers were increasing not diminishing we grew very impatient to get to solid ground so we started too early and went springing from cake to cake tom made a miscalculation and fell short he got a bitter bath but he was so close to shore that he only had to swim a stroke or two then his feet struck hard bottom and he crawled out i arrived a little later without accident we had been in a drenching perspiration and toms bath was a disaster for him he took to his bed sick and had a procession of diseases the closing one was scarletfever and he came out of it stone deaf within a year or two speech departed of course but some years later he was taught to talk after a fashion one couldnt always make out what it was he was trying to say of course he could not modulate his voice since he couldnt hear himself talk when he supposed he was talking low and confidentially you could hear him in illinois four years ago i was invited by the university of missouri to come out there and receive the honorary degree of lld i took that opportunity to spend a week in hannibal a city now a village in my day it had been fiftythree years since tom nash and i had had that adventure when i was at the railway station ready to leave hannibal there was a crowd of citizens there i saw tom nash approaching me across a vacant space and i walked toward him for i recognized him at once he was old and whiteheaded but the boy of fifteen was still visible in him he came up to me made a trumpet of his hands at my ear nodded his head toward the citizens and said confidentially in a yell like a foghorn same damned fools sam from susys biography papa was about twenty years old when he went on the mississippi as a pilot just before he started on his tripp grandma clemens asked him to promise her on the bible not to touch intoxicating liquors or swear and he said yes mother i will and he kept that promise seven years when grandma released him from it under the inspiring influence of that remark what a garden of forgotten reforms rises upon my sight mark twain to be continued north american review no dciii november chapters from my autobiography vi by mark twain from susys biography papa made arrangements to read at vassar college the st of may and i went with him we went by way of new york city mamma went with us to new york and stayed two days to do some shopping we started tuesday at past two oclock in the afternoon and reached new york about past six papa went right up to general grants from the station and mamma and i went to the everett house aunt clara came to supper with us up in our room we and aunt clara were going were going to the theatre right after supper and we expected papa to take us there and to come home as early as he could but we got through dinner and he didnt come and didnt come and mamma got more perplexed and worried but at last we thought we would have to go without him so we put on our things and started down stairs but before wed goten half down we met papa coming up with a great bunch of roses in his hand he explained that the reason he was so late was that his watch stopped and he didnt notice and kept thinking it an hour earlier than it really was the roses he carried were some col fred grant sent to mamma we went to the theatre and enjoyed adonis word illegible acted very much we reached home about past eleven oclock and went right to bed wednesday morning we got up rather late and had breakfast about past nine oclock after breakfast mamma went out shopping and papa and i went to see papas agent about some business matters after papa had gotten through talking to cousin charlie webster papas agent we went to get a friend of papas major pond to go and see a dog show with us then we went to see the dogs with major pond and we had a delightful time seeing so many dogs together when we got through seeing the dogs papa thought he would go and see general grant and i went with him this was april papa went up into general grants room and he took me with him i felt greatly honored and delighted when papa took me into general grants room and let me see the general and col grant for general grant is a man i shall be glad all my life that i have seen papa and general grant had a long talk together and papa has written an account of his talk and visit with general grant for me to put into this biography susy has inserted in this place that account of mine as follows april i called on general grant and took susy with me the general was looking and feeling far better than he had looked or felt for some months he had ventured to work again on his book that morning the first time he had done any work for perhaps a month this mornings work was his first attempt at dictating and it was a thorough success to his great delight he had always said that it would be impossible for him to dictate anything but i had said that he was noted for clearness of statement and as a narrative was simply a statement of consecutive facts he was consequently peculiarly qualified and equipped for dictation this turned out to be true for he had dictated two hours that morning to a shorthand writer had never hesitated for words had not repeated himself and the manuscript when finished needed no revision the two hours work was an account of appomattox and this was such an extremely important feature that his book would necessarily have been severely lame without it therefore i had taken a shorthand writer there before to see if i could not get him to write at least a few lines about appomattox but he was at that time not well enough to undertake it i was aware that of all the hundred versions of appomattox not one was really correct therefore i was extremely anxious that he should leave behind him the truth his throat was not distressing him and his voice was much better and stronger than usual he was so delighted to have gotten appomattox accomplished once more in his life to have gotten the matter off his mind that he was as talkative as his old self he received susy very pleasantly and then fell to talking about certain matters which he hoped to be able to dictate next day and he said in substance that among other things he wanted to settle once for all a question that had been bandied about from mouth to mouth and from newspaper to newspaper that question was with whom originated the idea of the march to the sea was it grants or was it shermans idea whether i or some one else being anxious to get the important fact settled asked him with whom the idea originated i dont remember but i remember his answer i shall always remember his answer general grant said neither of us originated the idea of shermans march to the sea the enemy did it he went on to say that the enemy however necessarily originated a great many of the plans that the general on the opposite side gets the credit for at the same time that the enemy is doing that he is laying open other moves which the opposing general sees and takes advantage of in this case sherman had a plan all thought out of course he meant to destroy the two remaining railroads in that part of the country and that would finish up that region but general hood did not play the military part that he was expected to play on the contrary general hood made a dive at chattanooga this left the march to the sea open to sherman and so after sending part of his army to defend and hold what he had acquired in the chattanooga region he was perfectly free to proceed with the rest of it through georgia he saw the opportunity and he would not have been fit for his place if he had not seized it he wrote me the general is speaking what his plan was and i sent him word to go ahead my staff were opposed to the movement i think the general said they tried to persuade him to stop sherman the chief of his staff the general said even went so far as to go to washington without the generals knowledge and get the ear of the authorities and he succeeded in arousing their fears to such an extent that they telegraphed general grant to stop sherman then general grant said out of deference to the government i telegraphed sherman and stopped him twentyfour hours and then considering that that was deference enough to the government i telegraphed him to go ahead again i have not tried to give the generals language but only the general idea of what he said the thing that mainly struck me was his terse remark that the enemy originated the idea of the march to the sea it struck me because it was so suggestive of the generals epigrammatic fashion saying a great deal in a single crisp sentence this is my account and signed mark twain susy resumes after papa and general grant had had their talk we went back to the hotel where mamma was and papa told mamma all about his interview with general grant mamma and i had a nice quiet afternoon together that pair of devoted comrades were always shutting themselves up together when there was opportunity to have what susy called a cozy time from susys nursery days to the end of her life she and her mother were close friends intimate friends passionate adorers of each other susys was a beautiful mind and it made her an interesting comrade and with the fine mind she had a heart like her mothers susy never had an interest or an occupation which she was not glad to put aside for that something which was in all cases more precious to her a visit with her mother susy died at the right time the fortunate time of life the happy age twentyfour years at twentyfour such a girl has seen the best of life life as a happy dream after that age the risks begin responsibility comes and with it the cares the sorrows and the inevitable tragedy for her mothers sake i would have brought her back from the grave if i could but i would not have done it for my own from susys biography then papa went to read in public there were a great many authors that read that thursday afternoon beside papa i would have liked to have gone and heard papa read but papa said he was going to read in vassar just what he was planning to read in new york so i stayed at home with mamma the next day mamma planned to take the four oclock car back to hartford we rose quite early that morning and went to the vienna bakery and took breakfast there from there we went to a german bookstore and bought some german books for claras birthday dear me the power of association to snatch mouldy dead memories out of their graves and make them walk that remark about buying foreign books throws a sudden white glare upon the distant past and i see the long stretch of a new york street with an unearthly vividness and john hay walking down it grave and remorseful i was walking down it too that morning and i overtook hay and asked him what the trouble was he turned a lustreless eye upon me and said my case is beyond cure in the most innocent way in the world i have committed a crime which will never be forgiven by the sufferers for they will never believe oh well no i was going to say they would never believe that i did the thing innocently the truth is they will know that i acted innocently because they are rational people but what of that i never can look them in the face again nor they me perhaps hay was a young bachelor and at that time was on the tribune staff he explained his trouble in these words substantially when i was passing along here yesterday morning on my way downtown to the office i stepped into a bookstore where i am acquainted and asked if they had anything new from the other side they handed me a french novel in the usual yellow paper cover and i carried it away i didnt even look at the title of it it was for recreation reading and i was on my way to my work i went mooning and dreaming along and i think i hadnt gone more than fifty yards when i heard my name called i stopped and a private carriage drew up at the sidewalk and i shook hands with the inmates mother and young daughter excellent people they were on their way to the steamer to sail for paris the mother said i saw that book in your hand and i judged by the look of it that it was a french novel is it i said it was she said do let me have it so that my daughter can practise her french on it on the way over of course i handed her the book and we parted ten minutes ago i was passing that bookstore again and i stepped in and fetched away another copy of that book here it is read the first page of it that is enough you will know what the rest is like i think it must be the foulest book in the french language one of the foulest anyway i would be ashamed to offer it to a harlot but oh dear i gave it to that sweet young girl without shame take my advice dont give away a book until you have examined it from susys biography then mamma and i went to do some shopping and papa went to see general grant after we had finnished doing our shopping we went home to the hotel together when we entered our rooms in the hotel we saw on the table a vase full of exquisett red roses mamma who is very fond of flowers exclaimed oh i wonder who could have sent them we both looked at the card in the midst of the roses and saw that it was written on in papas handwriting it was written in german liebes geshchenk on die mamma i am sure i didnt say on that is susys spelling not mine also i am sure i didnt spell geschenk so liberally as all that s l c mamma was delighted papa came home and gave mamma her ticket and after visiting a while with her went to see major pond and mamma and i sat down to our lunch after lunch most of our time was taken up with packing and at about three oclock we went to escort mamma to the train we got on board the train with her and stayed with her about five minutes and then we said goodbye to her and the train started for hartford it was the first time i had ever beene away from home without mamma in my life although i was yrs old papa and i drove back to the hotel and got major pond and then went to see the brooklyn bridge we went across it to brooklyn on the cars and then walked back across it from brooklyn to new york we enjoyed looking at the beautiful scenery and we could see the bridge moove under the intense heat of the sun we had a perfectly delightful time but weer pretty tired when we got back to the hotel the next morning we rose early took our breakfast and took an early train to poughkeepsie we had a very pleasant journey to poughkeepsie the hudson was magnificent shrouded with beautiful mist when we arived at poughkeepsie it was raining quite hard which fact greatly dissapointed me because i very much wanted to see the outside of the buildings of vassar college and as it rained that would be impossible it was quite a long drive from the station to vasser college and papa and i had a nice long time to discuss and laugh over german profanity one of the german phrases papa particularly enjoys is o heilige maria mutter jesus jean has a german nurse and this was one of her phrases there was a time when jean exclaimed ach gott to every trifle but when mamma found it out she was shocked and instantly put a stop to it it brings that pretty little german girl vividly before me a sweet and innocent and plump little creature with peachy cheeks a clearsouled little maiden and without offence notwithstanding her profanities and she was loaded to the eyebrows with them she was a mere child she was not fifteen yet she was just from germany and knew no english she was always scattering her profanities around and they were such a satisfaction to me that i never dreamed of such a thing as modifying her for my own sake i had no disposition to tell on her indeed i took pains to keep her from being found out i told her to confine her religious exercises to the childrens quarters and urged her to remember that mrs clemens was prejudiced against pieties on weekdays to the children the little maids profanities sounded natural and proper and right because they had been used to that kind of talk in germany and they attached no evil importance to it it grieves me that i have forgotten those vigorous remarks i long hoarded them in my memory as a treasure but i remember one of them still because i heard it so many times the trial of that little creatures life was the childrens hair she would tug and strain with her comb accompanying her work with her misplaced pieties and when finally she was through with her triple job she always fired up and exploded her thanks toward the sky where they belonged in this form gott sei dank ich bin fertig mitm gott verdammtes haar i believe i am not quite brave enough to translate it from susys biography we at length reached vassar college and she looked very finely her buildings and her grounds being very beautiful we went to the front doore and range the bell the young girl who came to the doore wished to know who we wanted to see evidently we were not expected papa told her who we wanted to see and she showed us to the parlor we waited no one came and waited no one came still no one came it was beginning to seem pretty awkward oh well this is a pretty piece of business papa exclaimed at length we heard footsteps coming down the long corridor and miss c the lady who had invited papa came into the room she greeted papa very pleasantly and they had a nice little chatt together soon the lady principal also entered and she was very pleasant and agreable she showed us to our rooms and said she would send for us when dinner was ready we went into our rooms but we had nothing to do for half an hour exept to watch the rain drops as they fell upon the window panes at last we were called to dinner and i went down without papa as he never eats anything in the middle of the day i sat at the table with the lady principal and enjoyed very much seeing all the young girls trooping into the diningroom after dinner i went around the college with the young ladies and papa stayed in his room and smoked when it was supper time papa went down and ate supper with us and we had a very delightful supper after supper the young ladies went to their rooms to dress for the evening papa went to his room and i went with the lady principal at length the guests began to arive but papa still remained in his room until called for papa read in the chapell it was the first time i had ever heard him read in my life that is in public when he came out on to the stage i remember the people behind me exclaimed oh how queer he is isnt he funny i thought papa was very funny although i did not think him queer he read a trying situation and the golden arm a ghost story that he heard down south when he was a little boy the golden arm papa had told me before but he had startled me so that i did not much wish to hear it again but i had resolved this time to be prepared and not to let myself be startled but still papa did and very very much he startled the whole roomful of people and they jumped as one man the other story was also very funny and interesting and i enjoyed the evening inexpressibly much after papa had finished reading we all went down to the collation in the diningroom and after that there was dancing and singing then the guests went away and papa and i went to bed the next morning we rose early took an early train for hartford and reached hartford at past oclock we were very glad to get back how charitably she treats that ghastly experience it is a dear and lovely disposition and a most valuable one that can brush away indignities and discourtesies and seek and find the pleasanter features of an experience susy had that disposition and it was one of the jewels of her character that had come to her straight from her mother it is a feature that was left out of me at birth and at seventy i have not yet acquired it i did not go to vassar college professionally but as a guest as a guest and gratis aunt clara now mrs john b stanchfield was a graduate of vassar and it was to please her that i inflicted that journey upon susy and myself the invitation had come to me from both the lady mentioned by susy and the president of the college a sour old saint who has probably been gathered to his fathers long ago and i hope they enjoy him i hope they value his society i think i can get along without it in either end of the next world we arrived at the college in that soaking rain and susy has described with just a suggestion of dissatisfaction the sort of reception we got susy had to sit in her damp clothes half an hour while we waited in the parlor then she was taken to a fireless room and left to wait there again as she has stated i do not remember that presidents name and i am sorry he did not put in an appearance until it was time for me to step upon the platform in front of that great garden of young and lovely blossoms he caught up with me and advanced upon the platform with me and was going to introduce me i said in substance you have allowed me to get along without your help thus far and if you will retire from the platform i will try to do the rest without it i did not see him any more but i detest his memory of course my resentment did not extend to the students and so i had an unforgettable good time talking to them and i think they had a good time too for they responded as one man to use susys unimprovable phrase girls are charming creatures i shall have to be twice seventy years old before i change my mind as to that i am to talk to a crowd of them this afternoon students of barnard college the sexs annex to columbia university and i think i shall have as pleasant a time with those lasses as i had with the vassar girls twentyone years ago from susys biography i stopped in the middle of mammas early history to tell about our tripp to vassar because i was afraid i would forget about it now i will go on where i left off some time after miss emma nigh died papa took mamma and little langdon to elmira for the summer when in elmira langdon began to fail but i think mamma did not know just what was the matter with him i was the cause of the childs illness his mother trusted him to my care and i took him a long drive in an open barouche for an airing it was a raw cold morning but he was well wrapped about with furs and in the hands of a careful person no harm would have come to him but i soon dropped into a reverie and forgot all about my charge the furs fell away and exposed his bare legs by and by the coachman noticed this and i arranged the wraps again but it was too late the child was almost frozen i hurried home with him i was aghast at what i had done and i feared the consequences i have always felt shame for that treacherous mornings work and have not allowed myself to think of it when i could help it i doubt if i had the courage to make confession at that time i think it most likely that i have never confessed until now from susys biography at last it was time for papa to return to hartford and langdon was real sick at that time but still mamma decided to go with him thinking the journey might do him good but after they reached hartford he became very sick and his trouble prooved to be diptheeria he died about a week after mamma and papa reached hartford he was burried by the side of grandpa at elmira new york susy rests there with them s l c after that mamma became very very ill so ill that there seemed great danger of death but with a great deal of good care she recovered some months afterward mamma and papa and susy who was perhaps fourteen or fifteen months old at the time s l c went to europe and stayed for a time in scotland and england in scotland mamma and papa became very well equanted with dr john brown the author of rab and his friends and he mett but was not so well equanted with mr charles kingsley mr henry m stanley sir thomas hardy grandson of the captain hardy to whom nellson said kiss me hardy when dying on shipboard mr henry irving robert browning sir charles dilke mr charles reade mr william black lord houghton frank buckland mr tom hughes anthony trollope tom hood son of the poet and mamma and papa were quite well equanted with dr macdonald and family and papa met harrison ainsworth i remember all these men very well indeed except the last one i do not recall ainsworth by my count susy mentions fourteen men they are all dead except sir charles dilke we met a great many other interesting people among them lewis carroll author of the immortal alice but he was only interesting to look at for he was the stillest and shyest fullgrown man i have ever met except uncle remus dr macdonald and several other lively talkers were present and the talk went briskly on for a couple of hours but carroll sat still all the while except that now and then he answered a question his answers were brief i do not remember that he elaborated any of them at a dinner at smalleys we met herbert spencer at a large luncheon party at lord houghtons we met sir arthur helps who was a celebrity of worldwide fame at the time but is quite forgotten now lord elcho a large vigorous man sat at some distance down the table he was talking earnestly about godalming it was a deep and flowing and unarticulated rumble but i got the godalming pretty clearly every time it broke free of the rumble and as all the strength was on the first end of the word it startled me every time because it sounded so like swearing in the middle of the luncheon lady houghton rose remarked to the guests on her right and on her left in a matteroffact way excuse me i have an engagement and without further ceremony she went off to meet it this would have been doubtful etiquette in america lord houghton told a number of delightful stories he told them in french and i lost nothing of them but the nubs mark twain to be continued footnote i was his publisher i was putting his personal memoirs to press at the time s l c north american review no dciv december chapters from my autobiography vii by mark twain i was always heedless i was born heedless and therefore i was constantly and quite unconsciously committing breaches of the minor proprieties which brought upon me humiliations which ought to have humiliated me but didnt because i didnt know anything had happened but livy knew and so the humiliations fell to her share poor child who had not earned them and did not deserve them she always said i was the most difficult child she had she was very sensitive about me it distressed her to see me do heedless things which could bring me under criticism and so she was always watchful and alert to protect me from the kind of transgressions which i have been speaking of when i was leaving hartford for washington upon the occasion referred to she said i have written a small warning and put it in a pocket of your dressvest when you are dressing to go to the authors reception at the white house you will naturally put your fingers in your vest pockets according to your custom and you will find that little note there read it carefully and do as it tells you i cannot be with you and so i delegate my sentry duties to this little note if i should give you the warning by word of mouth now it would pass from your head and be forgotten in a few minutes it was president clevelands first term i had never seen his wife the young the beautiful the goodhearted the sympathetic the fascinating sure enough just as i had finished dressing to go to the white house i found that little note which i had long ago forgotten it was a grave little note a serious little note like its writer but it made me laugh livys gentle gravities often produced that effect upon me where the expert humorists best joke would have failed for i do not laugh easily when we reached the white house and i was shaking hands with the president he started to say something but i interrupted him and said if your excellency will excuse me i will come back in a moment but now i have a very important matter to attend to and it must be attended to at once i turned to mrs cleveland the young the beautiful the fascinating and gave her my card on the back of which i had written he didnt and i asked her to sign her name below those words she said he didnt he didnt what oh i said never mind we cannot stop to discuss that now this is urgent wont you please sign your name i handed her a fountainpen why she said i cannot commit myself in that way who is it that didnt and what is it that he didnt oh i said time is flying flying flying wont you take me out of my distress and sign your name to it its all right i give you my word its all right she looked nonplussed but hesitatingly and mechanically she took the pen and said i will sign it i will take the risk but you must tell me all about it right afterward so that you can be arrested before you get out of the house in case there should be anything criminal about this then she signed and i handed her mrs clementss note which was very brief very simple and to the point it said dont wear your arctics in the white house it made her shout and at my request she summoned a messenger and we sent that card at once to the mail on its way to mrs clemens in hartford when the little ruth was about a year or a year and a half old mason an old and valued friend of mine was consulgeneral at frankfortonthemain i had known him well in and in america and i and mine had spent a good deal of time with him and his family in frankfort in he was a thoroughly competent diligent and conscientious official indeed he possessed these qualities in so large a degree that among american consuls he might fairly be said to be monumental for at that time our consular service was largely and i think i may say mainly in the hands of ignorant vulgar and incapable men who had been political heelers in america and had been taken care of by transference to consulates where they could be supported at the governments expense instead of being transferred to the poor house which would have been cheaper and more patriotic mason in had been consulgeneral in frankfort several years four i think he had come from marseilles with a great record he had been consul there during thirteen years and one part of his record was heroic there had been a desolating cholera epidemic and mason was the only representative of any foreign country who stayed at his post and saw it through and during that time he not only represented his own country but he represented all the other countries in christendom and did their work and did it well and was praised for it by them in words of no uncertain sound this great record of masons had saved him from official decapitation straight along while republican presidents occupied the chair but now it was occupied by a democrat mr cleveland was not seated in it he was not yet inaugurated before he was deluged with applications from democratic politicians desiring the appointment of a thousand or so politically useful democrats to masons place a year or two later mason wrote me and asked me if i couldnt do something to save him from destruction i was very anxious to keep him in his place but at first i could not think of any way to help him for i was a mugwump we the mugwumps a little company made up of the unenslaved of both parties the very best men to be found in the two great parties that was our idea of it voted sixty thousand strong for mr cleveland in new york and elected him our principles were high and very definite we were not a party we had no candidates we had no axes to grind our vote laid upon the man we cast it for no obligation of any kind by our rule we could not ask for office we could not accept office when voting it was our duty to vote for the best man regardless of his party name we had no other creed vote for the best man that was creed enough such being my situation i was puzzled to know how to try to help mason and at the same time save my mugwump purity undefiled it was a delicate place but presently out of the ruck of confusions in my mind rose a sane thought clear and bright to wit since it was a mugwumps duty to do his best to put the beet man in office necessarily it must be a mugwumps duty to try to keep the best man in when he was already there my course was easy now it might not be quite delicate for a mugwump to approach the president directly but i could approach him indirectly with all delicacy since in that case not even courtesy would require him to take notice of an application which no one could prove had ever reached him yes it was easy and simple sailing now i could lay the matter before ruth in her cradle and wait for results i wrote the little child and said to her all that i have just been saying about mugwump principles and the limitations which they put upon me i explained that it would not be proper for me to apply to her father in mr masons behalf but i detailed to her mr masons high and honorable record and suggested that she take the matter in her own hands and do a patriotic work which i felt some delicacy about venturing upon myself i asked her to forget that her father was only president of the united states and her subject and servant i asked her not to put her application in the form of a command but to modify it and give it the fictitious and pleasanter form of a mere request that it would be no harm to let him gratify himself with the superstition that he was independent and could do as he pleased in the matter i begged her to put stress and plenty of it upon the proposition that to keep mason in his place would be a benefaction to the nation to enlarge upon that and keep still about all other considerations in due time i received a letter from the president written with his own hand signed by his own hand acknowledging ruths intervention and thanking me for enabling him to save to the country the services of so good and welltried a servant as mason and thanking me also for the detailed fulness of masons record which could leave no doubt in any ones mind that mason was in his right place and ought to be kept there mason has remained in the service ever since and is now consulgeneral at paris during the time that we were living in buffalo in mr cleveland was sheriff but i never happened to make his acquaintance or even see him in fact i suppose i was not even aware of his existence fourteen years later he was become the greatest man in the state i was not living in the state at the time he was governor and was about to step into the post of president of the united states at that time i was on the public highway in company with another bandit george w cable we were robbing the public with readings from our works during four months and in the course of time we went to albany to levy tribute and i said we ought to go and pay our respects to the governor so cable and i went to that majestic capitol building and stated our errand we were shown into the governors private office and i sittingroom on the second floor and henry went from that room and downstairs without further ceremony but this time my mother went with him to the head of the stairs and said goodby again as i remember it she was moved to this by something in henrys manner and she remained at the head of the stairs while he descended when he reached the door he hesitated and climbed the stairs and shook hands goodby once more in the morning when i awoke i had been dreaming and the dream was so vivid so like reality that it deceived me and i thought it was real in the dream i had seen henry a corpse he lay in a metallic burialcase he was dressed in a suit of my clothing and on his breast lay a great bouquet of flowers mainly white roses with a red rose in the centre the casket stood upon a couple of chairs i dressed and moved toward that door thinking i would go in there and look at it but i changed my mind i thought i could not yet bear to meet my mother i thought i would wait awhile and make some preparation for that ordeal the house was in locust street a little above th and i walked to th and to the middle of the block beyond before it suddenly flashed upon me that there was nothing real about this it was only a dream i can still feel something of the grateful upheaval of joy of that moment and i can also still feel the remnant of doubt the suspicion that maybe it was real after all i returned to the house almost on a run flew up the stairs two or three steps at a jump and rushed into that sittingroom and was made glad again for there was no casket there we made the usual eventless trip to new orleans no it was not eventless for it was on the way down that i had the fight with mr brown which resulted in his requiring that i be left ashore at new orleans in new orleans i always had a job it was my privilege to watch the freightpiles from seven in the evening until seven in the morning and get three dollars for it it was a threenight job and occurred every thirtyfive days henry always joined my watch about nine in the evening when his own duties were ended and we often walked my rounds and chatted together until midnight this time we were to part and so the night before the boat sailed i gave henry some advice i said in case of disaster to the boat dont lose your head leave that unwisdom to the passengers they are competent theyll attend to it but you rush for the hurricanedeck and astern to one of the lifeboats lashed aft the wheelhouse and obey the mates orders thus you will be useful when the boat is launched give such help as you can in getting the women and children into it and be sure you dont try to get into it yourself it is summer weather the river is only a mile wide as a rule and you can swim that without any trouble two or three days afterward the boats boilers exploded at ship island below memphis early one morning and what happened afterward i have already told in old times on the mississippi as related there i followed the pennsylvania about a day later on another boat and we began to get news of the disaster at every port we touched at and so by the time we reached memphis we knew all about it i found henry stretched upon a mattress on the floor of a great building along with thirty or forty other scalded and wounded persons and was promptly informed by some indiscreet person that he had inhaled steam that his body was badly scalded and that he would live but a little while also i was told that the physicians and nurses were giving their whole attention to persons who had a chance of being saved they were shorthanded in the matter of physicians and nurses and henry and such others as were considered to be fatally hurt were receiving only such attention as could be spared from time to time from the more urgent cases but dr peyton a fine and largehearted old physician of great reputation in the community gave me his sympathy and took vigorous hold of the case and in about a week he had brought henry around dr peyton never committed himself with prognostications which might not materialize but at eleven oclock one night he told me that henry was out of danger and would get well then he said at midnight these poor fellows lying here and there all over this place will begin to mourn and mutter and lament and make outcries and if this commotion should disturb henry it will be bad for him therefore ask the physician on watch to give him an eighth of a grain of morphine but this is not to be done unless henry shall show signs that he is being disturbed oh well never mind the rest of it the physicians on watch were young fellows hardly out of the medical college and they made a mistake they had no way of measuring the eighth of a grain of morphine so they guessed at it and gave him a vast quantity heaped on the end of a knifeblade and the fatal effects were soon apparent i think he died about dawn i dont remember as to that he was carried to the deadroom and i went away for a while to a citizens house and slept off some of my accumulated fatigue and meantime something was happening the coffins provided for the dead were of unpainted white pine but in this instance some of the ladies of memphis had made up a fund of sixty dollars and bought a metallic case and when i came back and entered the deadroom henry lay in that open case and he was dressed in a suit of my clothing he had borrowed it without my knowledge during our last sojourn in st louis and i recognized instantly that my dream of several weeks before was here exactly reproduced so far as these details went and i think i missed one detail but that one was immediately supplied for just then an elderly lady entered the place with a large bouquet consisting mainly of white roses and in the centre of it was a red rose and she laid it on his breast i told the dream there in the club that night just as i have told it here rev dr burton swung his leonine head around focussed me with his eye and said when was it that this happened in june it is a good many years ago have you told it several times since yes i have a good many times how many why i dont know how many well strike an average how many times a year do you think you have told it well i have told it as many as six times a year possibly oftener very well then youve told it well say seventy or eighty times since it happened yes i said thats a conservative estimate now then mark a very extraordinary thing happened to me a great many years ago and i used to tell it a number of times a good many times every year for it was so wonderful that it always astonished the hearer and that astonishment gave me a distinct pleasure every time i never suspected that that tale was acquiring any auxiliary advantages through repetition until one day after i had been telling it ten or fifteen years it struck me that either i was getting old and slow in delivery or that the tale was longer than it was when it was born mark i diligently and prayerfully examined that tale with this result that i found that its proportions were now as nearly as i could make oat one part fact straight fact fact pure and undiluted golden fact and twentyfour parts embroidery i never told that tale afterwards i was never able to tell it again for i had lost confidence in it and so the pleasure of telling it was gone and gone permanently how much of this tale of yours is embroidery well i said i dont know i dont think any of it is embroidery i think it is all just as i have stated it detail by detail very well he said then it is all right but i wouldnt tell it any more because if you keep on it will begin to collect embroidery sure the safest thing is to stop now that was a great many years ago and today is the first time that i have told that dream since dr burton scared me into fatal doubts about it no i dont believe i can say that i dont believe that i ever really had any doubts whatever concerning the salient points of the dream for those points are of such a nature that they are pictures and pictures can be remembered when they are vivid much better than one can remember remarks and unconcreted facts although it has been so many years since i have told that dream i can see those pictures now just as clearly defined as if they were before me in this room i have not told the entire dream there was a good deal more of it i mean i have not told all that happened in the dreams fulfilment after the incident in the deathroom i may mention one detail and that is this when i arrived in st louis with the casket it was about eight oclock in the morning and i ran to my brotherinlaws place of business hoping to find him there but i missed him for while i was on the way to his office he was on his way from the house to the boat when i got back to the boat the casket was gone he had conveyed it out to his house i hastened thither and when i arrived the men were just removing the casket from the vehicle to carry it upstairs i stopped that procedure for i did not want my mother to see the dead face because one side of it was drawn and distorted by the effects of the opium when i went upstairs there stood the two chairs placed to receive the coffin just as i had seen them in my dream and if i had arrived two or three minutes later the casket would have been resting upon them precisely as in my dream of several weeks before mark twain to be continued footnote see old times on the mississippi north american review no dcxiv may chapters from my autobiography xvii by mark twain from susys biography of me sept mamma is teaching jean a little natural history and is making a little collection of insects for her but mamma does not allow jean to kill any insects she only collects those insects that are found dead mamma has told us all perticularly jean to bring her all the little dead insects that she finds the other day as we were all sitting at supper jean broke into the room and ran triumfantly up to mamma and presented her with a plate full of dead flies mamma thanked jean vary enthusiastically although she with difficulty concealed her amusement just then soar mash entered the room and jean believing her hungry asked mamma for permission to give her the flies mamma laughingly consented and the flies almost immediately dissapeared monday october sour hashs presence indicates that this adventure occurred at quarry farm susys biography interests itself pretty exclusively with historical facts where they happen is not a matter of much concern to her when other historians refer to the bunker hill monument they know it is not necessary to mention that that monument is in boston susy recognizes that when she mentions sour mash it is not necessary to localize her to susy sour mash is the bunker hill monument of quarry farm ordinary cats have some partiality for living flies but none for dead ones but susy does not trouble herself to apologize for sour mashs eccentricities of taste this biography was for us and susy knew that nothing that sour mash might do could startle us or need explanation we being aware that she was not an ordinary cat but moving upon a plane far above the prejudices and superstitions which are law to common catdom once in hartford the flies were so numerous for a time and so troublesome that mrs clemens conceived the idea of paying george a bounty on all the flies he might kill the children saw an opportunity here for the acquisition of sudden wealth they supposed that their mother merely wanted to accumulate dead flies for some рsthetic or scientific reason or other and they judged that the more flies she could get the happier she would be so they went into business with george on a commission straightway the dead flies began to arrive in such quantities that mrs clemens was pleased beyond words with the success of her idea next she was astonished that one house could furnish so many she was paying an extravagantly high bounty and it presently began to look as if by this addition to our expenses we were now probably living beyond our income after a few days there was peace and comfort not a fly was discoverable in the house there wasnt a straggler left still to mrs clements surprise the dead flies continued to arrive by the plateful and the bounty expense was as crushing as ever then she made inquiry and found that our innocent little rascals had established a fly trust and had hired all the children in the neighborhood to collect flies on a cheap and unburdensome commission mrs clemenss experience in this matter was a new one for her but the governments of the world had tried it and wept over it and discarded it every halfcentury since man was created any government could have told her that the best way to increase wolves in america rabbits in australia and snakes in india is to pay a bounty on their scalps then every patriot goes to raising them from susys biography of me sept the other evening clara and i brought down our new soap bubble water and we all blew soap bubles papa blew his soap bubles and filled them with tobacco smoke and as the light shone on then they took very beautiful opaline colors papa would hold them and then let us catch them in our hand and they felt delightful to the touch the mixture of the smoke and water had a singularly pleasant effect it is human life we are blown upon the world we float buoyantly upon the summer air a little while complacently showing off our grace of form and our dainty iridescent colors then we vanish with a little puff leaving nothing behind but a memory and sometimes not even that i suppose that at those solemn times when we wake in the deeps of the night and reflect there is not one of us who is not willing to confess that he is really only a soapbubble and as little worth the making i remember those days of twentyone years ago and a certain pathos clings about them susy with her manifold young charms and her iridescent mind was as lovely a bubble as any we made that day and as transitory she passed as they passed in her youth and beauty and nothing of her is left but a heartbreak and a memory that longvanished day came vividly back to me a few weeks ago when for the first time in twentyone years i found myself again amusing a child with smokecharged soapbubbles sidenote susys next date is november th the eve of my fiftieth birthday it seems a good while ago i must have been rather young for my age then for i was trying to tame an oldfashioned bicycle nine feet high it is to me almost unbelievable at my present stage of life that there have really been people willing to trust themselves upon a dizzy and unstable altitude like that and that i was one of them twichell and i took lessons every day he succeeded and became a master of the art of riding that wild vehicle but i had no gift in that direction and was never able to stay on mine long enough to get any satisfactory view of the planet every time i tried to steal a look at a pretty girl or any other kind of scenery that single moment of inattention gave the bicycle the chance it had been waiting for and i went over the front of it and struck the ground on my head or my back before i had time to realise that something was happening i didnt always go over the front way i had other ways and practised them all but no matter which way was chosen for me there was always one monotonous result the bicycle skinned my leg and leaped up into the air and came down on top of me sometimes its wires were so sprung by this violent performance that it had the collapsed look of an umbrella that had had a misunderstanding with a cyclone after each days practice i arrived at home with my skin hanging in ribbons from my knees down i plastered the ribbons on where they belonged and bound them there with handkerchiefs steeped in ponds extract and was ready for more adventures next day it was always a surprise to me that i had so much skin and that it held out so well there was always plenty and i soon came to understand that the supply was going to remain sufficient for all my needs it turned out that i had nine skins in layers one on top of the other like the leaves of a book and some of the doctors said it was quite remarkable i was full of enthusiasm over this insane amusement my teacher was a young german from the bicycle factory a gentle kindly patient creature with a pathetically grave face he never smiled he never made a remark he always gathered me tenderly up when i plunged off and helped me on again without a word when he had been teaching me twice a day for three weeks i introduced a new gymnastic one that he had never seen before and so at last a compliment was wrung from him a thing which i had been risking my life for days to achieve he gathered me up and said mournfully mr clemens you can fall off a bicycle in more different ways than any person i ever saw before sidenote a boys life is not all comedy much of the tragic enters into it the drunken tramp mentioned in tom sawyer or huck finn who was burned up in the village jail lay upon my conscience a hundred nights afterward and filled them with hideous dreams dreams in which i saw his appealing face as i had seen it in the pathetic reality pressed against the windowbars with the red hell glowing behind him a face which seemed to say to me if you had not give me the matches this would not have happened you are responsible for my death i was not responsible for it for i had meant him no harm but only good when i let him have the matches but no matter mine was a trained presbyterian conscience and knew but the one duty to hunt and harry its slave upon all pretexts and on all occasions particularly when there was no sense or reason in it the tramp who was to blame suffered ten minutes i who was not to blame suffered three months the shooting down of poor old smarr in the main street at noonday supplied me with some more dreams and in them i always saw again the grotesque closing picture the great family bible spread open on the profane old mans breast by some thoughtful idiot and rising and sinking to the labored breathings and adding the torture of its leaden weight to the dying struggles we are curiously made in all the throng of gaping and sympathetic onlookers there was not one with common sense enough to perceive that an anvil would have been in better taste there than the bible less open to sarcastic criticism and swifter in its atrocious work in my nightmares i gasped and struggled for breath under the crush of that vast book for many a night all within the space of a couple of years we had two or three other tragedies and i had the illluck to be too near by on each occasion there was the slave man who was struck down with a chunk of slag for some small offence i saw him die and the young california emigrant who was stabbed with a bowie knife by a drunken comrade i saw the red life gush from his breast and the case of the rowdy young hyde brothers and their harmless old uncle one of them held the old man down with his knees on his breast while the other one tried repeatedly to kill him with an allen revolver which wouldnt go off i happened along just then of course then there was the case of the young california emigrant who got drunk and proposed to raid the welshmans house all alone one dark and threatening night this house stood halfway up hollidays hill cardiff hill and its sole occupants were a poor but quite respectable widow and her young and blameless daughter the invading ruffian woke the whole village with his ribald yells and coarse challenges and obscenities i went up there with a comrade john briggs i think to look and listen the figure of the man was dimly risible the women were on their porch but not visible in the deep shadow of its roof but we heard the elder womans voice she had loaded an old musket with slugs and she warned the man that if he stayed where he was while she counted ten it would cost him his life she began to count slowly he began to laugh he stopped laughing at six then through the deep stillness in a steady voice followed the rest of the tale seven eight nine a long pause we holding our breath ten a red spout of flame gushed out into the night and the man dropped with his breast riddled to rags then the rain and the thunder burst loose and the waiting town swarmed up the hill in the glare of the lightning like an invasion of ants those people saw the rest i had had my share and was satisfied i went home to dream and was not disappointed my teaching and training enabled me to see deeper into these tragedies than an ignorant person could have done i knew what they were for i tried to disguise it from myself but down in the secret deeps of my heart i knew and i knew that i knew they were inventions of providence to beguile me to a better life it sounds curiously innocent and conceited now but to me there was nothing strange about it it was quite in accordance with the thoughtful and judicious ways of providence as i understood them it would not have surprised me nor even overflattered me if providence had killed off that whole community in trying to save an asset like me educated as i had been it would have seemed just the thing and well worth the expense why providence should take such an anxious interest in such a property that idea never entered my head and there was no one in that simple hamlet who would have dreamed of putting it there for one thing no one was equipped with it it is quite true i took all the tragedies to myself and tallied them off in turn as they happened saying to myself in each case with a sigh another one gone and on my account this ought to bring me to repentance his patience will not always endure and yet privately i believed it would that is i believed it in the daytime but not in the night with the going down of the sun my faith failed and the clammy fears gathered about my heart it was then that i repented those were awful nights nights of despair nights charged with the bitterness of death after each tragedy i recognized the warning and repented repented and begged begged like a coward begged like a dog and not in the interest of those poor people who had been extinguished for my sake but only in my own interest it seems selfish when i look back on it now my repentances were very real very earnest and after each tragedy they happened every night for a long time but as a rule they could not stand the daylight they faded out and shredded away and disappeared in the glad splendor of the sun they were the creatures of fear and darkness and they could not live out of their own place the day gave me cheer and peace and at night i repented again in all my boyhood life i am not sure that i ever tried to lead a better life in the daytime or wanted to in my age i should never think of wishing to do such a thing but in my age as in my youth night brings me many a deep remorse i realize that from the cradle up i have been like the rest of the race never quite sane in the night when injun joe died but never mind in another chapter i have already described what a raging hell of repentance i passed through then i believe that for months i was as pure as the driven snow after dark it was back in those fardistant days or that jim wolf came to us he was from shelbyville a hamlet thirty or forty miles back in the country and he brought all his native sweetnesses and gentlenesses and simplicities with him he was approaching seventeen a grave and slender lad trustful honest a creature to love and cling to and he was incredibly bashful it is to this kind that untoward things happen my sister gave a candypull on a winters night i was too young to be of the company and jim was too diffident i was sent up to bed early and jim followed of his own motion his room was in the new part of the house and his window looked out on the roof of the l annex that roof was six inches deep in snow and the snow had an icecrust upon it which was as slick as glass out of the comb of the roof projected a short chimney a common resort for sentimental cats on moonlight nights and this was a moonlight night down at the eaves below the chimney a canopy of dead vines spread away to some posts making a cozy shelter and after an hour or two the rollicking crowd of young ladies and gentlemen grouped themselves in its shade with their saucers of liquid and pipinghot candy disposed about them on the frozen ground to cool there was joyous chaffing and joking and laughter peal upon peal of it about this time a couple of old disreputable tomcats got up on the chimney and started a heated argument about something also about this time i gave up trying to get to sleep and went visiting to jims room he was awake and fuming about the cats and their intolerable yowling i asked him mockingly why he didnt climb out and drive them away he was nettled and said overboldly that for two cents he would it was a rash remark and was probably repented of before it was fairly out of his mouth but it was too late he was committed i knew him and i knew he would rather break his neck than back down if i egged him on judiciously oh of course you would whos doubting it it galled him and he burst out with sharp irritation maybe you doubt it i oh no i shouldnt think of such a thing you are always doing wonderful things with your mouth he was in a passion now he snatched on his yarn socks and began to raise the window saying in a voice unsteady with anger you think i dasnt you do think what you blame please i dont care what you think ill show you the window made him rage it wouldnt stay up i said never mind ill hold it indeed i would have done anything to help i was only a boy and was already in a radiant heaven of anticipation he climbed carefully out clung to the windowsill until his feet were safely placed then began to pick his perilous way on all fours along the glassy comb a foot and a hand on each side of it i believe i enjoy it now as much as i did then yet it is a good deal over fifty years ago the frosty breeze flapped his short shirt about his lean legs the crystal roof shone like polished marble in the intense glory of the moon the unconscious cats sat erect upon the chimney alertly watching each other lashing their tails and pouring out their hollow grievances and slowly and cautiously jim crept on flapping as he went the gay and frolicsome young creatures under the vinecanopy unaware and outraging these solemnities with their misplaced laughter every time jim slipped i had a hope but always on he crept and disappointed it at last he was within reaching distance he paused raised himself carefully up measured his distance deliberately then made a frantic grab at the nearest cat and missed of course he lost his balance his heels flew up he struck on his back and like a rocket he darted down the roof feet first crashed through the dead vines and landed in a sitting posture in fourteen saucers of redhot candy in the midst of all that party and dressed as he was this lad who could not look a girl in the face with his clothes on there was a wild scramble and a storm of shrieks and jim fled up the stairs dripping broken crockery all the way sidenote the incident was ended but i was not done with it yet though i supposed i was eighteen or twenty years later i arrived in new york from california and by that time i had failed in all my other undertakings and had stumbled into literature without intending it this was early in i was offered a large sum to write something for the sunday mercury and i answered with the tale of jim wolf and the cats i also collected the money for it twentyfive dollars it seemed overpay but i did not say anything about that for i was not so scrupulous then as i am now a year or two later jim wolf and the cats appeared in a tennessee paper in a new dress as to spelling spelling borrowed from artemus ward the appropriator of the tale had a wide reputation in the west and was exceedingly popular deservedly so i think he wrote some of the breeziest and funniest things i have ever read and did his work with distinguished ease and fluency his name has passed out of my memory a couple of years went by then the original story my own version cropped up again and went floating around in the spelling and with my name to it soon first one paper and then another fell upon me rigorously for stealing jim wolf and the cats from the tennessee man i got a merciless beating but i did not mind it its all in the game besides i had learned a good while before that that it is not wise to keep the fire going under a slander unless you can get some large advantage out of keeping it alive few slanders can stand the wear of silence sidenote sidenote but i was not done with jim and the cats yet in i was lecturing in london in the queens concert rooms hanover square and was living at the langham hotel portland place i had no domestic household and no official household except george dolby lectureagent and charles warren stoddard the california poet now professor of english literature in the roman catholic university washington ostensibly stoddard was my private secretary in reality he was merely my comrade i hired him in order to have his company as secretary there was nothing for him to do except to scrapbook the daily reports of the great trial of the tichborne claimant for perjury but he made a sufficient job out of that for the reports filled six columns a day and he usually postponed the scrapbooking until sunday then he had columns to cut out and paste in a proper labor for hercules he did his work well but if he had been older and feebler it would have killed him once a week without doubt he does his literary lectures well but also without doubt he prepares them fifteen minutes before he is due on his platform and thus gets into them a freshness and sparkle which they might lack if they underwent the staling process of overstudy he was good company when he was awake he was refined sensitive charming gentle generous honest himself and unsuspicious of other peoples honesty and i think he was the purest male i have known in mind and speech george dolby was something of a contrast to him but the two were very friendly and sociable together nevertheless dolby was large and ruddy full of life and strength and spirits a tireless and energetic talker and always overflowing with goodnature and bursting with jollity it was a choice and satisfactory menagerie this pensive poet and this gladsome gorilla an indelicate story was a sharp distress to stoddard dolby told him twentyfive a day dolby always came home with us after the lecture and entertained stoddard till midnight me too after he left i walked the floor and talked and stoddard went to sleep on the sofa i hired him for company dolby had been agent for concerts and theatres and charles dickens and all sorts of shows and attractions for many years he had known the human being in many aspects and he didnt much believe in him but the poet did the waifs and estrays found a friend in stoddard dolby tried to persuade him that he was dispensing his charities unworthily but he was never able to succeed one night a young american got access to stoddard at the concert rooms and told him a moving tale he said he was living on the surrey side and for some strange reason his remittances had failed to arrive from home he had no money he was out of employment and friendless his girlwife and his new baby were actually suffering for food for the love of heaven could he lend him a sovereign until his remittances should resume stoddard was deeply touched and gave him a sovereign on my account dolby scoffed but stoddard stood his ground each told me his story later in the evening and i backed stoddards judgment dolby said we were women in disguise and not a sane kind of women either the next week the young man came again his wife was ill with the pleurisy the baby had the bots or something i am not sure of the name of the disease the doctor and the drugs had eaten up the money the poor little family was starving if stoddard in the kindness of his heart could only spare him another sovereign etc etc stoddard was much moved and spared him a sovereign for me dolby was outraged he spoke up and said to the customer now young man you are going to the hotel with us and state your case to the other member of the family if you dont make him believe in you i shant honor this poets drafts in your interest any longer for i dont believe in you myself the young man was quite willing i found no fault in him on the contrary i believed in him at once and was solicitous to heal the wounds inflicted by dolbys too frank incredulity therefore i did everything i could think of to cheer him up and entertain him and make him feel at home and comfortable i spun many yarns among others the tale of jim wolf and the cats learning that he had done something in a small way in literature i offered to try to find a market for him in that line his face lighted joyfully at that and he said that if i could only sell a small manuscript to tom hoods annual for him it would be the happiest event of his sad life and he would hold me in grateful remembrance always that was a most pleasant night for three of us but dolby was disgusted and sarcastic next week the baby died meantime i had spoken to tom hood and gained his sympathy the young man had sent his manuscript to him and the very day the child died the money for the ms came three guineas the young man came with a poor little strip of crape around his arm and thanked me and said that nothing could have been more timely than that money and that his poor little wife was grateful beyond words for the service i had rendered he wept and in fact stoddard and i wept with him which was but natural also dolby wept at least he wiped his eyes and wrung out his handkerchief and sobbed stertorously and made other exaggerated shows of grief stoddard and i were ashamed of dolby and tried to make the young man understand that he meant no harm it was only his way the young man said sadly that he was not minding it his grief was too deep for other hurts that he was only thinking of the funeral and the heavy expenses which we cut that short and told him not to trouble about it leave it all to us send the bills to mr dolby and yes said dolby with a mock tremor in his voice send them to me and i will pay them what are you going you must not go alone in your worn and broken condition mr stoddard and i will go with you come stoddard we will comfort the bereaved mamma and get a lock of the babys hair it was shocking we were ashamed of him again and said so but he was not disturbed he said oh i know this kind the woods are full of them ill make this offer if he will show me his family i will give him twenty pounds come the young man said he would not remain to be insulted and he said goodnight and took his hat but dolby said he would go with him and stay by him until he found the family stoddard went along to soothe the young man and modify dolby they drove across the river and all over southwark but did not find the family at last the young man confessed there wasnt any the thing he sold to tom hoods annual was jim and the cats and he did not put my name to it so that small tale was sold three times i am selling it again now it is one of the best properties i have come across mark twain to be continued footnotes the colored butler see adventures of huckleberry finn used in huck finn i think used in tom sawyer north american review no dcxv may chapters from my autobiography xviii by mark twain dictated december i wish to insert here some pages of susys biography of me in which the biographer does not scatter according to her custom but sticks pretty steadily to a single subject until she has fought it to a finish feb last summer while we were in elmira an article came out in the christian union by name what ought he to have done treating of the government of children or rather giving an account of a fathers battle with his little baby boy by the mother of the child and put in the form of a question as to whether the father disciplined the child corectly or not different people wrote their opinions of the fathers behavior and told what they thought he should have done mamma had long known how to disciplin children for in fact the bringing up of children had been one of her specialties for many years she had a great many theories but one of them was that if a child was big enough to be nauty it was big enough to be whipped and here we all agreed with her i remember one morning when dr came up to the farm he had a long discussion with mamma upon the following topic mamma gave this as illustrative of one important rule for punishing a child she said we will suppose the boy has thrown a handkerchief onto the floor i tell him to pick it up he refuses i tell him again he refuses then i say you must either pick up the handkerchief or have a whipping my theory is never to make a child have a whipping and pick up the handkerchief too i say if you do not pick it up i must punish you if he doesnt he gets the whipping but i pick up the handkerchief if he does he gets no punishment i tell him to do a thing if he disobeys me he is punished for so doing but not forced to obey me afterwards when clara and i had been very nauty or were being very nauty the nurse would go and call mamma and she would appear suddenly and look at us she had a way of looking at us when she was displeased as if she could see right through us till we were ready to sink through the floor from embarasment and total absence of knowing what to say this look was usually followed with clara or susy what do you mean by this do you want to come to the bathroom with me then followed the climax for clara and i both new only too well what going to the bathroom meant but mammas first and foremost object was to make the child understand that he is being punished for his sake and because the mother so loves him that she cannot allow him to do wrong also that it is as hard for her to punish him as for him to be punished and even harder mamma never allowed herself to punish us when she was angry with us she never struck us because she was enoyed at us and felt like striking us if we had been nauty and had enoyed her so that she thought she felt or would show the least bit of temper toward us while punnishing us she always postponed the punishment until she was no more chafed by our behavior she never humored herself by striking or punishing us because or while she was the least bit enoyed with us our very worst nautinesses were punished by being taken to the bathroom and being whipped by the paper cutter but after the whipping was over mamma did not allow us to leave her until we were perfectly happy and perfectly understood why we had been whipped i never remember having felt the least bit bitterly toward mamma for punishing me i always felt i had deserved my punishment and was much happier for having received it for after mamma had punished us and shown her displeasure she showed no signs of further displeasure but acted as if we had not displeased her in any way ordinary punishments answered very well for susy she was a thinker and would reason out the purpose of them apply the lesson and achieve the reform required but it was much less easy to devise punishments that would reform clara this was because she was a philosopher who was always turning her attention to finding something good and satisfactory and entertaining in everything that came her way consequently it was sometimes pretty discouraging to the troubled mother to find that after all her pains and thought in inventing what she meant to be a severe and reformcompelling punishment the child had entirely missed the severities through her native disposition to get interest and pleasure out of them as novelties the mother in her anxiety to find a penalty that would take sharp hold and do its work effectively at last resorted with a sore heart and with a reproachful conscience to that punishment which the incorrigible criminal in the penitentiary dreads above all the other punitive miseries which the warden inflicts upon him for his good solitary confinement in the dark chamber the grieved and worried mother shut clara up in a very small clothescloset and went away and left her there for fifteen minutes it was all that the motherheart could endure then she came softly back and listened listened for the sobs but there werent any there were muffled and inarticulate sounds but they could not be construed into sobs the mother waited half an hour longer by that time she was suffering so intensely with sorrow and compassion for the little prisoner that she was not able to wait any longer for the distressed sounds which she had counted upon to inform her when there had been punishment enough and the reform accomplished she opened the closet to set the prisoner free and take her back into her loving favor and forgiveness but the result was not the one expected the captive had manufactured a fairy cavern out of the closet and friendly fairies out of the clothes hanging from the hooks and was having a most sinful and unrepentant good time and requested permission to spend the rest of the day there from susys biography of me but mammas oppinions and ideas upon the subject of bringing up children has always been more or less of a joke in our family perticularly since papas article in the christian union and i am sure clara and i have related the history of our old family papercutter our punishments and privations with rather more pride and triumph than any other sentiment because of mammas way of rearing us when the article what ought he to have done came out mamma read it and was very much interested in it and when papa heard that she had read it he went to work and secretly wrote his opinion of what the father ought to have done he told aunt susy clara and i about it but mamma was not to see it or hear any thing about it till it came out he gave it to aunt susy to read and after clara and i had gone up to get ready for bed he brought it up for us to read he told what he thought the father ought to have done by telling what mamma would have done the article was a beautiful tribute to mamma and every word in it true but still in writing about mamma he partly forgot that the article was going to be published i think and expressed himself more fully than he would do the second time he wrote it i think the article has done and will do a great deal of good and i think it would have been perfect for the family and friends enjoyment but a little bit too private to have been published as it was and papa felt so too because the very next day or a few days after he went down to new york to see if he couldnt get it back before it was published but it was too late and he had to return without it when the christian union reached the farm and papas article in it all ready and waiting to be read to mamma papa hadnt the courage to show it to her for he knew she wouldnt like it at all at first and he didnt but he might have let it go and never let her see it but finally he gave his consent to her seeing it and told clara and i we could take it to her which we did with tardiness and we all stood around mamma while she read it all wondering what she would say and think about it she was too much surprised and pleased privately too to say much at first but as we all expected publicly or rather when she remembered that this article was to be read by every one that took the christian union she was rather shocked and a little displeased clara and i had great fun the night papa gave it to us to read and then hide so mamma couldnt see it for just as we were in the midst of reading it mamma appeared papa following anxiously and asked why we were not in bed then a scuffle ensued for we told her it was a secret and tried to hide it but she chased us wherever we went till she thought it was time for us to go to bed then she surendered and left us to tuck it under claras matress a little while after the article was published letters began to come in to papa crittisizing it there were some very pleasant ones but a few very disagreable one of these the very worst mamma got hold of and read to papas great regret it was full of the most disagreble things and so very enoying to papa that he for a time felt he must do something to show the author of it his great displeasure at being so insulted but he finally decided not to because he felt the man had some cause for feeling enoyed at for papa had spoken of him he was the babys father rather slightingly in his christian union article after all this papa and mamma both wished i think they might never hear or be spoken to on the subject of the christian union article and whenever any has spoken to me and told me how much they did enjoy my fathers article in the christian union i almost laughed in their faces when i remembered what a great variety of oppinions had been expressed upon the subject of the christian union article of papas the article was written in july or august and just the other day papa received quite a bright letter from a gentleman who has read the c u article and gave his opinion of it in these words it is missing she probably put the letter between the leaves of the biography and it got lost out she threw away the hostile letters but tried to keep the pleasantest one for her book surely there has been no kindlier biographer than this one yet to a quite creditable degree she is loyal to the responsibilities of her position as historian not eulogist and honorably gives me a quiet prod now and then but how many many many she has withheld that i deserved i could prize them now there would be no acid in her words and it is loss to me that she did not set them all down oh susy you sweet little biographer you break my old heart with your gentle charities i think a great deal of her work her canvases are on their easels and her brush flies about in a carefree and random way delivering a dash here a dash there and another yonder and one might suppose that there would be no definite result on the contrary i think that an intelligent reader of her little book must find that by the time he has finished it he has somehow accumulated a pretty clear and nicely shaded idea of the several members of this family including susy herself and that the random dashes on the canvases have developed into portraits i feel that my own portrait with some of the defects fined down and others left out is here and i am sure that any who knew the mother will recognize her without difficulty and will say that the lines are drawn with a just judgment and a sure hand little creature though susy was the penetration which was born in her finds its way to the surface more than once in these pages before susy began the biography she let fall a remark now and then concerning my character which showed that she had it under observation in the record which we kept of the childrens sayings there is an instance of this she was twelve years old at the time we had established a rule that each member of the family must bring a fact to breakfast a fact drawn from a book or from any other source any fact would answer susys first contribution was in substance as follows two great exiles and former opponents in war met in ephesus scipio and hannibal scipio asked hannibal to name the greatest general the world had produced alexander and he explained why and the next greatest pyrrhus and he explained why but where do you place yourself then if i had conquered you i would place myself before the others susys grave comment was that attracted me it was just like papa he is so frank about his books so frank in admiring them she meant thursday march some months ago i commented upon a chapter of susys biography wherein she very elaborately discussed an article about the training and disciplining of children which i had published in the christian union this was twentyone years ago an article which was full of worshipful praises of mrs clemens as a mother and which little clara and susy and i had been hiding from this lovely and admirable mother because we knew she would disapprove of public and printed praises of herself at the time that i was dictating these comments several months ago i was trying to call back to my memory some of the details of that article but i was not able to do it and i wished i had a copy of the article so that i could see what there was about it which gave it such large interest for susy yesterday afternoon i elected to walk home from the luncheon at the st regis which is in th street and fifth avenue for it was a fine spring day and i hadnt had a walk for a year or two and felt the need of exercise as i walked along down fifth avenue the desire to see that christian union article came into my head again i had just reached the corner of nd street then and there was the usual jam of wagons carriages and automobiles there i stopped to let it thin out before trying to cross the street but a stranger who didnt require as much room as i do came racing by and darted into a crack among the vehicles and made the crossing but on his way past me he thrust a couple of ancient newspaper clippings into my hand and said there you dont know me but i have saved them in my scrapbook for twenty years and it occurred to me this morning that perhaps you would like to see them so i was carrying them downtown to mail them i not expecting to run across you in this accidental way of course but i will give them into your own hands now goodby and he disappeared among the wagons those scraps which he had put into my hand were ancient newspaper copies of that christian union article it is a handsome instance of mental telegraphy or if it isnt that it is a handsome case of coincidence from the biography march th mr laurence barrette and mr and mrs hutton were here a little while ago and we had a very interesting visit from them papa said mr barette never had acted so well before when he had seen him as he did the first night he was staying with us and mrs said she never had seen an actor on the stage whom she more wanted to speak with papa has been very much interested of late in the mind cure theory and in fact so have we all a young lady in town has worked wonders by using the mind cure upon people she is constantly busy now curing peoples deseases in this way and curing her own even which to me seems the most remarkable of all a little while past papa was delighted with the knowledge of what he thought the best way of curing a cold which was by starving it this starving did work beautifully and freed him from a great many severe colds now he says it wasnt the starving that helped his colds but the trust in the starving the mind cure connected with the starving i shouldnt wonder if we finally became firm believers in mind cure the next time papa has a cold i havent a doubt he will send for miss h the young lady who is doctoring in the mind cure theory to cure him of it mamma was over at mrs george warners to lunch the other day and miss h was there too mamma asked if anything as natural as near sightedness could be cured she said oh yes just as well as other deseases when mamma came home she took me into her room and told me that perhaps my nearsightedness could be cured by the mind cure and that she was going to have me try the treatment any way there could be no harm in it and there might be great good if her plan succeeds there certainly will be a great deal in mind cure to my oppinion for i am very near sighted and so is mamma and i never expected there could be any more cure for it than for blindness but now i dont know but what theres a cure for that it was a disappointment her nearsightedness remained with her to the end she was born with it no doubt yet strangely enough she must have been four years old and possibly five before we knew of its existence it is not easy to understand how that could have happened i discovered the defect by accident i was halfway up the hall stairs one day at home and was leading her by the hand when i glanced back through the open door of the diningroom and saw what i thought she would recognise as a pretty picture it was stray kit the slender the graceful the sociable the beautiful the incomparable the cat of cats the tortoiseshell curled up as round as a wheel and sound asleep on the firered cover of the diningtable with a brilliant stream of sunlight falling across her i exclaimed about it but susy said she could see nothing there neither cat nor tablecloth the distance was so slight not more than twenty feet perhaps that if it had been any other child i should not have credited the statement from the biography march th clara sprained her ankle a little while ago by running into a tree when coasting and while she was unable to walk with it she played solotaire with cards a great deal while clara was sick and papa saw her play solotaire so much he got very much interested in the game and finally began to play it himself a little then jean took it up and at last mamma even played it ocasionally jeans and papas love for it rapidly increased and now jean brings the cards every night to the table and papa and mamma help her play and before dinner is at an end papa has gotten a separate pack of cards and is playing alone with great interest mamma and clara next are made subject to the contagious solatair and there are four solotaireans at the table while you hear nothing but fill up the place etc it is dreadful after supper clara goes into the library and gets a little red mahogany table and placing it under the gas fixture seats herself and begins to play again then papa follows with another table of the same discription and they play solatair till bedtime we have just had our prince and pauper pictures taken two groups and some little single ones the groups the interview and lady jane grey scene were pretty good the lady jane scene was perfect just as pretty as it could be the interview was not so good and two of the little single pictures were very good indeed but one was very bad yet on the whole we think they were a success papa has done a great deal in his life i think that is good and very remarkable but i think if he had had the advantages with which he could have developed the gifts which he has made no use of in writing his books or in any other way for other peoples pleasure and benefit outside of his own family and intimate friends he could have done more than he has and a great deal more even he is known to the public as a humorist but he has much more in him that is earnest than that is humorous he has a keen sense of the ludicrous notices funny stories and incidents knows how to tell them to improve upon them and does not forget them he has been through a great many of the funny adventures related in tom sawyer and in huckleberry finn himself and he lived among just such boys and in just such villages all the days of his early life his prince and pauper is his most orriginal and best production it shows the most of any of his books what kind of pictures are in his mind usually not that the pictures of england in the th century and the adventures of a little prince and pauper are the kind of things he mainly thinks about but that that book and those pictures represent the train of thought and imagination he would be likely to be thinking of today tomorrow or next day more nearly than those given in tom sawyer or huckleberry finn papa can make exceedingly bright jokes and he enjoys funny things and when he is with people he jokes and laughs a great deal but still he is more interested in earnest books and earnest subjects to talk upon than in humorous ones when we are all alone at home nine times out of ten he talks about some very earnest subjects with an ocasional joke thrown in and he a good deal more often talks upon such subjects than upon the other kind he is as much of a pholosopher as anything i think i think he could have done a great deal in this direction if he had studied while young for he seems to enjoy reasoning out things no matter what in a great many such directions he has greater ability than in the gifts which have made him famous thus at fourteen she had made up her mind about me and in no timorous or uncertain terms had set down her reasons for her opinion fifteen years were to pass before any other critic except mr howells i think was to reutter that daring opinion and print it right or wrong it was a brave position for that little analyser to take she never withdrew it afterward nor modified it she has spoken of herself as lacking physical courage and has evinced her admiration of claras but she had moral courage which is the rarest of human qualities and she kept it functionable by exercising it i think that in questions of morals and politics she was usually on my side but when she was not she had her reasons and maintained her ground two years after she passed out of my life i wrote a philosophy of the three persons who have seen the manuscript only one understood it and all three condemned it if she could have read it she also would have condemned it possibly probably in fact but she would have understood it it would have had no difficulties for her on that score also she would have found a tireless pleasure in analyzing and discussing its problems mark twain to be continued footnotes it is so yet m t she has said it well and correctly humor is a subject which has never had much interest for me this is why i have never examined it nor written about it nor used it as a topic for a speech a hundred times it has been offered me as a topic in these past forty years but in no case has it attracted me m t north american review no dcxvi june chapters from my autobiography xix by mark twain from susys biography of me march the other day was my birthday and i had a little birthday party in the evening and papa acted some very funny charades with mr gherhardt mr jesse grant who had come up from new york and was spending the evening with us and mr frank warner one of them was on his knees honyssneeze there were a good many other funny ones all of which i dont remember mr grant was very pleasant and began playing the charades in the most delightful way susys spelling has defeated me this time i cannot make out what honyssneeze stands for impromptu charades were almost a nightly pastime of ours from the childrens earliest days they played in them with me when they were only five or six years old as they increased in years and practice their love for the sport almost amounted to a passion and they acted their parts with a steadily increasing ability at first they required much drilling but later they were generally ready as soon as the parts were assigned and they acted them according to their own devices their stage facility and absence of constraint and selfconsciousness in the prince and pauper was a result of their charading practice at ten and twelve susy wrote plays and she and daisy warner and clara played them in the library or upstairs in the schoolroom with only themselves and the servants for audience they were of a tragic and tremendous sort and were performed with great energy and earnestness they were dramatized freely from english history and in them mary queen of scots and elizabeth had few holidays the clothes were borrowed from the mothers wardrobe and the gowns were longer than necessary but that was not regarded as a defect in one of these plays jean three years old perhaps was sir francis bacon she was not dressed for the part and did not have to say anything but sat silent and decorous at a tiny table and was kept busy signing deathwarrants it was a really important office for few entered those plays and got out of them alive march mamma and papa have been in new york for two or three days and miss corey has been staying with us they are coming home today at two oclock papa has just begun to play chess and he is very fond of it so he has engaged to play with mrs charles warner every morning from to he came down to supper last night full of this pleasant prospect but evidently with something on his mind finally he said to mamma in an appologetical tone susy warner and i have a plan well mamma said what now i wonder papa said that susy warner and he were going to name the chess after some of the old bible heroes and then play chess on sunday april mamma and papa clara and daisy have gone to new york to see the mikado they are coming home tonight at half past seven last winter when mr cable was lecturing with papa he wrote this letter to him just before he came to visit us dear uncle thats one nice thing about me i never bother any one to offer me a good thing twice you dont ask me to stay over sunday but then you dont ask me to leave saturday night and knowing the nobility of your nature as i do thank you ill stay till monday morning yours and the dear families george w cable december it seems a prodigious while ago two or three nights ago i dined at a friends house with a score of other men and at my side was cable actually almost an old man really almost an old man that once so young chap years old frost on his head seven grandchildren in stock and a brandnew wife to rebegin life with dictated nov ever since papa and mamma were married papa has written his books and then taken them to mamma in manuscript and she has expergated them papa read huckleberry finn to us in manuscript just before it came out and then he would leave parts of it with mamma to expergate while he went off up to the study to work and sometimes clara and i would be sitting with mamma while she was looking the manuscript over and i remember so well with what pangs of regret we used to see her turn down the leaves of the pages which meant that some delightfully dreadful part must be scratched out and i remember one part pertickularly which was perfectly fascinating it was dreadful that clara and i used to delight in and oh with what dispair we saw mamma turn down the leaf on which it was written we thought the book would be almost ruined without it but we gradually came to feel as mamma did it would be a pity to replace the vivacity and quaintness and felicity of susys innocent free spelling with the dull and petrified uniformities of the spellingbook nearly all the grimness it taken out of the expergating of my books by the subtle mollification accidentally infused into the word by susys modification of the spelling of it i remember the special case mentioned by susy and can see the group yet twothirds of it pleading for the life of the culprit sentence that was so fascinatingly dreadful and the other third of it patiently explaining why the court could not grant the prayer of the pleaders but i do not remember what the condemned phrase was it had much company and they all went to the gallows but it is possible that that specially dreadful one which gave those little people so much delight was cunningly devised and put into the book for just that function and not with any hope or expectation that it would get by the expergator alive it is possible for i had that custom susys quaint and effective spelling falls quite opportunely into todays atmosphere which is heavy with the rumblings and grumblings and mutterings of the simplified spelling reform andrew carnegie started this storm a couple of years ago by moving a simplifying of english orthography and establishing a fund for the prosecution and maintenance of the crusade he began gently he addressed a circular to some hundreds of his friends asking them to simplify the spelling of a dozen of our badly spelt words i think they were only words which end with the superfluous ugh he asked that these friends use the suggested spellings in their private correspondence by this one perceives that the beginning was sufficiently quiet and unaggressive next stage a small committee was appointed with brander matthews for managing director and spokesman it issued a list of three hundred words of average silliness as to spelling and proposed new and sane spellings for these words the president of the united states unsolicited adopted these simplified three hundred officially and ordered that they be used in the official documents of the government it was now remarked by all the educated and the thoughtful except the clergy that sheol was to pay this was most justly and comprehensively descriptive the indignant british lion rose with a roar that was heard across the atlantic and stood there on his little isle gazing redeyed out over the glooming seas snowflecked with driving spindrift and lathing his tail a most scary spectacle to see the lion was outraged because we a nation of children without any grownup people among us with no property in the language but using it merely by courtesy of its owner the english nation were trying to defile the sacredness of it by removing from it peculiarities which had been its ornament and which had made it holy and beautiful for ages in truth there is a certain sardonic propriety in preserving our orthography since ours is a mongrel language which started with a childs vocabulary of three hundred words and now consists of two hundred and twentyfive thousand the whole lot with the exception of the original and legitimate three hundred borrowed stolen smouched from every unwatched language under the sun the spelling of each individual word of the lot locating the source of the theft and preserving the memory of the revered crime why is it that i have intruded into this turmoil and manifested a desire to get our orthography purged of its asininities indeed i do not know why i should manifest any interest in the matter for at bottom i disrespect our orthography most heartily and as heartily disrespect everything that has been said by anybody in defence of it nothing professing to be a defence of our ludicrous spellings has had any basis so far as my observation goes except sentimentality in these arguments the term venerable is used instead of mouldy and hallowed instead of devilish whereas there is nothing properly venerable or antique about a language which is not yet four hundred years old and about a jumble of imbecile spellings which were grotesque in the beginning and which grow more and more grotesque with the flight of the years dictated monday november jean and papa were walking out past the barn the other day when jean saw some little newly born baby ducks she exclaimed as she perceived them i dont see why god gives us so much ducks when patrick kills them so susy is mistaken as to the origin of the ducks they were not a gift i bought them i am not finding fault with her for that would be most unfair she is remarkably accurate in her statements as a historian as a rule and it would not be just to make much of this small slip of hers besides i think it was a quite natural slip for by heredity and habit ours was a religious household and it was a common thing with us whenever anybody did a handsome thing to give the credit of it to providence without examining into the matter this may be called automatic religion in fact that is what it is it is so used to its work that it can do it without your help or even your privity out of all the facts and statistics that may be placed before it it will always get the one result since it has never been taught to seek any other it is thus the unreflecting cause of much injustice as we have seen it betrayed susy into an injustice toward me it had to be automatic for she would have been far from doing me an injustice when in her right mind it was a dear little biographer and she meant me no harm and i am not censuring her now but am only desirous of correcting in advance an erroneous impression which her words would be sure to convey to a readers mind no elaboration of this matter is necessary it is sufficient to say i provided the ducks it was in hartford the greensward sloped downhill from the house to the sluggish little river that flowed through the grounds and patrick who was fertile in good ideas had early conceived the idea of having homemade ducks for our table every morning he drove them from the stable down to the river and the children were always there to see and admire the waddling white procession they were there again at sunset to see patrick conduct the procession back to its lodgings in the stable but this was not always a gay and happy holiday show with joy in it for the witnesses no too frequently there was a tragedy connected with it and then there were tears and pain for the children there was a stranded log or two in the river and on these certain families of snappingturtles used to congregate and drowse in the sun and give thanks in their dumb way to providence for benevolence extended to them it was but another instance of misplaced credit it was the young ducks that those pious reptiles were so thankful for whereas they were my ducks i bought the ducks when a crop of young ducks not yet quite old enough for the table but approaching that age began to join the procession and paddle around in the sluggish water and give thanks not to me for that privilege the snappingturtles would suspend their songs of praise and slide off the logs and paddle along under the water and chew the feet of the young ducks presently patrick would notice that two or three of those little creatures were not moving about but were apparently at anchor and were not looking as thankful as they had been looking a short time before he early found out what that sign meant a submerged snappingturtle was taking his breakfast and silently singing his gratitude every day or two patrick would rescue and fetch up a little duck with incomplete legs to stand upon nothing left of their extremities but gnawed and bleeding stumps then the children said pitying things and wept and at dinner we finished the tragedy which the turtles had begun thus as will be seen out of season at least it was really the turtles that gave us so much ducks at my expense papa has written a new version of there is a happy land it is there is a boardinghouse far far away where they have ham and eggs three times a day oh dont those boarders yell when they hear the dinnerbell they give that landlord rats three times a day again susy has made a small error it was not i that wrote the song i heard billy rice sing it in the negro minstrel show and i brought it home and sang it with great spirit for the elevation of the household the children admired it to the limit and made me sing it with burdensome frequency to their minds it was superior to the battle hymn of the republic how many years ago that was where now is billy rice he was a joy to me and so were the other stars of the niggershow billy birch david wambold backus and a delightful dozen of their brethren who made life a pleasure to me forty years ago and later birch wambold and backus are gone years ago and with them departed to return no more forever i suppose the real niggershow the genuine niggershow the extravagant niggershow the show which to me had no peer and whose peer has not yet arrived in my experience we have the grand opera and i have witnessed and greatly enjoyed the first act of everything which wagner created but the effect on me has always been so powerful that one act was quite sufficient whenever i have witnessed two acts i have gone away physically exhausted and whenever i have ventured an entire opera the result has been the next thing to suicide but if i could have the niggershow back again in its pristine purity and perfection i should have but little further use for opera it seems to me that to the elevated mind and the sensitive spirit the handorgan and the niggershow are a standard and a summit to whose rarefied altitude the other forms of musical art may not hope to reach dictated september it is years since i have examined the childrens record i have turned over a few of its pages this morning this book is a record in which mrs clemens and i registered some of the sayings and doings of the children in the long ago when they were little chaps of course we wrote these things down at the time because they were of momentary interest things of the passing hour and of no permanent value but at this distant day i find that they still possess an interest for me and also a value because it turns out that they were registrations of character the qualities then revealed by fitful glimpses in childish acts and speeches remained as a permanency in the childrens characters in the drift of the years and were always afterwards clearly and definitely recognizable there is a masterful streak in jean that now and then moves her to set my authority aside for a moment and end a losing argument in that prompt and effective fashion and here in this old book i find evidence that she was just like that before she was quite four years old from the childrens record quarry farm july yesterday evening our cows after being inspected and worshipped by jean from the shed for an hour wandered off down into the pasture and left her bereft i thought i was going to get back home now but that was an error jean knew of some more cows in a field somewhere and took my hand and led me thitherward when we turned the corner and took the righthand road i saw that we should presently be out of range of call and sight so i began to argue against continuing the expedition and jean began to argue in favor of it she using english for light skirmishing and german for business i kept up my end with vigor and demolished her arguments in detail one after the other till i judged i had her about cornered she hesitated a moment then answered up sharply wir werden nichts mehr darсњber sprechen we wont talk any more about it it nearly took my breath away though i thought i might possibly have misunderstood i said why you little rascal was hast du gesagt but she said the same words over again and in the same decided way i suppose i ought to have been outraged but i wasnt i was charmed and i suppose i ought to have spanked her but i didnt i fraternized with the enemy and we went on and spent half an hour with the cows that incident is followed in the record by the following paragraph which is another instance of a juvenile characteristic maintaining itself into mature age susy was persistently and conscientiously truthful throughout her life with the exception of one interruption covering several months and perhaps a year this was while she was still a little child suddenly not gradually she began to lie not furtively but frankly openly and on a scale quite disproportioned to her size her mother was so stunned so nearly paralyzed for a day or two that she did not know what to do with the emergency reasonings persuasions beseechings all went for nothing they produced no effect the lying went tranquilly on other remedies were tried but they failed there is a tradition that success was finally accomplished by whipping i think the record says so but if it does it is because the record is incomplete whipping was indeed tried and was faithfully kept up during two or three weeks but the results were merely temporary the reforms achieved were discouragingly brief fortunately for susy an incident presently occurred which put a complete stop to all the mothers efforts in the direction of reform this incident was the chance discovery in darwin of a passage which said that when a child exhibits a sudden and unaccountable disposition to forsake the truth and restrict itself to lying the explanation must be sought away back in the past that an ancestor of the child had had the same disease at the same tender age that it was irremovable by persuasion or punishment and that it had ceased as suddenly and as mysteriously as it had come when it had run its appointed course i think mr darwin said that nothing was necessary but to leave the matter alone and let the malady have its way and perish by the statute of limitations we had confidence in darwin and after that day susy was relieved of our reformatory persecutions she went on lying without let or hindrance during several months or a year then the lying suddenly ceased and she became as conscientiously and exactingly truthful as she had been before the attack and she remained so to the end of her life the paragraph in the record to which i have been leading up is in my handwriting and is of a date so long posterior to the time of the lying malady that she had evidently forgotten that truthspeaking had ever had any difficulties for her mama was speaking of a servant who had been pretty unveracious but was now trying to tell the truth susy was a good deal surprised and said she shouldnt think anybody would have to try to tell the truth in the record the childrens acts and speeches quite definitely define their characters susys indicated the presence of mentality thought and they were generally marked by gravity she was timid on her physical side but had an abundance of moral courage clara was sturdy independent orderly practical persistent plucky just a little animal and very satisfactory charles dudley warner said susy was made of mind and clara of matter when motley the kitten died some one said that the thoughts of the two children need not be inquired into they could be divined that susy was wondering if this was the end of motley and had his life been worth while whereas clara was merely interested in seeing to it that there should be a creditable funeral in those days susy was a dreamer a thinker a poet and philosopher and clara well clara wasnt in afteryears a passion for music developed the latent spirituality and intellectuality in clara and her practicality took second and in fact even third place jean was from the beginning orderly steady diligent persistent and remains so she picked up languages easily and kept them susy aged eleven jean three susy said the other day when she saw jean bringing a cat to me of her own motion jean has found out already that mamma loves morals and papa loves cats it is another of susys remorselessly sound verdicts as a child jean neglected my books when she was nine years old will gillette invited her and the rest of us to a dinner at the murray hill hotel in new york in order that we might get acquainted with mrs leslie and her daughters elsie leslie was nine years old and was a great celebrity on the stage jean was astonished and awed to see that little slip of a thing sit up at table and take part in the conversation of the grown people capably and with ease and tranquillity poor jean was obliged to keep still for the subjects discussed never happened to hit her level but at last the talk fell within her limit and she had her chance to contribute to it tom sawyer was mentioned jean spoke gratefully up and said i know who wrote that book harriet beecher stowe one evening susy had prayed clara was curled up for sleep she was reminded that it was her turn to pray now she laid oh ones enough and dropped off to slumber clara five years old we were in germany the nurse rosa was not allowed to speak to the children otherwise than in german clara grew very tired of it by and by the little creatures patience was exhausted and she said aunt clara i wish god had made rosa in english clara four years old susy six this morning when clara discovered that this is my birthday she was greatly troubled because she had provided no gift for me and repeated her sorrow several times finally she went musing to the nursery and presently returned with her newest and dearest treasure a large toy horse and said you shall have this horse for your birthday papa i accepted it with many thanks after an hour she was racing up and down the room with the horse when susy said why clara you gave that horse to papa and now youve tooken it again clara i never give it to him for always i give it to him for his birthday in geneva in september i lay abed late one morning and as clara was passing through the room i took her on my bed a moment then the child went to clara spaulding and said aunt clara papa is a good deal of trouble to me is he why well he wants me to get in bed with him and i cant do that with jelmuls gentlemen i dont like jelmuls anyway what you dont like gentlemen dont you like uncle theodore crane oh yes but hes not a jelmul hes a friend mark twain to be continued footnote cable never travelled sundays north american review no dcxviii july chapters from my autobiography xx by mark twain sidenote notes on innocents abroad dictated in florence italy april i will begin with a note upon the dedication i wrote the book in the months of march and april in san francisco it was published in august three years afterward mr goodman of virginia city nevada on whose newspaper i had served ten years before came east and we were walking down broadway one day when he said how did you come to steal oliver wendell holmess dedication and put it in your book i made a careless and inconsequential answer for i supposed he was joking but he assured me that he was in earnest he said im not discussing the question of whether you stole it or didnt for that is a question that can be settled in the first bookstore we come to i am only asking you how you came to steal it for that is where my curiosity is focalized i couldnt accommodate him with this information as i hadnt it in stock i could have made oath that i had not stolen anything therefore my vanity was not hurt nor my spirit troubled at bottom i supposed that he had mistaken another book for mine and was now getting himself into an untenable place and preparing sorrow for himself and triumph for me we entered a bookstore and he asked for the innocents abroad and for the dainty little blue and gold edition of dr oliver wendell holmess poems he opened the books exposed their dedications and said read them it is plain that the author of the second one stole the first one isnt it i was very much ashamed and unspeakably astonished we continued our walk but i was not able to throw any gleam of light upon that original question of his i could not remember ever having seen dr holmess dedication i knew the poems but the dedication was new to me i did not get hold of the key to that secret until months afterward then it came in a curious way and yet it was a natural way for the natural way provided by nature and the construction of the human mind for the discovery of a forgotten event is to employ another forgotten event for its resurrection sidenote i received a letter from the rev dr rising who had been rector of the episcopal church in virginia city in my time in which letter dr rising made reference to certain things which had happened to us in the sandwich islands six years before among things he made casual mention of the honolulu hotels poverty in the matter of literature at first i did not see the bearing of the remark it called nothing to my mind but presently it did with a flash there was but one book in mr kirchhofs hotel and that was the first volume of dr holmess blue and gold series i had had a fortnights chance to get well acquainted with its contents for i had ridden around the big island hawaii on horseback and had brought back so many saddle boils that if there had been a duty on them it would have bankrupted me to pay it they kept me in my room unclothed and in persistent pain for two weeks with no company but cigars and the little volume of poems of course i read them almost constantly i read them from beginning to end then read them backwards then began in the middle and read them both ways then read them wrong end first and upside down in a word i read the book to rags and was infinitely grateful to the hand that wrote it here we have an exhibition of what repetition can do when persisted in daily and hourly over a considerable stretch of time where one is merely reading for entertainment without thought or intention of preserving in the memory that which is read it is a process which in the course of years dries all the juice out of a familiar verse of scripture leaving nothing but a sapless husk behind in that case you at least know the origin of the husk but in the case in point i apparently preserved the husk but presently forgot whence it came it lay lost in some dim corner of my memory a year or two then came forward when i needed a dedication and was promptly mistaken by me as a child of my own happy fancy i was new i was ignorant the mysteries of the human mind were a sealed book to me as yet and i stupidly looked upon myself as a tough and unforgivable criminal i wrote to dr holmes and told him the whole disgraceful affair implored him in impassioned language to believe that i had never intended to commit this crime and was unaware that i had committed it until i was confronted with the awful evidence i have lost his answer i could better have afforded to lose an uncle of these i had a surplus many of them of no real value to me but that letter was beyond price beyond uncledom and unsparable in it dr holmes laughed the kindest and healingest laugh over the whole matter and at considerable length and in happy phrase assured me that there was no crime in unconscious plagiarism that i committed it every day that he committed it every day that every man alive on the earth who writes or speaks commits it every day and not merely once or twice but every time he opens his mouth that all our phrasings are spiritualized shadows cast multitudinously from our readings that no happy phrase of ours is ever quite original with us there is nothing of our own in it except some slight change born of our temperament character environment teachings and associations that this slight change differentiates it from another mans manner of saying it stamps it with our special style and makes it our own for the time being all the rest of it being old moldy antique and smelling of the breath of a thousand generations of them that have passed it over their teeth before in the thirtyodd years which have come and gone since then i have satisfied myself that what dr holmes said was true i wish to make a note upon the preface of the innocents in the last paragraph of that brief preface i speak of the proprietors of the daily alta california having waived their rights in certain letters which i wrote for that journal while absent on the quaker city trip i was young then i am whiteheaded now but the insult of that word rankles yet now that i am reading that paragraph for the first time in many years reading it for the first time since it was written perhaps there were rights it is true such rights as the strong are able to acquire over the weak and the absent early in george barnes invited me to resign my reportership on his paper the san francisco morning call and for some months thereafter i was without money or work then i had a pleasant turn of fortune the proprietors of the sacramento union a great and influential daily journal sent me to the sandwich islands to write four letters a month at twenty dollars apiece i was there four or five months and returned to find myself about the best known honest man on the pacific coast thomas mcguire proprietor of several theatres said that now was the time to make my fortune strike while the iron was hot break into the lecture field i did it i announced a lecture on the sandwich islands closing the advertisement with the remark admission one dollar doors open at halfpast the trouble begins at a true prophecy the trouble certainly did begin at when i found myself in front of the only audience i had ever faced for the fright which pervaded me from head to foot was paralyzing it lasted two minutes and was as bitter as death the memory of it is indestructible but it had its compensations for it made me immune from timidity before audiences for all time to come i lectured in all the principal californian towns and in nevada then lectured once or twice more in san francisco then retired from the field rich for me and laid out a plan to sail westward from san francisco and go around the world the proprietors of the alta engaged me to write an account of the trip for that paper fifty letters of a column and a half each which would be about two thousand words per letter and the pay to be twenty dollars per letter i went east to st louis to say goodbye to my mother and then i was bitten by the prospectus of captain duncan of the quaker city excursion and i ended by joining it during the trip i wrote and sent the fifty letters six of them miscarried and i wrote six new ones to complete my contract then i put together a lecture on the trip and delivered it in san francisco at great and satisfactory pecuniary profit then i branched out into the country and was aghast at the result i had been entirely forgotten i never had people enough in my houses to sit as a jury of inquest on my lost reputation i inquired into this curious condition of things and found that the thrifty owners of that prodigiously rich alta newspaper had copyrighted all those poor little twentydollar letters and had threatened with prosecution any journal which should venture to copy a paragraph from them and there i was i had contracted to furnish a large book concerning the excursion to the american publishing co of hartford and i supposed i should need all those letters to fill it out with i was in an uncomfortable situation that is if the proprietors of this stealthily acquired copyright should refuse to let me use the letters that is just what they did mr mac something i have forgotten the rest of his name said his firm were going to make a book out of the letters in order to get back the thousand dollars which they had paid for them i said that if they had acted fairly and honorably and had allowed the country press to use the letters or portions of them my lectureskirmish on the coast would have paid me ten thousand dollars whereas the alta had lost me that amount then he offered a compromise he would publish the book and allow me ten per cent royalty on it the compromise did not appeal to me and i said so i was now quite unknown outside of san francisco the books sale would be confined to that city and my royalty would not pay me enough to board me three months whereas my eastern contract if carried out could be profitable to me for i had a sort of reputation on the atlantic seaboard acquired through the publication of six excursionletters in the new york tribune and one or two in the herald in the end mr mac agreed to suppress his book on certain conditions in my preface i must thank the alta for waiving rights and granting me permission i objected to the thanks i could not with any large degree of sincerity thank the alta for bankrupting my lectureraid after considerable debate my point was conceded and the thanks left out sidenote sidenote sidenote noah brooks was the editor of the alta at the time a man of sterling character and equipped with a right heart also a good historian where facts were not essential in biographical sketches of me written many years afterward he was quite eloquent in praises of the generosity of the alta people in giving to me without compensation a book which as history had afterward shown was worth a fortune after all the fuss i did not levy heavily upon the alta letters i found that they were newspaper matter not book matter they had been written here and there and yonder as opportunity had given me a chance workingmoment or two during our feverish flight around about europe or in the furnaceheat of my stateroom on board the quaker city therefore they were loosely constructed and needed to have some of the wind and water squeezed out of them i used several of them ten or twelve perhaps i wrote the rest of the innocents abroad in sixty days and i could have added a fortnights labor with the pen and gotten along without the letters altogether i was very young in those days exceedingly young marvellously young younger than i am now younger than i shall ever be again by hundreds of years i worked every night from eleven or twelve until broad day in the morning and as i did two hundred thousand words in the sixty days the average was more than three thousand words a day nothing for sir walter scott nothing for louis stevenson nothing for plenty of other people but quite handsome for me in when we were living in tedworth square london and i was writing the book called following the equator my average was eighteen hundred words a day here in florence my average seems to be fourteen hundred words per sitting of four or five hours i was deducing from the above that i have been slowing down steadily in these thirtysix years but i perceive that my statistics have a defect three thousand words in the spring of when i was working seven or eight or nine hours at a sitting has little or no advantage over the sitting of today covering half the time and producing half the output figures often beguile me particularly when i have the arranging of them myself in which case the remark attributed to disraeli would often apply with justice and force there are three kinds of lies lies damned lies and statistics dictated january the proverb says that providence protects children and idiots this is really true i know it because i have tested it it did not protect george through the most of his campaign but it saved him in his last inning and the veracity of the proverb stood confirmed sidenote i have several times been saved by this mysterious interposition when i was manifestly in extreme peril it has been common all my life for smart people to perceive in me an easy prey for selfish designs and i have walked without suspicion into the trap set for me yet have often come out unscathed against all the likelihoods more than forty years ago in san francisco the office staff adjourned upon conclusion of its work at two oclock in the morning to a great bowling establishment where there were twelve alleys i was invited rather perfunctorily and as a matter of etiquette by which i mean that i was invited politely but not urgently but when i diffidently declined with thanks and explained that i knew nothing about the game those lively young fellows became at once eager and anxious and urgent to have my society this flattered me for i perceived no trap and i innocently and gratefully accepted their invitation i was given an alley all to myself the boys explained the game to me and they also explained to me that there would be an hours play and that the player who scored the fewest tenstrikes in the hour would have to provide oysters and beer for the combination this disturbed me very seriously since it promised me bankruptcy and i was sorry that this detail had been overlooked in the beginning but my pride would not allow me to back out now so i stayed in and did what i could to look satisfied and glad i had come it is not likely that i looked as contented as i wanted to but the others looked glad enough to make up for it for they were quite unable to hide their evil joy they showed me how to stand and how to stoop and how to aim the ball and how to let fly and then the game began the results were astonishing in my ignorance i delivered the balls in apparently every way except the right one but no matter during half an hour i never started a ball down the alley that didnt score a tenstrike every time at the other end the others lost their grip early and their joy along with it now and then one of them got a tenstrike but the occurrence was so rare that it made no show alongside of my giant score the boys surrendered at the end of the halfhour and put on their coats and gathered around me and in courteous but sufficiently definite language expressed their opinion of an experienceworn and seasoned expert who would stoop to lying and deception in order to rob kind and wellmeaning friends who had put their trust in him under the delusion that he was an honest and honorable person i was not able to convince them that i had not lied for now my character was gone and they refused to attach any value to anything i said the proprietor of the place stood by for a while saying nothing then he came to my defence he said it looks like a mystery gentlemen but it isnt a mystery after its explained that is a grooved alley youve only to start a ball down it any way you please and the groove will do the rest it will slam the ball against the northeast curve of the head pin every time and nothing can save the ten from going down it was true the boys made the experiment and they found that there was no art that could send a ball down that alley and fail to score a tenstrike with it when i had told those boys that i knew nothing about that game i was speaking only the truth but it was ever thus all through my life whenever i have diverged from custom and principle and uttered a truth the rule has been that the hearer hadnt strength of mind enough to believe it sidenote a quarter of a century ago i arrived in london to lecture a few weeks under the management of george dolby who had conducted the dickens readings in america five or six years before he took me to the albemarle and fed me and in the course of the dinner he enlarged a good deal and with great satisfaction upon his reputation as a player of fifteenball pool and when he learned by my testimony that i had never seen the game played and knew nothing of the art of pocketing balls he enlarged more and more and still more and kept on enlarging until i recognized that i was either in the presence of the very father of fifteenball pool or in the presence of his most immediate descendant at the end of the dinner dolby was eager to introduce me to the game and show me what he could do we adjourned to the billiardroom and he framed the balls in a flat pyramid and told me to fire at the apex ball and then go on and do what i could toward pocketing the fifteen after which he would take the cue and show me what a pastmaster of the game could do with those balls i did as required i began with the diffidence proper to my ignorant estate and when i had finished my inning all the balls were in the pockets and dolby was burying me under a volcanic irruption of acid sarcasms so i was a liar in dolbys belief he thought he had been sold and at a cheap rate but he divided his sarcasms quite fairly and quite equally between the two of us he was full of ironical admiration of his childishness and innocence in letting a wandering and characterless and scandalous american load him up with deceptions of so transparent a character that they ought not to have deceived the house cat on the other hand he was remorselessly severe upon me for beguiling him by studied and discreditable artifice into bragging and boasting about his poor game in the presence of a professional expert disguised in lies and frauds who could empty more balls in billiard pockets in an hour than he could empty into a basket in a day in the matter of fifteenball pool i never got dolbys confidence wholly back though i got it in other ways and kept it until his death i have played that game a number of times since but that first time was the only time in my life that i have ever pocketed all the fifteen in a single inning sidenote my unsuspicious nature has made it necessary for providence to save me from traps a number of times thirty years ago a couple of elmira bankers invited me to play the game of quaker with them i had never heard of the game before and said that if it required intellect i should not be able to entertain them but they said it was merely a game of chance and required no mentality so i agreed to make a trial of it they appointed four in the afternoon for the sacrifice as the place they chose a groundfloor room with a large window in it then they went treacherously around and advertised the sell which they were going to play upon me i arrived on time and we began the game with a large and eager freelist to superintend it these superintendents were outside with their noses pressed against the windowpane the bankers described the game to me so far as i recollect the pattern of it was this they had a pile of mexican dollars on the table twelve of them were of even date fifty of them were of odd dates the bankers were to separate a coin from the pile and hide it under a hand and i must guess odd or even if i guessed correctly the coin would be mine if incorrectly i lost a dollar the first guess i made was even and was right i guessed again even and took the money they fed me another one and i guessed even again and took the money i guessed even the fourth time and took the money it seemed to me that even was a good guess and i might as well stay by it which i did i guessed even twelve times and took the twelve dollars i was doing as they secretly desired their experience of human nature had convinced them that any human being as innocent as my face proclaimed me to be would repeat his first guess if it won and would go on repeating it if it should continue to win it was their belief that an innocent would be almost sure at the beginning to guess even and not odd and that if an innocent should guess even twelve times in succession and win every time he would go on guessing even to the end so it was their purpose to let me win those twelve even dates and then advance the odd dates one by one until i should lose fifty dollars and furnish those superintendents something to laugh about for a week to come but it did not come out in that way for by the time i had won the twelfth dollar and last even date i withdrew from the game because it was so onesided that it was monotonous and did not entertain me there was a burst of laughter from the superintendents at the window when i came out of the place but i did not know what they were laughing at nor whom they were laughing at and it was a matter of no interest to me anyway through that incident i acquired an enviable reputation for smartness and penetration but it was not my due for i had not penetrated anything that the cow could not have penetrated mark twain to be continued footnote with the pen i mean this autobiography is dictated not written north american review no dcxx august chapters from my autobiography xxi by mark twain from susys biography of me feb mamma and i have both been very much troubled of late because papa since he has been publishing gen grants book has seemed to forget his own books and work entirely and the other evening as papa and i were promonading up and down the library he told me that he didnt expect to write but one more book and then he was ready to give up work altogether die or do anything he said that he had written more than he had ever expected to and the only book that he had been pertickularly anxious to write was one locked up in the safe down stairs not yet published but this intended future of course will never do and although papa usually holds to his own opinions and intents with outsiders when mamma realy desires anything and says that it must be papa allways gives up his plans at least so far and does as she says is right and she is usually right if she dissagrees with him at all it was because he knew his great tendency to being convinced by her that he published without her knowledge that article in the christian union concerning the government of children so judging by the proofs of past years i think that we will be able to persuade papa to go back to work as before and not leave off writing with the end of his next story mamma says that she sometimes feels and i do too that she would rather have papa depend on his writing for a living than to have him think of giving it up dictated november i have a defect of a sort which i think is not common certainly i hope it isnt it is rare that i can call before my minds eye the form and face of either friend or enemy if i should make a list now of persons whom i know in america and abroad say to the number of even an entire thousand it is quite unlikely that i could reproduce five of them in my minds eye of my dearest and most intimate friends i could name eight whom i have seen and talked with four days ago but when i try to call them before me they are formless shadows jean has been absent this past eight or ten days in the country and i wish i could reproduce her in the mirror of my mind but i cant do it it may be that this defect is not constitutional but a result of lifelong absence of mind and indolent and inadequate observation once or twice in my life it has been an embarrassment to me twenty years ago in the days of susys biography of me there was a dispute one morning at the breakfasttable about the color of a neighbors eyes i was asked for a verdict but had to confess that if that valued neighbor and old friend had eyes i was not sure that i had ever seen them it was then mockingly suggested that perhaps i didnt even know the color of the eyes of my own family and i was required to shut my own at once and testify i was able to name the color of mrs clemenss eyes but was not able to even suggest a color for jeans or claras or susys all this talk is suggested by susys remark the other evening as papa and i were promenading up and down the library down to the bottom of my heart i am thankful that i can see that picture and it is not dim but stands out clear in the unfaded light of twentyone years ago in those days susy and i used to promonade daily up and down the library with our arms about each others waists and deal in intimate communion concerning affairs of state or the deep questions of human life or our small personal affairs it was quite natural that i should think i had written myself out when i was only fifty years old for everybody who has ever written has been smitten with that superstition at about that age not even yet have i really written myself out i have merely stopped writing because dictating is pleasanter work and because dictating has given me a strong aversion to the pen and because two hours of talking per day is enough and because but i am only damaging my mind with this digging around in it for pretexts where no pretext is needed and where the simple truth is for this one time better than any invention in this small emergency i shall never finish my five or six unfinished books for the reason that by forty years of slavery to the pen i have earned my freedom i detest the pen and i wouldnt use it again to sign the death warrant of my dearest enemy dictated march for thirty years i have received an average of a dozen letters a year from strangers who remember me or whose fathers remember me as boy and young man but these letters are almost always disappointing i have not known these strangers nor their fathers i have not heard of the names they mention the reminiscences to which they call attention have had no part in my experience all of which means that these strangers have been mistaking me for somebody else but at last i have the refreshment this morning of a letter from a man who deals in names that were familiar to me in my boyhood the writer encloses a newspaper clipping which has been wandering through the press for four or five weeks and he wants to know if capt tonkray lately deceased was as stated in the clipping the original of huckleberry finn i have replied that huckleberry finn was frank f as this inquirer evidently knew the hannibal of the forties he will easily recall frank franks father was at one time town drunkard an exceedingly welldefined and unofficial office of those days he succeeded general gaines and for a time he was sole and only incumbent of the office but afterward jimmy finn proved competency and disputed the place with him so we had two town drunkards at one time and it made as much trouble in that village as christendom experienced in the fourteenth century when there were two popes at the same time in huckleberry finn i have drawn frank exactly as he was he was ignorant unwashed insufficiently fed but he had as good a heart as ever any boy had his liberties were totally unrestricted he was the only really independent person boy or man in the community and by consequence he was tranquilly and continuously happy and was envied by all the rest of us we liked him we enjoyed his society and as his society was forbidden us by our parents the prohibition trebled and quadrupled its value and therefore we sought and got more of his society than of any other boys i heard four years ago that he was justice of the peace in a remote village in the state of and was a good citizen and was greatly respected during jimmy finns term he jimmy was not exclusive he was not finical he was not hypercritical he was largely and handsomely democratic and slept in the deserted tanyard with the hogs my father tried to reform him once but did not succeed my father was not a professional reformer in him the spirit of reform was spasmodic it only broke out now and then with considerable intervals between once he tried to reform injun joe that also was a failure it was a failure and we boys were glad for injun joe drunk was interesting and a benefaction to us but injun joe sober was a dreary spectacle we watched my fathers experiments upon him with a good deal of anxiety but it came out all right and we were satisfied injun joe got drunk oftener than before and became intolerably interesting i think that in tom sawyer i starved injun joe to death in the cave but that may have been to meet the exigencies of romantic literature i cant remember now whether the real injun joe died in the cave or out of it but i do remember that the news of his death reached me at a most unhappy time that is to say just at bedtime on a summer night when a prodigious storm of thunder and lightning accompanied by a deluging rain that turned the streets and lanes into rivers caused me to repent and resolve to lead a better life i can remember those awful thunderbursts and the white glare of the lightning yet and the wild lashing of the rain against the windowpanes by my teachings i perfectly well knew what all that wild riot was for satan had come to get injun joe i had no shadow of doubt about it it was the proper thing when a person like injun joe was required in the under world and i should have thought it strange and unaccountable if satan had come for him in a less impressive way with every glare of lightning i shrivelled and shrunk together in mortal terror and in the interval of black darkness that followed i poured out my lamentings over my lost condition and my supplications for just one more chance with an energy and feeling and sincerity quite foreign to my nature but in the morning i saw that it was a false alarm and concluded to resume business at the old stand and wait for another reminder the axiom says history repeats itself a week or two ago mr blankblank dined with us at dinner he mentioned a circumstance which flashed me back over about sixty years and landed me in that little bedroom on that tempestuous night and brought to my mind how creditable to me was my conduct through the whole night and how barren it was of moral spot or fleck during that entire period he said mr x was sexton or something of the episcopal church in his town and had been for many years the competent superintendent of all the churchs worldly affairs and was regarded by the whole congregation as a stay a blessing a priceless treasure but he had a couple of defects not large defects but they seemed large when flung against the background of his profoundly religious character he drank a good deal and he could outswear a brakeman a movement arose to persuade him to lay aside these vices and after consulting with his pal who occupied the same position as himself in the other episcopal church and whose defects were duplicates of his own and had inspired regret in the congregation he was serving they concluded to try for reform not wholesale but half at a time they took the liquor pledge and waited for results during nine days the results were entirely satisfactory and they were recipients of many compliments and much congratulation then on newyears eve they had business a mile and a half out of town just beyond the state line everything went well with them that evening in the barroom of the inn but at last the celebration of the occasion by those villagers came to be of a burdensome nature it was a bitter cold night and the multitudinous hot toddies that were circulating began by and by to exert a powerful influence upon the new prohibitionists at last xs friend remarked x does it occur to you that we are outside the diocese that ended reform no then they took a chance in reform no for a while that one prospered and they got much applause i now reach the incident which sent me back a matter of sixty years as i have remarked a while ago one morning mr blankblank met x on the street and said you have made a gallant struggle against those defects of yours i am aware that you failed on no but i am also aware that you are having better luck with no yes x said no is all right and sound up to date and we are full of hope blankblank said x of course you have your troubles like other people but they never show on the outside i have never seen you when you were not cheerful are you always cheerful really always cheerful well no he said no i cant say that i am always cheerful but well you know that kind of a night that comes say you wake up way in the night and the whole world is sunk in gloom and there are storms and earthquakes and all sorts of disasters in the air threatening and you get cold and clammy and when that happens to me i recognize how sinful i am and it all goes clear to my heart and wrings it and i have such terrors and terrors oh they are indescribable those terrors that assail me and i slip out of bed and get on my knees and pray and pray and promise that i will be good if i can only have another chance and then you know in the morning the sun shines out so lovely and the birds sing and the whole world is so beautiful and b god i rally now i will quote a brief paragraph from this letter which i have a minute ago spoken of the writer says you no doubt are at a loss to know who i am i will tell you in my younger days i was a resident of hannibal mo and you and i were schoolmates attending mr dawsons school along with sam and will bowen and andy fuqua and others whose names i have forgotten i was then about the smallest boy in school for my age and they called me little aleck for short i only dimly remember him but i knew those other people as well as i knew the town drunkards i remember dawsons schoolhouse perfectly if i wanted to describe it i could save myself the trouble by conveying the description of it to these pages from tom sawyer i can remember the drowsy and inviting summer sounds that used to float in through the open windows from that distant boyparadise cardiff hill hollidays hill and mingle with the murmurs of the studying pupils and make them the more dreary by the contrast i remember andy fuqua the oldest pupil a man of twentyfive i remember the youngest pupil nannie owsley a child of seven i remember george robards eighteen or twenty years old the only pupil who studied latin i remember in some cases vividly in others vaguely the rest of the twentyfive boys and girls i remember mr dawson very well i remember his boy theodore who was as good as he could be in fact he was inordinately good extravagantly good offensively good detestably good and he had popeyes and i would have drowned him if i had had a chance in that school we were all about on an equality and so far as i remember the passion of envy had no place in our hearts except in the case of arch fuqua the other ones brother of course we all went barefoot in the summertime arch fuqua was about my own age ten or eleven in the winter we could stand him because he wore shoes then and his great gift was hidden from our sight and we were enabled to forget it but in the summertime he was a bitterness to us he was our envy for he could double back his big toe and let it fly and you could hear it snap thirty yards there was not another boy in the school that could approach this feat he had not a rival as regards a physical distinction except in theodore eddy who could work his ears like a horse but he was no real rival because you couldnt hear him work his ears so all the advantage lay with arch fuqua i am not done with dawsons school i will return to it in a later chapter dictated at hamilton bermuda january that reminds me in conversation we are always using that phrase and seldom or never noticing how large a significance it bears it stands for a curious and interesting fact to wit that sleeping or waking dreaming or talking the thoughts which swarm through our heads are almost constantly almost continuously accompanied by a like swarm of reminders of incidents and episodes of our past a man can never know what a large traffic this commerce of association carries on in our minds until he sets out to write his autobiography he then finds that a thought is seldom born to him that does not immediately remind him of some event large or small in his past experience quite naturally these remarks remind me of various things among others this that sometimes a thought by the power of association will bring back to your mind a lost word or a lost name which you have not been able to recover by any other process known to your mental equipment yesterday we had an instance of this rev joseph h twichell is with me on this flying trip to bermuda he was with me on my last visit to bermuda and today we were trying to remember when it was we thought it was somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty years ago but that was as near as we could get at the date twichell said that the landlady in whose boardinghouse we sojourned in that ancient time could doubtless furnish us the date and we must look her up we wanted to see her anyway because she and her blooming daughter of eighteen were the only persons whose acquaintance we had made at that time for we were travelling under fictitious names and people who wear aliases are not given to seeking society and bringing themselves under suspicion but at this point in our talk we encountered an obstruction we could not recall the landladys name we hunted all around through our minds for that name using all the customary methods of research but without success the name was gone from us apparently permanently we finally gave the matter up and fell to talking about something else the talk wandered from one subject to another and finally arrived at twichells schooldays in hartford the hartford of something more than half a century ago and he mentioned several of his schoolmasters dwelling with special interest upon the peculiarities of an aged one named olney he remarked that olney humble village schoolmaster as he was was yet a man of superior parts and had published textbooks which had enjoyed a wide currency in america in their day i said i remembered those books and had studied olneys geography in school when i was a boy then twichell said that reminds me our landladys name was a name that was associated with schoolbooks of some kind or other fifty or sixty years ago i wonder what it was i believe it began with k association did the rest and did it instantly i said kirkhams grammar that settled it kirkham was the name and we went out to seek for the owner of it there was no trouble about that for bermuda is not large and is like the earlier garden of eden in that everybody in it knows everybody else just as it was in the serpents headquarters in adams time we easily found miss kirkham she that had been the blooming girl of a generation before and she was still keeping boarders but her mother had passed from this life she settled the date for us and did it with certainty by help of a couple of uncommon circumstances events of that ancient time she said we had sailed from bermuda on the th of may which was the day on which her only nephew was born and he is now thirty years of age the other unusual circumstance she called it an unusual circumstance and i didnt say anything was that on that day the rev mr twichell bearing the assumed name of peters had made a statement to her which she regarded as a fiction i remembered the circumstance very well we had bidden the young girl goodby and had gone fifty yards perhaps when twichell said he had forgotten something i doubted it and must go back when he rejoined me he was silent and this alarmed me because i had not seen an example of it before he seemed quite uncomfortable and i asked him what the trouble was he said he had been inspired to give the girl a pleasant surprise and so had gone back and said to her that young fellows name is not wilkinson thats mark twain she did not lose her mind she did not exhibit any excitement at all but said quite simply quite tranquilly tell it to the marines mr peters if that should happen to be your name it was very pleasant to meet her again we were whiteheaded but she was not in the sweet and unvexed spiritual atmosphere of the bermudas one does not achieve gray hairs at fortyeight i had a dream last night and of course it was born of association like nearly everything else that drifts into a persons head asleep or awake on board ship on the passage down twichell was talking about the swiftly developing possibilities of aerial navigation and he quoted those striking verses of tennysons which forecast a future when airborne vessels of war shall meet and fight above the clouds and redden the earth below with a rain of blood this picture of carnage and blood and death reminded me of something which i had read a fortnight ago statistics of railway accidents compiled by the united states government wherein the appalling fact was set forth that on our miles of railway we annually kill persons outright and injure the warships in the air suggested the railway horrors and three nights afterward the railway horrors suggested my dream the work of association was going on in my head unconsciously all that time it was an admirable dream what there was of it in it i saw a funeral procession i saw it from a mountain peak i saw it crawling along and curving here and there serpentlike through a level vast plain i seemed to see a hundred miles of the procession but neither the beginning of it nor the end of it was within the limits of my vision the procession was in ten divisions each division marked by a sombre flag and the whole represented ten years of our railway activities in the accident line each division was composed of cripples and was bearing its own years mutilated corpses to the grave in the aggregate cripples and dead drenched in blood mark twain to be continued footnote it isnt yet title of it captain stormfields visit to heaven s l c chapters from my autobiography xxii by mark twain sidenote dictated october susy has named a number of the friends who were assembled at onteora at the time of our visit but there were others among them laurence hutton charles dudley warner and carroll beckwith and their wives it was a bright and jolly company some of those choice spirits are still with us the others have passed from this life mrs clemens susy mr warner mary mapes dodge laurence hutton dean sage peace to their ashes susy is in error in thinking mrs dodge was not there at that time we were her guests we arrived at nightfall dreary from a tiresome journey but the dreariness did not last mrs dodge had provided a homemade banquet and the happy company sat down to it twenty strong or more then the thing happened which always happens at large dinners and is always exasperating everybody talked to his elbowmates and all talked at once and gradually raised their voices higher and higher and higher in the desperate effort to be heard it was like a riot an insurrection it was an intolerable volume of noise presently i said to the lady next me i will subdue this riot i will silence this racket there is only one way to do it but i know the art you must tilt your head toward mine and seem to be deeply interested in what i am saying i will talk in a low voice then just because our neighbors wont be able to hear me they will want to hear me if i mumble long enough say two minutes you will see that the dialogues will one after another come to a standstill and there will be silence not a sound anywhere but my mumbling then in a very low voice i began when i went out to chicago eleven years ago to witness the grant festivities there was a great banquet on the first night with six hundred exsoldiers present the gentleman who sat next me was mr x x he was very hard of hearing and he had a habit common to deaf people of shouting his remarks instead of delivering them in an ordinary voice he would handle his knife and fork in reflective silence for five or six minutes at a time and then suddenly fetch out a shout that would make you jump out of the united states by this time the insurrection at mrs dodges table at least that part of it in my immediate neighborhood had died down and the silence was spreading couple by couple down the long table i went on in a lower and still lower mumble and most impressively during one of mr x xs mute intervals a man opposite us approached the end of a story which he had been telling his elbowneighbor he was speaking in a low voice there was much noise i was deeply interested and straining my ears to catch his words stretching my neck holding my breath to hear unconscious of everything but the fascinating tale i heard him say at this point he seized her by her long hair she shrieking and begging bent her neck across his knee and with one awful sweep of the razor how do you like chicaaago that was x xs interruption hearable at thirty miles by the time i had reached that place in my mumblings mrs dodges diningroom was so silent so breathlessly still that if you had dropped a thought anywhere in it you could have heard it smack the floor when i delivered that yell the entire dinner company jumped as one person and punched their heads through the ceiling damaging it for it was only lath and plaster and it all came down on us and much of it went into the victuals and made them gritty but no one was hurt then i explained why it was that i had played that game and begged them to take the moral of it home to their hearts and be rational and merciful thenceforth and cease from screaming in mass and agree to let one person talk at a time and the rest listen in grateful and unvexed peace they granted my prayer and we had a happy time all the rest of the evening i do not think i have ever had a better time in my life this was largely because the new terms enabled me to keep the floor now that i had it and do all the talking myself i do like to hear myself talk susy has exposed this in her biography of me dean sage was a delightful man yet in one way a terror to his friends for he loved them so well that he could not refrain from playing practical jokes on them we have to be pretty deeply in love with a person before we can do him the honor of joking familiarly with him dean sage was the best citizen i have known in america it takes courage to be a good citizen and he had plenty of it he allowed no individual and no corporation to infringe his smallest right and escape unpunished he was very rich and very generous and benevolent and he gave away his money with a prodigal hand but if an individual or corporation infringed a right of his to the value of ten cents he would spend thousands of dollars worth of time and labor and money and persistence on the matter and would not lower his flag until he had won his battle or lost it he and rev mr harris had been classmates in college and to the day of sages death they were as fond of each other as an engaged pair it follows without saying that whenever sage found an opportunity to play a joke upon harris harris was sure to suffer along about sage fell a victim to an illness which reduced him to a skeleton and defied all the efforts of the physicians to cure it he went to the adirondacks and took harris with him sage had always been an active man and he couldnt idle any day wholly away in inanition but walked every day to the limit of his strength one day toward nightfall the pair came upon a humble log cabin which bore these words painted upon a shingle entertainment for man and beast they were obliged to stop there for the night sages strength being exhausted they entered the cabin and found its owner and sole occupant there a rugged and sturdy and simplehearted man of middle age he cooked supper and placed it before the travellers salt junk boiled beans corn bread and black coffee sages stomach could abide nothing but the most delicate food therefore this banquet revolted him and he sat at the table unemployed while harris fed ravenously limitlessly gratefully for he had been chaplain in a fighting regiment all through the war and had kept in perfection the grand and uncritical appetite and splendid physical vigor which those four years of tough fare and activity had furnished him sage went supperless to bed and tossed and writhed all night upon a shuck mattress that was full of attentive and interested corncobs in the morning harris was ravenous again and devoured the odious breakfast as contentedly and as delightedly as he had devoured its twin the night before sage sat upon the porch empty and contemplated the performance and meditated revenge presently he beckoned to the landlord and took him aside and had a confidential talk with him he said i am the paymaster what is the bill two suppers fifty cents two beds thirty cents two breakfasts fifty cents total a dollar and thirty cents sage said go back and make out the bill and fetch it to me here on the porch make it thirteen dollars thirteen dollars why its impossible i am no robber i am charging you what i charge everybody its a dollar and thirty cents and thats all it is my man ive got something to say about this as well as you its thirteen dollars youll make out your bill for that and youll take it too or youll not get a cent the man was troubled and said i dont understand this i cant make it out well i understand it i know what i am about its thirteen dollars and i want the bill made out for that theres no other terms get it ready and bring it out here i will examine it and be outraged you understand i will dispute the bill you must stand to it you must refuse to take less i will begin to lose my temper you must begin to lose yours i will call you hard names you must answer with harder ones i will raise my voice you must raise yours you must go into a rage foam at the mouth if you can insert some soap to help it along now go along and follow your instructions the man played his assigned part and played it well he brought the bill and stood waiting for results sages face began to cloud up his eyes to snap and his nostrils to inflate like a horses then he broke out with thirteen dollars you mean to say that you charge thirteen dollars for these damned inhuman hospitalities of yours are you a professional buccaneer is it your custom to the man burst in with spirit now i dont want any more out of you thats a plenty the bill is thirteen dollars and youll pay it thats all a couple of characterless adventurers bilking their way through this country and attempting to dictate terms to a gentleman a gentleman who received you supposing you were gentlemen yourselves whereas in my opinion hells full of sage broke in not another word of that i wont have it i regard you as the lowestdown thief that ever dont you use that word again by ill take you by the neck and harris came rushing out and just as the two were about to grapple he pushed himself between them and began to implore oh dean dont dont now mr smith control yourself oh think of your family dean think what a scandal but they burst out with maledictions imprecations and all the hard names they could dig out of the rich accumulations of their educated memories and in the midst of it the man shouted when gentlemen come to this house i treat them as gentlemen when people come to this house with the ordinary appetites of gentlemen i charge them a dollar and thirty cents for what i furnished you but when a man brings a hellfired famine here that gorges a barrel of pork and four barrels of beans at two sittings sage broke in in a voice that was eloquent with remorse and selfreproach i never thought of that and i ask your pardon i am ashamed of myself and of my friend heres your thirteen dollars and my apologies along with it dictated march i have always taken a great interest in other peoples duels one always feels an abiding interest in any heroic thing which has entered into his own experience sidenote in fourteen years after my unmaterialized duel messieurs fortu and gambetta fought a duel which made heroes of both of them in france but made them rather ridiculous throughout the rest of the world i was living in munich that fall and winter and i was so interested in that funny tragedy that i wrote a long account of it and it is in one of my books somewhere an account which had some inaccuracies in it but as an exhibition of the spirit of that duel i think it was correct and trustworthy and when i was living in vienna thirtyfour years after my ineffectual duel my interest in that kind of incident was still strong and i find here among my autobiographical manuscripts of that day a chapter which i began concerning it but did not finish i wanted to finish it but held it open in the hope that the italian ambassador m nigra would find time to furnish me the full history of seсѓor cavalottis adventures in that line but he was a busy man there was always an interruption before he could get well started so my hope was never fulfilled the following is the unfinished chapter sidenote as concerns duelling this pastime is as common in austria today as it is in france but with this difference that here in the austrian states the duel is dangerous while in france it is not here it is tragedy in france it in comedy here it is a solemnity there it is monkeyshines here the duellist risks his life there he does not even risk his shirt here he fights with pistol or sabre in france with a hairpin a blunt one here the desperately wounded man tries to walk to the hospital there they paint the scratch so that they can find it again lay the sufferer on a stretcher and conduct him off the field with a band of music at the end of a french duel the pair hug and kiss and cry and praise each others valor then the surgeons make an examination and pick out the scratched one and the other one helps him on to the litter and pays his fare and in return the scratched one treats to champagne and oysters in the evening and then the incident is closed as the french say it is all polite and gracious and pretty and impressive at the end of an austrian duel the antagonist that is alive gravely offers his hand to the other man utters some phrases of courteous regret then bids him goodby and goes his way and that incident also is closed the french duellist is painstakingly protected from danger by the rules of the game his antagonists weapon cannot reach so far as his body if he get a scratch it will not be above his elbow but in austria the rules of the game do not provide against danger they carefully provide for it usually commonly the combat must be kept up until one of the men is disabled a nondisabling slash or stab does not retire him for a matter of three months i watched the viennese journals and whenever a duel was reported in their telegraphic columns i scrapbooked it by this record i find that duelling in austria is not confined to journalists and old maids as in france but is indulged in by military men journalists students physicians lawyers members of the legislature and even the cabinet the bench and the police duelling is forbidden by law and so it seems odd to see the makers and administrators of the laws dancing on their work in this way some months ago count bodeni at that time chief of the government fought a pistolduel here in the capital city of the empire with representative wolf and both of those distinguished christians came near getting turned out of the church for the church as well as the state forbids duelling in one case lately in hungary the police interfered and stopped a duel after the first innings this was a sabreduel between the chief of police and the city attorney unkind things were said about it by the newspapers they said the police remembered their duty uncommonly well when their own officials were the parties concerned in duels but i think the underlings showed good breadandbutter judgment if their superiors had carved each other well the public would have asked where were the police and their places would have been endangered but custom does not require them to be around where mere unofficial citizens are explaining a thing with sabres there was another duel a double duel going on in the immediate neighborhood at the time and in this case the police obeyed custom and did not disturb it their bread and butter was not at stake there in this duel a physician fought a couple of surgeons and wounded both one of them lightly the other seriously an undertaker wanted to keep people from interfering but that was quite natural again selecting at random from my record i next find a duel at tarnopol between military men an officer of the tenth dragoons charged an officer of the ninth dragoons with an offence against the laws of the cardtable there was a defect or a doubt somewhere in the matter and this had to be examined and passed upon by a court of honor so the case was sent up to lemberg for this purpose one would like to know what the defect was but the newspaper does not say a man here who has fought many duels and has a graveyard says that probably the matter in question was as to whether the accusation was true or not that if the charge was a very grave one cheating for instance proof of its truth would rule the guilty officer out of the field of honor the court would not allow a gentleman to fight with such a person you see what a solemn thing it is you see how particular they are any little careless act can lose you your privilege of getting yourself shot here the court seems to have gone into the matter in a searching and careful fashion for several months elapsed before it reached a decision it then sanctioned a duel and the accused killed his accuser next i find a duel between a prince and a major first with pistols no result satisfactory to either party then with sabres and the major badly hurt next a sabreduel between journalists the one a strong man the other feeble and in poor health it was brief the strong one drove his sword through the weak one and death was immediate next a duel between a lieutenant and a student of medicine according to the newspaper report these are the details the student was in a restaurant one evening passing along he halted at a table to speak with some friends near by sat a dozen military men the student conceived that one of these was staring at him he asked the officer to step outside and explain this officer and another one gathered up their caps and sabres and went out with the student outside this is the students account the student introduced himself to the offending officer and said you seemed to stare at me for answer the officer struck at the student with his fist the student parried the blow both officers drew their sabres and attacked the young fellow and one of them gave him a wound on the left arm then they withdrew this was saturday night the duel followed on monday in the military ridingschool the customary duellingground all over austria apparently the weapons were pistols the duelling terms were somewhat beyond custom in the matter of severity if i may gather that from the statement that the combat was fought unter sehr schweren bedingungen to wit distance steps with steps advance there was but one exchange of shots the student was hit he put his hand on his breast his body began to bend slowly forward then collapsed in death and sank to the ground it is pathetic there are other duels in my list but i find in each and all of them one and the same everrecurring defect the principals are never present but only their sham representatives the real principals in any duel are not the duellists themselves but their families they do the mourning the suffering theirs is the loss and theirs the misery they stake all that the duellist stakes nothing but his life and that is a trivial thing compared with what his death must cost those whom he leaves behind him challenges should not mention the duellist he has nothing much at stake and the real vengeance cannot reach him the challenge should summon the offenders old gray mother and his young wife and his little children these or any to whom he is a dear and worshipped possession and should say you have done me no harm but i am the meek slave of a custom which requires me to crush the happiness out of your hearts and condemn you to years of pain and grief in order that i may wash clean with your tears a stain which has been put upon me by another person the logic of it is admirable a person has robbed me of a penny i must beggar ten innocent persons to make good my loss surely nobodys honor is worth all that since the duellists family are the real principals in a duel the state ought to compel them to be present at it custom also ought to be so amended as to require it and without it no duel ought to be allowed to go on if that students unoffending mother had been present and watching the officer through her tears as he raised his pistol he why he would have fired in the air we know that for we know how we are all made laws ought to be based upon the ascertained facts of our nature it would be a simple thing to make a duelling law which would stop duelling as things are now the mother is never invited she submits to this and without outward complaint for she too is the vassal of custom and custom requires her to conceal her pain when she learns the disastrous news that her son must go to the duellingfield and by the powerful force that is lodged in habit and custom she is enabled to obey this trying requirement a requirement which exacts a miracle of her and gets it last january a neighbor of ours who has a young son in the army was wakened by this youth at three oclock one morning and she sat up in bed and listened to his message i have come to tell you something mother which will distress you but you must be good and brave and bear it i have been affronted by a fellow officer and we fight at three this afternoon lie down and sleep now and think no more about it she kissed him good night and lay down paralyzed with grief and fear but said nothing but she did not sleep she prayed and mourned till the first streak of dawn then fled to the nearest church and implored the virgin for help and from that church she went to another and another and another church after church and still church after church and so spent all the day until three oclock on her knees in agony and tears then dragged herself home and sat down comfortless and desolate to count the minutes and wait with an outward show of calm for what had been ordained for her happiness or endless misery presently she heard the clank of a sabre she had not known before what music was in that sound and her son put his head in and said x was in the wrong and he apologized so that incident was closed and for the rest of her life the mother will always find something pleasant about the clank of a sabre no doubt in one of my listed duels however let it go there is nothing particularly striking about it except that the seconds interfered and prematurely too for neither man was dead this was certainly irregular neither of the men liked it it was a duel with cavalry sabres between an editor and a lieutenant the editor walked to the hospital the lieutenant was carried in this country an editor who can write well is valuable but he is not likely to remain so unless he can handle a sabre with charm the following very recent telegram shows that also in france duels are humanely stopped as soon as they approach the french dangerpoint reuters telegram paris march the duel between colonels henry and picquart took place this morning in the riding school of the ecole militaire the doors of which were strictly guarded in order to prevent intrusion the combatants who fought with swords were in position at ten oclock at the first reengagement lieutenantcolonel henry was slightly scratched in the fore arm and just at the same moment his own blade appeared to touch his adversarys neck senator ranc who was colonel picquarts second stopped the fight but as it was found that his principal had not been touched the combat continued a very sharp encounter ensued in which colonel henry was wounded in the elbow and the duel terminated after which the stretcher and the band in lurid contrast with this delicate flirtation we have this fatal duel of day before yesterday in italy where the earnest austrian duel is in vogue i knew cavalotti slightly and this gives me a sort of personal interest in his duel i first saw him in rome several years ago he was sitting on a block of stone in the forum and was writing something in his notebook a poem or a challenge or something like that and the friend who pointed him out to me said that is cavalotti he has fought thirty duels do not disturb him i did not disturb him may it is a long time ago cavalotti poet orator satirist statesman patriot was a great man and his death was deeply lamented by his countrymen many monuments to his memory testify to this in his duels he killed several of his antagonists and disabled the rest by nature he was a little irascible once when the officials of the library of bologna threw out his books the gentle poet went up there and challenged the whole fifteen his parliamentary duties were exacting but he proposed to keep coming up and fighting duels between trains until all those officials had been retired from the activities of life although he always chose the sword to fight with he had never had a lesson with that weapon when game was called he waited for nothing but always plunged at his opponent and rained such a storm of wild and original thrusts and whacks upon him that the man was dead or crippled before he could bring his science to bear but his latest antagonist discarded science and won he held his sword straight forward like a lance when cavalotti made his plunge with the result that he impaled himself upon it it entered his mouth and passed out at the back of his neck death was instantaneous dictated december six months ago when i was recalling early days in san francisco i broke off at a place where i was about to tell about captain osborns odd adventure at the what cheer or perhaps it was at another cheap feedingplace the miners restaurant it was a place where one could get good food on the cheapest possible terms and its popularity was great among the multitudes whose purses were light it was a good place to go to to observe mixed humanity captain osborn and bret harte went there one day and took a meal and in the course of it osborn fished up an interesting reminiscence of a dozen years before and told about it it was to this effect he was a midshipman in the navy when the californian gold craze burst upon the world and set it wild with excitement his ship made the long journey around the horn and was approaching her goal the golden gate when an accident happened it happened to me said osborn i fell overboard there was a heavy sea running but no one was much alarmed about me because we had on board a newly patented lifesaving device which was believed to be competent to rescue anything that could fall overboard from a midshipman to an anchor ours was the only ship that had this device we were very proud of it and had been anxious to give its powers a practical test this thing was lashed to the garboardstrake of the maintogallant mizzenyard amidships and there was nothing to do but cut the lashings and heave it over it would do the rest one day the cry of man overboard brought all hands on deck instantly the lashings were cut and the machine flung joyously over damnation it went to the bottom like an anvil by the time that the ship was brought to and a boat manned i was become but a bobbing speck on the waves half a mile astern and losing my strength very fast but by good luck there was a common seaman on board who had practical ideas in his head and hadnt waited to see what the patent machine was going to do but had run aft and sprung over after me the moment the alarm was cried through the ship i had a good deal of a start of him and the seas made his progress slow and difficult but he stuck to his work and fought his way to me and just in the nick of time he put his saving arms about me when i was about to go down he held me up until the boat reached us and rescued us by that time i was unconscious and i was still unconscious when we arrived at the ship a dangerous fever followed and i was delirious for three days then i come to myself and at once inquired for my benefactor of course he was gone we were lying at anchor in the bay and every man had deserted to the goldmines except the commissioned officers i found out nothing about my benefactor but his name burton sanders a name which i have held in grateful memory ever since every time i have been on the coast these twelve or thirteen years i have tried to get track of him but have never succeeded i wish i could find him and make him understand that his brave act has never been forgotten by me harte i would rather see him and take him by the hand than any other man on the planet at this stage or a little later there was an interruption a waiter near by said to another waiter pointing take a look at that tramp thats coming in aint that the one that bilked the house last week out of ten cents i believe it is let him alone dont pay any attention to him wait till we can get a good look at him the tramp approached timidly and hesitatingly with the air of one unsure and apprehensive the waiters watched him furtively when he was passing behind hartes chair one of them said hes the one and they pounced upon him and proposed to turn him over to the police as a bilk he begged piteously he confessed his guilt but said he had been driven to his crime by necessity that when he had eaten the plate of beans and flipped out without paying for it it was because he was starving and hadnt the ten cents to pay for it with but the waiters would listen to no explanations no palliations he must be placed in custody he brushed his hand across his eyes and said meekly that he would submit being friendless each waiter took him by an arm and faced him about to conduct him away then his melancholy eyes fell upon captain osborn and a light of glad and eager recognition flashed from them he said werent you a midshipman once sir in the old lancaster yes said osborn why didnt you fall overboard yes i did how do you come to know about it wasnt there a new patent machine aboard and didnt they throw it over to save you why yes said osborn laughing gently but it didnt do it no sir it was a sailor that done it it certainly was look here my man you are getting distinctly interesting were you of our crew yes sir i was i reckon you may be right you do certainly know a good deal about that incident what is your name burton sanders the captain sprang up excited and said give me your hand give me both your hands id rather shake them than inherit a fortune and then he cried to the waiters let him go take your hands off he is my guest and can have anything and everything this house is able to furnish i am responsible there was a lovefeast then captain osborn ordered it regardless of expense and he and harte sat there and listened while the man told stirring adventures of his life and fed himself up to the eyebrows then osborn wanted to be benefactor in his turn and pay back some of his debt the man said it could all be paid with ten dollars that it had been so long since he had owned that amount of money that it would seem a fortune to him and he should be grateful beyond words if the captain could spare him that amount the captain spared him ten broad twentydollar gold pieces and made him take them in spite of his modest protestations and gave him his address and said he must never fail to give him notice when he needed grateful service several months later harte stumbled upon the man in the street he was most comfortably drunk and pleasant and chatty harte remarked upon the splendidly and movingly dramatic incident of the restaurant and said how curious and fortunate and happy and interesting it was that you two should come together after that long separation and at exactly the right moment to save you from disaster and turn your defeat by the waiters into a victory a preacher could make a great sermon out of that for it does look as if the hand of providence was in it the heros face assumed a sweetly genial expression and he said well now it wasnt providence this time i was running the arrangements myself how do you mean oh i hadnt ever seen the gentleman before i was at the next table with my back to you the whole time he was telling about it i saw my chance and slipped out and fetched the two waiters with me and offered to give them a commission out of what i could get out of the captain if they would do a quarrel act with me and give me an opening so then after a minute or two i straggled back and you know the rest of it as well as i do mark twain to be continued footnotes this was tried i well remember it m t october can this be correct i think there must be some mistake m t north american review no dcxxiii october chapters from my autobiography xxiii by mark twain sidenote dictated march i am talking of a time sixty years ago and upwards i remember the names of some of those schoolmates and by fitful glimpses even their faces rise dimly before me for a moment only just long enough to be recognized then they vanish i catch glimpses of george robards the latin pupil slender pale studious bending over his book and absorbed in it his long straight black hair hanging down below his jaws like a pair of curtains on the sides of his face i can see him give his head a toss and flirt one of the curtains back around his head to get it out of his way apparently really to show off in that day it was a great thing among the boys to have hair of so flexible a sort that it could be flung back in that way with a flirt of the head george robards was the envy of us all for there was no hair among us that was so competent for this exhibition as his except perhaps the yellow locks of will bowen and john robards my hair was a dense ruck of short curls and so was my brother henrys we tried all kinds of devices to get these crooks straightened out so that they would flirt but we never succeeded sometimes by soaking our heads and then combing and brushing our hair down tight and flat to our skulls we could get it straight temporarily and this gave us a comforting moment of joy but the first time we gave it a flirt it all shrivelled into curls again and our happiness was gone john robards was the little brother of george he was a wee chap with silky golden curtains to his face which dangled to his shoulders and below and could be flung back ravishingly when he was twelve years old he crossed the plains with his father amidst the rush of the goldseekers of and i remember the departure of the cavalcade when it spurred westward we were all there to see and to envy and i can still see that proud little chap sailing by on a great horse with his long locks streaming out behind we were all on hand to gaze and envy when he returned two years later in unimaginable glory for he had travelled none of us had ever been forty miles from home but he had crossed the continent he had been in the goldmines that fairyland of our imagination and he had done a still more wonderful thing he had been in ships in ships on the actual ocean in ships on three actual oceans for he had sailed down the pacific and around the horn among icebergs and through snowstorms and wild wintry gales and had sailed on and turned the corner and flown northward in the trades and up through the blistering equatorial waters and there in his brown face were the proofs of what he had been through we would have sold our souls to satan for the privilege of trading places with him i saw him when i was out on that missouri trip four years ago he was old then though not quite so old as i and the burden of life was upon him he said his granddaughter twelve years old had read my books and would like to see me it was a pathetic time for she was a prisoner in her room and marked for death and john knew that she was passing swiftly away twelve years old just her grandfathers age when he rode away on that great journey with his yellow hair flapping behind him in her i seemed to see that boy again it was as if he had come back out of that remote past and was present before me in his golden youth her malady was heart disease and her brief life came to a close a few days later another of those schoolboys was john garth he became a prosperous banker and a prominent and valued citizen and a few years ago he died rich and honored he died it is what i have to say about so many of those boys and girls the widow still lives and there are grandchildren in her pantalette days and my barefoot days she was a schoolmate of mine i saw johns tomb when i made that missouri visit her father mr kercheval had an apprentice in the early days when i was nine years old and he had also a slave woman who had many merits but i cant feel very kindly or forgivingly toward either that good apprentice boy or that good slave woman for they saved my life one day when i was playing on a loose log which i supposed was attached to a raft but it wasnt it tilted me into bear creek and when i had been under water twice and was coming up to make the third and fatal descent my fingers appeared above the water and that slave woman seized them and pulled me out within a week i was in again and that apprentice had to come along just at the wrong time and he plunged in and dived pawed around on the bottom and found me and dragged me out and emptied the water out of me and i was saved again i was drowned seven times after that before i learned to swim once in bear creek and six times in the mississippi i do not now know who the people were who interfered with the intentions of a providence wiser than themselves but i hold a grudge against them yet when i told the tale of these remarkable happenings to rev dr burton of hartford he said he did not believe it he slipped on the ice the very next year and sprained his ankle will bowen was another schoolmate and so was his brother sam who was his junior by a couple of years before the civil war broke out both became st louis and new orleans pilots both are dead long ago sidenote dictated march we will return to those schoolchildren of sixty years ago i recall mary miller she was not my first sweetheart but i think she was the first one that furnished me a broken heart i fell in love with her when she was eighteen and i was nine but she scorned me and i recognized that this was a cold world i had not noticed that temperature before i believe i was as miserable as even a grown man could be but i think that this sorrow did not remain with me long as i remember it i soon transferred my worship to artimisia briggs who was a year older than mary miller when i revealed my passion to her she did not scoff at it she did not make fun of it she was very kind and gentle about it but she was also firm and said she did not want to be pestered by children and there was mary lacy she was a schoolmate but she also was out of my class because of her advanced age she was pretty wild and determined and independent but she married and at once settled down and became in all ways a model matron and was as highly respected as any matron in the town four years ago she was still living and had been married fifty years jimmie mcdaniel was another schoolmate his age and mine about tallied his father kept the candyshop and he was the most envied little chap in the town after tom blankenship huck finn for although we never saw him eating candy we supposed that it was nevertheless his ordinary diet he pretended that he never ate it and didnt care for it because there was nothing forbidden about it there was plenty of it and he could have as much of it as he wanted he was the first human being to whom i ever told a humorous story so far as i can remember this was about jim wolfe and the cats and i gave him that tale the morning after that memorable episode i thought he would laugh his teeth out i had never been so proud and happy before and have seldom been so proud and happy since i saw him four years ago when i was out there he wore a beard gray and venerable that came halfway down to his knees and yet it was not difficult for me to recognize him he had been married fiftyfour years he had many children and grandchildren and greatgrandchildren and also even posterity they all said thousands yet the boy to whom i had told the cat story when we were callow juveniles was still present in that cheerful little old man artimisia briggs got married not long after refusing me she married richmond the stone mason who was my methodist sundayschool teacher in the earliest days and he had one distinction which i envied him at some time or other he had hit his thumb with his hammer and the result was a thumb nail which remained permanently twisted and distorted and curved and pointed like a parrots beak i should not consider it an ornament now i suppose but it had a fascination for me then and a vast value because it was the only one in the town he was a very kindly and considerate sundayschool teacher and patient and compassionate so he was the favorite teacher with us little chaps in that school they had slender oblong pasteboard blue tickets each with a verse from the testament printed on it and you could get a blue ticket by reciting two verses by reciting five verses you could get three blue tickets and you could trade these at the bookcase and borrow a book for a week i was under mr richmonds spiritual care every now and then for two or three years and he was never hard upon me i always recited the same five verses every sunday he was always satisfied with the performance he never seemed to notice that these were the same five foolish virgins that he had been hearing about every sunday for months i always got my tickets and exchanged them for a book they were pretty dreary books for there was not a bad boy in the entire bookcase they were all good boys and good girls and drearily uninteresting but they were better society than none and i was glad to have their company and disapprove of it sidenote twenty years ago mr richmond had become possessed of tom sawyers cave in the hills three miles from town and had made a touristresort of it in when the goldseekers were streaming through our little town of hannibal many of our grown men got the gold fever and i think that all the boys had it on the saturday holidays in summertime we used to borrow skiffs whose owners were not present and go down the river three miles to the cave hollow missourian for valley and there we staked out claims and pretended to dig gold panning out half a dollar a day at first two or three times as much later and by and by whole fortunes as our imaginations became inured to the work stupid and unprophetic lads we were doing this in play and never suspecting why that cave hollow and all the adjacent hills were made of gold but we did not know it we took it for dirt we left its rich secret in its own peaceful possession and grew up in poverty and went wandering about the world struggling for bread and this because we had not the gift of prophecy that region was all dirt and rocks to us yet all it needed was to be ground up and scientifically handled and it was gold that is to say the whole region was a cementmine and they make the finest kind of portland cement there now five thousand barrels a day with a plant that cost for a little while reuel gridley attended that school of ours he was an elderly pupil he was perhaps twentytwo or twentythree years old then came the mexican war and he volunteered a company of infantry was raised in our town and mr hickman a tall straight handsome athlete of twentyfive was made captain of it and had a sword by his side and a broad yellow stripe down the leg of his gray pants and when that company marched back and forth through the streets in its smart uniform which it did several times a day for drill its evolutions were attended by all the boys whenever the school hours permitted i can see that marching company yet and i can almost feel again the consuming desire that i had to join it but they had no use for boys of twelve and thirteen and before i had a chance in another war the desire to kill people to whom i had not been introduced had passed away i saw the splendid hickman in his old age he seemed about the oldest man i had ever seen an amazing and melancholy contrast with the showy young captain i had seen preparing his warriors for carnage so many many years before hickman is dead it is the old story as susy said what is it all for reuel gridley went away to the wars and we heard of him no more for fifteen or sixteen years then one day in carson city while i was having a difficulty with an editor on the sidewalk an editor better built for war than i was i heard a voice say give him the best youve got sam im at your back it was reuel gridley he said he had not recognized me by my face but by my drawling style of speech he went down to the reese river mines about that time and presently he lost an election bet in his mining camp and by the terms of it he was obliged to buy a fiftypound sack of selfraising flour and carry it through the town preceded by music and deliver it to the winner of the bet of course the whole camp was present and full of fluid and enthusiasm the winner of the bet put up the sack at auction for the benefit of the united states sanitary fund and sold it the excitement grew and grew the sack was sold over and over again for the benefit of the fund the news of it came to virginia city by telegraph it produced great enthusiasm and reuel gridley was begged by telegraph to bring the sack and have an auction in virginia city he brought it an open barouche was provided also a brass band the sack was sold over and over again at gold hill then was brought up to virginia city toward night and sold and sold again and again and still again netting twenty or thirty thousand dollars for the sanitary fund gridley carried it across california and sold it at various towns he sold it for large sums in sacramento and in san francisco he brought it east sold it in new york and in various other cities then carried it out to a great fair at st louis and went on selling it and finally made it up into small cakes and sold those at a dollar apiece first and last the sack of flour which had originally cost ten dollars perhaps netted more than two hundred thousand dollars for the sanitary fund reuel gridley has been dead these many many years it is the old story in that school were the first jews i had ever seen it took me a good while to get over the awe of it to my fancy they were clothed invisibly in the damp and cobwebby mould of antiquity they carried me back to egypt and in imagination i moved among the pharaohs and all the shadowy celebrities of that remote age the name of the boys was levin we had a collective name for them which was the only really large and handsome witticism that was ever born in that congressional district we called them twentytwo and even when the joke was old and had been worn threadbare we always followed it with the explanation to make sure that it would be understood twice levin twentytwo there were other boys whose names remain with me irving ayres but no matter he is dead then there was george butler whom i remember as a child of seven wearing a blue leather belt with a brass buckle and hated and envied by all the boys on account of it he was a nephew of general ben butler and fought gallantly at balls bluff and in several other actions of the civil war he is dead long and long ago will bowen dead long ago ed stevens dead long ago and john briggs were special mates of mine john is still living sidenote in when i was ten years old there was an epidemic of measles in the town and it made a most alarming slaughter among the little people there was a funeral almost daily and the mothers of the town were nearly demented with fright my mother was greatly troubled she worried over pamela and henry and me and took constant and extraordinary pains to keep us from coming into contact with the contagion but upon reflection i believed that her judgment was at fault it seemed to me that i could improve upon it if left to my own devices i cannot remember now whether i was frightened about the measles or not but i clearly remember that i grew very tired of the suspense i suffered on account of being continually under the threat of death i remember that i got so weary of it and so anxious to have the matter settled one way or the other and promptly that this anxiety spoiled my days and my nights i had no pleasure in them i made up my mind to end this suspense and be done with it will bowen was dangerously ill with the measles and i thought i would go down there and catch them i entered the house by the front way and slipped along through rooms and halls keeping sharp watch against discovery and at last i reached wills bedchamber in the rear of the house on the second floor and got into it uncaptured but that was as far as my victory reached his mother caught me there a moment later and snatched me out of the house and gave me a most competent scolding and drove me away she was so scared that she could hardly get her words out and her face was white i saw that i must manage better next time and i did i hung about the lane at the rear of the house and watched through cracks in the fence until i was convinced that the conditions were favorable then i slipped through the back yard and up the back way and got into the room and into the bed with will bowen without being observed i dont know how long i was in the bed i only remember that will bowen as society had no value for me for he was too sick to even notice that i was there when i heard his mother coming i covered up my head but that device was a failure it was dead summertime the cover was nothing more than a limp blanket or sheet and anybody could see that there were two of us under it it didnt remain two very long mrs bowen snatched me out of the bed and conducted me home herself with a grip on my collar which she never loosened until she delivered me into my mothers hands along with her opinion of that kind of a boy it was a good case of measles that resulted it brought me within a shade of deaths door it brought me to where i no longer took any interest in anything but on the contrary felt a total absence of interest which was most placid and enchanting i have never enjoyed anything in my life any more than i enjoyed dying that time i was in effect dying the word had been passed and the family notified to assemble around the bed and see me off i knew them all there was no doubtfulness in my vision they were all crying but that did not affect me i took but the vaguest interest in it and that merely because i was the centre of all this emotional attention and was gratified by it and vain of it when dr cunningham had made up his mind that nothing more could be done for me he put bags of hot ashes all over me he put them on my breast on my wrists on my ankles and so very much to his astonishment and doubtless to my regret he dragged me back into this world and set me going again dictated july in an article entitled englands ovation to mark twain sydney brooks but never mind that now i was in oxford by seven oclock that evening june and trying on the scarlet gown which the tailor had been constructing and found it right right and surpassingly becoming at half past ten the next morning we assembled at all souls college and marched thence gowned mortarboarded and in double file down a long street to the sheldonian theatre between solid walls of the populace very much hurrahd and limitlessly kodakd we made a procession of considerable length and distinction and picturesqueness with the chancellor lord curzon late viceroy of india in his rich robe of black and gold in the lead followed by a pair of trim little boy trainbearers and the trainbearers followed by the young prince arthur of connaught who was to be made a dcl the detachment of dcls were followed by the doctors of science and these by the doctors of literature and these in turn by the doctors of music sidney colvin marched in front of me i was coupled with sidney lee and kipling followed us general booth of the salvation army was in the squadron of dcls our journey ended we were halted in a fine old hall whence we could see through a corridor of some length the massed audience in the theatre here for a little time we moved about and chatted and made acquaintanceships then the dcls were summoned and they marched through that corridor and the shouting began in the theatre it would be some time before the doctors of literature and of science would be called for because each of those dcls had to have a couple of latin speeches made over him before his promotion would be complete one by the regius professor of civil law the other by the chancellor after a while i asked sir william ramsay if a person might smoke here and not get shot he said yes but that whoever did it and got caught would be fined a guinea and perhaps hanged later he said he knew of a place where we could accomplish at least as much as half of a smoke before any informers would be likely to chance upon us and he was ready to show the way to any who might be willing to risk the guinea and the hanging by request he led the way and kipling sir norman lockyer and i followed we crossed an unpopulated quadrangle and stood under one of its exits an archway of massive masonry and there we lit up and began to take comfort the photographers soon arrived but they were courteous and friendly and gave us no trouble and we gave them none they grouped us in all sorts of ways and photographed us at their diligent leisure while we smoked and talked we were there more than an hour then we returned to headquarters happy content and greatly refreshed presently we filed into the theatre under a very satisfactory hurrah and waited in a crimson column dividing the crowded pit through the middle until each of us in his turn should be called to stand before the chancellor and hear our merits set forth in sonorous latin meantime kipling and i wrote autographs until some good kind soul interfered in our behalf and procured for us a rest i will now save what is left of my modesty by quoting a paragraph from sydney brookss ovation let those stars take the place of it for the present sydney brooks has done it well it makes me proud to read it as proud as i was in that old day sixtytwo years ago when i lay dying the centre of attraction with one eye piously closed upon the fleeting vanities of this life an excellent effect and the other open a crack to observe the tears the sorrow the admiration all for me all for me ah that was the proudest moment of my long life until oxford most americans have been to oxford and will remember what a dream of the middle ages it is with its crooked lanes its gray and stately piles of ancient architecture and its meditationbreeding air of repose and dignity and unkinship with the noise and fret and hurry and bustle of these modern days as a dream of the middle ages oxford was not perfect until pageant day arrived and furnished certain details which had been for generations lacking these details began to appear at midafternoon on the th at that time singles couples groups and squadrons of the three thousand five hundred costumed characters who were to take part in the pageant began to ooze and drip and stream through house doors all over the old town and wend toward the meadows outside the walls soon the lanes were thronged with costumes which oxford had from time to time seen and been familiar with in bygone centuries fashions of dress which marked off centuries as by dates and milestoned them back and back and back until history faded into legend and tradition when arthur was a fact and the round table a reality in this rich commingling of quaint and strange and brilliantly colored fashions in dress the dresschanges of oxford for twelve centuries stood livid and realized to the eye oxford as a dream of the middle ages was complete now as it had never in our day before been complete at last there was no discord the mouldering old buildings and the picturesque throngs drifting past them were in harmony soon astonishingly soon the only persons that seemed out of place and grotesquely and offensively and criminally out of place were such persons as came intruding along clothed in the ugly and odious fashions of the twentieth century they were a bitterness to the feelings an insult to the eye the makeups of illustrious historic personages seemed perfect both as to portraiture and costume one had no trouble in recognizing them also i was apparently quite easily recognizable myself the first corner i turned brought me suddenly face to face with henry viii a person whom i had been implacably disliking for sixty years but when he put out his hand with royal courtliness and grace and said welcome wellbeloved stranger to my century and to the hospitalities of my realm my old prejudices vanished away and i forgave him i think now that henry the eighth has been overabused and that most of us if we had been situated as he was domestically would not have been able to get along with as limited a graveyard as he forced himself to put up with i feel now that he was one of the nicest men in history personal contact with a king is more effective in removing baleful prejudices than is any amount of argument drawn from tales and histories if i had a child i would name it henry the eighth regardless of sex do you remember charles the first and his broad slouch with the plume in it and his slender tall figure and his body clothed in velvet doublet with lace sleeves and his legs in leather with long rapier at his side and his spurs on his heels i encountered him at the next corner and knew him in a moment knew him as perfectly and as vividly as i should know the grand chain in the mississippi if i should see it from the pilothouse after all these years he bent his body and gave his hat a sweep that fetched its plume within an inch of the ground and gave me a welcome that went to my heart this king has been much maligned i shall understand him better hereafter and shall regret him more than i have been in the habit of doing these fifty or sixty years he did some things in his time which might better have been left undone and which cast a shadow upon his name we all know that we all concede it but our error has been in regarding them as crimes and in calling them by that name whereas i perceive now that they were only indiscretions at every few steps i met persons of deathless name whom i had never encountered before outside of pictures and statuary and history and these were most thrilling and charming encounters i had handshakes with henry the second who had not been seen in the oxford streets for nearly eight hundred years and with the fair rosamond whom i now believe to have been chaste and blameless although i had thought differently about it before and with shakespeare one of the pleasantest foreigners i have ever gotten acquainted with and with roger bacon and with queen elizabeth who talked five minutes and never swore once a fact which gave me a new and good opinion of her and moved me to forgive her for beheading the scottish mary if she really did it which i now doubt and with the quaintly and anciently clad young king harold harefoot of near nine hundred years ago who came flying by on a bicycle and smoking a pipe but at once checked up and got off to shake with me and also i met a bishop who had lost his way because this was the first time he had been inside the walls of oxford for as much as twelve hundred years or thereabouts by this time i had grown so used to the obliterated ages and their bestknown people that if i had met adam i should not have been either surprised or embarrassed and if he had come in a racing automobile and a cloud of dust with nothing on but his figleaf it would have seemed to me all right and harmonious mark twain to be continued chapters from my autobiography xxiv by mark twain from susys biography of me mamma and papa have returned from onteora and they have had a delightful visit mr frank stockton was down in virginia and could not reach onteora in time so they did not see him and mrs mary mapes dodge was ill and couldnt go to onteora but mrs general custer was there and mamma said that she was a very attractive sweet appearing woman dictated october onteora was situated high up in the catskill mountains in the centre of a farreaching solitude i do not mean that the region was wholly uninhabited there were farmhouses here and there at generous distances apart their occupants were descendants of ancestors who had built the houses in rip van winkles time or earlier and those ancestors were not more primitive than were this posterity of theirs the city people were as foreign and unfamiliar and strange to them as monkeys would have been and they would have respected the monkeys as much as they respected these elegant summerresorters the resorters were a puzzle to them their ways were so strange and their interests so trivial they drove the resorters over the mountain roads and listened in shamed surprise at their bursts of enthusiasm over the scenery the farmers had had that scenery on exhibition from their mountain roosts all their lives and had never noticed anything remarkable about it by way of an incident a pair of these primitives were overheard chatting about the resorters one day and in the course of their talk this remark was dropped i was adrivin a passel of em round about yisterday evenin quiet ones you know still and solemn and all to wunst they busted out to make your hair lift and i judged hell was to pay now what do you reckon it was it want anything but jest one of them common damned yaller sunsets in those days tuesday october warner is gone stockton is gone i attended both funerals warner was a near neighbor from the autumn of until his death nineteen years afterward it is not the privilege of the most of us to have many intimate friends a dozen is our aggregate but i think he could count his by the score it is seldom that a man is so beloved by both sexes and all ages as warner was there was a charm about his spirit and his ways and his words that won all that came within the sphere of its influence our children adopted him while they were little creatures and thenceforth to the end he was cousin charley to them he was uncle charley to the children of more than one other friend mrs clemens was very fond of him and he always called her by her first name shortened warner died as she died and as i would die without premonition without a moments warning uncle remus still lives and must be over a thousand years old indeed i know that this must be so because i have seen a new photograph of him in the public prints within the last month or so and in that picture his aspects are distinctly and strikingly geological and one can see he is thinking about the mastodons and plesiosaurians that he used to play with when he was young it is just a quarter of a century since i have seen uncle remus he visited us in our home in hartford and was reverently devoured by the big eyes of susy and clara for i made a deep and awful impression upon the little creatures who knew his book by heart through my nightly declamation of its tales to them by revealing to them privately that he was the real uncle remus whitewashed so that he could come into peoples houses the front way he was the bashfulest grown person i have ever met when there were people about he stayed silent and seemed to suffer until they were gone but he was lovely nevertheless for the sweetness and benignity of the immortal remus looked out from his eyes and the graces and sincerities of his character shone in his face it may be that jim wolf was as bashful as harris it hardly seems possible yet as i look back fiftysix years and consider jim wolf i am almost persuaded that he was he was our long slim apprentice in my brothers printingoffice in hannibal he was seventeen and yet he was as much as four times as bashful as i was though i was only fourteen he boarded and slept in the house but he was always tonguetied in the presence of my sister and when even my gentle mother spoke to him he could not answer save in frightened monosyllables he would not enter a room where a girl was nothing could persuade him to do such a thing once when he was in our small parlor alone two majestic old maids entered and seated themselves in such a way that jim could not escape without passing by them he would as soon have thought of passing by one of harriss plesiosaurians ninety feet long i came in presently was charmed with the situation and sat down in a corner to watch jim suffer and enjoy it my mother followed a minute later and sat down with the visitors and began to talk jim sat upright in his chair and during a quarter of an hour he did not change his position by a shade neither general grant nor a bronze image could have maintained that immovable pose more successfully i mean as to body and limbs with the face there was a difference by fleeting revealments of the face i saw that something was happening something out of the common there would be a sudden twitch of the muscles of the face an instant distortion which in the next instant had passed and left no trace these twitches gradually grew in frequency but no muscle outside of the face lost any of its rigidity or betrayed any interest in what was happening to jim i mean if something was happening to him and i knew perfectly well that that was the case at last a pair of tears began to swim slowly down his cheeks amongst the twitchings but jim sat still and let them run then i saw his right hand steal along his thigh until halfway to his knee then take a vigorous grip upon the cloth that was a wasp that he was grabbing a colony of them were climbing up his legs and prospecting around and every time he winced they stabbed him to the hilt so for a quarter of an hour one group of excursionists after another climbed up jims legs and resented even the slightest wince or squirm that he indulged himself with in his misery when the entertainment had become nearly unbearable he conceived the idea of gripping them between his fingers and putting them out of commission he succeeded with many of them but at great cost for as he couldnt see the wasp he was as likely to take hold of the wrong end of him as he was the right then the dying wasp gave him a punch to remember the incident by if those ladies had stayed all day and if all the wasps in missouri had come and climbed up jims legs nobody there would ever have known it but jim and the wasps and me there he would have sat until the ladies left when they finally went away we went upstairs and he took his clothes off and his legs were a picture to look at they looked as if they were mailed all over with shirt buttons each with a single red hole in the centre the pain was intolerable no would have been intolerable but the pain of the presence of those ladies had been so much harder to bear that the pain of the wasps stings was quite pleasant and enjoyable by comparison jim never could enjoy wasps i remember once from susys biography of me mamma has given me a very pleasant little newspaper scrap about papa to copy i will put it in here thursday october it was a rather strong compliment i think i will leave it out it was from james redpath the chief ingredients of redpaths makeup were honesty sincerity kindliness and pluck he wasnt afraid he was one of ossawatomie browns righthand men in the bleeding kansas days he was all through that struggle he carried his life in his hands and from one day to another it wasnt worth the price of a nights lodging he had a small body of daring men under him and they were constantly being hunted by the jayhawkers who were proslavery missourians guerillas modern free lances friday october i cant think of the name of that daredevil guerilla who led the jayhawkers and chased redpath up and down the country and in turn was chased by redpath by grace of the chances of war the two men never met in the field though they several times came within an ace of it ten or twelve years later redpath was earning his living in boston as chief of the lecture business in the united states fifteen or sixteen years after his kansas adventures i became a public lecturer and he was my agent along there somewhere was a press dinner one november night at the tremont hotel in boston and i attended it i sat near the head of the table with redpath between me and the chairman a stranger sat on my other side i tried several times to talk with the stranger but he seemed to be out of words and i presently ceased from troubling him he was manifestly a very shy man and moreover he might have been losing sleep the night before the first man called up was redpath at the mention of the name the stranger started and showed interest he fixed a fascinated eye on redpath and lost not a word of his speech redpath told some stirring incidents of his career in kansas and said among other things three times i came near capturing the gallant jayhawker chief and once he actually captured me but didnt know me and let me go because he said he was hot on redpaths trail and couldnt afford to waste time and rope on inconsequential small fry my stranger was called up next and when redpath heard his name he in turn showed a startled interest the stranger said bending a caressing glance upon redpath and speaking gently i may even say sweetly you realize that i was that jayhawker chief i am glad to know you now and take you to my heart and call you friend then he added in a voice that was pathetic with regret but if i had only known you then what tumultuous happiness i should have had in your society while it lasted the last quarter of a century of my life has been pretty constantly and faithfully devoted to the study of the human race that is to say the study of myself for in my individual person i am the entire human race compacted together i have found that then is no ingredient of the race which i do not possess in either a small way or a large way when it is small as compared with the same ingredient in somebody else there is still enough of it for all the purposes of examination in my contacts with the species i find no one who possesses a quality which i do not possess the shades of difference between other people and me serve to make variety and prevent monotony but that is all broadly speaking we are all alike and so by studying myself carefully and comparing myself with other people and noting the divergences i have been enabled to acquire a knowledge of the human race which i perceive is more accurate and more comprehensive than that which has been acquired and revealed by any other member of our species as a result my private and concealed opinion of myself is not of a complimentary sort it follows that my estimate of the human race is the duplicate of my estimate of myself i am not proposing to discuss all of the peculiarities of the human race at this time i only wish to touch lightly upon one or two of them to begin with i wonder why a man should prefer a good billiardtable to a poor one and why he should prefer straight cues to crooked ones and why he should prefer round balls to chipped ones and why he should prefer a level table to one that slants and why he should prefer responsive cushions to the dull and unresponsive kind i wonder at these things because when we examine the matter we find that the essentials involved in billiards are as competently and exhaustively furnished by a bad billiard outfit as they are by the best one one of the essentials is amusement very well if there is any more amusement to be gotten out of the one outfit than out of the other the facts are in favor of the bad outfit the bad outfit will always furnish thirty per cent more fun for the players and for the spectators than will the good outfit another essential of the game is that the outfit shall give the players full opportunity to exercise their best skill and display it in a way to compel the admiration of the spectators very well the bad outfit is nothing behind the good one in this regard it is a difficult matter to estimate correctly the eccentricities of chipped balls and a slanting table and make the right allowance for them and secure a count the finest kind of skill is required to accomplish the satisfactory result another essential of the game is that it shall add to the interest of the game by furnishing opportunities to bet very well in this regard no good outfit can claim any advantage over a bad one i know by experience that a bad outfit is as valuable as the best one that an outfit that couldnt be sold at auction for seven dollars is just as valuable for all the essentials of the game as an outfit that is worth a thousand i acquired some of this learning in jackass gulch california more than forty years ago jackass gulch had once been a rich and thriving surfacemining camp by and by its gold deposits were exhausted then the people began to go away and the town began to decay and rapidly in my time it had disappeared where the bank and the city hall and the church and the gamblingdens and the newspaper office and the streets of brick blocks had been was nothing now but a wide and beautiful expanse of green grass a peaceful and charming solitude half a dozen scattered dwellings were still inhabited and there was still one saloon of a ruined and rickety character struggling for life but doomed in its bar was a billiard outfit that was the counterpart of the one in my fatherinlaws garret the balls were chipped the cloth was darned and patched the tables surface was undulating and the cues were headless and had the curve of a parenthesis but the forlorn remnant of marooned miners played games there and those games were more entertaining to look at than a circus and a grand opera combined nothing but a quite extraordinary skill could score a carom on that table a skill that required the nicest estimate of force distance and how much to allow for the various slants of the table and the other formidable peculiarities and idiosyncrasies furnished by the contradictions of the outfit last winter here in new york i saw hoppe and schaefer and sutton and the three or four other billiard champions of worldwide fame contend against each other and certainly the art and science displayed were a wonder to see yet i saw nothing there in the way of science and art that was more wonderful than shots which i had seen texas tom make on the wavy surface of that poor old wreck in the perishing saloon at jackass gulch forty years before once i saw texas tom make a string of seven points on a single inning all calculated shots and not a fluke or a scratch among them i often saw him make runs of four but when he made his great string of seven the boys went wild with enthusiasm and admiration the joy and the noise exceeded that which the great gathering at madison square produced when sutton scored five hundred points at the eighteeninch game on a worldfamous night last winter with practice that champion could score nineteen or twenty on the jackass gulch table but to start with texas tom would show him miracles that would astonish him also it might have another handsome result it might persuade the great experts to discard their own trifling game and bring the jackass gulch outfit here and exhibit their skill in a game worth a hundred of the discarded one for profound and breathless interest and for displays of almost superhuman skill in my experience games played with a fiendish outfit furnish ecstasies of delight which games played with the other kind cannot match twentyseven years ago my budding little family spent the summer at batemans point near newport rhode island it was a comfortable boardingplace well stocked with sweet mothers and little children but the male sex was scarce however there was another young fellow besides myself and he and i had good times higgins was his name but that was not his fault he was a very pleasant and companionable person on the premises there was what had once been a bowlingalley it was a single alley and it was estimated that it had been out of repair for sixty years but not the balls the balls were in good condition there were fortyone of them and they ranged in size from a grapefruit up to a lignumvitр sphere that you could hardly lift higgins and i played on that alley day after day at first one of us located himself at the bottom end to set up the pins in case anything should happen to them but nothing happened the surface of that alley consisted of a rolling stretch of elevations and depressions and neither of us could by any art known to us persuade a ball to stay on the alley until it should accomplish something little balls and big the same thing always happened the ball left the alley before it was halfway home and went thundering down alongside of it the rest of the way and made the gamekeeper climb out and take care of himself no matter we persevered and were rewarded we examined the alley noted and located a lot of its peculiarities and little by little we learned how to deliver a ball in such a way that it would travel home and knock down a pin or two by and by we succeeded in improving our game to a point where we were able to get all of the pins with thirtyfive balls so we made it a thirtyfiveball game if the player did not succeed with thirtyfive he had lost the game i suppose that all the balls taken together weighed five hundred pounds or maybe a ton or along there somewhere but anyway it was hot weather and by the time that a player had sent thirtyfive of them home he was in a drench of perspiration and physically exhausted next we started cocked hat that is to say a triangle of three pins the other seven being discarded in this game we used the three smallest balls and kept on delivering them until we got the three pins down after a day or two of practice we were able to get the chief pin with an output of four balls but it cost us a great many deliveries to get the other two but by and by we succeeded in perfecting our art at least we perfected it to our limit we reached a scientific excellence where we could get the three pins down with twelve deliveries of the three small balls making thirtysix shots to conquer the cocked hat having reached our limit for daylight work we set up a couple of candles and played at night as the alley was fifty or sixty feet long we couldnt see the pins but the candles indicated their locality we continued this game until we were able to knock down the invisible pins with thirtysix shots having now reached the limit of the candle game we changed and played it lefthanded we continued the lefthanded game until we conquered its limit which was fiftyfour shots sometimes we sent down a succession of fifteen balls without getting anything at all we easily got out of that old alley five times the fun that anybody could have gotten out of the best alley in new york one blazing hot day a modest and courteous officer of the regular army appeared in our den and introduced himself he was about thirtyfive years old well built and militarily erect and straight and he was hermetically sealed up in the uniform of that ignorant old day a uniform made of heavy material and much properer for january than july when he saw the venerable alley and glanced from that to the long procession of shining balls in the trough his eye lit with desire and we judged that he was our meat we politely invited him to take a hand and he could not conceal his gratitude though his breeding and the etiquette of his profession made him try we explained the game to him and said that there were fortyone balls and that the player was privileged to extend his inning and keep on playing until he had used them all up repeatedly and that for every tenstrike he got a prize we didnt name the prize it wasnt necessary as no prize would ever be needed or called for he started a sarcastic smile but quenched it according to the etiquette of his profession he merely remarked that he would like to select a couple of medium balls and one small one adding that he didnt think he would need the rest then he began and he was an astonished man he couldnt get a ball to stay on the alley when he had fired about fifteen balls and hadnt yet reached the cluster of pins his annoyance began to show out through his clothes he wouldnt let it show in his face but after another fifteen balls he was not able to control his face he didnt utter a word but he exuded mute blasphemy from every pore he asked permission to take off his coat which was granted then he turned himself loose with bitter determination and although he was only an infantry officer he could have been mistaken for a battery he got up such a volleying thunder with those balls presently he removed his cravat after a little he took off his vest and still he went bravely on higgins was suffocating my condition was the same but it would not be courteous to laugh it would be better to burst and we came near it that officer was good pluck he stood to his work without uttering a word and kept the balls going until he had expended the outfit four times making four times fortyone shots then he had to give it up and he did for he was no longer able to stand without wobbling he put on his clothes bade us a courteous goodby invited us to call at the fort and started away then he came back and said what is the prize for the tenstrike we had to confess that we had not selected it yet he said gravely that he thought there was no occasion for hurry about it i believe batemans alley was a better one than any other in america in the matter of the essentials of the game it compelled skill it provided opportunity for bets and if you could get a stranger to do the bowling for you there was more and wholesomer and delightfuler entertainment to be gotten out of his industries than out of the finest game by the best expert and played upon the best alley elsewhere in existence mark twain to be continued north american review no dcxxv december chapters from my autobiography xxv by mark twain january answer to a letter received this morning dear mrs h i am forever your debtor for reminding me of that curious passage in my life during the first year or two after it happened i could not bear to think of it my pain and shame were so intense and my sense of having been an imbecile so settled established and confirmed that i drove the episode entirely from my mind and so all these twentyeight or twentynine years i have lived in the conviction that my performance of that time was coarse vulgar and destitute of humor but your suggestion that you and your family found humor in it twentyeight years ago moved me to look into the matter so i commissioned a boston typewriter to delve among the boston papers of that bygone time and send me a copy of it it came this morning and if there is any vulgarity about it i am not able to discover it if it isnt innocently and ridiculously funny i am no judge i will see to it that you get a copy address of samuel l clemens mark twain from a report of the dinner given by the publishers of the atlantic monthly in honor of the seventieth anniversary of the birth of john greenleaf whittier at the hotel brunswick boston december as published in the boston evening transcript december mr chairman this is an occasion peculiarly meet for the digging up of pleasant reminiscences concerning literary folk therefore i will drop lightly into history myself standing here on the shore of the atlantic and contemplating certain of its largest literary billows i am reminded of a thing which happened to me thirteen years ago when i had just succeeded in stirring up a little nevadian literary puddle myself whose spumeflakes were beginning to blow thinly californiawards i started an inspection tramp through the southern mines of california i was callow and conceited and i resolved to try the virtue of my nom de guerre i very soon had an opportunity i knocked at a miners lonely log cabin in the foothills of the sierras just at nightfall it was snowing at the time a jaded melancholy man of fifty barefooted opened the door to me when he heard my nom de guerre he looked more dejected than before he let me in pretty reluctantly i thought and after the customary bacon and beans black coffee and hot whiskey i took a pipe this sorrowful man had not said three words up to this time now he spoke up and said in the voice of one who is secretly suffering youre the fourth im going to move the fourth what said i the fourth littery man that has been here in twentyfour hours im going to move you dont tell me said i who were the others mr longfellow mr emerson and mr oliver wendell holmes consound the lot you can easily believe i was interested i supplicated three hot whiskeys did the rest and finally the melancholy miner began said he they came here just at dark yesterday evening and i let them in of course said they were going to the yosemite they were a rough lot but thats nothing everybody looks rough that travels afoot mr emerson was a seedy little bit of a chap redheaded mr holmes as fat as a balloon he weighed as much as three hundred and double chins all the way down to his stomach mr longfellow built like a prizefighter his head was cropped and bristly like as if he had a wig made of hairbrushes his nose lay straight down his face like a finger with the end joint tilted up they had been drinking i could see that and what queer talk they used mr holmes inspected this cabin then he took me by the buttonhole and says he through the deep cares of thought i hear a voice that sings build thee more stately mansions o my soul says i i cant afford it mr holmes and moreover i dont want to blamed if i liked it pretty well either coming from a stranger that way however i started to get out my bacon and beans when mr emerson came and looked on awhile and then he takes me aside by the buttonhole and says give me agates for my meat give me cantharids to eat from air and ocean bring me foods from all zones and altitudes says i mr emerson if youll excuse me this aint no hotel you see it sort of riled me i warnt used to the ways of littery swells but i went on asweating over my work and next comes mr longfellow and buttonholes me and interrupts me says he honor be to mudjekeewis you shall hear how paupukkeewis but i broke in and says i beg your pardon mr longfellow if youll be so kind as to hold your yawp for about five minutes and let me get this grub ready youll do me proud well sir after theyd filled up i set out the jug mr holmes looks at it and then he fires up all of a sudden and yells flash out a stream of bloodred wine for i would drink to other days by george i was getting kind of worked up i dont deny it i was getting kind of worked up i turns to mr holmes and says i looky here my fat friend im arunning this shanty and if the court knows herself youll take whiskey straight or youll go dry thems the very words i said to him now i dont want to sass such famous littery people but you see they kind of forced me there aint nothing onreasonable bout me i dont mind a passel of guests atreadin on my tail three or four times but when it comes to standing on it its different and if the court knows herself i says youll take whiskey straight or youll go dry well between drinks theyd swell around the cabin and strike attitudes and spout and pretty soon they got out a greasy old deck and went to playing euchre at ten cents a corner on trust i began to notice some pretty suspicious things mr emerson dealt looked at his hand shook his head says i am the doubter and the doubt and camly bunched the hands and went to shuffling for a new layout says he they reckon ill who leave me out they know not well the subtle ways i keep i pass and deal again hangd if he didnt go ahead and do it too o he was a cool one well in about a minute things were running pretty tight but all of a sudden i see by mr emersons eye he judged he had em he had already corralled two tricks and each of the others one so now he kind of lifts a little in his chair and says i tire of globes and aces too long the game is played and down he fetched a right bower mr longfellow smiles as sweet as pie and says thanks thanks to thee my worthy friend for the lesson thou hast taught and blamed if he didnt down with another right bower emerson claps his hand on his bowie longfellow claps his on his revolver and i went under a bunk there was going to be trouble but that monstrous holmes rose up wobbling his double chins and says he order gentlemen the first man that draws ill lay down on him and smother him all quiet on the potomac you bet they were pretty howcomeyouso by now and they begun to blow emerson says the nobbiest thing i ever wrote was barbara frietchie says longfellow it dont begin with my biglow papers says holmes my thanatopsis lays over em both they mighty near ended in a fight then they wished they had some more company and mr emerson pointed to me and says is yonder squalid peasant all that this proud nursery could breed he was awhetting his bowie on his boot so i let it pass well sir next they took it into their heads that they would like some music so they made me stand up and sing when johnny comes marching home till i dropped at thirteen minutes past four this morning thats what ive been through my friend when i woke at seven they were leaving thank goodness and mr longfellow had my only boots on and hisn under his arm says i hold on there evangeline what are you going to do with them he says going to make tracks with em because lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time as i said mr twain you are the fourth in twentyfour hours and im going to move i aint suited to a littery atmosphere i said to the miner why my dear sir these were not the gracious singers to whom we and the world pay loving reverence and homage these were impostors the miner investigated me with a calm eye for a while then said he ah impostors were they are you i did not pursue the subject and since then i have not travelled on my nom de guerre enough to hurt such was the reminiscence i was moved to contribute mr chairman in my enthusiasm i may have exaggerated the details a little but you will easily forgive me that fault since i believe it is the first time i have ever deflected from perpendicular fact on an occasion like this what i have said to mrs h is true i did suffer during a year or two from the deep humiliations of that episode but at last in in venice my wife and i came across mr and mrs a p c of concord massachusetts and a friendship began then of the sort which nothing but death terminates the cs were very bright people and in every way charming and companionable we were together a month or two in venice and several months in rome afterwards and one day that lamented break of mine was mentioned and when i was on the point of lathering those people for bringing it to my mind when i had gotten the memory of it almost squelched i perceived with joy that the cs were indignant about the way that my performance had been received in boston they poured out their opinions most freely and frankly about the frosty attitude of the people who were present at that performance and about the boston newspapers for the position they had taken in regard to the matter that position was that i had been irreverent beyond belief beyond imagination very well i had accepted that as a fact for a year or two and had been thoroughly miserable about it whenever i thought of it which was not frequently if i could help it whenever i thought of it i wondered how i ever could have been inspired to do so unholy a thing well the cs comforted me but they did not persuade me to continue to think about the unhappy episode i resisted that i tried to get it out of my mind and let it die and i succeeded until mrs hs letter came it had been a good twentyfive years since i had thought of that matter and when she said that the thing was funny i wondered if possibly she might be right at any rate my curiosity was aroused and i wrote to boston and got the whole thing copied as above set forth i vaguely remember some of the details of that gathering dimly i can see a hundred people no perhaps fifty shadowy figures sitting at tables feeding ghosts now to me and nameless forever more i dont know who they were but i can very distinctly see seated at the grand table and facing the rest of us mr emerson supernaturally grave unsmiling mr whittier grave lovely his beautiful spirit shining out of his face mr longfellow with his silken white hair and his benignant face dr oliver wendell holmes flashing smiles and affection and all goodfellowship everywhere like a rosediamond whose facets are being turned toward the light first one way and then another a charming man and always fascinating whether he was talking or whether he was sitting still what he would call still but what would be more or lees motion to other people i can see those figures with entire distinctness across this abyss of time one other feature is clear willie winter for these past thousand years dramatic editor of the new york tribune and still occupying that high post in his old age was there he was much younger then than he is now and he showed it it was always a pleasure to me to see willie winter at a banquet during a matter of twenty years i was seldom at a banquet where willie winter was not also present and where he did not read a charming poem written for the occasion he did it this time and it was up to standard dainty happy choicely phrased and as good to listen to as music and sounding exactly as if it was pouring unprepared out of heart and brain now at that point ends all that was pleasurable about that notable celebration of mr whittiers seventieth birthday because i got up at that point and followed winter with what i have no doubt i supposed would be the gem of the evening the gay oration above quoted from the boston paper i had written it all out the day before and had perfectly memorized it and i stood up there at my genial and happy and selfsatisfied ease and began to deliver it those majestic guests that row of venerable and still active volcanoes listened as did everybody else in the house with attentive interest well i delivered myself of well say the first two hundred words of my speech i was expecting no returns from that part of the speech but this was not the case as regarded the rest of it i arrived now at the dialogue the old miner said you are the fourth im going to move the fourth what said i he answered the fourth littery man that has been here in twentyfour hours i am going to move why you dont tell me said i who were the others mr longfellow mr emerson mr oliver wendell holmes consound the lot now then the houses attention continued but the expression of interest in the faces turned to a sort of black frost i wondered what the trouble was i didnt know i went on but with difficulty i struggled along and entered upon that miners fearful description of the bogus emerson the bogus holmes the bogus longfellow always hoping but with a gradually perishing hope that somebody would laugh or that somebody would at least smile but nobody did i didnt know enough to give it up and sit down i was too new to public speaking and so i went on with this awful performance and carried it clear through to the end in front of a body of people who seemed turned to stone with horror it was the sort of expression their faces would have worn if i had been making these remarks about the deity and the rest of the trinity there is no milder way in which to describe the petrified condition and the ghastly expression of those people when i sat down it was with a heart which had long ceased to beat i shall never be as dead again as i was then i shall never be as miserable again as i was then i speak now as one who doesnt know what the condition of things may be in the next world but in this one i shall never be as wretched again as i was then howells who was near me tried to say a comforting word but couldnt get beyond a gasp there was no use he understood the whole size of the disaster he had good intentions but the words froze before they could get out it was an atmosphere that would freeze anything if benvenuto cellinis salamander had been in that place he would not have survived to be put into cellinis autobiography there was a frightful pause there was an awful silence a desolating silence then the next man on the list had to get up there was no help for it that was bishop bishop had just burst handsomely upon the world with a most acceptable novel which had appeared in the atlantic monthly a place which would make any novel respectable and any author noteworthy in this case the novel itself was recognized as being without extraneous help respectable bishop was away up in the public favor and he was an object of high interest consequently there was a sort of national expectancy in the air we may say our american millions were standing from maine to texas and from alaska to florida holding their breath their lips parted their hands ready to applaud when bishop should get up on that occasion and for the first time in his life speak in public it was under these damaging conditions that he got up to make good as the vulgar say i had spoken several times before and that in the reason why i was able to go on without dying in my tracks as i ought to have done but bishop had had no experience he was up facing those awful deities facing those other people those strangers facing human beings for the first time in his life with a speech to utter no doubt it was well packed away in his memory no doubt it was fresh and usable until i had been heard from i suppose that after that and under the smothering pall of that dreary silence it began to waste away and disappear out of his head like the rags breaking from the edge of a fog and presently there wasnt any fog left he didnt go on he didnt last long it was not many sentences after his first before he began to hesitate and break and lose his grip and totter and wobble and at last he slumped down in a limp and mushy pile well the programme for the occasion was probably not more than onethird finished but it ended there nobody rose the next man hadnt strength enough to get up and everybody looked so dazed so stupefied paralyzed it was impossible for anybody to do anything or even try nothing could go on in that strange atmosphere howells mournfully and without words hitched himself to bishop and me and supported us out of the room it was very kind he was most generous he towed us tottering away into some room in that building and we sat down there i dont know what my remark was now but i know the nature of it it was the kind of remark you make when you know that nothing in the world can help your case but howells was honest he had to say the heartbreaking things he did say that there was no help for this calamity this shipwreck this cataclysm that this was the most disastrous thing that had ever happened in anybodys history and then he added that is for you and consider what you have done for bishop it is bad enough in your case you deserve to suffer you have committed this crime and you deserve to have all you are going to get but here is an innocent man bishop had never done you any harm and see what you have done to him he can never hold his head up again the world can never look upon bishop as being a live person he is a corpse that is the history of that episode of twentyeight years ago which pretty nearly killed me with shame during that first year or two whenever it forced its way into my mind now then i take that speech up and examine it as i said it arrived this morning from boston i have read it twice and unless i am an idiot it hasnt a single defect in it from the first word to the last it is just as good as good can be it is smart it is saturated with humor there isnt a suggestion of coarseness or vulgarity in it anywhere what could have been the matter with that house it is amazing it is incredible that they didnt shout with laughter and those deities the loudest of them all could the fault have been with me did i lose courage when i saw those great men up there whom i was going to describe in such a strange fashion if that happened if i showed doubt that can account for it for you cant be successfully funny if you show that you are afraid of it well i cant account for it but if i had those beloved and revered old literary immortals back here now on the platform at carnegie hall i would take that same old speech deliver it word for word and melt them till theyd run all over that stage oh the fault must have been with me it is not in the speech at all dictated october in some ways i was always honest even from my earliest years i could never bring myself to use money which i had acquired in questionable ways many a time i tried but principle was always stronger than desire six or eight months ago lieutenantgeneral nelson a miles was given a great dinnerparty in new york and when he and i were chatting together in the drawingroom before going out to dinner he said ive known you as much as thirty years isnt it i said yes thats about it i think he mused a moment or two and then said i wonder we didnt meet in washington in you were there at that time werent you i said yes but there was a difference i was not known then i had not begun to bud i was an obscurity but you had been adding to your fine civil war record you had just come back from your brilliant indian campaign in the far west and had been rewarded with a brigadiergeneralship in the regular army and everybody was talking about you and praising you if you had met me you wouldnt be able to remember it now unless some unusual circumstance of the meeting had burnt it into your memory it is forty years ago and people dont remember nobodies over a stretch of time like that i didnt wish to continue the conversation along that line so i changed the subject i could have proven to him without any trouble that we did meet in washington in but i thought it might embarrass one or the other of us so i didnt do it i remember the incident very well this was the way of it i had just come back from the quaker city excursion and had made a contract with bliss of hartford to write the innocents abroad i was out of money and i went down to washington to see if i could earn enough there to keep me in bread and butter while i should write the book i came across william clinton brother of the astronomer and together we invented a scheme for our mutual sustenance we became the fathers and originators of what is a common feature in the newspaper world now the syndicate we became the old original first newspaper syndicate on the planet it was on a small scale but that is usual with untried new enterprises we had twelve journals on our list they were all weeklies all obscure and poor and all scattered far away among the back settlements it was a proud thing for those little newspapers to have a washington correspondence and a fortunate thing for us that they felt in that way about it each of the twelve took two letters a week from us at a dollar per letter each of us wrote one letter per week and sent off six duplicates of it to these benefactors thus acquiring twentyfour dollars a week to live on which was all we needed in our cheap and humble quarters clinton was one of the dearest and loveliest human beings i have ever known and we led a charmed existence together in a contentment which knew no bounds clinton was refined by nature and breeding he was a gentleman by nature and breeding he was highly educated he was of a beautiful spirit he was pure in heart and speech he was a scotchman and a presbyterian a presbyterian of the old and genuine school being honest and sincere in his religion and loving it and finding serenity and peace in it he hadnt a vice unless a large and grateful sympathy with scotch whiskey may be called by that name i didnt regard it as a vice because he was a scotchman and scotch whiskey to a scotchman is as innocent as milk is to the rest of the human race in clintons case it was a virtue and not an economical one twentyfour dollars a week would really have been riches to us if we hadnt had to support that jug because of the jug we were always sailing pretty close to the wind and any tardiness in the arrival of any part of our income was sure to cause us some inconvenience i remember a time when a shortage occurred we had to have three dollars and we had to have it before the close of the day i dont know now how we happened to want all that money at one time i only know we had to have it clinton told me to go out and find it and he said he would also go out and see what he could do he didnt seem to have any doubt that we would succeed but i knew that that was his religion working in him i hadnt the same confidence i hadnt any idea where to turn to raise all that bullion and i said so i think he was ashamed of me privately because of my weak faith he told me to give myself no uneasiness no concern and said in a simple confident and unquestioning way the lord will provide i saw that he fully believed the lord would provide but it seemed to me that if he had had my experience but never mind that before he was done with me his strong faith had had its influence and i went forth from the place almost convinced that the lord really would provide i wandered around the streets for an hour trying to think up some way to get that money but nothing suggested itself at last i lounged into the big lobby of the ebbitt house which was then a new hotel and sat down presently a dog came loafing along he paused glanced up at me and said with his eyes are you friendly i answered with my eyes that i was he gave his tail a grateful little wag and came forward and rested his jaw on my knee and lifted his brown eyes to my face in a winningly affectionate way he was a lovely creature as beautiful as a girl and he was made all of silk and velvet i stroked his smooth brown head and fondled his drooping ears and we were a pair of lovers right away pretty soon brigadiergeneral miles the hero of the land came strolling by in his blue and gold splendors with everybodys admiring gaze upon him he saw the dog and stopped and there was a light in his eye which showed that he had a warm place in his heart for dogs like this gracious creature then he came forward and patted the dog and said he is very fine he is a wonder would you sell him i was greatly moved it seemed a marvellous thing to me the way clintons prediction had come true i said yes the general said what do you ask for him three dollars the general was manifestly surprised he said three dollars only three dollars why that dog is a most uncommon dog he cant possibly be worth leas than fifty if he were mine i wouldnt take a hundred for him im afraid you are not aware of his value reconsider your price if you like i dont wish to wrong you but if he had known me he would have known that i was no more capable of wronging him than he was of wronging me i responded with the same quiet decision as before no three dollars that is his price very well since you insist upon it said the general and he gave me three dollars and led the dog away and disappeared upstairs in about ten minutes a gentlefaced middleaged gentleman came along and began to look around here and there and under tables and everywhere and i said to him is it a dog you are looking for his face was sad before and troubled but it lit up gladly now and he answered yes have you seen him yes i said he was here a minute ago and i saw him follow a gentleman away i think i could find him for you if you would like me to try i have seldom seen a person look so grateful and there was gratitude in his voice too when he conceded that he would like me to try i said i would do it with great pleasure but that as it might take a little time i hoped he would not mind paying me something for my trouble he said he would do it most gladly repeating that phrase most gladly and asked me how much i said three dollars he looked surprised and said dear me it is nothing i will pay you ten quite willingly but i said no three is the price and i started for the stairs without waiting for any further argument for clinton had said that that was the amount that the lord would provide and it seemed to me that it would be sacrilegious to take a penny more than was promised i got the number of the generals room from the officeclerk as i passed by his wicket and when i reached the room i found the general there caressing his dog and quite happy i said i am sorry but i have to take the dog again he seemed very much surprised and said take him again why he is my dog you sold him to me and at your own price yes i said it is true but i have to have him because the man wants him again what man the man that owns him he wasnt my dog the general looked even more surprised than before and for a moment he couldnt seem to find his voice then he said do you mean to tell me that you were selling another mans dog and knew it yes i knew it wasnt my dog then why did you sell him i said well that is a curious question to ask i sold him because you wanted him you offered to buy the dog you cant deny that i was not anxious to sell him i had not even thought of selling him but it seemed to me that if it could be any accommodation to you he broke me off in the middle and said accommodation to me it is the most extraordinary spirit of accommodation i have ever heard of the idea of your selling a dog that didnt belong to you i broke him off there and said there is no relevancy about this kind of argument you said yourself that the dog was probably worth a hundred dollars i only asked you three was there anything unfair about that you offered to pay more you know you did i only asked you three you cant deny it oh what in the world has that to do with it the crux of the matter is that you didnt own the dog cant you see that you seem to think that there is no impropriety in selling property that isnt yours provided you sell it cheap now then i said please dont argue about it any more you cant get around the fact that the price was perfectly fair perfectly reasonable considering that i didnt own the dog and so arguing about it is only a waste of words i have to have him back again because the man wants him dont you see that i havent any choice in the matter put yourself in my place suppose you had sold a dog that didnt belong to you suppose you oh he said dont muddle my brains any more with your idiotic reasonings take him along and give me a rest so i paid back the three dollars and led the dog downstairs and passed him over to his owner and collected three for my trouble i went away then with a good conscience because i had acted honorably i never could have used the three that i sold the dog for because it was not rightly my own but the three i got for restoring him to his rightful owner was righteously and properly mine because i had earned it that man might never have gotten that dog back at all if it hadnt been for me my principles have remained to this day what they were then i was always honest i know i can never be otherwise it is as i said in the beginning i was never able to persuade myself to use money which i had acquired in questionable ways now then that is the tale some of it is true mark twain
