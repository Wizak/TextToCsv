 helping himself or grant thorntons ambition by horatio alger jr new york helping himself chapter i the ministers son i wish we were not so terribly poor grant said mrs thornton in a discouraged tone is there anything new that makes you say so mother answered the boy of fifteen whom she addressed nothing new only the same old trouble here is a note from mr tudor the storekeeper let me see it mother grant took a yellow envelope from his mothers hand and drew out the inclosure a half sheet of coarse letter paper which contained the following lines july rev john thornton dear sir inclosed you will find a bill for groceries and other goods furnished to you in the last six months amounting to sixtyseven dollars and thirtyfour cents it ought to have been paid before how you a minister of the gospel can justify yourself in using goods which you dont pay for i cant understand if i remember rightly the bible says owe no man anything as i suppose you recognize the bible as an authority i expect you to pay up promptly and oblige yours respectfully thomas tudor grant looked vexed and indignant i think that is an impudent letter mother he said it is right that the man should have his money grant that is true but he might have asked for it civilly without taunting my poor father with his inability to pay he would pay if he could heaven knows he would grant said his mother sighing i would like to give mr tudor a piece of my mind i would rather pay his bill no grant though he is neither kind nor considerate we must admit that his claim is a just one if i only knew where to turn for money have you shown the bill to father asked grant no you know how unpractical your father is it would only annoy and make him anxious and he would not know what to do your poor father has no business faculty he is a very learned man said grant proudly yes he graduated very high at college and is widely respected by his fellow ministers but he has no aptitude for business you have mother if you had been a man you would have done better than he without your good management we should have been a good deal worse off than we are it is the only thing that has kept our heads above water i am glad you think so grant i have done the best i could but no management will pay bills without money it was quite true that the ministers wife was a woman of excellent practical sense who had known how to make his small salary go very far in this respect she differed widely from her learned husband who in matters of business was scarcely more than a child but as she intimated with truth there was something better than management and that was ready cash to support a family on six hundred dollars a year is very hard grant when there are three children resumed his mother i cant understand why a man like father cant command a better salary said grant theres rev mr stentor in waverley gets fifteen hundred dollars salary and i am sure he cant compare with father in ability true grant but your father is modest and not given to blowing his own trumpet while mr stentor from all i can hear has a very high opinion of himself he has a loud voice and thrashes round in his pulpit as if he were a prophet said grant not quite knowing how to finish his sentence your father never was a man to push himself forward he is very modest i suppose that is not the only bill that we owe said grant no our unpaid bills must amount to at least two hundred dollars more answered his mother grant whistled two hundred and sixtyseven dollars seemed to him an immense sum and so it was to a poor minister with a family of three children and a salary of only six hundred dollars where to obtain so large a sum neither grant nor his mother could possibly imagine even if there were anyone to borrow it from there seemed no chance to pay back so considerable a sum mother and son looked at each other in perplexity finally grant broke the silence mother he said one thing seems pretty clear i must go to work i am fifteen well and strong and i ought to be earning my own living but your father has set his heart upon your going to college grant and i should like to go too but if i did it would be years before i could be anything but an expense and a burden and that would make me unhappy you are almost ready for college grant are you not very nearly i could get ready for the september examination i have only to review homer and brush up my latin and your uncle godfrey is ready to help you through that gives me an idea mother it would cost uncle godfrey as much as nine hundred dollars a year over and above all the help i could get from the college funds and perhaps from teaching school this winter now if he would allow me that sum for a single year and let me go to work i could pay up all fathers debts and give him a new start it would save uncle godfrey nine hundred dollars he has set his heart on your going to college i dont think he would agree to help you at all if you disappoint him at any rate i could try the experiment something has got to be done mother yes grant there is no doubt of that mr tudor is evidently in earnest if we dont pay him i think it very likely he will refuse to let us have anything more on credit and you know there is no other grocery store in the village have you any money to pay him on account mother i have eight dollars let me have that and go over and see what i can do with him we cant get along without groceries by the way mother doesnt the parish owe father anything they are about sixty dollars in arrears on the salary and the treasurer is deacon gridley yes then ill tell you what i will do ill first go over to the deacons and try to collect something afterward i will call on mr tudor it is your fathers place to do it but he has no business faculty and could not accomplish anything go then grant but remember one thing what is that mother you have a quick temper my son dont allow yourself to speak hastily or disrespectfully even if you are disappointed mr tudors bill is a just one and he ought to have his money ill do the best i can mother chapter ii grant makes two business calls deacon gridley had a small farm and farming was his chief occupation but he had a few thousand dollars laid away in stocks and bonds and being a thrifty man not to say mean he managed to save up nearly all the interest which he added to his original accumulation he always coveted financial trusts and so it came about that he was parish treasurer it was often convenient for him to keep in his hands for a month at a time money thus collected which ought to have been paid over at once to the minister but the deacon was a thoroughly selfish man and cared little how pressed for money mr thornton might be as long as he himself derived some benefit from holding on to the parish funds the deacon was mowing the front yard of his house when grant came up to his front gate goodmorning deacon gridley said the ministers son mornin grant answered the deacon hows your folks pretty well in health returned grant coming to business at once but rather short of money ministers most genally are said deacon gridley dryly i should think they might be with the small salaries they get said grant indignantly some of em do get poorly paid replied the deacon but i call six hundred dollars a pooty fair income it might be for a single man but when a minister has a wife and three children like my father its pretty hard scratching some folks aint got faculty said the deacon adding complacently it never cost me nigh on to six hundred dollars a year to live the deacon had the reputation of living very penuriously and abram fish who once worked for him and boarded in the family said he was half starved there you get your milk and vegetables off the farm said grant who felt the comparison was not a fair one that makes a great deal of difference it makes some difference the deacon admitted but not as much as the difference in our expenses i didnt spend moren a hundred dollars cash last year this excessive frugality may have been the reason why mrs deacon gridley was always so shabbily dressed the poor woman had not had a new bonnet for five years as every lady in the parish well knew ministers have some expenses that other people dont persisted grant what kind of expenses id like to know they have to buy books and magazines and entertain missionaries and hire teams to go on exchanges thats something admitted the deacon maybe it amounts to twenty or thirty dollars a year more likely a hundred said grant that would be awful extravagant sinful waste if i was a minister id be more keerful well deacon gridley i dont want to argue with you i came to see if you hadnt collected some money for father mr tudor has sent in his bill and he wants to be paid how much is it sixtyseven dollars and thirtyfour cents you dont tell me said the deacon scandalized you folks must be terrible extravagant grant hardly knew whether to be more vexed or amused if wanting to have enough to eat is extravagant he said then we are you must live on the fat of the land grant we havent any of us got the gout nor are likely to have answered grant provoked but let us come back to business have you got any money for father now it so happened that deacon gridley had fifty dollars collected but he thought he knew where he could let it out for one per cent for a month and he did not like to lose the opportunity im sorry to disappoint you grant he answered but folks are slow about payin up and havent you got any money collected asked grant desperately ill tell you what ill do said the deacon with a bright idea ive got fifty dollars of my own say for a month till i can make collections that would be very kind said grant feeling that he had done the deacon an injustice of course the deacon resumed hastily i should have to charge interest in fact i was goin to lend out the money to a neighbor for a month at one per cent but id just as lieve let your father have it at that price isnt that more than legal interest asked grant well you see money is worth good interest nowadays ef your father dont want it no matter i can let the other man have it grant rapidly calculated that the interest would only amount to fifty cents and money must be had i think fatherll agree to your terms he said ill let you know this afternoon all right grant it dont make a mite of difference to me but if your father wants the money hell have to speak for it today ill see that the matter is attended to said grant and he went on his way pleased with the prospect of obtaining money for their impoverished household even on such hard terms next he made his way to mr tudors store it was one of those country variety stores where almost everything in the way of house supplies can be obtained from groceries to dry goods mr tudor was a small man with a parchment skin and insignificant features he was in the act of weighing out a quantity of sugar for a customer when grant entered grant waited till the shopkeeper was at leisure did you want to see me grant said tudor yes mr tudor you sent over a bill to our house this morning and youve come to pay it thats right moneys tight and ive got bills to pay in the city ive got a little money for you on account said grant watching tudors face anxiously how much asked the storekeeper his countenance changing eight dollars eight dollars ejaculated tudor indignantly only eight dollars out of sixtyseven thats a regular imposition and i dont care ef your father is a minister i stick to my words grant was angry but he remembered his mothers injunction to restrain his temper wed like to pay the whole mr tudor if we had the money and do you think i can trust the whole neighborhood and only get one dollar in ten of whats due me spluttered mr tudor ministers ought to set a better example ministers ought to get better pay said grant theres plenty dont get as much as your father when do you expect to pay the rest id like to know i spose you expect me to go on trustin and mebbe six months from now youll pay me another eight dollars said the storekeeper with withering sarcasm i was going to tell you if you hadnt interrupted me said grant that we should probably have some more money for you tomorrow how much twentyfive dollars answered the boy knowing that part of the money borrowed must go in other quarters will that be satisfactory thats more like said tudor calming down ef youll pay that ill give you a leetle more time on the rest do you want anything this mornin ive got some prime butter just come in ill call for some articles this afternoon mr tudor here are the eight dollars please credit us with that sum well ive accomplished something said grant to himself as he plodded homeward chapter iii grant walks to somerset godfrey thornton grants uncle lived in the neighboring town of somerset he was an old bachelor three years older than his brother the minister and followed the profession of a lawyer his business was not large but his habits were frugal and he had managed to save up ten thousand dollars grant had always been a favorite with him and having no son of his own he had formed the plan of sending him to college he was ambitious that he should be a professional man it might have been supposed that he would have felt disposed to assist his brother whose scanty salary he knew was inadequate to the needs of a family but godfrey thornton was an obstinate man and chose to give assistance in his own way and no other it would be a very handsome thing he thought to give his nephew a college education and so indeed it would but he forgot one thing in families of limited means when a boy reaches the age of fifteen or sixteen he is very properly expected to earn something toward the family income and this grant could not do while preparing for college if his uncle could have made up his mind to give his brother a small sum annually to make up for this all would have been well not that this idea had suggested itself to the rev john thornton he felt grateful for his brothers intentions toward grant and had bright hopes of his boys future but in truth pecuniary troubles affected him less than his wife she was the manager and it was for her to contrive and be anxious after grant had arranged the matters referred to in the preceding chapter he told his mother that he proposed to go to somerset to call on his uncle no grant i dont object though i should be sorry to have you lose the chance of an education i have a very fair education already mother of course i should like to go to college but i cant bear to have you and father struggling with poverty if i become a business man i may have a better chance to help you at any rate i can help you sooner if i can only induce uncle godfrey to give you the sum my education would cost him i shall feel perfectly easy you can make the attempt my son but i have doubts about your success grant however was more hopeful he didnt see why his uncle should object and it would cost him no more money it seemed to him very plain sailing and he set out to walk to somerset full of courage and hope it was a pretty direct road and the distance five miles was not formidable to a stronglimbed boy like grant in an hour and a half he entered the village and soon reached the small onestory building which served his uncle as an office entering he saw his uncle busy with some papers at his desk the old lawyer raised his eyes as the door opened so its you grant is it he said nobody sick at home eh no uncle godfrey we are all well i was afraid some one might be sick from your coming over however i suppose you have some errand in somerset my only errand is to call upon you uncle i suppose i am to consider that a compliment said the old bachelor not ill pleased well and when are you going to be ready for college i can be ready to enter in september replied grant that is good all you will have to do will be to present yourself for examination i shall see you through as i have promised you are very kind uncle godfrey said grant and then he hesitated its thornton family pride grant i want my nephew to be somebody i want you to be a professional man and take a prominent place in the world cant i be somebody without becoming a professional man or or what asked his uncle abruptly getting a college education continued grant what does this mean asked the old lawyer knitting his brow youre not getting off the notion of going to college i hope i should like to go to college uncle im glad to hear that said godfrey thornton relieved i thought you might want to grow up a dunce and become a bricklayer or something of that kind somehow grants task began to seem more difficult than he had anticipated but continued grant summoning up his courage i am afraid it will be rather selfish i cant say i understand you grant as long as i am willing to pay your college bills i dont see why there is anything selfish in your accepting my offer i mean as regards father and mother dont i take you off their hands what do you mean i mean this uncle godfrey said grant boldly i ought to be at work earning money to keep them fathers income is very small and you dont mean to say you want to give up going to college said godfrey thornton hastily i think i ought to uncle why so that i can find work and help father along you see i should be four years in college and three years studying a profession and all that time my brother and sister would be growing older and more expensive and father would be getting into debt uncle godfreys brow wore a perceptible frown tell me who has put this idea into your head he said i am sure it isnt your father no one put it into my head uncle godfrey its my own idea humph old heads dont grow on young shoulders evidently you are a foolish boy grant with a liberal education you can do something for your family but it is so long to wait objected grant it will be a great disappointment to me to have you give up going to college but of course i cant force you to go said his uncle coldly it will save me three hundred dollars a year for four yearsi may say for seven however you will be throwing away a grand opportunity dont think i undervalue the advantage of a college training uncle said grant eagerly it isnt that its because i thought i might help father in fact i wanted to make a proposal to you what is it you say it will cost three hundred dollars a year to keep me in college well would you be willing to give father two hundred a year for the next four years and let me take care of myself in some business place so this is your proposal is it yes sir all i have got to say is that you have got uncommon assurance you propose to defeat my cherished plan and want me to pay two hundred dollars a year in acknowledgment of your consideration i am sorry you look upon it in that light uncle godfrey i distinctly decline your proposal if you refuse to go to college i wash my hands of you and your family do you understand that yes uncle godfrey answered grant crestfallen go home and think over the matter my offer still holds good you can present yourself at college in september and if you are admitted notify me the lawyer turned back to his writing and grant understood that the interview was over in sadness he started on his return walk from somerset he had accomplished nothing except to make his uncle angry he could not make up his mind what to do he had walked about four miles when his attention was sharply drawn by a cry of terror looking up quickly he saw a girl of fourteen flying along the road pursued by a drunken man armed with a big club they were not more than thirty feet apart and the situation was critical grant was no coward and he instantly resolved to rescue the girl if it were a possible thing chapter iv a timely rescue i will save her if i can said grant to himself the task however was not an easy one the drunken man was tall and strongly made and his condition did not appear to interfere with his locomotion he was evidently half crazed with drink and his pursuit of the young girl arose probably from a blind impulse but it was likely to be none the less serious for her grant saw at once that he was far from being a match for the drunkard in physical strength if he had been timid a regard for his personal safety would have led him to keep aloof but he would have despised himself if he had not done what he could for the girl stranger though she was who was in such peril it chanced that grant had cut a stout stick to help him on his way this suggested his plan of campaign he ran sideways toward the pursuer and thrust his stick between his legs tripping him up the man fell violently forward and lay as if stunned breathing heavily grant was alarmed at first fearing that he might be seriously hurt but a glance assured him that his stupor was chiefly the result of his potations then he hurried to overtake the girl who seeing what had taken place had paused in her flight dont be frightened said grant the man cant get up at present i will see you home if you will tell me where you live i am boarding at mrs grangers quarter of a mile back mamma and i answered the girl the color temporarily banished by fright returning to her cheeks where did you fall in with this man inquired grant i was taking a walk answered the girl and overtook him i did not take much notice of him at first and was not aware of his condition till he began to run after me then i was almost frightened to death and i dont think i ever ran so fast in my life you were in serious danger he was fast overtaking you i saw that he was and i believe i should have dropped if you had not come up and saved me how brave you were grant colored with pleasure though he disclaimed the praise oh it was nothing he said modestly but we had better start at once for he may revive oh let us go then exclaimed the girl in terror and hardly knowing what she did she seized grants arm see he is beginning to stir do come quickly clinging to grants arm the two hastened away leaving the inebriate on the ground grant now had leisure to view more closely the girl he had rescued she was a very pretty girl a year or two younger than himself with a bright vivacious manner and her young rescuer thought her very attractive do you live round here she asked i live in colebrook the village close by i was walking from somerset i should like to know the name of the one who has done me so great a service we will exchange names if you like said grant smiling my name is grant thornton i am the son of rev john thornton who is minister in colebrook so you are a ministers son i have always heard that ministers sons are apt to be wild said the girl smiling mischievously i am an exception said grant demurely i am ready to believe it returned his companion my name is carrie clifton my mother is a ministers daughter so i have a right to think well of ministers families how long have you been boarding in this neighborhood miss carrie only a week i am afraid i shant dare to stay here any longer it is not often you would meet with such an adventure as this i hope you wont allow it to frighten you away do you know that drunken man does he live nearby i think he is a stranger a tramp i never saw him before and i know almost everybody who lives about here i am glad he doesnt live here he will probably push on his way and not come this way again during the summer i hope you are right he might try to revenge himself on you for tripping him up i dont think he saw me to recognize me he was so drunk that he didnt know what he was about when he gets over his intoxication he probably wont remember anything that has happened by this time they had reached the gate of the farmhouse where carrie was boarding and grant prepared to leave her i think you are safe now he said oh but i shant let you go yet said the girl you must come in and see mother grant hesitated but he felt that he should like to meet the mother of a young lady who seemed to him so attractive and he allowed himself to be led into the yard mrs clifton was sitting in a rustic chair under a tree behind the house there grant and his companion found her carrie poured forth her story impetuously and then drawing grant forward indicated him as her rescuer her mother listened with natural alarm shuddering at the peril from which her daughter had so happily escaped i cannot tell how grateful i am to you for the service you have done my daughter she said warmly you are a very brave boy there is not one in ten who would have had the courage to act as you did you praise me more than i deserve mrs clifton i saw the man was drunk and i did not really run much risk in what i did i am very thankful that i was able to be of service to miss carrie it is most fortunate that you were at hand my daughter might have been killed what do you think mother he is a ministers son said carrie vivaciously that certainly is no objection in my eyes said mrs clifton smiling for i am a ministers daughter where does your father preach his church is only a mile distant in the village i shall hear him then next sunday last sunday carrie and i were both tired and remained at home but i have always been accustomed to go to church somewhere papa will be here next sunday said carrie he can only come saturday night on account of his business does he do business in new york asked grant yes his store is on broadway we live on madison avenue and whenever you are in the city we shall be very glad to have you call said mrs clifton graciously thank you i should like to call very much answered grant who was quite sincere in what he said but i dont often go to new york perhaps you will get a place there some time suggested carrie i should like to replied grant then your father does not propose to send you to college it was mrs clifton who said this he wishes me to go but i think i ought to go to work to help him he has two other children besides me is either one a girl asked carrie yes i have a sister of thirteen named mary i wish you would bring her here to see me said carrie i havent got acquainted with any girls yet mrs clifton seconded the invitation and grant promised that he would do so in fact he was pleased at the opportunity it would give him of improving his acquaintance with the young lady from new york he returned home very well pleased with his trip to somerset though he had failed in the object of his expedition chapter v mrs thorntons pearls the next sunday mrs clifton and her daughter appeared at church and grant had the pleasure of greeting them he was invited with his sister to take supper with them on the next monday afternoon and accepted the invitation about sunset he met his new friends walking with the addition of the husband and father who coming saturday evening from new york had felt too fatigued to attend church mr clifton to whom he was introduced was a portly man in middle life who received grant quite graciously and made for himself acknowledgment of the service which our hero had rendered his daughter if i ever have the opportunity of doing you a favor master thornton you may call upon me with confidence he said grant thanked him and was better pleased than if he had received an immediate gift meanwhile deacon gridley kept his promise and advanced the minister fifty dollars deducting a months interest even with this deduction mrs thornton was very glad to obtain the money part of it was paid on account to mr tudor and silenced his importunities for a time as to his own plans there was nothing for grant to do except to continue his studies as he might enter college after all if any employment should offer of a remunerative character he felt that it would be his duty to accept it in spite of his uncles objections but such chances were not very likely to happen while he remained in the country for obvious reasons three weeks passed and again not only mr tudor but another creditor began to be troublesome how soon is your father going to pay up his bill asked tudor when grant called at the store for a gallon of molasses very soon i hope faltered grant i hope so too answered the grocer grimly only three weeks ago i paid you thirtythree dollars said grant and you have been increasing the balance ever since said tudor frowning if father could get his salary regularly commenced grant thats his affair not mine rejoined the grocer i have to pay my bills regular and i cant afford to wait months for my pay grant looked uncomfortable but did not know what to say the short and the long of it is that after this week your father must either pay up his bill or pay cash for what articles he gets hereafter very well said grant coldly he was too proud to remonstrate moreover though he felt angry he was constrained to admit that the grocer had some reason for his course something must be done he said to himself but he was not wise enough to decide what that something should be though he regretted to pain his mother he felt obliged to report to her what the grocer had said dont be troubled mother he said as he noticed the shade of anxiety which came over her face something will turn up mrs thornton shook her head it isnt safe to trust to that grant she said we must help ourselves i wish i knew how said grant perplexed i am afraid i shall have to make a sacrifice said mrs thornton not addressing grant but rather in soliloquy grant looked at his mother in surprise what sacrifice could she refer to did she mean that they must move into a smaller house and retrench generally that was all that occurred to him we might perhaps move into a smaller house mother said he but we have none too much room here and the difference in rent wouldnt be much i didnt mean that grant listen and i will tell you what i do mean you know that i was named after a rich lady the friend of my mother i have heard you say so when she died she left me by will a pearl necklace and pearl bracelets both of very considerable value i have never seen you wear them mother no i have not thought they would be suitable for the wife of a poor minister my wearing them would excite unfavorable comment in the parish i dont see whose business it would be said grant indignantly at any rate just or not i knew what would be said mrs thornton replied how is it you have never shown the pearl ornaments to me mother you were only five years old when they came to me and i laid them away at once and have seldom thought of them since i have been thinking that as they are of no use to me i should be justified in selling them for what i can get and appropriating the proceeds toward paying your fathers debts how much do you think they are worth mother a lady to whom i showed them once said they must have cost five hundred dollars or more grant whistled do you mind showing them to me mother he asked mrs thornton went upstairs and brought down the pearl necklace and bracelets they were very handsome and grant gazed at them with admiration i wonder what the ladies would say if you should wear them to the sewing circle he said humorously they would think i was going over to the vanities of this world responded his mother smiling they can be of no possible use to me now or hereafter and i believe it will be the best thing i can do to sell them where can you sell them no one here can afford to buy them they must be sold in new york and i must depend upon you to attend to the business for me can you trust me mother wouldnt father your father has no head for business grant he is a learned man and knows a great deal about books but of practical matters he knows very little you are only a boy but you are a very sensible and trustworthy boy and i shall have to depend upon you i will do the best i can mother only tell me what you want me to do i wish you to take these pearls and go to new york you can find a purchaser there if anywhere i suppose it will be best to take them to some jewelry store and drive the best bargain you can when do you wish me to go mother there can be no advantage in delay if tomorrow is pleasant you may as well go then shall you tell father your plan no grant it might make him feel bad to think i was compelled to make a sacrifice which after all is very little of a sacrifice to me years since i decided to trouble him as little as possible with matters of business it could do no good and by making him anxious unfitted him for his professional work mrs thorntons course may not be considered wise by some but she knew her husbands peculiar mental constitution and her object at least was praiseworthy to screen him from undue anxiety though it involved an extra share for herself the next morning grant took an early breakfast and walked briskly toward the depot to take the first train for new york the fare would be a dollar and a quarter each way for the distance was fifty miles and this both he and his mother felt to be a large outlay if however he succeeded in his errand it would be wisely spent and this was their hope at the depot grant found tom calder a youth of eighteen who had the reputation of being wild and had been suspected of dishonesty he had been employed in the city so that grant was not surprised to meet him at the depot hello grant where are you bound he asked i am going to new york what for a little business grant answered evasively tom was the last person he felt inclined to take into his confidence goin to try to get a place if any good chance offers i shall accept it that is if father and mother are willing lets take a seat together thats what im going for myself chapter vi grant gets into unexpected trouble tom calder was not the companion grant would have chosen but there seemed no good excuse for declining his company he belonged to a rather disreputable family living in the borders of the village if this had been all it would not have been fair to object to him but tom himself bore not a very high reputation he had been suspected more than once of stealing from his school companions and when employed for a time by mr tudor in the village store the latter began to miss money from the till but tom was so sly that he had been unable to bring the theft home to him however he thought it best to dispense with his services what kind of a situation are you goin to try for asked tom when they were fairly on their way i dont know they say that beggars mustnt be choosers i want to get into a brokers office if i can said tom do you consider that a very good business asked grant i should say so responded tom emphatically do they pay high wages not extra but a feller can get points and make something out of the market whats that asked grant puzzled oh i forgot you aint used to the city responded tom emphatically i mean you find out when a stock is going up and you buy for a rise but doesnt that take considerable money asked grant wondering how tom could raise money to buy stocks oh you can go to the bucket shops answered tom but what have bucket shops to do with stocks asked grant more than ever puzzled tom burst into a loud laugh aint you jolly green though he ejaculated grant was rather nettled at this i dont see how i could be expected to understand such talk he said with some asperity thats where it is you cant said tom its all like a b c to me and i forgot that you didnt know anything about wall street a bucket shop is where you can buy stock in small lots putting down a dollar a share as margin if stocks go up you sell out on the rise and get back your dollar minus commission suppose they go down then you lose what you put up isnt it rather risky of course theres some risk but if you have a good point there isnt much this was tom calders view of the matter as a matter of fact the great majority of those who visit the bucket shops lose all they put in and are likely sooner or later to get into difficulty so that many employers will at once discharge a clerk or boy known to speculate in this way if i had any money id buy some stock today that is as soon as i get to the city continued tom you couldnt lend me five dollars could you no i couldnt answered grant shortly id give you half the profits i havent got the money grant explained thats a pity the fact is im rather short however i know plenty of fellows in the city and i guess i can raise a tenner or so then your credit must be better in new york than in colebrook thought grant but he forebore to say so grant was rather glad the little package of pearls was in the pocket furthest away from tom for his opinion of his companions honesty was not the highest when half an hour had passed tom vacated his seat im going into the smoking car he said to have a smoke wont you come with me no thank you i dont smoke then its time you began ive got a cigarette for you if youll try it much obliged but i am better off without it youll soon get over that littleboy feeling why boys in the city of half your age smoke i am sorry to hear it well tata ill be back soon grant was not sorry to have tom leave him he didnt enjoy his company and besides he foresaw that it would be rather embarrassing if tom should take a fancy to remain with him in the city he didnt care to have anyone certainly not tom learn on what errand he had come to the city two minutes had scarcely elapsed after tom vacated his seat when a pleasantlooking gentleman of middle age who had been sitting just behind them rose and took the seat beside grant i will sit with you if you dont object said he i should be glad of your company said grant politely you live in the country i infer yes sir i overheard your conversation with the young man who has just left you i suspect you are not very much alike i hope not sir perhaps tom would say the same for he thinks me green there is such a thing as knowing too much that isnt desirable to know so you dont smoke no sir i wish more boys of your age could say as much do i understand that you are going to the city in search of employment that is not my chief errand answered grant with some hesitation still if i could hear of a good chance i might induce my parents to let me accept it where do you live my young friend in colebrook my father is the minister there that ought to be a recommendation for it is to be supposed you have been carefully trained some of our most successful business men have been ministers sons are you in business in new york sir asked grant thinking he had a right by this time to ask a question yes here is my card taking the card grant learned that his companion was mr henry reynolds and was a broker with an office in new street i see you are a broker sir said grant tom calder wants to get a place in a brokers office i should prefer that he would try some other broker said mr reynolds smiling i dont want a boy who deals with the bucket shops at this point tom reentered the car having finished his cigarette observing that his place had been taken he sat down at a little distance when you get ready to take a place said the broker call at my office and though i wont promise to give you a place i shall feel well disposed to if i can make room for you thank you sir said grant gratefully i hope if i ever do enter your employment i shall merit your confidence i have good hopes of it by the way you may as well give me your name i am grant thornton of colebrook said our hero mr reynolds entered the name in a little pocket diary and left the seat which tom calder immediately took whos that old codger he asked the gentleman who has just left me is a new york business man you got pretty thick with him eh we talked a little grant took care not to mention that mr reynolds was a broker as he knew that tom would press for an introduction in that case when they reached new york tom showed a disposition to remain with grant but the latter said wed better separate and we can meet again after we have attended to our business a meeting place was agreed upon and tom went his way now came the difficult part of grants task where should he go to dispose of his pearls he walked along undecided till he came to a large jewelry store it struck him that this would be a good place for his purpose and he entered what can i do for you young man asked a man of thirty behind the counter i have some pearl ornaments i would like to sell said grant indeed said the clerk fixing a suspicious glance upon grant let me see them grant took out the necklace and bracelets and passed them over no sooner had he done so than a showily dressed lady advanced to the place where he was standing and held out her hand for the ornaments exclaiming i forbid you to buy those articles sir they are mine the boy stole them from me and i have followed him here suspecting that he intended to dispose of them that is false exclaimed grant indignantly i never saw that woman before in my life so you are a liar as well as a thief said the woman you will please give me those pearls sir the clerk looked at the two contestants in indecision he was disposed to believe the ladys statement chapter vii mrs simpson comes to grief surely i have a right to my own property said the showily dressed lady in a tone of authority which quite imposed upon the weakminded salesman i dare say you are right maam said he hesitatingly of course i am said she if you give her those pearls which belong to my mother i will have you arrested said grant plucking up spirit hoitytoity said the lady contemptuously i hope you wont pay any regard to what that young thief says the clerk looked undecided he beckoned an older salesman and laid the matter before him the latter looked searchingly at the two grant was flushed and excited and the lady had a brazen front do you claim these pearls madam he said i do she answered promptly how did you come by them they were a wedding present from my husband may i ask your name the lady hesitated a moment then answered mrs simpson where do you live there was another slight hesitation then came the answer no madison avenue now madison avenue is a fashionable street and the name produced an impression on the first clerk i think the pearls belong to the lady he whispered i have some further questions to ask returned the elder salesman in a low voice do you know this boy whom you charge with stealing your property yes answered the lady to grants exceeding surprise he is a poor boy whom i have employed to do errands has he had the run of your house yes thats the way of it he must have managed to find his way to the second floor and opened the bureau drawer where i kept the pearls what have you to say to this asked the elder salesman please ask the lady my name suggested grant dont you know your own name demanded the lady sharply yes but i dont think you do can you answer the boys question mrs simpson of course i can his name is john cavanaugh and the very suit he has on i gave him grant was thunderstruck at the ladys brazen front she was outwardly a fine lady but he began to suspect that she was an impostor i am getting tired of this said the socalled mrs simpson impatiently will you or will you not restore my pearls when we are satisfied that they belong to you madam said the elder salesman coolly i dont feel like taking the responsibility but will send for my employer and leave the matter to him to decide i hope i wont have long to wait sir i will send at once its a pretty state of things when a lady has her own property kept from her said mrs simpson while the elder clerk was at the other end of the store giving some instructions to a boy i dont in the least doubt your claim to the articles mrs simpson said the first salesman obsequiously come boy youd better own up that you have stolen the articles and the lady will probably let you off this time yes i will let him off this time chimed in the lady i dont want to send him to prison if you can prove that i am a thief i am willing to go said grant hotly by this time the elder salesman had come back is your name john cavanaugh my boy he asked no sir did you ever see this lady before no sir the lady threw up her hands in feigned amazement i wouldnt have believed the boy would lie so she said what is your name my name is grant thornton i live in colebrook and my father is rev john thornton i know there is such a minister there to whom do these pearls belong to my mother a likely story that a country ministers wife should own such valuable pearls said mrs simpson in a tone of sarcasm how do you account for it asked the clerk they were given my mother years since by a rich lady who was a good friend of hers she has never had occasion to wear them mrs simpson smiled significantly the boy has learned his story she said i did not give you credit for such an imagination john cavanaugh my name is grant thornton madam said our hero gravely five minutes later two men entered the store one was a policeman the other the head of the firm when grants eye fell on the policeman he felt nervous but when he glanced at the gentleman his face lighted up with pleasure why its mr clifton he said grant thornton said the jeweler in surprise why i thought you will do me justice mr clifton said grant and thereupon he related the circumstances already known to the reader when mrs simpson found that the boy whom she had selected as an easy victim was known to the proprietor of the place she became nervous and only thought of escape it is possible that i am mistaken she said let me look at the pearls again they were held up for her inspection they are very like mine she said after a brief glance but i see there is a slight difference how about the boy madam asked the elder clerk he is the very image of my errand boy but if mr clifton knows him i must be mistaken i am sorry to have given you so much trouble i have an engagement to meet and must go stop madam said mr clifton sternly interposing an obstacle to her departure we cant spare you yet i really must go sir i give up all claim to the pearls that is not sufficient you have laid claim to them knowing that they were not yours officer have you ever seen this woman before yes sir i know her well how dare you insult me demanded mrs simpson but there was a tremor in her voice i give her in charge for an attempted swindle said mr clifton you will have to come with me madam said the policeman you may as well go quietly well the game is up said the woman with a careless laugh it came near succeeding though now my boy said the jeweler i will attend to your business you want to sell these pearls yes sir they are of no use to mother and she needs the money at what do you value them i leave that to you sir i shall be satisfied with what you think them worth the jeweler examined them attentively after his examination was concluded he said i am willing to give four hundred dollars for them of course they cost more but i shall have to reset them that is more than i expected said grant joyfully it will pay all our debts and give us a little fund to help us in future do you wish the money now there might be some risk in a boy like you carrying so much with you what would you advise mr clifton that you take perhaps a hundred dollars and let me bring the balance next saturday night when i come to pass sunday at colebrook thank you sir if it wont be too much trouble for you chapter viii grant takes a decisive step grant came home a messenger of good tidings as his beaming face plainly showed his mother could hardly believe in her good fortune when grant informed her that he had sold the pearls for four hundred dollars why that will pay up all your fathers debts she said and we shall once more feel independent and with a good reserve fund besides suggested grant on saturday evening he called on mr clifton and received the balance of the purchase money on monday with a little list of creditors and his pocket full of money he made a round of calls and paid up everybody including mr tudor i told you the bill would be paid mr tudor he said quietly to the grocer you mustnt feel hard on me on account of my pressing you grant said the grocer well pleased in a conciliatory tone you see i needed money to pay my bills you seemed to think my father didnt mean to pay you said grant who could not so easily get over what he had considered unfriendly conduct on the part of mr tudor no i didnt of course i knew he was honest but all the same i needed the money i wish all my customers was as honest as your folks with this grant thought it best to be contented the time might come again when they would require the forbearance of the grocer but he did not mean that it should be so if he could help it for he was more than ever resolved to give up the project of going to college the one hundred and fifty dollars which remained after paying the debts would tide them over a year but his college course would occupy four and then there would be three years more of study to fit him for entering a profession and so there would be plenty of time for the old difficulties to return if the parish would increase kis fathers salary by even a hundred dollars they might get along but there was such a selfcomplacent feeling in the village that mr thornton was liberally paid that he well knew there was no chance of that upon this subject he had more than one earnest conversation with his mother i should be sorry to have you leave home she said but i acknowledge the force of your reasons i shouldnt be happy at college mother responded grant if i thought you were pinched at home if you were our only child grant it would be different that is true but there are frank and mary who would suffer if i go to work i shall soon be able to help you take care of them you are a good and unselfish boy grant said his mother i dont know about that mother i am consulting my own happiness as well as yours yet you would like to go to college if we had plenty of money not otherwise i dont want to enjoy advantages at the expense of you all your uncle godfrey will be very angry said mrs thornton thoughtfully i suppose he will and i shall be sorry for it i am grateful to him for his good intentions toward me and i have no right to expect that he will feel as i do about the matter if he is angry i shall be sorry but i dont think it ought to influence me you must do as you decide to be best grant it is you who are most interested but suppose you make up your mind to enter upon a business career what chance have you of obtaining a place i shall call upon mr reynolds and see if he has any place for me who is mr reynolds asked his mother in some surprise i forgot that i didnt tell you of the gentleman whose acquaintance i made on my way up to the city he is a wall street broker his attention was drawn to me by something that he heard and he offered to help me if he could to get employment it would cost something to go to new york and after all there is no certainty that he could help you said mrs thornton cautiously that is true mother but i think he would do something for me however grant received a summons to new york on other business mrs simpson as she called herself though she had no right to the name was brought up for trial and grant was needed as a witness of course his expenses were to be paid he resolved to take this opportunity to call at the office of mr reynolds i do not propose to speak of mrs simpsons trial i will merely say that she was found guilty of the charge upon which she had been indicted and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment when grant was released from his duties as witness he made his way to wall street or rather new street which branches out from the great financial thoroughfare and had no difficulty in finding the office of mr reynolds can i see mr reynolds he asked of a young man who was writing at a desk have you come to deliver stock if so i will take charge of it no answered grant i wish to see him personally he is at the stock exchange just at present if you will take a seat he will be back in twenty minutes probably grant sat down and in less than the time mentioned mr reynolds entered the office the broker who had a good memory for faces at once recognized our hero ha my young friend from the country he said would you like to see me when you are at leisure sir answered grant well pleased at the prompt recognition you will not have to wait long amuse yourself as well as you can for a few minutes promptness was the rule in mr reynolds office another characteristic of the broker was that he was just as polite to a boy as to his best customer this is i am quite aware an unusual trait and therefore the more to be appreciated when we meet with it presently mr reynolds appeared at the door of his inner office and beckoned to grant to enter take a seat my young friend he said and now let me know what i can do for you when i met you in the cars said grant you invited me if i ever wanted a position to call upon you and you would see if you could help me very true i did have you made up your mind to seek a place yes sir are your parents willing you should come to new york yes sir that is my mother is willing and my father will agree to whatever she decides to be best so far so good i wouldnt engage any boy who came against his parents wishes now let me tell you that you have come at a very favorable time i have had in my employ for two years the son of an old friend who has suited me in every respect but now he is to go abroad with his father for a year and i must supply his place you shall have the place if you want it nothing would suit me better said grant joyfully do you think i would be competent to fulfill the duties harry becker does not leave me for two weeks he will initiate you into your duties and if you are as quick as i think you are at learning that will be sufficient when shall i come sir next monday morning it is now thursday and that will give you time to remove to the city perhaps i had better come saturday so as to get settled in a boardinghouse before going to work could you recommend some moderate priced boardinghouse mr reynolds for the first week you may come to my house as my guest that will give you a chance to look about you i live at west th street you had better take it down on paper you can come any time on monday that will give you a chance to spend sunday at home and you need not go to work till tuesday grant expressed his gratitude in suitable terms and left the office elated at his good fortune a surprise awaited him at the junction of wall and new streets he came suddenly upon a largesized bootblack whose face looked familiar tom calder he exclaimed is that you chapter ix uncle godfrey parts from grant when tom calder turned round and saw who had addressed him he turned red with mortification and he tried to hide his blacking box he was terribly mortified to have it known that he had been forced into such a business if tom had nothing worse to be ashamed of he need not have blushed but he was suffering from false shame when did you come to the city he stammered only this morning i suppose you are surprised to see me in this business said tom awkwardly there is nothing to be ashamed of said grant it is an honest business its an awful come down for me said tom uncomfortably the fact is ive had hard luck i am sorry to hear that said grant i expected a place in wall street but i came just too late and things are awful dull anyway then i was robbed of my money how much asked grant curiously for he didnt believe a word of it eight dollars and thirtythree cents replied tom glibly i thought you were too smart to be robbed said grant slyly if it had been a green boy from the country like me now it wouldnt have been surprising i was asleep when i was robbed explained tom hurriedly a fellow got into my room in the night and picked my pocket i couldnt help that now could i i suppose not so i had to get something to do or go back to colebrook i say grant well dont you tell any of the fellers at home what business im in thats a good fellow i wont if you dont want me to said grant you see its only a few days till i can get something else to do its a great deal better blacking boots than being idle in my opinion said grant thats the way i look at it but you didnt tell me what you came to the city for im coming here for good announced grant you havent got a place have you ejaculated tom in surprise yes i am to enter the office of mr reynolds a stock broker there is his sign you dont say so i why thats just the sort of place i wanted how did you get the chance i got acquainted with mr reynolds on board the cars that day we came to new york together and you asked him for the place i asked him this morning you might have given me the chance grumbled tom enviously you knew it was the sort of place i was after i dont think i was called upon to do that said grant smiling besides he wouldnt have accepted you why not aint i as smart as you id like to know retorted tom calder angrily he heard us talking in the cars and didnt like what you said what did i say he doesnt approve of boys smoking cigarettes and going to bucket shops you spoke of both how did he hear he was sitting just behind us was it that old chap that was sittin with you when i came back from the smoking car yes just my luck said tom ruefully when are you goin to work asked tom after a pause next monday where are you going to board we might take a room together you know it would be kind of social as we both come from the same place it did not occur to grant that the arrangement would suit him at all but he did not think it necessary to say so he only said i am going to mr reynolds house just at first you dont say so why hes taken a regular fancy to you if he has i hope he wont get over it i suppose he lives in a handsome brownstone house uptown very likely ive never seen the house well some folks has luck but i aint one of em grumbled tom your luck is coming i hope tom i wish it would come pretty soon then i say suppose your folks wont let you take the place he asked suddenly brightening up they wont oppose it i thought they wanted you to go to college i cant afford it it would take too long before i could earn anything and i ought to be helping the family im goin to look out for number one said tom shrugging his shoulders thats all i can do toms mother was a hardworking woman and had taken in washing for years but for her the family would often have lacked for food his father was a lazy intemperate man who had no pride of manhood and cared only for himself in this respect tom was like him though the son had not as yet become intemperate i dont think there is any chance of my giving up the place answered grant if i do i will mention your name thats a good fellow grant did not volunteer to recommend tom for he could not have done so with a clear conscience this omission however tom did not notice well tom i must be going goodby and good luck grant went home with a cheerful face and announced his good luck to his mother i am glad you are going to your employers house she said i wish you could remain there permanently so do i mother but i hope at any rate to get a comfortable boarding place tom calder wants to room with me i hope you wont think of it said mrs thornton alarmed not for a moment i wish tom well but i shouldnt like to be too intimate with him and now mother i think i ought to write to uncle godfrey and tell him what i have decided upon that will be proper grant grant wrote the following letter and mailed it at once dear uncle godfrey i am afraid you wont like what i have to tell you but i think it is my duty to the family to give up the college course you so kindly offered me in view of fathers small salary and narrow means i have been offered a place in the office of a stock broker in new york and have accepted it i enter upon my duties next monday morning i hope to come near paying my own way and before very long to help father i know you will be disappointed uncle godfrey and i hope you wont think i dont appreciate your kind offer but i think it would be selfish in me to accept it please do forgive me and believe me to be your affectionate nephew grant thornton in twentyfour hours an answer came to this letter it ran thus nephew grant i would not have believed you would act so foolishly and ungratefully it is not often that such an offer as mine is made to a boy i did think you were sensible enough to understand the advantages of a professional education i hoped you would do credit to the name of thornton and keep up the family reputation as a man of learning and a gentleman but you have a foolish fancy for going into a brokers office and i suppose you must be gratified but you neednt think i will renew my offer i wash my hands of you from this time forth and leave you to your own foolish course the time will come when you will see your folly godfrey thornton grant sighed as he finished reading this missive he felt that his uncle had done him injustice it was no foolish fancy but a conscientious sense of duty which had led him to sacrifice his educational prospects on monday morning he took the earliest train for new york chapter x a day in wall street grant went at once on his arrival in the city to mr reynolds office he had in his hand a wellworn valise containing his small stock of clothing the broker was just leaving the office for the stock exchange as grant entered so you are punctual he said smiling yes sir i always on time that is an excellent habit here harry in answer to this summons harry becker a boy two years older and correspondingly larger than grant came forward he was a pleasantlooking boy and surveyed grant with a friendly glance harry said mr reynolds this is your successor do me the favor of initiating him into his duties so that when you leave me he will be qualified to take your place all right sir the broker hurried over to the exchange and the two boys were left together what is your name asked the city boy grant thornton mine is harry becker are you accustomed to the city no i am afraid you will find me very green answered grant you are not the boy to remain so long said harry scrutinizing him attentively i hope not you are going to europe mr reynolds tells me yes the governor is going to take me the governor my father i mean said harry smiling i suppose you are not sorry to go oh no i expect to have a tiptop time how would you like it very much if i could afford it but at present i would rather fill your place in the office i am the son of a poor country minister and must earn my own living how did you get in with mr reynolds asked harry grant told him is he easy to get along with he inquired a little anxiously he is very kind and considerate still he is stanch and expects a boy to serve him faithfully he has a right to expect that as i am to break you in you had better go about with me everywhere first we will go to the postoffice the two boys walked to nassau street where the new york postoffice was then located harry pointed out the box belonging to the firm and producing a key opened it and took out half a dozen letters there may be some stock orders in these letters he said we will go back to the office give them to mr clark to open and then you can go with me to the stock exchange ten minutes later they entered the large room used by the brokers as an exchange grant looked about him in undisguised astonishment it seemed like a pandemonium the room was full of men shouting gesticulating and acting like crazy men the floor was littered with fragments of paper and on a raised dais were the officers of the exchange the chief among them the chairman calling rapidly the names of a long list of stocks each name was followed by a confused shouting which grant learned afterward to be bids for the stock named there were several groups of brokers each apparently interested in some leading security in each of the galleries one at each end overlooking the stock room curious spectators were watching what was going on harry decker was amused at grants look of surprise and bewilderment youll get used to it in time he said say there is mr reynolds i must speak to him mr reynolds stood near a placard on which in prominent letters was inscribed erie harry handed him a paper which he took glanced at quickly and then resumed his bidding he has just bought one thousand erie said harry aside to grant one thousand yes a thousand shares at fiftyfive fiftyfive dollars yes why that will make fiftyfive thousand dollars ejaculated grant in wonder yes that is one of the orders i brought over just now a man must have a great deal of capital to carry on this business if that is only an item of a single days business yes but not so much as you may imagine i cant explain now but youll understand better as you go on now well go back and see if theres anything to do in the office not long afterward harry had to come back to the exchange again and grant came with him he found something new to surprise him a tall man of dignified presence was walking across the floor when a fellow member with a sly stroke sent his tall hat spinning across the floor when the victim turned the mischiefmaker was intent upon his memorandum book and the tall mans suspicions fell upon a short stout young man beside him with a vigorous sweep he knocked the young mans hat off saying its a poor rule that dont work both ways this led to a little scrimmage in which a dozen were involved the brokers staid middleaged men most of them seemed like a pack of school boys at recess grant surveyed the scene with undisguised astonishment what does it mean harry he asked oh thats a very common occurrence said harry smiling i never saw grown men acting so wont there be a fight oh its all fun the brokers are unlike any other class of men in business hours explained harry its one of the customs of the place just then to his astonishment grant saw his employer mr reynolds pursuing his hat which was rolling over the floor he was about to run to his assistance but harry stopped him no interference is allowed he said leave them to their fun i used to think it strange myself when i first came into the exchange but im used to it now now we may as well go back to the office there is no occasion to follow the boys through the days routine grant found his companion very obliging and very ready to give him the information he needed many boys would have been supercilious and perhaps been disposed to play tricks on a country boy but harry was not one of them he took a friendly interest in grant answered all his questions and did his best to qualify him for the position he was to assume before the office closed grant and his new friend went to the bank to make a deposit of money and checks the deposit amounted to about twenty thousand dollars there must be plenty of money in new york said grant why up in colebrook if a man were worth twenty thousand dollars he would be considered a rich man it takes a good deal more than that to make a man rich in new york in the stock business a man is likely to do a larger business in proportion to his capital than in the mercantile business on their way back from the bank grant came face to face with tom calder tom was busily engaged in talking to a companion some years older than himself and didnt observe grant grant was by no means prepossessed in favor of this young man whose red and mottled face and bold glance made him look far from respectable do you know those fellows asked harry becker the youngest one is from colebrook he is in bad company i hope he is not an intimate friend of yours far from it still i know him and am sorry to see him with such a companion at four oclock mr reynolds proposed to go home he beckoned to grant to accompany him chapter xi grant makes a friend what do you think of your first day in wall street asked mr reynolds kindly i have found it very interesting answered grant do you think you shall like the business yes sir i think so better than if you had been able to carry out your original plan and go to college yes sir under the circumstances for i have a better prospect of helping the family that feeling does you credit have you any brothers and sisters one of each sir i have but one boy now nine years old i am sorry to say he is not strong in body though very bright and quick mentally i wish he were more fond of play and would spend less time in reading and study i dont think that is a common complaint among boys sir no i judge not from my own remembrance and observation my wife is dead and i am such a busy man that i am not able to give my boy as much attention as i wish i could my boys health is the more important to me because i have no other child grants interest was excited and he looked forward to meeting his employers son not without eagerness he had not long to wait the little fellow was in the street in front of the house when his father reached home he was a slender oldfashioned boy in appearance who looked as if he had been in the habit of keeping company with grown people his frame was small but his head was large he was pale and would have been plain but for a pair of large dark eyes lighting up his face welcome home papa he said running up to meet mr reynolds the broker stooped over and kissed his son then he said i have brought you some company herbert this is grant thornton the boy i spoke to you about i am glad to make your acquaintance said the boy with oldfashioned courtesy offering his hand and i am glad to meet you herbert responded grant pleasantly the little boy looked up earnestly in the face of his fathers office boy i think i shall like you he said mr reynolds looked pleased and so did grant i am sure we shall be very good friends said our hero herbert said his father will you show grant the room he is to occupy it is next to mine isnt it papa yes my son come with me said herbert putting his hand in grants i will show you the way grant who was only accustomed to the plain homes in his native village was impressed by the evidence of wealth and luxury observable in the house of the stock broker the room assigned to him was small but it was very handsomely furnished and he almost felt out of place in it but it was not many days to anticipate matters a little before he felt at home herbert took grant afterward into his own room see my books he said leading the way to a bookcase containing perhaps a hundred volumes the majority of a juvenile character but some suited to more mature tastes do you like reading asked grant i have read all the books you see here answered herbert and some of papas besides i like to read better than to play but you ought to spend some of your time in play or you will not grow up healthy that is what papa says i try to play some but i dont care much about it grant was no longer surprised at the little boys delicacy it was clear that he needed more amusement and more exercise perhaps he thought i can induce herbert to exercise more when do you take dinner he asked at halfpast six there is plenty of time then suppose we take a little walk together we shall both have a better appetite i should like to replied herbert that is with you i dont like to walk alone how far is central park from here a little over a mile i have never seen it would you mind walking as far as that oh no so the two boys walked out together they were soon engaged in an animated conversation consisting for the most part of questions proposed by grant and answers given by herbert not far from the park they came to a vacant lot where some boys were playing ball now if we only had a ball herbert said grant we might have a little amusement ive got a ball in my pocket but i dont use it much let me see it herbert produced the ball which proved to be an expensive one better than any grant had ever owned there herbert stand here and i will place myself about fifty feet away now throw it to me no matter how swiftly they were soon engaged in throwing the ball to each other grant was a good ball player and he soon interested the little boy in the sport our hero was pleased to see herberts quiet listless manner exchanged for the animation which seemed better suited to a boy you are improving herbert he said after a while you would make a good player in time i never liked it before said the little boy i never knew there was so much fun in playing ball we shall have to try it every day i suppose it is about time to go home to supper and we havent been to central park after all that will do for another day are boys allowed to play ball in the park two afternoons in the week i believe but i never played there we shall have to try it some day i should like to play with you they reached home in full time for dinner at the dinner table mr reynolds was struck by the unusually bright and animated face of his son and his good appetite what have you been doing to make you so hungry herbert he asked i took a walk with grant and we had a fine game of ball i am glad to hear it said the broker much pleased if you want to become stout and strong like grant that is the best thing for you to do i never liked playing ball before papa that is a compliment to you grant said the broker smiling i think he said to the prim elderly lady who presided over the household acting as housekeeper herbert will be the better for having a boy in the house i dont know about that said mrs estabrook stiffly when he came into the house he had mud on his clothes he never did that till this boy came i wont complain of that if his health is improved mrs estabrook who was a poor relation of herberts mother pursed up her mouth but did not reply in her eyes it was more important that a boy should keep his clothes whole and clean than to have color in his cheeks and health in his frame i hope that boy wont stay here long she thought referring of course to grant hell quite spoil herbert by making him rough and careless of his appearance well herbert and how do you like grant asked mr reynolds as his son was bidding him goodnight before going to bed i am so glad you brought him here papa i shall have good times now youll let him stay all the time wont you ill see about it herbert answered his father smiling chapter xii mrs estabrooks plans grant was going home with mr reynolds at the close of the fourth day when it occurred to him to say what had been in his mind for some time isnt it time mr reynolds for me to be looking out for a boarding place the broker smiled and said with assumed concern are you dissatisfied with your present boarding place how could i be sir returned grant earnestly but you told me i could stay with you a week while i was looking about for a suitable place to board that is true now however there is a difficulty about your making a change what is that sir herbert would not give his consent the fact is grant herbert finds so much pleasure in your society and derives so much advantage from the increased exercise you lead him to take that i think you will have to make up your mind to stay grants face showed the pleasure he felt i shall be very glad to stay mr reynolds he answered if you are willing to have me i had this in view from the first said the broker but i wanted to see how you and herbert got along i wished to be sure also that your influence on him would be good of that i can have no doubt and i am glad to receive you as a member of my family there was one member of the household however who was not so well pleased with the proposed arrangement this was mrs estabrook the housekeeper as the week drew to a close she said one evening after the boys had retired how much longer is the office boy to stay here mr reynolds why do you ask inquired the broker only with reference to domestic arrangements answered the housekeeper disconcerted he will remain for a considerable time mrs estabrook i i thought he was only going to stay a week he is company for herbert and i think it desirable to keep him herbert soils his clothes a deal more now than he used to do said the housekeeper discontentedly i am sure i dont know where the other boy carries him nor i but i am not afraid to trust him with grant as to the clothes i consider them of very small account compared with my boys health mrs estabrook knitted in silence for five minutes she was by no means pleased with her employers plan having taken a dislike to grant for which indeed her chief reason was jealousy she had a stepson a young man of twentyone in mr reynolds office whom she would like to have in the house in place of grant but mr reynolds had never taken notice of her occasional hints to that effect the housekeepers plans were farreaching she knew that herbert was delicate and doubted if he would live to grow up in that case supposing her stepson had managed to ingratiate himself with the broker why might he not hope to become his heir now this interloper as she called grant had stepped into the place which her own favorite his name was willis ford should have had mrs estabrook felt aggrieved and unjustly treated and naturally incensed at grant who was the unconscious cause of her disappointment she returned to the charge though had she been wiser she would have foreborne do you think a poor boy like this grant thornton is a suitable companion for a rich mans son mr reynolds excuse me for suggesting it but i am so interested in dear herbert grant thornton is the son of a country minister and has had an excellent training said the broker coldly the fact that he is poor is no objection in my eyes i think mrs estabrook we will dismiss the subject i think myself competent to choose my sons associates i hope you will excuse me said the housekeeper seeing that she had gone too far i am so attached to the dear child if you are you will not object to the extra trouble you may have with his clothes since his health is benefited that artful young beggar has wound his way into his employers confidence thought mrs estabrook resentfully but it may not be always so a few minutes later when the housekeeper was in her own sittingroom she was told that willis ford wanted to see her mrs estabrooks thin face lighted up with pleasure for she was devotedly attached to her stepson bring him up here at once she said a minute later the young man entered the room he was a thin sallowcomplexioned young man with restless black eyes and a discontented expression as of one who thinks he is not well used by the world welcome my dear boy said the housekeeper warmly i am so glad to see you willis submitted reluctantly to his stepmothers caress and threw himself into a rocking chair opposite her are you well willis asked mrs estabrook anxiously yes im well enough muttered the young man i thought you looked out of sorts i feel so is anything the matter yes im sick of working at such starvation wages i thought fifteen dollars a week a very good salary only last january you were raised three dollars and i expected to be raised three dollars more on the first of july did you apply to mr reynolds yes and he told me i must wait till next january i think he might have raised you if only on account of the connection between our families perhaps he would if you would ask him mother i will when there is a good opportunity still willis i think fifteen dollars a week very comfortable you dont know a young mans expenses mother how much do you pay for board willis six dollars a week i have a room with a friend or i should have to pay eight that leaves you nine dollars a week for all other expenses i think you might save something out of that i cant i have clothes to buy and sometimes i want to go to the theatre and in fact nine dollars dont go as far as you think of course a woman doesnt need to spend much its different with a young man your income would be a good deal increased if you had no board to pay of course you dont know any generous minded person who will board me for nothing do you theres a new office boy in your office isnt there yes a country boy did you know he was boarding here no is he mr reynolds told me tonight he was going to keep him here permanently as a companion for his little son lucky for him i wish mr reynolds would give you a home here i would rather he would make it up in money and let me board where i please but you forget it would give you a chance to get him interested in you and if herbert should die you might take his place as heir that would be a splendid idea but theres no prospect of it it isnt for me it may be for the office boy hes an artful boy and thats what hes working for in my opinion i didnt think the little beggar was so evilheaded he seems quiet enough still waters run deep youd better keep an eye on him and ill do the same i will the next day grant was puzzled to understand why willis ford spoke so sharply to him and regarded him with such evident unfriendliness what have i done to offend you he thought chapter xiii two views of tom calder thus far nothing had been said about the compensation grant was to receive for his work in the brokers office he did not like to ask especially as he knew that at the end of the first week the matter would be settled when he found that he was to remain for the present at the house of his employer he concluded that his cash pay would be very small perhaps a dollar a week however that would be doing quite as well as if he paid his own board elsewhere while he enjoyed a much more agreeable and luxurious home he would be unable to assist his father for a year or two but that was only what he had a right to expect when saturday afternoon came mr reynolds said by the way grant i must pay you your weeks wages i believe no sum was agreed upon no sir we will call it six dollars will that be satisfactory very much so mr reynolds but there will be a deduction for board mr reynolds smiled that is a different matter he said that comes to you as herberts companion it is worth that to me to have my boys happiness increased grant was overjoyed at the bright prospect opened before him and he said with glowing face you are very kind mr reynolds now i shall be able to help my father that is very creditable to you my boy willis you may pay grant six dollars willis ford did so but he looked very glum he estimated that including his board grant would be in receipt of twelve dollars a week or its equivalent and this was only three dollars less than he himself received who had been in the office five years and was a connection of the broker its a shame he thought that this green country boy should be paid nearly as much as i i must call and tell mother grant was a very happy boy that evening he resolved to lay aside three dollars a week to send to his mother to save up a dollar a week and deposit it in some savings bank and make the other two dollars answer for his clothing and miscellaneous expenses on the next monday afternoon grant walked home alone mr reynolds having some business which delayed him he thought he would walk up broadway as there was much in that crowded thoroughfare to amuse and interest him just at the corner of canal street he came across tom calder tom was standing in a listless attitude with his hands in his pockets with apparently no business cares weighing upon his mind hello grant he said with sudden recognition how are you tom im all right but im rather hard up grant was not surprised to hear that you see theres a feller owes me seven dollars and i cant get it till next week continued tom watching grants face to see if he believed it grant did not believe it but did not think it necessary to say so thats inconvenient he remarked i should say it was you couldnt lend me a couple of dollars could you i dont think i could tom looked disappointed how much do you get he asked six dollars a week thats pretty good for a boy like you i wish youd take a room with me it would come cheaper i shall stay where i am for the present said grant he did not care to mention unless he were asked that he was making his home at the house of mr reynolds as it might either lead to a call from tom whom he did not particularly care to introduce to his new friends or might lead to a more pressing request for a loan where are you boarding asked grant after a pause in clinton place i have a room there and get my meals where i like theres a chap from your office that lives in the same house who is it asked grant anxiously its willis ford is that so returned grant in surprise do you know him only a little i dont like him hes too stuck up grant made no comment but in his heart he agreed with tom are you doing anything he asked not just yet answered tom i expect a good job soon you havent a quarter to spare have you grant produced the desired sum and handed it to his companion he didnt fancy tom but he was willing to help him in a small way thanks said tom thatll buy my supper ill give it back to you in a day or two grant did not think there was much likelihood of that but felt that he could afford to lose this small sum four days later he met tom in wall street but what a change he was attired in a new suit wore a fancy necktie while a chain that looked like gold dangled from his watch pocket grant stared at him in amazement how are you grant said tom patronizingly very well thank you i hope you are adoin well very well you seem to be prosperous yes answered tom languidly evidently enjoying his surprise i told you i expected to get into something good by the way i owe you a quarter there it is much obliged for the accommodation grant pocketed the coin which he had never expected to receive and continued to regard tom with puzzled surprise he could not understand what business tom could have found that had so altered his circumstances he ventured to inquire i wouldnt mind tellin you answered tom but you see its kind of confidential im a confidential agent thats it it seems to be a pretty good business remarked grant yes it is i dont work for nothin i can tell you that im glad of your good luck tom said grant and he spoke sincerely i hope youll keep your agency oh i guess i will a feller like me is pretty sure of a good livin anyway hello jim this last was addressed to a flashily dressed individual the same one in fact that grant had seen on a former occasion with tom whos your friend asked jim with a glance at grant grant thornton hes from my place in the country hes in the office of mr reynolds a broker in new street introduce me grant let me make you acquainted with my friend jim morrison said tom with a flourish glad to make your acquaintance mr thornton said jim morrison jauntily offering his hand thank you said grant in a reserved tone for he was not especially attracted by the look of toms friend he shook hands however come round and see us some evenin grant said tom well take you round wont we jim of course we will your friend should see something of the city youre the feller that can show him well we must be goin its lunch time tom pulled out a watch which if not gold was of the same color as gold and the two sauntered away what in the world can tom have found to do grant wondered chapter xiv willis fords new friends when harry decker left the office at the end of two weeks grant was fully able to take his place having with harrys friendly assistance completely mastered the usual routine of a brokers office he had also learned the names and offices of prominent operators and was in all respects qualified to be of service to his employer mr reynolds always treated him with friendly consideration and appeared to have perfect confidence in him for some reason which he could not understand however willis ford was far from cordial often addressing him in a faultfinding tone which at first disturbed grant when he found that it arose from fords dislike he ceased to trouble himself about it though it annoyed him he had discovered fords relationship to mrs estabrook who treated him in the same cool manner as it appears i cant please them grant said to himself i wont make any special effort to do so he contented himself with doing his work faithfully and so satisfying his own conscience one evening some weeks later grant was returning from a concert to which the broker had given him a ticket when to his great surprise he met willis ford walking with tom calder and jim morrison the three were apparently on intimate terms goodevenin grant said tom goodevening tom grant looked at willis ford but the latters lip curled and he did not speak grant however bowed and passed on he was surprised at the intimacy which had grown up between ford and those two knowing fords spirit of exclusiveness he would have been less surprised had he known that morrison had first ingratiated himself with ford by offering to lend him money and afterward had lured him into a gambling house where ford not knowing that he was a dupe had been induced to play and was now a loser to the extent of several hundred dollars for which morrison held his notes i dont know when i can pay you said ford gloomily when he came to realize his situation oh something will turn up said jim morrison lightly i shant trouble you two weeks later however he lay in wait for ford when he left wall street i want to speak to you a moment mr ford he said well what is it asked ford uncomfortably i am hard up so am i responded willis ford but you owe me a matter of six hundred dollars i know it but you said you wouldnt trouble me i didnt expect i should be obliged to said morrison smoothly but circumstances alter cases you know i shall have to ask you for it thats all the good it will do said willis irritably i havent a cent to my name when do you expect to have heaven knows i dont ford was about to leave his companion and walk away but morrison had no intention of allowing the matter to end so he laid his hand on fords shoulder and said firmly mr ford this wont do yours is a debt of honor and must be paid will you be kind enough to let me know how it is to be paid demanded ford with an ugly sneer that is your business not mine mr ford then if it is my business ill give you notice when i can pay you and now goodafternoon he made another attempt to walk away but again there was a hand placed upon his shoulder understand mr ford that i am in earnest said morrison i cant undertake to tell you how you are to find the money but it must be found suppose it isnt said ford with a look of defiance then i shall seek an interview with your respected employer tell him of the debt and how it was incurred and i think he would look for another clerk you wouldnt do that said ford his face betraying consternation i would and i will unless you pay what you owe me but man how am i to do it you will drive me to desperation take three days to think of it if you cant raise it i may suggest a way the two parted and willis ford was left to many uncomfortable reflections he knew of no way to raise the money yet if he did not do it he was menaced with exposure and ruin would his stepmother come to his assistance he knew that mrs estabrook had a thousand dollars in government bonds if he could only induce her to give him the custody of them on any pretext he could meet the demand upon him and he would never again incur a debt of honor he cursed his folly for ever yielding to the temptation once let him get out of this scrape and he would never get into another like it the next evening he made a call upon mrs estabrook and made himself unusually agreeable the coldhearted woman whose heart warmed to him alone smiled upon him with affection i am glad to see you in such good spirits willis she said if she only knew how i really felt thought her stepson but it was for his interest to wear a mask the fact is mother he said i feel very cheerful ive made a little turn in stocks and realized three hundred dollars have you indeed willis i congratulate you my son no doubt you will find the money useful no doubt of that if i had the capital i could make a good deal more but there would be the danger of losing suggested mrs estabrook that danger is very small mother i am in a situation to know all about the course of stocks i wouldnt advise another to speculate unless he has some friend in the stock exchange but for me it is perfectly safe pray be careful willis oh yes i am sure to be by the way mother havent you got some money in government bonds a little answered mrs estabrook cautiously how much now about a thousand dollars let me manage it for you and i will make it two thousand inside of a month mrs estabrook had a large share of acquisitiveness but she had also a large measure of caution which she had inherited from her scotch ancestry no willis she said shaking her head i cant take any risk this money it has taken me years to save it is the sole dependence i have for my old age and i cant run the risk of losing it but two thousand dollars will be better than one mother just let me tell you what happened to a customer of ours he had above five hundred dollars in the savings bank drawing four per cent interest only twenty dollars a year he had a friend in the stock exchange who took charge of it bought stocks judiciously on a margin then reinvested and now after three months how much do you think it amounts to how much asked the housekeeper with interest six thousand five hundred dollars just thirteen times as much answered willis glibly this story by the way was all a fabrication intended to influence his stepmother mrs estabrook never doubted fords statement but her instinctive caution saved her from falling into the trap it looks tempting willis she said but i dont dare to take the risk ford was deeply disappointed but did not betray it it is for you to decide said he carelessly then drifted to other subjects ten minutes later he pressed his hand upon his breast while his features worked convulsively i believe i am sick he said what can i do for you my dear son asked the housekeeper in alarm if you have a glass of brandy gasped willis i will go downstairs and get some she said hurriedly no sooner had she left the room than willis sprang to his feet locked the door then went to the bureau unlocked the upper drawer he had a key in his pocket which fitted the lock and thrusting in his hand drew out a long envelope containing one fivehundreddollar government bond and five bonds of one hundred dollars each which he thrust into his side pocket then closing the drawer he unlocked the door of the room and when his stepmother returned he threw himself back in his chair groaning he took the glass of brandy the housekeeper brought him and after a few minutes professing himself much better left the house saved he exclaimed triumphantly now i shall be all right again chapter xv an artful trap willis ford was anxious to get away he feared that mrs estabrook might go to the bureau and discover the loss before he got out of the house which would make it awkward for him once out in the street he breathed more freely he had enough with him to pay his only debt and give him four hundred dollars extra it might be supposed he would feel some compunction at robbing his stepmother of her all whatever her faults she was devoted to him but willis ford had a hard selfish nature and the only thought that troubled him was the fear that he might be found out indeed the housekeepers suspicions would be likely to fall upon him unless they could be turned in some other direction who should it be there came to him an evil suggestion which made his face brighten with relief and malicious joy the new boy grant thornton was a member of the household he probably had the run of the house what more probable than that he should enter mrs estabrooks chamber and search her bureau this was the way willis reasoned he knew that his stepmother hated grant and would be very willing to believe anything against him he would take care that suspicion should fall in that direction he thought of a way to heighten that suspicion what it was my readers will learn in due time the next day at halfpast eight oclock in the morning on his way down broadway willis ford dropped into the grand central hotel and walked through the reading room in the rear here sat jim morrison and tom calder waiting for him by appointment ford took a chair beside them goodmorning he said cheerfully have you brought the money asked morrison anxiously hush dont speak so loud said ford cautiously we dont want everybody to know our business all right said morrison in a lower voice but have you brought it yes youre a trump said morrison his face expressing his joy that is to say ive brought what amounts to the same thing if its your note said morrison with sharp disappointment i dont want it it isnt a note its what will bring the money what is it then its government bonds for six hundred dollars i dont know anything about bonds said morrison besides the amount is more than six hundred dollars these bonds are worth a hundred and twelve amounting in all to six hundred and seventytwo dollars thats forty more than i owe you i wont make any account of that however as you will have to dispose of them i may get into trouble said morrison suspiciously where did they come from that does not concern you said ford haughtily dont i give them to you but where did you get them that is my business if you dont want them say the word and ill take them back and when will you pay the money i dont know answered ford curtly maybe hell sell em for us himself suggested tom calder good tom why cant you sell em and give me the money then you can pay the exact sum and save the forty dollars i dont choose to do so said ford it seems to me you are treating me in a very strange manner i offer you more than i owe you and you make no end of objections to receiving it i am afraid ill get into trouble if i offer the bonds for sale said morrison doggedly i dont know anybody in the business except you yes you do said ford a bright idea occurring to him who you know the boy in our office grant thornton said tom yes grant thornton manage to see him and ask him to dispose of the bonds for you he will bring them to our office and i will dispose of them without asking any questions first rate said tom thatll do wont it jim i dont see why it wont answered morrison appearing satisfied i would suggest that you see him some time today good hand over the bonds willis ford had already separated the bonds into two parcels six hundred in one and four hundred in the other the first of these he passed over to jim morrison put it into your pocket at once he said we dont want anyone to see them there is a telegraph boy looking at us im going to see if it is all there muttered morrison and he drew from the envelope the two bonds and ascertained by a personal inspection that they were as represented its all right he said you might have taken my word for it said willis ford offended in matters of business i take no ones word chuckled the confidence man i wonder what theyre up to said the little telegraph boy to himself i know one of them fellers is a gambler wonder who that feller with him is them must be govment bonds johnny cavanagh was an observing boy and mentally photographed upon his memory the faces of the entire group though he never expected to see any of them again when grant was hurrying through wall street about noon he came upon tom calder and morrison hello there grant said tom placing his hand upon his shoulder whats the matter tom im in a hurry said grant jim morrisons got a little business for you what is it he wants you to sell govment bonds for him youd better take them round to our office i havent got time said morrison just attend to them like a good fellow and ill give you a dollar for your trouble how much have you got six hundred a five hundred and a one are they yours yes ive had em two years but now ive got to raise money what do you want for them regular price whatever it is when will you call for the money meet me at fifth avenue hotel with it tomorrow morning at nine oclock i shall have to meet you earlier say halfpast eight all right heres the bonds grant put the envelope into his pocket and hurried to the exchange when he returned to the office he carried the bonds to willis ford mr ford he said an acquaintance of mine handed them to me to be sold some one you know queried ford i know him slightly well i suppose its all right ill make out a check to your order and you can collect the money at the bank grant interposed no objection and put the check in his pocket the boys fallen into the trap said willis to himself exultantly as he proceeded to enter the transaction on the books chapter xvi grant falls under suspicion in furtherance of his scheme to throw suspicion upon grant willis ford decided to make another call upon his stepmother the succeeding evening it occurred to him that she might possibly connect his visit of the evening before with her loss and he wished to forestall this is mrs estabrook at home he asked of the servant yes sir when the housekeeper made her appearance he carefully scrutinized her face she was calm and placid and it was clear that she had not discovered the abstraction of the bonds i dare say you are surprised to see me so soon again he commenced i am always glad to see you willis she said come upstairs what a pleasant room you have mother yes i am very comfortable have you had any return of your sickness she asked anxiously no i have been perfectly well by the way mother i have a special object in calling what is it willis i want to speak to you about those bonds of yours if you will only sell them out and invest in erie i am sure you will make in six months a sum equal to several years interest that may be willis but i am very timid about taking a risk those bonds represent all the property i have willis fords conscience pricked him a little when he heard her speaking thus of the property he had so heartlessly stolen but he did not show it in his manner what is the date of your bonds mother he asked i dont know does that make any difference it makes some difference those that have longest to run are most valuable i can easily tell said the housekeeper as she rose from her chair and opened the bureau drawer in full confidence that the bonds were safe it was an exciting moment for willis ford knowing the sad discovery that awaited her she put her hand in that part of the drawer where she supposed the bonds to be and found nothing a shade of anxiety overspread her face and she searched hurriedly in other parts of the drawer dont you find them mother asked willis it is very strange said mrs estabrook half to herself what is strange i always kept the bonds in the righthand corner of this drawer and you cant find them i have looked all over the drawer you may have put them by mistake in one of the other drawers heaven grant it said mrs estabrook her face white with anxiety let me help you mother said willis rising she did not object for her hands trembled with nervousness the other drawers were opened and were thoroughly searched but of course the bonds were not found mrs estabrook seemed near fainting i have been robbed she said i am ruined but who could have robbed you asked ford innocently idontknow oh willis it was cruel and the poor woman burst into tears all these years i have been saving and now i have lost all i shall die in the poorhouse after all not while i am living mother said willis but the bonds must be found they must be mislaid no no they are stolen i shall never see them again but who has taken them ha i have an idea what is it asked the housekeeper faintly that boy grant thornton he lives in the house doesnt he yes answered mrs estabrook in excitement do you think he can have robbed me what a fool i am i ought to have suspected when when what when he brought some bonds to me today to sell he did exclaimed mrs estabrook what were they a fivehundreddollar and a hundreddollar bond i had a fivehundred and five onehundreddollar bonds they were mine the young villain i greatly fear so mother you ought to have kept them willis oh why didnt you where is the boy i will see mr reynolds at once wait a minute till i tell you all i know the boy said the bonds were handed to him by an acquaintance it was a falsehood do you know the number of your bonds mother yes i have them noted down somewhere good i took the number of those the boy gave me for sale mrs estabrook found the memorandum it was compared with one which willis ford brought with him and the numbers were identical four numbers of course were missing from fords list that seems pretty conclusive mother the young rascal has stolen your bonds and offered a part of them for sale it was certainly bold in him to bring them to our office is he in the house ill go and see and bring mr reynolds with you if you can find him in an excited state scarcely knowing what she did the housekeeper went downstairs and found both parties of whom she was in search in the same room she poured out her story in an incoherent manner inveighing against grant as a thief when grant with some difficulty understood what was the charge against him he was almost speechless with indignation do you mean to say i stole your bonds he demanded yes i do and it was a base cruel act i agree with you in that mrs estabrook it was base and cruel but i had nothing to do with it you dare to say that when you brought the bonds to my son willis to be sold today is this true grant asked mr reynolds did you sell any bonds at the office today yes sir the broker looked grave where did you get them he asked they were handed to me by an acquaintance in wall street who was he his name is james morrison what do you know of him is he in any business i know very little of him sir have you handed him the money no sir i am to meet him tomorrow morning at the fifth avenue hotel and pay him why doesnt he call at the office i dont know answered grant puzzled i suggested to him to bring the bonds to the office himself but he said he was in haste and offered me a dollar to attend to the matter this seems a mysterious case excuse me mr reynolds but i think it is plain enough said the housekeeper spitefully that boy opened my bureau drawer and stole the bonds that is not true mr reynolds exclaimed grant indignantly how did you know the bonds were offered for sale at my office today mrs estabrook inquired the broker my son willis ford told me when did you see him just now is he in the house yes sir i left him in my room ask him to be kind enough to accompany you here the housekeeper left the room grant and his employer remained silent during her absence chapter xvii the telltale key willis ford entered the presence of his employer with an air of confidence which he did not feel knowing his own guilt he felt ill at ease and nervous but the crisis had come and he must meet it take a seat mr ford said mr reynolds gravely your stepmother tells me that she has lost some government bonds all i had in the world moaned the housekeeper yes sir i regret to say that she has been robbed i learn moreover that a part of the bonds were brought to my office for sale today yes sir and by grant thornton he can answer that question for himself sir he is present it is true said grant quietly did you ask him where the bonds came from he volunteered the information he said they were intrusted to him for sale by a friend acquaintance corrected grant it may have been so i understood him to say friend you had no suspicions that anything was wrong asked the broker no i felt perfect confidence in the boy grant was rather surprised to hear this if this were the case willis ford had always been very successful in concealing his real sentiments how did you pay him in a check to his own order have you collected the money on that check grant asked mr reynolds yes sir have you paid it out to the party from whom you obtained the bonds no sir i am to meet him tomorrow morning at the fifth avenue hotel willis fords countenance changed when he heard this statement he supposed that jim morrison already had his money and was safely off with it now it was clear that grant would not be allowed to pay it to him and his own debt would remain unpaid that being the case morrison would be exasperated and there was no knowing what he would say what do you know of this man grant very little sir how does he impress you as an honest straightforward man grant shook his head not at all he said yet you took charge of his business for him yes sir but not willingly he offered me a dollar for my trouble and as i did not know there was anything wrong i consented besides here grant paused well will you excuse my continuing mr reynolds no answered the broker firmly on the other hand i insist upon your saying what you had in your mind having seen mr ford in this mans company i concluded he was all right willis ford flushed and looked disconcerted is this true mr ford asked the broker do you know this man what do you say his name was thornton asked ford partly to gain time james morrison yes i know him he was introduced to me by an intimate friend of that boy indicating grant willis ford smiled triumphantly he felt that he had checkmated our hero is this true grant i presume so answered grant coolly you refer to tom calder do you not mr ford i believe that is his name he is not an intimate friend of mine but we came from the same village it is that boy who was with me when i first met you mr reynolds the brokers face cleared yes i remember him but how do you happen to know tom calder mr ford he had a room at the same house with me he introduced himself as a friend of this boy do you know anything of him how he earns his living havent the faintest idea answered ford my acquaintance with him is very slight there seems a mystery here said the broker this morrison gives grant two bonds to dispose of which are identified as belonging to my housekeeper how did he obtain possession of them that is the question there isnt much doubt about that said mrs estabrook this boy whom you have taken into your family has taken them you are entirely mistaken mrs estabrook said grant indignantly of course you say so retorted the housekeeper but it stands to reason that that is the way it happened you took them and gave them to this man that is if there is such a man your son says there is mrs estabrook said the broker quietly well i dont intend to say how it happened likely enough the man is a thief and that boy is his accomplice you will oblige me by not jumping at conclusions mrs estabrook said mr reynolds whoever has taken the bonds is likely to be discovered meanwhile your loss will at all events be partially made up since grant has the money realized from the sale of the greater part of them i should like to place the money in your hands mr reynolds said grant but it belongs to me said the housekeeper that is undoubtedly true said her employer but till the matter is ascertained beyond a doubt i will retain the money how can there be any doubt asked the housekeeper discontented i do not think there is but i will tell you now you claim that your bonds were marked by certain numbers two of which belong to those which were bought by mr ford at the office today yes sir meanwhile you and your stepson have had time to compare notes and you have had a chance to learn his numbers mrs estabrook turned livid i didnt expect to have such a charge brought against me mr reynolds and by you she said her voice trembling with passion i have brought no such charge mrs estabrook i have only explained how there may be doubt of your claim to the money i thought you knew me better sir i think i do and i also think i know grant better than to think him capable of abstracting your bonds yet you have had no hesitation in bringing this serious charge against him that is different sir pardon me i can see no difference he has the same right that you have to be considered innocent till he is proved to be guilty you must admit sir said willis ford that appearances are very much against grant i admit nothing at present for the affair seems to be complicated perhaps mr ford you can offer some suggestion that will throw light upon the mystery i dont think it very mysterious sir my mother kept her bonds in the upper drawer of her bureau this boy had the run of the house what was to prevent his entering my mothers room opening the drawer and taking anything he found of value what was to prevent some one else doing it mr ford myself for example of course that is different mr reynolds well i dont know i am honest and so i believe is grant thank you sir said grant gratefully it just occurred to me said ford to ask my mother if she has at any time lost or mislaid her keys well thought of mr ford and mr reynolds turned to his housekeeper for a reply no answered mrs estabrook i keep my keys in my pocket and i have them there yet so saying she produced four keys attached to a ring then continued ford if grant chances to have a key which will fit the bureau drawer that would be evidence against him show me any keys you may have grant said the broker grant thrust his hand in his pocket and drew out two keys he looked at them in astonishment one of them unlocks my valise he said the other is a strange key i did not know i had it ford smiled maliciously let us see if it will open the bureau drawer he said the party adjourned to the housekeepers room the key was put into the lock of the bureau drawer and opened it at once i think there is no more to be said said willis ford triumphantly grant looked the picture of surprise and dismay chapter xviii grants enemies triumph it is not too much to say that grant was overwhelmed by the unexpected discovery in his pocket of a key that fitted the housekeepers drawer he saw at once how strong it made the evidence against him and yet he knew himself to be innocent the most painful thought was that mr reynolds would believe him to be guilty in fact the broker for the first time began to think that grant might possibly have yielded to temptation cant you account for the possession of that key he asked no sir answered grant in painful embarrassment i have occasion to use but one key and that is the key to my valise i think you had occasion to use the other sneered ford mr ford retorted grant indignantly you are determined to think me guilty but i care nothing for your opinion i should be very sorry if mr reynolds should think me capable of such baseness your guilt seems pretty clear said ford sarcastically as i have no doubt mr reynolds will agree speak for yourself mr ford said the banker quietly i hope you are not going to shield that young thief mr reynolds said the housekeeper his guilt is as clear as noonday i think he ought to be arrested you are rather in a hurry mrs estabrook said mr reynolds and i must request you to be careful how you make charges against me against you asked the housekeeper alarmed at his tone yes answered the broker sternly you have insinuated that i intend to shield a supposed thief i have only to say that at present the theft is to be proved i submit sir said ford that the evidence is pretty strong the boy is proved to have had the bonds in his possession he admits that he sold a part of them and has the money in his possession and a key is found in his possession which will open the drawer in which the bonds were kept who put the key in my pocket demanded grant quickly for a moment willis ford looked confused and his momentary confusion was not lost upon grant or the banker no doubt you put it there yourself he answered sharply after a monents pause that matter will be investigated said the broker i think the money ought to be paid to me said the housekeeper can you prove your ownership of the bonds asked the broker i can answered willis ford flippantly i have seen them i should like some additional evidence said mr reynolds you are related to mrs estabrook and may be supposed to have some interest in the matter what proof can i have asked the housekeeper disturbed by this unexpected obstacle have you the memorandum of the broker who bought you the bonds i dont know sir then you had better look the housekeeper searched the drawer and produced triumphantly a memorandum to the effect that she had purchased the bonds of a wellknown house in wall street so far so good said the broker it appears that besides the bonds sold you had four onehundreddollar bonds yes sir you had not parted with them no sir they will some time be put on the market and then we shall have a clew to the mystery that boy has probably got them said the housekeeper nodding her head emphatically you are at liberty to search my chamber mrs estabrook said grant quietly he may have passed them over to that man morrison suggested the housekeeper i hardly think that likely said willis ford who saw danger to himself in any persecution of jim morrison mr reynolds noticed his defense of morrison and glanced at him thoughtfully mrs estabrook he said i am satisfied that you possessed the bonds which you claim and i will relieve your mind by saying that i will guarantee you against loss by their disappearance you need have no further anxiety on the subject i will undertake to investigate the matter which at present appears to be involved in mystery whether or not i succeed in solving it will not matter to you since you are saved from loss thank you sir said the housekeeper feeling considerably relieved it wasnt much but it was my all i depended upon it to use when old age prevented me from earning my living i am glad you are so wise in providing for the future you wont let that boy escape the housekeeper could not help adding if you refer to grant thornton i think i may say for him that he has no intention of leaving us is he to stay in the house of course and i expect him to aid me in coming to the truth let me request mrs estabrook that you discontinue referring to him in offensive terms or i may withdraw my offer guaranteeing you from loss grant if you will accompany me i have some questions to put to you grant and his employer left the room together he wont let the boy be punished though he must know hes guilty said mrs estabrook spitefully he makes a fool of himself about that boy said willis ford disconcerted hes an artful young vagabond said the housekeeper i know he took the bonds of course he did ford assented though he had the best of reasons for knowing that grant was innocent at any rate he continued you are all right mother since mr reynolds agrees to make up the value of the bonds to you when you get your money just consult me about investing it dont put it into bonds for they may be stolen perhaps id better put it into the savings bank said his stepmother youll get very small interest there i can invest it so you can make quite as much however there will be time enough to speak of that when youve got the money now mother i shall have to bid you goodevening cant you stay longer willis i feel so upset that i dont like to be left alone i dont know what that boy may do i think you are safe said willis ford secretly amused but as he left the house he felt seriously disquieted there was danger that jim morrison when he found the money which he was to receive withheld would be incensed and denounce ford who had received back his evidence of indebtedness should he divulge that the bonds had been given him by ford grant would be cleared and he would be convicted of theft as ford was leaving the house a telegraph boy was just ascending the steps it was john cavanagh already referred to as his eyes rested on ford he said to himself where have i seen that feller i know his face then it flashed upon the boy that he had seen ford at the grand central hotel in the act of giving bonds to jim morrison its queer i should meet him here said the telegraph boy to himself i wonder what game hes up to johnny was introduced into the presence of mr reynolds for whom he had a message on his way out he met grant in the hall the two boys were acquainted grant having at one time advanced johnny two dollars toward paying his mothers rent do you live here asked the telegraph boy yes answered grant i met a feller goin out that ive seen before who was it willis ford a clerk of mr reynolds i seed him in the grand central hotel yesterday givin some bonds to a suspiciouslookin chap you did exclaimed grant come right up and tell that to mr reynolds and he seized the astonished telegraph boy by the arm chapter xix important evidence mr reynolds looked rather surprised when grant appeared drawing the telegraph boy after him this boy has got something to tell you about mr ford said grant breathless with excitement about mr ford repeated the broker what do you know about willis ford i dont know his name replied johnny its the chap that just went out of the house it was mr ford explained grant tell me what you know about him said the broker encouragingly i seed him in the grand central hotel givin some bond to a flashylookin man there was a boy wid him a big boy with whom mr ford no wid the other chap i know who he means sir said grant it was tom calder and the man was jim morrison the same man that gave me the bonds to sell that seems important said mr reynolds i did not believe ford capable of such rascality he had as good a chance to take the bonds as i sir he was here last evening was he asked the broker quickly i did not know that he was here for an hour at least i saw him come in and go out mr reynolds asked several more questions of the telegraph boy and enjoined him to silence my boy he said come here tornorrow evening at halfpast seven i may want you i will sir if i can get away i shall be on duty say to the telegraph company that i have an errand for you your time will be paid for that will make it all right sir and meanwhile here is a dollar for your own use johnnys eyes sparkled for with his limited earnings this sum would come in very handy he turned away nearly forgetting the original errand that brought him to the house but luckily it occurred in time the nature of it has nothing to do with this story when johnny had gone mr reynolds said grant i need not caution you not to breathe a word of this i begin to think that there is a conspiracy against you but whether willis ford is alone in it or has a confederate i cannot decide my housekeeper does not appear to like you no sir i am sorry to say she does not but i dont think she is in this plot i think she honestly believes that i stole her bonds i have too great confidence in you to believe it i own i was a little shaken when the key was found you have no idea how it came in your pocket i suppose no sir i cant guess i might suspect mr ford of putting it there but i cant see how he managed it well we will let matters take their course you will go to work as usual and not speak a word of what has happened this evening thank you sir meanwhile we must follow willis ford when he left the house he was by no means in a comfortable frame of mind he felt that it was absolutely necessary to see jim morrison and have an understanding with him what arrangements he could make with him or how he could reconcile him to the loss of the money which he had expected to receive from the sale of the bonds he could not yet imagine perhaps he would be willing to receive the other four bonds in part payment in that case willis himself would not profit as much as he had hoped from the theft but there seemed no alternative he had got himself into a scrape and he must get out of it the best way possible though he did not know where to find morrison he thought it likely that he might be seen at the white elephant a large and showy billiard room on broadway near thirtieth street there were several gambling houses near by and there or in that neighborhood he thought that morrison might be met he was right on entering the billiard room he found the man he sought playing a game of billiards with tom calder at the first table i want to see you morrison he said in a low voice is the game most finished i have only six points more to make i shall probably run out this time he was right in his estimate two minutes later the two went out of the saloon together accompanied by tom well what is it he asked let us turn into a side street they turned into thirtieth street which was much less brilliantly lighted than broadway and sauntered leisurely along did you buy the bonds of that boy asked morrison anxiously yes then its all right have you brought me the money how should i returned ford impatiently i couldnt pay him and keep the money myself oh well it doesnt matter he is to meet me tomorrow morning and hand over the money i am afraid you will be disappointed disappointed repeated morrison quickly what do you mean the boy hasnt made off with the money has he if he has and the sentence ended with an oath no it isnt as you suppose then why wont he pay me the money id like to know there is some trouble about the bonds it is charged that they are stolen how is that you gave them to me said morrison suspiciously now came the awkward moment however ford had decided on the story he would tell they were given me by a person who owed me money he said plausibly how was i to know they were stolen they were stolen then i suppose so in fact i know so how do you know well in fact they were stolen from my stepmother morrison whistled well he said of course you mustnt say that i gave them to you you would get me into trouble so you want to save yourself at my expense i am to be suspected of stealing the bonds am i thats a decidedly cool proposal but it wont do i shall clear myself by telling just where i got the bonds thats what i want you to do you do ejaculated the gambler in surprise yes you are to say that the boy gave them to you why should i say that because he is already suspected of stealing the bonds but i gave them to him to sell you mustnt admit it there is no proof of it except his word whats your game whatever it is it is too deep for me ive got it all arranged you are to say that the boy owed you a gambling debt and agreed to meet you tomorrow morning to pay it of the bonds you are to know nothing unless you say that he told you he had some which he was going to sell in order to get money to pay you what advantage am i to get out of all this what advantage why you will save yourself from suspicion that isnt enough i didnt take the bonds and you know it i believe you did it yourself hush said willis ford looking around him nervously look here ford i gave up your i o u and now i find ive got to whistle for my money go with me to my room and you shall have four hundred dollars tonight in cash no in bonds some more of the same kind no thank you i want ready money then give me a little more time and i will dispose of them when this excitement blows over finally morrison gave a sulky assent and the conspirators parted chapter xx at the fifth avenue hotel if i thought he was playing me false said jim morrison after ford and himself had parted company id make him smart for it i guess its all right said tom who was less experienced and less suspicious than his companion it may be so but i have my suspicions i dont trust willis ford shall you go round to the fifth avenue hotel to meet grant tomorrow morning of course i shall i want to see what the boy says it may be a putup job between him and ford the very same question was put by grant to mr reynolds shall i go round to the hotel tomorrow morning to see morrison and tom calder the broker paused a moment and looked thoughtful yes he answered after a pause you may and what shall i say when he demands the money upon this mr reynolds gave grant full instructions as to what he desired him to say about quarter after eight oclock the next morning a quietlooking man who looked like a respectable bookkeeper entered the fifth avenue hotel and walked through the corridor glancing as it seemed indifferently to the right and left finally he reached the door of the reading room and entered his face brightened as at the further end he saw two persons occupying adjoining seats they were in fact morrison and tom calder the newcomer selected a boston daily paper and as it seemed by chance settled himself in a seat not six feet away from our two acquaintances so that he could without much effort listen to their conversation its almost time for grant to come said tom after a pause yes grumbled morrison but as he wont have any money for me i dont feel as anxious as i should otherwise whatll you say to him i dont know yet i want to find out whether ford has told the truth about the bonds i believe he stole em himself five minutes later grant entered the readingroom a quick glance showed him not only the two he had come to meet but the quiet little man who was apparently absorbed in a copy of the boston journal he went up at once to meet them i believe i am in time he said yes answered jim morrison have you brought the money no why not demanded morrison with a frown there was something wrong about the bonds you gave me to sell werent they all right they werent counterfeit were they they were genuine but but what a lady claims that they belong to her that they were stolen from her of course you can explain how they came into your hands they were given me by a party that owed me money if hes played a trick on me it will be the worse for him did you sell them yes then give me the money mr reynolds wont let me does he think i took the bonds asked morrison hastily no he doesnt answered grant proudly but he would like to have an interview with you and make some inquiries so that he may form some idea as to the person who did take them they belonged to his housekeeper mrs estabrook who is the stepmother of mr ford a young man employed in our office tom calder and jim morrison exchanged glances grants story agreed with fords and tended to confirm their confidence in his good faith when does he want to see me asked morrison can you call at his house this evening at eight oclock where does he live grant mentioned the street and number i will be there he said briefly can i come too asked tom calder addressing the question to grant there will be no objection i think tell him well be on hand the three left the hotel together grant taking a broadway stage at the door the quiet man seemed no longer interested in the boston journal for he hung it up in its place and sauntered out of the hotel he had not attracted the attention of jim morrison or tom when grant entered the office and with his usual manner asked ford if he should go to the postoffice the young man eyed him curiously are you to remain in the office he said yes i suppose so after what you have done what have i done mr ford asked grant eyeing the young man steadily i dont think you need to have me tell you he said with a sneer i dont think mr reynolds is very prudent to employ a boy convicted of dishonesty do you believe me guilty mr ford asked our hero calmly the evidence against you is overwhelming my mother ought to have you arrested the person who stole the bonds may be arrested what do you mean asked willis ford flushing and looking disconcerted i mean that i have no concern in the matter shall i go to the postoffice yes snapped ford and take care you dont steal any of the letters grant did not reply he knew that his vindication was certain and he was willing to wait if willis ford had been prudent he would have dropped the matter there but his hatred of grant was too great to be easily concealed when a few minutes later the broker entered the office and inquired where is grant ford after answering he has gone to the postoffice could not help saying are you going to keep that boy mr reynolds why should i not the broker replied i thought a boy in his position ought to be honest i agree with you mr ford said the broker quietly after taking my mothers bonds that can hardly be said of grant thornton you seem to be sure he did take them mr ford the discovery of the key settled that to my mind grant says he has no knowledge of the key ford laughed scornfully of course he would say so he replied i propose to investigate the matter further said the broker can you make it convenient to call at my house this evening possibly something may be discovered by that time yes sir i will come with pleasure i have no feeling in regard to the boy except that i dont think it safe to employ him in a business like yours i agree with you mr ford one who is capable of stealing bonds from a private house is unfit to be employed in an office like mine yet you retain the boy sir for the present it is not fair to assume that he is guilty till we have demonstrated it beyond a doubt i think there will be no difficulty about that mr reynolds said willis ford well pleased at these words i sincerely hope that his innocence may be proved soon afterward mr reynolds went to the stock exchange and willis ford returned to his routine duties with the testimony of jim morrison i shall be able to fix you my young friend he said to himself as grant returned from the postoffice no further allusion was made to the matter during the day grant and willis ford were both looking forward to the evening but for different reasons grant expected to be vindicated while ford hoped he could convince the broker of the boys guilt chapter xxi the thief is discovered willis ford ascended the steps of the brokers residence with a jaunty step the servant admitted him but he met grant in the hall wont you come upstairs mr ford he said willis ford nodded superciliously your stay in the house will be short young man he thought you had better make the most of it he was ushered not into the housekeepers room but into a sittingroom on the second floor he found mr reynolds and his stepmother there already both greeted him the broker gravely but his stepmother cordially grant did not come in i have come as you requested mr reynolds he said i suppose its about the bonds may i ask if you have discovered anything new i think i have answered the broker slowly the housekeeper looked surprised if anything new had been discovered she at least had not heard it may i ask what it is ford inquired carelessly you shall know in good time let me however return the question have you heard anything calculated to throw light on the mystery no sir i cant say i have to my mind there is no mystery at all about the affair i presume i understand what you mean still i will ask you to explain yourself everything seems to throw suspicion upon that boy grant thornton nobody saw him take the bonds to be sure but he has had every opportunity of doing so living in the same house as he does again a key has been found in his pocket which will open the bureau drawer in which the bonds were kept and thirdly i can testify and the boy admits that he presented them at our office for sale and received the money for them i think sir that any jury would consider this accumulation of proof conclusive it does seem rather strong said the broker gravely i compliment you on the way you have summed up mr ford willis ford looked much gratified he was susceptible to flattery and he was additionally pleased because as he thought mr reynolds was impressed by the weight of evidence i have sometimes thought he said complacently that i ought to have become a lawyer i always had a liking for the profession still said the broker deliberately we ought to consider grants explanation of the matter he says that the bonds were intrusted to him for sale by a third party of course he would say something like that returned willis shrugging his shoulders he can hardly expect anyone to be taken in by such a statement as that you think then that he had no dealings with this morrison i dont say that sir said ford remembering the story which he and morrison had agreed upon it may be stated here that he had been anxious to meet morrison before meeting the coming appointment in order to ascertain what had passed between him and grant with this object in view he had gone to the usual haunts of the gambler but had been unable to catch sight of him however as he had seen him the evening previous and agreed upon the story to be told he contented himself with that you think then that morrison may have given grant the bonds said mr reynolds no sir that is not my idea have you any other notion i think the boy may have been owing him money and took this method of raising it but how should he owe him money asked the broker curiously i dont wish to say anything against morrison but i have been told that he is a gambler grant may have lost money to him at play or you thought the broker but he said your suggestion is worth considering but i dont think grant has had any opportunity to lose money in that way as he spends his evenings usually at home it wouldnt take long to lose a great deal of money sir that explains it said the housekeeper speaking for the first time i have no doubt willis is right and the boy gambles i presume mr ford said the broker with a peculiar look that you do not approve of gambling most certainly not sir said ford his face expressing the horror which a sowellconducted young man must naturally feel for so pernicious a habit i am glad to hear it will you excuse me a moment after the broker had left the room mrs estabrook turned to willis and said you are pretty sharp willis you have found out this wretched boy and now i think we shall get rid of him i flatter myself mother said willis complacently that i have given the old man some new ideas as to the character of his favorite i dont think we shall see him in the office again as he spoke his ears caught the sound of ascending footsteps on the stairs without he was rather puzzled he conjectured that grant had been summoned to confront his accuser but there seemed from the sound to be more than two approaching when the door opened and the broker gravely ushered in jim morrison and tom calder both looking ill at ease followed by grant thornton he looked amazed and perplexed i believe you know these gentlemen said mr reynolds gravely i have thought it best to make our present investigation thorough and complete i have met the gentlemen before said ford uncomfortably you also have met them grant have you not yes sir have you had any business transaction with either yes sir mr morrison met me on wall street and handed me two bonds with a request that i would sell them for him and hand him the money the next morning at the fifth avenue hotel were these the same bonds that you sold to mr ford yes sir i think the boy is lying sir burst out ford what have you to say to the boys story mr morrison asked the broker hes made a little mistake answered jim morrison who by this time was feeling more at his ease i didnt give him no bonds willis ford looked triumphant and grant amazed how then could there be any business between you i may as well own up that i am a gambler replied morrison with virtuous frankness the boy lost the money to me at play and said hed meet and pay me at the fifth avenue hotel i didnt know where he was goin to get the money but i expect he must have stolen the bonds and got it that way considering the damaging nature of the revelation grant showed considerable selfcommand he did not turn pale nor did he look guilty and consciencestricken what have you to say to this charge grant asked the broker it is not true sir what a hardened young villain said the housekeeper in a low but audible voice mr reynolds will hardly believe you said ford turning upon our hero and speaking in a tone of virtuous indignation you see sir he continued addressing the broker that i was right in my conjecture i am not quite satisfied yet said mr reynolds grant call the boy great was the perplexity of willis ford and his friends when grant left the room and almost immediately reappeared with a small boy in blue uniform not one of them recognized him have you ever seen any of these gentlemen before my boy asked the broker ive seed em all sir answered the boy state where you saw them last i seed him and him and him said johnny pointing out willis ford jim morrison and tom calder at the grand central hotel yesterday mornm ford started and became very pale what passed between them he indicating ford gave some bonds to him indicating morrison and got back a bit of paper i dont know what was on it it is false ejaculated willis ford hoarsely chapter xxii willis ford at bay the telegraph boys evidence overwhelmed willis ford and his confederates with dismay the feeling was greater in ford for it tended to fasten the theft upon him while jim morrison and tom calder though convicted of falsehood were at all events sustained by the consciousness that nothing worse could be alleged against them it is false asserted willis ford with a flushed face it is true declared the telegraph boy sturdily i dont believe a word of it said the housekeeper angrily this is a startling revelation mr ford said the broker gravely it is a base conspiracy sir returned ford hoarsely i submit sir that the word of a boy like that ought not to weigh against mine besides these gentlemen indicating jim morrison and tom calder will corroborate my statement of course we do blustered morrison that boy is a liar i have spoken the truth sir and they know it asserted johnny resolutely how much did grant thornton pay you for telling this lie demanded willis ford furiously i will answer that question mr ford said grant thinking it time to speak for himself i paid him nothing and did not know till last evening that he had witnessed the interview between you and mr morrison your word is of no value said ford scornfully that is a matter for mr reynolds to consider answered grant with composure mr ford said the broker gravely i attach more importance to the testimony of this telegraph boy than you appear to but then it is to be considered that you are an interested party am i to be discredited on account of what a wretched telegraph boy chooses to say asked ford bitterly even supposing him worthy of credence my two friends sustain me and it is three against one they are your friends then asked mr reynolds significantly willis ford flushed it was not to his credit to admit that an acknowledged gambler was his friend yet he knew that to deny it would make morrison angry and perhaps lead him to make some awkward revelations i have not known them long sir he answered embarrassed but i believe they feel friendly to me one of them he added maliciously is an old friend of grant thornton yes answered grant by no means disconcerted tom calder is from the same town as myself and i wish him well tom looked pleased at this friendly declaration on the part of grant whom indeed he personally liked better than willis ford who evidently looked down upon him and had more than once snubbed him you see said ford adroitly that grant thorntons old friend testifies against him i dont think i need say any more except to deny in toto the statement of that low telegraph boy im no lower than you are retorted johnny angrily none of your impertinence boy said ford loftily i must say interposed the housekeeper that this seems a very discreditable conspiracy against my stepson i am sure mr reynolds you wont allow his reputation to be injured by such a base attack mr ford said the broker i have listened attentively to what you have said i ought to say that a telegraph boy has as much right to be believed as yourself even when there are three against him the three are interested parties i have no doubt he is also i presume he has an understanding with grant thornton who is a suspected thief i deny that mr ford exclaimed grant indignantly you are certainly suspected of stealing my stepmothers bonds and i have no doubt you took them declared the housekeeper venomously at this time the doorbell was heard to ring excuse me for a moment said the broker i will be back directly when he had left the room the parties left behind looked at each other uncomfortably willis ford however was too angry to keep silence he turned to grant and made an attack upon him you wont accomplish anything you young rascal by your plotting and contriving i give you credit for a good deal of cunning in bringing this boy to give the testimony he has but it wont do you any good mr reynolds isnt a fool and he will see through your design that he will willis said the housekeeper after all the kindness that boy has received in this house he might be better employed than in stealing my bonds and then trying to throw it upon a man like you i dont care to argue with you mr ford said grant quietly you know as well as i do that i didnt steal the bonds and you know he added significantly who did i have a great mind to break your head you impudent boy that would be a very poor argument the truth has already come out and i am vindicated i dont know whether you expect mr reynolds to shield you or not but if my mother takes my advice she will have you arrested whatever happens i intend to said the housekeeper nodding spitefully if you had returned the bonds i did not mean to let the matter drop but since you have tried to throw suspicion on my son who has always been devoted to me i mean to punish you as severely as the law allows i think you will change your mind mrs estabrook and let the thief go unpunished said grant in no ways disturbed not unless you make a full confession and even then i think you ought to suffer for your base wickedness you are making a mistake mrs estabrook i referred to the thief that is yourself grant shrugged his shoulders he was spared the necessity of answering the attack for just then the door opened and mr reynolds reentered he did not enter alone however a small man of quiet manner attired in a sober suit of brown closely followed him all present looked at him in surprise who was this man and what had he to do with the matter that concerned them all they were not destined to remain long in doubt mr graham gentlemen said the broker with a wave of the hand the detective bowed courteously mr graham permit me to ask continued the broker if you have seen any of these gentlemen before yes answered graham and he indicated grant thornton jim morrison and tom calder when did you see them and where at the fifth avenue hotel this morning what passed between them they were talking about some bonds which that gentleman indicating morrison acknowledged giving to the boy to sell he asked for the proceeds but the boy told him there was something wrong about the bonds and his employer wouldnt allow him to pass over the money upon this morrison as i understand him to be called said they were given him by a party that owed him money and threatened that if he had played a trick upon him it would be the worse for him who is that man mr reynolds asked ford in nervous excitement one of the best known detectives in the city quietly answered the broker what have you to say to his evidence that it doesnt concern me i may be wrong about the boy taking the bonds but that doesnt involve me there may have been another party you forget the testimony of the telegraph boy that he saw you give the bonds to your friend there the boy told a falsehood i am in a position to confirm the boys testimony said the detective willis ford gasped for breath and seemed ready to sink into the floor what was coming next chapter xxiii justice triumphs mr graham turned to the broker and addressed further remarks to him your statement that four hundred dollars remained to be accounted for led me to conclude that they would be found in the possession of the party who had abstracted the others i therefore obtained a search warrant and visited the room occupied by that gentleman whose name i believe is willis ford this was an unexpected stroke ford did not speak but kept his eyes fixed upon the detective in evident panic i have just come from mr fords room he resumed these are what i found there he drew from his pocket a long envelope from which he took four government bonds will you be kind enough mrs estabrook said the broker gravely to examine these bonds and determine whether they are yours the housekeeper took them mechanically and examined them they are mine she said but i cannot believe willis took them i did not said ford hoarsely but his eyes were downcast will you account for their being in your room then mr ford inquired the broker sternly that boy must have put them there i know nothing of them i am as much surprised as you are we have had enough of this mr ford said the broker coldly your guilt is evident in robbing your stepmother you have committed a serious crime but in attempting to throw the guilt upon an innocent boy you have been guilty of an offense still more detestable and one which i cannot forgive you cannot remain in my employment another day if you will call at the office in the morning i will pay your salary to the end of the month that will end all relations between us willis ford looked like a convicted criminal for the moment all his hardihood and bravado deserted him can this be true willis wailed his stepmother is it possible that you took my bonds and would have left me to an old age of poverty no answered ford with a return of his usual assurance i am as innocent as a babe unborn i am the victim of a conspiracy as mr reynolds is determined to shield his favorite by throwing the blame on it i must submit the time will come when he will acknowledge my innocence mother i will satisfy you later but i do not believe you will think me guilty gentlemen i bid you all goodevening no one spoke as he withdrew from the room and not even morrison offered to follow him when he was fairly out of the room the broker turned to morrison mr morrison he said i have a question or two to put to you i think you will find it to your interest to answer correctly do you still maintain that these bonds were given you by grant thornton i may as well make a clean breast of it said morrison they were given me by willis ford to satisfy a gambling debt was it not yes sir i take it for granted you did not know they were stolen if i had known it i wouldnt have touched them i might have been suspected of stealing them myself i believe you youre a gentleman said morrison gratified that his word was accepted of course you have lost the amount which you consider due you to be entirely candid with you i do not feel any sympathy with you money won at play must be classed among illgotten gains i hope you will realize this and give up a discreditable profession i have no doubt your advice is good sir do you want me and tom any longer you are at liberty to go i am indebted to you for coming you have helped to clear up the mystery of the theft hes a little hard on us tom said morrison as they went down the front steps but hes treated us like a gentleman that ford is a rascal i think so too tom assented and i shall never see a cent of that six hundred dollars continued jim morrison ruefully if youll excuse me ill go to my own room said mrs estabrook pertly i want to think quietly of all this go by all means said the broker courteously tomorrow morning your property shall be restored to you next the detective and the telegraph boy withdrew the latter rich by a fivedollar note which mr reynolds presented him johnnys eyes sparkled that will make mother happy he said shell think i am in luck keep your eyes open my boy and be faithful to your employer and this wont be the last piece of luck that will come your way when they were alone mr reynolds turned to grant and said kindly i congratulate you grant on your complete vindication those who have wickedly conspired against you have come to grief and you come out of the trial unscathed as i am to part with willis ford though you are not competent to take his place your duties will be somewhat enlarged and i will take care that your compensation shall be increased i am afraid mr reynolds i already receive more than i earn that may be but i am only anticipating a little how much do i pay you now six dollars a week sir i will allow you four dollars more but this additional sum i will keep in my own hands and credit you with it is time you were saving something for future use will this be satisfactory to you you are very kind mr reynolds said grant i dont know how to thank you then i will tell you be faithful in your duties in the office and continue your kindness to herbert gladly sir grant decided not to write to his mother about his increase in salary he preferred to wait till his savings amounted to a considerable sum and then surprise her by the announcement of his good fortune in six months he estimated he would have more than a hundred dollars and this to the country ministers son seemed a large sum at any rate when he was twentyone he might hope to be the possessor of a thousand dollars this opened to grant a brilliant prospect it was probably all his father was worth including all his possessions in spite of my uncles opposition thought grant i think i acted wisely in preferring business to college now i shall be able to make the family more comfortable when willis ford called at the office the next morning grant was gone to the post office as he returned he met ford coming out with a check in his hand so its you is it sneered ford stopping short yes mr ford i suppose you are exulting over your victory you are mistaken said grant it was not my wish that anything unpleasant should happen i suppose not said ford in an unpleasant tone for some reason you have shown a dislike to me from the first grant proceeded i dont know why i have always treated you with respect and tried to do my duty faithfully you are a little angel to be sure have you any objection to telling me why you dislike me he asked yes ill tell you it is because i see how you are trying to worm yourself into the confidence of mr reynolds you have plotted against me and now thanks to you i have lost my place i dont consider myself the cause of that mr ford i do but you neednt exult too much i generally pay my debts and i shant forget what i owe you i will be even with you some day so saying he walked off and grant returned to his work i cant understand why mr ford should hate me so he thought chapter xxiv startling news willis fords feelings were far from enviable when he took leave of the office in which he had long enjoyed an excellent position he was conscious though scarcely willing to admit it that his misfortunes had been brought upon him by his own unwise not to say criminal course none the less however was he angry with those whom he had connected with the disaster that had come upon him he had always disliked grant thornton now he hated him and thirsted for an opportunity to do him mischief next he felt embittered against mr reynolds who had discharged him though it is hardly possible to see how the broker could have done otherwise this dislike was increased within a few days and for this reason ford addressed a letter to mr reynolds requesting a certificate of good character which would enable him to procure a new situation to this request the broker answered substantially as follows i shall be glad to hear that you have changed your course and have decided to lead an honest lift but for the same reason that i am not willing to retain you in my employment i am unwilling to recommend you without reserve to another business man if you are willing to refer him to me on condition that i tell the truth i will cheerfully testify that you have discharged your office duties to my satisfaction the old fool muttered ford angrily crushing the letter in his hand what use would such a recommendation be to me not content with discharging me he wants to keep me out of employment in truth willis ford hardly knew where to turn he had saved no money and was earning nothing in his dilemma he turned to his stepmother one forenoon after he knew the broker and grant would be out of the way he rang the bell and inquired for the housekeeper mrs estabrook was agitated when she saw her stepson she did not like to believe that he had robbed her but it was hard to believe otherwise oh willis she said almost bursting into tears how could you take my small savings i would not have believed you capable of it you dont mean to say mother returned willis with welldissembled and reproachful sorrow that you believe this monstrous slander i dont want to believe it willis heaven knows but were not the bonds found in your room i admit it said ford but how did they get there did you not put them there certainly not mother i thought you knew me better than that but who then began his stepmother looking bewildered who should it be but that boy grant thornton yes have you any proof of this asked the housekeeper eagerly i will tell you what i have found out i learn that a boy called on the day in question at my room and asked to see me being told that i was out he asked leave to go up and wait for me as the servant had no suspicion he was allowed to go up i dont know how long he stayed but no doubt he had the bonds with him and concealed them where they were found did you ask for a description of the boy was it like grant asked the housekeeper quickly unfortunately the girl did not take particular notice of him i have no doubt that it was either grant or the telegraph boy who seems to have been in the plot now this story was an audacious fiction and should not have imposed upon a person of ordinary intelligence but the housekeeper was anxious to believe her stepson innocent and grant guilty she therefore accepted it without question and was loud in her denunciation of that artful young rascal you ought to tell mr reynolds of this willis she said it would be of no use mother he is too strongly prejudiced against me what do you think he has refused me a letter of recommendation what does he care if i starve concluded willis bitterly but i care willis i will not desert you said mrs estabrook in a tone of sympathy this was just the mood in which ford desired his stepmother to be he was desirous of effecting a loan and after a time succeeded in having transferred to him two of the onehundreddollar bonds he tried hard to obtain the five hundred but mrs estabrook was too prudent and too much attached to her savings to consent to this ford had to be satisfied with considerably less ought i to stay with mr reynolds after he has treated you in this way willis asked his stepmother anxiously by all means mother you dont want to throw away a good position but it will be hard to see that boy high in mr reynolds confidence after all his wickedness you must dissemble mother treat him fairly and watch your opportunity to harm him and serve me dont say much about me for it would do no good but keep your hold on reynolds if you think it best willis said his stepmother not without a feeling of relief for she was reluctant to relinquish a good home and liberal salary i will remain do so by all means we may as well make all we can out of the enemy for mr reynolds has treated me very shabbily and now i must bid you goodby what are your plans willis i cant tell you but i think i shall go west and i shall never see you you will hear from me and i hope i shall have good news to write willis ford left the house and going to the grand central depot bought a ticket for chicago now came quite a pleasant period after the trouble and excitement grant found his duties at the office increased and it was pleasant to see that his employer reposed confidence in him his relations with others in the office were pleasant now that willis ford was away and every day he seemed to get new insight into the details of the business whether jim morrison and tom calder were in the city he did not know at all events they were never seen in the neighborhood of wall street grant was not sorry to have them pass out of his life for he did not consider that he was likely to draw any benefit from their presence and companionship he was still a member of mr reynolds household herbert appeared to be as much attached to him as if he were an older brother and the broker looked with pleasure upon the new happiness that beamed from the face of his son as to mrs estabrook grant had feared that she would continue to show animosity toward him but he had nothing to complain of she certainly did not show any cordiality in her necessary intercourse with him but then on the other hand she did not manifest any desire to injure him this was all grant desired he felt that under no circumstances could he have made a friend of the housekeeper he was content to have her leave him alone after the lapse of six months grant expressed a desire to go home to pass a day or two his mothers birthday was close at hand and he had bought for her a present which he knew would be acceptable permission was readily accorded and grant passed four happy days at home his parents were pleased that he was so highly regarded by his employer and had come to think that grants choice had been a wise one when grant returned he went at once to the office he found it a scene of excitement what has happened he asked eagerly herbert reynolds has disappeared and his father is almost beside himself with grief was the startling reply chapter xxv anxious inquiries after a while grant learned the particulars about herberts disappearance he had gone out to play in the street about three oclock in the afternoon generally he waited for grant to returnhome but during his absence he had found other companions when his father returned home he inquired of the housekeeper where is herbert he went out to play said mrs estabrook indifferently in the street i believe so he ought to be in by this time probably he went to walk with some of his companions as he had no watch he might not know that it is so late this seemed very plausible to mr reynolds yes he said herbert seems lost without grant he will be glad to see him back to this mrs estabrook did not reply she had learned to her cost that it would not be politic to speak against grant and she was not disposed to praise him she seldom mentioned him at all the dinner bell rang and still herbert had not returned his father began to feel anxious it is strange that herbert remains so long away he said i shouldnt wonder if he had gone to central park on some excursion returned the housekeeper calmly you think there is nothing wrong asked the broker anxiously how could there be here sir answered mrs estabrook with unruffled demeanor this answer helped to calm mr reynolds who ordered dinner delayed half an hour when however an hour two hours passed and the little boy still remained absent the fathers anxiety became insupportable he merely tasted a few spoonfuls of soup and found it impossible to eat more the housekeeper on the contrary seemed quite unconcerned and showed her usual appetite i am seriously anxious mrs estabrook said the broker i will take my hat and go out to see if i can gain any information should herbert return while i am away give him his supper and if he is tired let him go to bed just finding out why he was out so late very well sir when mr reynolds had left the house a singular expression of gratified malice swept over the housekeepers face it is just retribution she murmured he condemned and discharged my stepson for the sin of another now it is his own heart that bleeds only a few steps from his own door the broker met a boy about two years older than herbert with whom the latter sometimes played harvey he said have you seen herbert this afternoon yes sir i saw him about three oclock where asked the broker anxiously just round the corner of the block answered harvey morrison was he alone no there was a young man with him about twenty i should think a young man was it one you had ever saw before no sir what was his appearance harvey described herberts companion as well as he could but the anxious father did not recognize the description did you speak to herbert did you ask where he was going yes sir he told me that you had sent for him to go on an excursion did he say that asked the father startled yes sir then there is some mischief afoot i never sent for him said the agitated father mr reynolds requested harvey to accompany him to the nearest police station and relate all that he knew to the officer in charge that the police might be put on the track he asked himself in vain what object any one could have in spiriting away the boy but no probable explanation occurred to him on his return to the house he communicated to the housekeeper what he had learned what do you think of it he asked it may be only a practical joke answered the housekeeper calmly heaven grant it may be nothing more but i fear it is something far more serious i dare say its only a boys lark mr reynolds but you forget it was a young man who was seen in his company i really dont know what to think of it then i dont believe the boy will come to any harm little sleep visited the brokers pillow that night but the housekeeper looked fresh and cheerful in the morning has the woman no feeling thought the anxious father as he watched the tranquil countenance of the woman who for five years had been in charge of his house when she was left alone in the house mrs estabrook took from her workbasket a letter bearing date a month previous and read slowly the following paragraph i have never forgotten the wrong done me by mr reynolds he discharged me summarily from his employment and declined to give me a recommendation which would secure me a place elsewhere i swore at the time that i would get even with him and i have never changed my resolution i shall not tell you what i propose to do it is better that you should not know but some day you will hear something that will surprise you when that time comes if you suspect anything say nothing let matters take their course the letter was signed by willis ford chapter xxvi a western cabin abner the speaker was a tall gaunt woman in a loose faded calico dress and she stood at the door of a cabin in a western clearing what yer want came as a reply from a tall unhealthylooking boy in overalls who was sitting on a log in the yard i want you to split some wood for the stove im tired drawled the boy ill tire you said the mother sharply you tall lazy goodfornothing drone here ive been up since five oclock slavin for you and your drunken father wheres he gone to the village i reckon to the tavern i reckon its there that he spends all the money he gets hold of he never gives me a cent this is the only gown ive got except an old alpaca much he cares it isnt my fault is it asked the boy indifferently youre afollerin in his steps youll be just another joel barton just as shifless and lazy just split me some wood before i get hold of yer abner rose slowly went to the shed for an ax and in the most deliberate manner possible began to obey his mothers commands the cabin occupied by abner and his parents was far from being a palace it contained four rooms but the furniture was of the most primitive description joel barton the nominal head of the famliy was the possessor of eighty acres of land from which he might have obtained a comfortable living for the soil was productive but he was lazy shiftless and intemperate as his wife had described him had he been as active and energetic as she was he might have been in very different circumstances it is no wonder that the poor woman was fretted and irritated almost beyond endurance seeing how all her industry was neutralized by her husbands habits abner took after his father though he had not yet developed a taste for drink and was perfectly contented with their poor way of living as long as he was not compelled to work hard what little was required of him he would shirk if he possibly could this cabin was situated about a mile from the little village which had gathered round the depot the name of the township was scipio though it is doubtful if one in fifty of the inhabitants knew after whom it was named in fact the name was given by a schoolmaster who had acquired some rudiments of classical learning at a country academy to the depot we must transport the reader on the arrival of the morning train from chicago but two passengers got out one of them was a young man under twenty the other was a boy apparently about ten years of age whom he held firmly by the hand he was a delicatelooking boy and though he was dressed in a coarse illfitting suit he had an appearance of refinement and gentle nature as if he had been brought up in a luxurious home he looked sad and anxious and the glances he fixed on his companion indicated that he held him in fear where are you going he asked timidly looking about him apprehensively youll know soon enough was the rough reply when are you going to take me home mr ford asked the boy in a pleading tone dont trouble yourself about that papa will be so anxious about me papa and grant the young mans brow contracted dont mention the name of that boy i hate him he was always good to me i liked so much to be with him he did all he could to injure me i swore to be even with him and i will but i have never injured you mr ford how could you a baby like you said ford contemptuously then why did you take me from home and make me so unhappy because it was the only way in which i could strike a blow at your father and grant thornton when your father dismissed me without a recommendation not caring whether i starved or not he made me his enemy but he wouldnt if you hadnt hadnt what demanded ford sternly taken mrs estabrooks bonds dare to say that again and i will beat you said willis ford brutally herbert trembled for he had a timid nature and an exquisite susceptibility to pain i didnt mean to offend you he said youd better not wait here a minutes while i look around for some one of whom i can make inquiries here sit dowp on that settee and mind you dont stir till i come back will you obey me yes answered the boy submissively chapter xxvii the ride to bartons willis ford went to the station master who stood at the door with a cheap cigar in his mouth is there a man named joel barton living hereabouts he asked the station master took his cigar from his mouth and surveyed his questioner with some curiosity does he owe you money he inquired no answered ford impatiently will you answer my question you neednt be in such a pesky hurry drawled the station master yes he lives up the road a piece how far is a piece well maybe a mile straighten yes is there any way of riding well stranger ive got a team myself is that boy with you yes ill take you over for half a dollar can you go at once yes then its a bargain the station master whose house was only three minutes walk away appeared in a reasonable time with a farm wagon drawn by an old horse that had seen better days it is to be hoped for she was a miserablelooking mare jump in herbert said ford the boy obeyed and sat on the front seat between the driver and his abductor i suppose the horse is warranted not to run away said ford regarding the animal with a smile he ran away with me once was the unexpected answer when was that bout fifteen years ago replied the driver with grim humor i reckon hes steadied down by this time it looks like it said ford know joel barton asked the station master after a pause i saw him once when i was a boy any relation he married a cousin of my stepmother what sort of a man is he hes a noaccount man shifless lazy drinks that agrees with what i have heard how about his wife shes smart enough if he was like her theyd live comfortably she has a hard time with him and abner abners her son and just like his father only doesnt drink yet like as not he will when he gets older willis ford was not the only listener to this colloquy herbert paid attention to every word and in the poor boys mind there was the uncomfortable query why are we going to these people he would know soon probably but he had a presentiment of trouble yes continued the station master mrs barton has a hard row to hoe but shes a match for joel what do you mean by that shes got a temper of her own and she can talk a man deaf dumb and blind she gives barton a piece of her mind whenever he comes home full she ought to have that satisfaction from what you tell me i dont feel very proud of my unknown relatives goin to stay there any length of time i dont know my own plans yet answered willis ford with a glance at the boy he foresaw a scene when he announced his purpose to leave herbert in this unpromising place but he did not wish to anticipate it i suppose barton is a farmer he suggested he pretends to be but his farm doesnt pay much what supports them his wife takes in work from the tailors in the the village then theyve got a cow and she makes butter as for joel he brings in precious little money he might pick up a few dollars hirin out by the day if he wasnt so lazy i had a job for him myself one day but he knocked off at noon said he was tuckered out and wanted me to pay him for that half day i knew well enough where the money would go so i told him i wouldnt pay him unless he worked until sunset did he do it yes he did but he grumbled a good deal when he got his pay he went over to thompsons saloon and he didnt leave it until all the money was spent when his wife heard of it she was mad and i expect she gave joel a taste of the broom handle i wouldnt blame her much nor i but here we are yonders bartons house will you get out yes abner who was sitting on a stump no sooner saw the team stop than he ran into the house in some excitement to tell the news marm he said theres a team stopped and theres a man and boy gettin out spect theyre coming here lords sake who be they dunno well go out and tell em ill see em in a minute abner met them in front of the house are you joel bartons son asked ford thats what the old man says returned abner with a grin is your mother at home marm will be right out shes slickin up who be you youll know in good time my boy whos he is he your son no answered herbert promptly willis ford turned upon his young ward with a frown he understood the boys tone it will be time to speak when you are spoken to he said sharply heres marm said abner as his mothers tall figure appeared in the doorway chapter xxviii herbert is provided with a new home mrs barton regarded the newcomers with a wondering stare did you want to see joel she asked i shall be glad to see him in due time mrs barton returned willis ford with unwonted politeness but i came principally to see you who be you inquired mrs barton unceremoniously i dont know you no moren the dead there is a slight connection between us however i am the stepson of pauline estabrook of new york who is a cousin of yours you dont say pauline is your mother ejaculated the lady of the house well i never expected to see kith or kin of hers out here is that your son no mrs barton but he is under my charge herbert was about to disclaim this but an ominous frown from willis ford intimidated him my name is willis ford his is sam green herberts eyes opened wide with astonishment at this statement my name is he commenced silence hissed ford with a menacing look you must not contradict me i spose i ought to invite you to stay here said mrs barton awkwardly but hes so shifless and such a poor provider that i aint got anything in the house fit for dinner thank you returned ford with an inward shudder i shall dine at the hotel but i have a little business matter to speak of mrs barton and i would wish to speak in private i will come into the house with your permission and we will leave the two boys together come right in said mrs barton whose curiosity was aroused here you abner just take care of the little boy abner proceeded to do this first thinking it necessary to ask a few questions where do you live when youre at home sam he asked in new york but my name isnt sam replied herbert what is it then herbert what makes him call you sam then asked abner with a jerk of the finger toward the house i dont know except he is afraid i will be found abner looked puzzled is he your guardeen he asked no he was my fathers clerk ho did your father have clerks yes he is a rich man and does business in new york what made him send you out here he didnt then why did you come mr ford was mad with papa and stole me away he wouldnt steal me away easy said abner defiantly but then i aint a little kid like you im not a kid said herbert who was not used to slang oh you dont know what i mean youre a little boy and couldnt do nothin if he tried to take me hed find his hands full herbert who was not very much prepossessed by abners appearance thought it very doubtful whether any one would ever attempt to kidnap him whats he goin to do with you continued abner i dont know i expect hell make papa pay a good sum to get me back humph remarked abner surveying with some contempt the small proportions of the boy before him you aint much good i dont believe hell pay much for you tears sprang to the eyes of the little boy but he forced them back my papa would think differently he said papa mimicked abner oh how nice we are why dont you say dad like i do because it isnt a nice name papa wouldnt like to have me call him so where did you get them clothes i dont think much of em nor i answered herbert theyre not my own clothes mr ford bought them for me in chicago he must like you to buy you new clothes no he doesnt my own clothes were much nicer he sold them he was afraid some one would know me in the others i wonder what he and marm are talking about so long this question herbert was unable to answer he did not guess how nearly this conversation affected him no sooner had the two entered the house than willis ford began mrs barton he said ill tell you now what brought me here go ahead said the lady encouragingly i want you to take the boy i have brought with me to board land sakes i dont keep a boardin house no but if i will make it worth your while you will take him wont you how much will you give asked mrs barton shrewdly four dollars a week hell be a sight of trouble said the lady but there was something in her tone that satisfied ford that she was favorably inclined to the proposal oh no he wont hes so small that you can twist him round your finger besides abner will be company for him he will be with him most of the time say five dollars and its a bargain said mrs barton ford hesitated he did not care to spend more than he was obliged to but it was of importance to obtain at least a temporary refuge for the boy of whose care he was heartily tired it seemed to him that five dollars would be enough to support the whole family in the style in which they were apparently accustomed to live however it was politic to make the sum sufficient to interest these people in retaining charge of the boy well he said after a pause its more than i expected to pay but i suppose i shall have to accept your terms i conclude mr barton will not object to your taking a boarder oh joel is of no account returned mrs barton contemptuously i run this house willis ford suppressed a smile he could easily believe from mrs bartons appearance that she was the head of the establishment theres one thing more added mrs barton youre to pay the money to me jest as sure as it goes into joels hands itll go for drink the way that man carries on is a disgrace i should prefer to pay the money to you said ford youll have to pay somethin in advance if you want the boy to have anythin to eat ive got to send to the village and i havent got a cent in the house willis ford took out a pocketbook extracting therefrom four fivedollar bills he handed them to mrs barton theres money for four weeks he said when that time is up ill send you more mrs bartons eyes sparkled and she eagerly clutched the money i aint seen so much money for years she said ill jest look out joel dont get hold of it dont you tell joel or abner how much youve paid me ill take care of that mrs barton by the way i must caution you not to believe any of the boys stories hes the son of a friend of mine whos put him under my care the boys weakminded and has strange fancies he thinks his name isnt sam green and that his father is rich why only the other day he insisted his name was george washington lands sake how curus of course you wont pay any attention to what he says he may take it into his head to run away if he does you must get him back you can trust me to do that said mrs barton with emphasis i aint goin to let no fivedollar boarder slip through my fingers thats well now i must be going you will hear from me from time to time he passed through the front door into the yard goodby he said herbert was about to follow him but he waived him back you are not to come with me sam he said i shall leave you for a few weeks with this good lady herbert stared at him in dismay this was something he had never dreamed of chapter xxix introduces mr barton when herbert realized that he was to be left behind he ran after willis ford and pleaded for the privilege of accompanying him dont leave me here mr ford he said i should die of homesickness so you would rather go with me ford said with an amused smile oh yes much rather i had not supposed you valued my company so highly i ought to feel complimented i am sorry to disappoint you but i shall have to leave you here for a few weeks this good lady will take good care of you herbert stole a glance at mrs barton who was watching him with mingled contempt and impatience but he did not become any more reconciled to the prospect he reiterated his request i have had enough of this said ford sternly you will stop making a fuss if you know what is best for yourself goodby you will hear from me soon herbert realized the uselessness of his resistance and sank despondently upon the grass is he goin to stay here marm asked abner curiously yes hes goin to board with us ho ho laughed abner hell have a nice boardin place abner you jest shut up or ill take a stick to you you neednt make him any more homesick than he is just try ef you cant amuse him say sam i guess well have a stavin time together said abner really pleased to have a companion whatll we do want to play leapfrog i dont feel like playing answered herbert despondently we might go fishin suggested abner theres a pond only a quarter of a mile from here i dont know how to fish said herbert dont know how to fish what do you know how to do we dont have any chance in new york say exclaimed abner with sudden interest is new york a nice place i wish i was back there i never shall be happy anywheres else tell me what you fellows do there i dunno but id like to go myself before herbert had a chance to answer mrs barton broke in abner you take care of sam while i go to the village what are you goin there for marm im going to buy some sausages for dinner we havent got anything in the house me and sam will go if youll give us the money i know you too well abner barton i wont trust you with the money ef i gave you a fivedollar bill id never see any ont back again say mam you havent got a fivedollar bill have you asked abner with distended eyes never you mind ill tell dad ef you dont give me some you jest dare to do it returned mrs barton in a menacing tone your father aint got nothin to do with it its money for sams board my name isnt sam expostulated herbert who had a natural preference for his own appellation thats what im goin to call you you can call yourself george washington or general jackson ef you want to mebbe youre christopher columbus my name is herbert reynolds said herbert annoyed thats what you call yourself today theres no knowin who youll be tomorrow dont you believe me mrs barton asked herbert distressed no i dont the man who brung you i disremember his name willis ford well willis ford then it seems you know his name well he told me you was loony and thought you was somebody else than your own self he told you that i was crazy ejaculated herbert yes and i have no doubt its so its a wicked lie exclaimed herbert indignantly and id like to tell him so to his face well you wont have a chance for some time but i cant stand here talkin i must be goin to the store you two behave yourselves while im gone herbert felt so dull and dispirited that he did not care to speak but abners curiosity had been excited about new york and he plied his young companion with questions which herbert answered wearily though he responded listlessly and did not say any more than he felt obliged to he excited abners interest i mean to go to new york some time he said is it far its as much as a thousand miles it may be more phew thats a big distance how did you come we came in the cars did it cost much i dont know mr ford paid for the tickets has he got plenty of money i dont think he has he used to be pas clerk i wish we had enough money you and me would start some fine mornin and mebbe your father would give me something to do when we got there for the first time herbert began to feel an interest in the conversation oh i wish we could he said fervently i know pa would give you a lot of money for bringing me back do you really think he would asked abner briskly i know he would but your mother wouldnt let us go she wouldnt know it said abner winking you wouldnt run away from home questioned herbert why wouldnt i whats to keep me here marms always scoldin and dad gets drunk whenever he has any money to spend for drink i reckon they wouldnt care much if i made myself scarce herbert was not sure whether he ought not to feel shocked he admitted to himself however that if he had a father and mother answering the description of abners that he would not so much regret leaving them at any rate abners words awoke a hope of sometime getting away from the place he already hated and returning to his city home now more valued than ever we cant go without money he said in a troubled voice couldnt we walk its too far and im not strong i could walk it ef i took time enough asserted abner positively hello theres dad herbert looked up and following abners glance saw a man approaching the farmhouse mr barton for it was he was a tall man shabbily attired his head crowned with a battered hat whose gait indicated a little uncertainty and betrayed some difficulty about the maintenance of his equilibrium is that your father asked herbert its the old man sure enough hes about half full whats that hes been drinkin as usual but he didnt drink enough to make him tight guess his funds give out herbert was rather shocked at abners want of respect in speaking of his father but even to him mr barton hardly seemed like a man who could command a sons respect wonder whether dad met marm on the way said abner musing by this time mr barton had entered the yard and caught sight of his son and herbert abner said he in a thick voice whos that boy then he didnt meet marm thought abner hes a boy thats goin to board with us dad he answered you dont say glad to make your acquaintance boy he said straightening up thank you sir answered herbert faintly chapter xxx a model household when did you come asked barton steadying himself against a tree half an hour ago answered abner for herbert was gazing with a repulsion he found it difficult to conceal at barton whose flushed face and thick utterance indicated his condition very clearly who came with him continued barton youd better ask marm she attended to the business it was a young man where is she gone to the village to buy some sassiges for dinner good exclaimed barton in a tone of satisfaction ill stay at home to dinner today did the man pay your mother any money i spose so or she wouldnt be buyin sassiges old schickman wont trust us any more the money should have been paid to me ill see about it when your marm comes back from the store youd spend it all for drink dad said abner how dare you speak so to your father you ungrateful young dog he essayed to reach abner to strike him but his dutiful son dodged easily and his father being unsteady on his legs fell on the ground abner laughed but herbert was too much shocked to share in his enjoyment come here and help me up you abner said his father not much dad if you hadnt tried to lick me you wouldnt have fallen let me help you sir said herbert conquering his instinctive disgust and approaching the fallen man youre a gentleman murmured barton as he took the little boys proffered hand and after considerable ado raised himself to a standing position youre a gentleman i wish i had a boy like you herbert could not join in the wish he felt that a father like joel barton would be a great misfortune but just then mrs barton entered the yard marching with long strides like a mans heres marm announced abner barton steadied himself as he turned to look at his wife i want to see you mrs b he said when are you goin to have dinner never if i depended on you to supply the vittles she answered bluntly dont speak so before a stranger said barton with a hiccough you hurt my feelins your feelins are tough and so are mine by this time what have you got there some sassiges ef you want your share youll have to be on time i shant save you any how much money did the man pay you mrs b thats my business retorted his wife shortly mrs b said her husband straightening up i want you to understand that im the master of this house and its my right to take care of the money youll oblige me by handin it over ill do nothing of the sort joel barton youd only spend it for drink would you grudge me the few pennies i spend for drink my system requires it thats what the doctor says then you must find the money for it yourself my system requires something to eat and ef i take a boarder hes got to have something to eat too mrs b i didnt think your heart was so hard said barton in a maudlin tone look here joel barton you might as well stop such foolish talk it wont do no good i cant stay here all day i must go and be gettin dinner had barton succeeded in raising money from his wife he would probably have returned at once to the tavern and his place would have been vacant at the dinner table failing in this he lay back and fell asleep and was not roused till dinner time mrs barton was a fair cook and herbert ate with an unexpected relish it is needless to say that abner also did full justice to the meal i say sam he said im glad youve come herbert was hardly prepared to agree with him now well have to live better abner explained mam and i genally have to skirmish round for vittles we dont often get meat this frank confession rather alarmed herbert he was not over selfindulgent but he had never lacked for nourishing food and the prospect of an uncertain supply was not encouraging when dinner was over there was no second course they left the table joel barton made a fresh attempt to extort a small sum from his wife but was met with an inflexible refusal mrs barton proved deaf alike to entreaties and threats she was a strong resolute woman and not one to be intimidated when barton left the house his look of disappointment had given place to one of cunning come here abner he said beckoning to his son and heir what for never you mind but i do mind do you want to catch hold of me no its only a little matter of business its for your good abner accompanied his father as far as the fence now what do you want he asked with his eyes warily fixed on his father i want you to find out where your marm keeps that money said barton in a coaxing tone what for youre to take it and bring it to me and go without eatin ill buy the provisions myself im the head of the family do you want me to hook money from marm twont be hookin the money by right belongs to me aint i the head of the family i dunno about that marms the boss and always has been chuckled abner joel frowned but immediately tried another attack of course ill give you some of it abner he resumed if theres five dollars ill give you a quarter ill see about it dad get it for me before evenin if you can i shall need it then abner returned to herbert and frankly related the conversation that had taken place between himself and his father herbert was shocked he did not know what to think of the singular family he had got into you wont do it will you he asked startled no i wont i want a quarter bad enough but id rather mam would keep the money shell spend it for vittles and dad would spend it for drink wouldnt you like to go afishin its fine weather and well have fun herbert assented not knowing how to dispose of his time abner turned the conversation again on new york what herbert had already told him had powerfully impressed his imagination havent you got any money he asked no answered herbert mr ford took away all i had except this he drew from his pocket a nickel that wont do no good said abner disappointed stop a minute though he added after aminutes pause wouldnt your folks send you some money if you should write to them yes answered herbert his face brightening why didnt i think of that before if i could get me paper and ink id write at once to papa i know hed either send the money or come for me well go to the post office said abner there you can buy some paper and a postage stamp youve got just money enough theres a pen and ink there let us go at once said herbert eagerly the boys took their way to the village the letter was written and posted and a burden was lifted from the boys mind he felt that his father would seek him out at once and he could bear his present position for a short time but alas for poor herbert the letter never came into his fathers hands why the reader will learn in the next chapter chapter xxxi the housekeepers crime it is not to be supposed that during this time the family of the missing boy were idle the mystrerious disappearance of his only son filled his fathers heart with anguish and he took immediate steps to penetrate the mystery not only was the fullest information given to the police but an experienced detective connected with a private agency was detailed for the search the matter also got into the papers and herbert in his western home little suspected that his name had already become a household word in thousands of families days passed and in spite of the efforts that were being made to discover him no clew had been obtained by herberts friends either as to his whereabouts or as to the identity of the party or parties hat had abducted him it is needless to say that grant heartily sympathized with the afflicted father and was sad on his own account for he had become warmly attached to the little boy whose instant companion he had been in his hours of leisure the only one in the house who took the matter coolly was mrs estabrook the housekeeper she even ventured to suggest that herbert had run away what do you mean mrs estabrook exclaimed the father impatiently you ought to know my poor boy better than that boys are a worrisome set returned the housekeeper composedly only last week i read in the herald about two boys who ran away from good homes and went out to kill indians herbert was not that kind of a boy said grant he had no fondness for adventure i have known herbert longer than you young man retorted the housekeeper with a sneer it is very clear that you didnt know him as well said mr reynolds mrs estabrook sniffed but said nothing without expressly saying so it was evident that she dissented from mr reynolds opinion the brokers loss unfitted him for work and he left the details of office work to his subordinates while nearly all his time was spent in interviews with the police authorities or in following up faint clews his loss seemed to strengthen the intimacy and attachment between him and grant in whom he confided without reserve when at home in the evening he talked over with grant whom he found a sympathetic listener the traits of the stolen boy and brought up reminiscences trifling perhaps but touching under the circumstances to mrs estabrook he seldom spoke of his son her cold and unsympathetic temperament repelled him she had never preferred to feel any attachment for herbert and the boy quick to read her want of feeling never cared to be with her one morning after mr reynolds and grant had gone out mrs estabrook on going to the hall saw a letter on the table which had been left by the postman as curiosity was by no means lacking in the housekeepers composition she took it up and peered at the address through her glasses it was directed to mr reynolds in a round schoolboy hand mrs estabrooks heart gave a sudden jump of excitement its herberts handwriting she said to herself she examined the postmark and found that it was mailed at scipio illinois she held the letter in her hand and considered what she should do should the letter come into the hands of mr reynolds the result would doubtless be that the boy would be recovered and would reveal the name of his abductor this would subject her favorite willis ford to arrest and probably imprisonment he should have been more careful and not allowed the boy to write said the housekeeper to herself willis must have been very imprudent if i only knew what was in the letter the housekeepers curiosity became so ungovernable that she decided to open it by steaming it she could do it and if it seemed expedient paste it together again she had little compunction in the matter in a few minutes she was able to withdraw the letter from the envelope and read its contents this is what herbert wrote scipio ill dear papa i know you must have been very anxious about me i would have written you before but i have had no chance willis ford found me playing in the street and got me to go with him by saying you had sent for me i thought it strange you should have sent mr ford but i didnt like to refuse for fear it was true we went on board a steamer in the harbor and mr ford took me in a stateroom then he put a handkerchief to my face and i became sleepy when i waked up we were at sea i dont know where i went but when we came to land some time the next day we got into the cars and traveled for a couple of days i begged mr ford to take me home but it made him cross i think he hates you and grant and i think he took me away to spite you i am sure he is a very wicked man finally we came to this place it is a small place in illinois the people who live here are mr and mrs barton and their son abner mr joel barton is a drunkard he gets drunk whenever he has money to buy whisky mrs barton is a hardworking woman and she does about all the work that is done mr ford paid her some money in advance she is a tall woman and her voice sounds like a mans she does not ill treat me but i wish i were at home abner is a big rough boy a good deal older and larger than i am but he is kind to me and he wants to come to new york he says he will run away and take me with him if we can get enough money to pay our fares i dont think we could walk it so far abner might for he is a good deal stronger than i am but i know i should get very tired now dear papa if you will send me money enough to pay for railroad tickets abner and i will start just as soon as we get it i dont know as he ought to run away from home but he says his father and mother dont care for him and i dont believe they do his father doesnt care for anything but whisky and his mother is scolding him all the time i dont think she would do that if she cared much for him do you i have filled the paper and must stop be sure to send the money to your loving son herbert reynolds how easy you write said abner in wonder as he saw herberts letter growing long before his eyes it would take me a week to write as long a letter as that and then i couldnt do it i cant write so easy generally said the little boy but you see i have a good deal to write about then theres another thing said abner i shouldnt know how to spell so many words you must be an awful good scholar i always liked to study said herbert dont you like to read and study no id rather play ball or go fishin wouldnt you i like to play part of the time but i wouldnt like to grow up ignorant i expect ill always be a knownothin but i reckon i know as much as dad the old mans awful ignorant he dont care for nothin but whisky and i hope you wont be like him in that abner no i wont i wouldnt like to have the boys flingin stones at me as they did at dad once when he was tight i licked a couple of em mrs estabrook read herberts letter with intense interest she saw that the little boys testimony would seriously incriminate willis ford if he were recovered as he would be if this letter came into his fathers hands theres only one thing to do the housekeeper reflected closing her thin lips tightly she lit the gas jet in her chamber and without a trace of compunction held the letter in the flame until it was thoroughly consumed chapter xxxii hope deferred day after day herbert and abner went to the post office and inquired for letters but alas none came poor herbert was in despair he thought his father would have instantly sent the money or come out himself to take him home was it possible his father had forgotten him or was indifferent to his absence he could not believe it but what was he to think i reckon your father didnt get the letter suggested abner herbert hailed this suggestion with relief or maybe marm has told the postmaster to give her any letters that come this suggestion too seemed not improbable what can we do asked herbert helplessly i reckon wed better run away without money well hire out to somebody for a week or two and write from where we are im afraid i couldnt do much work said the little boy then ill work for both said abner stoutly ive got tired of stayin at home anyway ill do whatever you say said herbert feeling that any change would be for the better ill tell you when im ready said abner well start some time when marms gone to the village there was another reason for herberts being dissatisfied with his new home a month had passed the full time for which willis ford had paid the boys board and there were no indications that any more was to be paid during the the first week the fare had been tolerable though mrs barton was not a skillful cook but now there was no money left and the family fell back upon what their limited resources could supply mush and milk now constituted their principal diet it is well enough occasionally but when furnished at every meal both herbert and abner became tired of it havent you got anything else for dinner marm asked abner discontentedly no i havent answered the mother snappishly you used to have sassiges and bacon that was when i had money to buy em wheres all that money gone the man left with him indicating herbert its spent and i wish willis ford would send along some more mighty quick he neednt expect me to take a free boarder she looked severely at herbert as if he were in fault certainly the poor boy had no desire to live on the liberality of mrs barton maybe hes sent you some money in a letter suggested abner well i never thought of that its a bright idee ef it did come from you abner barton jest go up to the postoffice after dinner and ask if theres any letter for me ef there is mind you dont open it all right marm come along bub said abner this was the name he gave to herbert whom he liked in his own rough way i dont think said herbert as they walked along that your mother can have got any letter written by my father if she had she would not be out of money i reckon youre right do you think that ford feller will send money for your board i think he will if he can for he wants to keep me here but i dont think he has much money with him all the worse for marm abner said herbert after a pause during which he had been thinking seriously would you mind running away pretty soon no bub im ready any time are you in a hurry you see abner i dont want to live on your mother she isnt rich no i guess not ef she hadnt married sech a goodfornothin as dad i wouldnt speak so of your father abner why not isnt it the truth dads no grit he gits drunk whenever he has a chance marms a good hardworkin woman shed git along well enough ef she was alone at any rate she cant afford to board me for nothing so i am ready to start whenever you are abner suppose we get up early tomorror and start how early three oclock marm gets up at five we must be on the road before that time im willing abner you must wake me up in time youd better go to bed early bub and git all the sleep you can well have a hard day tomorrer chapter xxxiii the journey begins wake up there the little boy stirred in his sleep and finally opened his eyes by the faint light that entered through the window he saw abner bending over him what is it he asked drowsily the kitchen clocks just struck three whispered abner you havent forgotten that we are going to run away have you ill get right up said herbert rubbing his eyes in two minutes the boys were dressed and ready for a start it had taken a great deal longer for herbert to dress at home but he had become less particular as to his toilet now the boys took their shoes in their hands and stole out in their stocking feet as they passed the door of the room in which mr and mrs barton slept they heard the deep breathing of both and knew that they were not likely to be heard outside the door they put on their shoes and were now ready to start wait a minute bub said abner he reentered the house and presently came out holding half a loaf in his hand thatll do for our breakfast he said we wont eat it now well wait till five oclock then well be hungry by five oclock they were as many miles on their way they had reached the middle of the next town do you feel tired bub asked abner a little i feel hungry dont you think we can eat the bread now yes wed better i feel kind o gone myself they sat down under a tree and abner divided the bread fairly you ought to have more than i protested herbert youre bigger than i and need more never mind that youll need it to keep up your strength abner was not naturally unselfish but he was manly enough to feel that he ought to be generous and kind to a boy so much smaller and he felt repaid for his selfdenial by noticing the evident relish with which herbert ate his allowance of bread even to the smallest crumb they found a spring which yielded them a cool refreshing draught and soon were on their way once more they had proceeded perhaps two miles further when the rumbling of wheels was heard behind them and a farm wagon soon came up alongside the driver was a man of about thirty sunburned and roughly clad whoa there he said the horse stopped where are you two goin he asked were travelin answered abner noncommittally wheres your home some ways back where are you goin im after work answered abner well youd orter be a good hand at it you look strong is that little feller your brother no hes my cousin herbert looked up in surprise at this avowal of relationship but he thought it best not to say anything that would conflict with abners statement is he after work too asked the driver with a smile no hes goin to his father where does he live further on have you walked fur pretty fur ef you want to ride ill give you a lift for a few miles thank you said abner prompt to accept the offer ill help you in bub the two boys took their seats beside the driver herbert being in the middle the little boy was really tired and he found it very pleasant to ride instead of walking he had walked seven miles already and that was more than he had ever before walked at one time they rode about three miles when the driver pulled up in front of a comfortablelooking house this is where i stop he said my aunt lives here and my sister has been paying her a visit ive come to take her home the front door was opened and his aunt and sister came out youre just in time for breakfast john said his aunt come in and sit down to the table bring in the boys too come in boys said the young man i guess you can eat something cant you weve had herbert began but abner checked him come along bub he said whats a bit of bread i aint half full chapter xxiv mrs bartons surprise a hearty breakfast consisting of beefsteak potatoes corn bread fresh butter and apple sauce made abners eyes glisten for he had never in his remembrance sat down at home to a meal equally attractive he wielded his knife and fork with an activity and energy which indicated thorough enjoyment even herbert though in the city his appetite had been delicate and he had already eaten part of a loaf of bread did excellent justice to the good things set before him he was himself surprised at his extraordinary appetite forgetting the stimulating effect of a sevenmile walk after breakfast they set out again on their tramp at sunset having rested several hours in the middle of the day they had accomplished twenty miles abner could have gone further but herbert was well tired out they obtained permission from a friendly farmer to spend the night in his barn and retired at halfpast seven mr reynolds would have been shocked had he known that his little son was compelled to sleep on a pile of hay but it may truthfully be said that herbert had seldom slept as soundly or felt more refreshed how did you sleep abner he asked like a top how was it with you bub i didnt wake up all night answered the little boy i wonder what dad and marm thought when they found us gone said abner with a grin wont they feel bad not much said abner they aint that kind i reckon it wont spoil their appetite when they descended from the haymow the farmer was milking his cows well youngsters he said so youre up and dressed yes sir and ready for breakfast ill be bound i reckon i should feel better for eatin said abner promptly jest you wait till i get through milkin and well see what mrs wiggins has got for us abner heard these words with joy for he was always possessed of a good appetite i say bub im glad i run away he remarked aside to herbert we live enough sight better than we did at home leaving the boys to pursue their journey we will return to the bereaved parents and inquire how they bore their loss when mrs barton rose to commence the labors of the day she found that no wood was on hand for the kitchen fire abners gittin lazier and lazier she soliloquized ill soon have him up she went to the foot of the stairs and called abner in a voice by no means low or gentle there was no answer that boy would sleep if there was an earthquake she muttered come down here and split some wood you lazy boy she cried still louder again no answer he hears fast enough but he dont want to work ill soon have him down she ascended the stairs two steps at a time and opened the door of her sons room if abner had been in bed his mother would have pulled him out for her arm was vigorous but the bed was empty well i vum she ejaculated in surprise ef that boy isnt up already thats a new wrinkle and the little boy gone too what can it mean it occurred to mrs barton that abner and herbert might have got up early to go fishing though she had never known him to make so early a start before i reckon breakfastll bring em round she said to herself i reckon i shall have to split the wood myself in half an hour breakfast was ready it was of a very simple character for the family resources were limited mr barton came downstairs and looked discontentedly at the repast provided this is a pretty mean breakfast mrs b he remarked wheres your meat and taters theres plenty of em in the market answered mrs barton then why didnt you buy some you ought to know joel barton you give me the money and ill see that you have a good breakfast wheres all the money that man ford gave you where is it its eaten up mr barton and you did your share ef youd had your way youd have spent some of the money for drink why dont he send you some more then ef you see him anywheres youd better ask him its your business to provide me with money you cant expect one boys board to support the whole family its strange where them boys are gone said joel desirous of changing the subject like as not they hid under the bed and fooled you ef they did ill rout em out said mrs barton who thought the supposition not improbable once more she ascended the stairs and made an irruption into the boys chamber she lifted the quilt and peered under the bed but there were no boys there looking about the room however she discovered something else on the mantelpiece was a scrap of paper which appeared to be so placed as to invite attention whats that said mrs barton to herself a moment later she was descending the staircase more rapidly than she had gone up just before look at that she exclaimed holding out a scrap of paper to joel barton i dont see nothin but a bit of paper said her husband dont be a fool read what it is read it aloud i aint got my specks the boys have run away abner writ it listen to this rudely written on the paper for abner was by no means a skillful penman were these words bub and i have runned away you neednt worry i reckon we can get along were going to make our fortunes when were rich well come back abner what do you think of that joel barton demanded his wife joel shrugged his shoulders i shant worry much he said theyll be back by tomorrer likely then youll have to split some wood today joel you cant expect a delicate woman like me to do such rough work youre strongern i be mrs b perhaps youll find i am if you dont go to work ill do it this afternoon all right then well have dinner in the evenin no wood no dinner seems to me youre rather hard on me mrs b i dont feel well nor you wont till you give up drinkin much against his will mr barton felt compelled by the stress of circumstances to do the work expected of him it made him feel angry with abner whom he did not miss for any other reason ill break that boys neck when he comes back he muttered its a shame to leave all this work for his poor old dad tomorrow came but the boys did not a week slipped away and still they were missing mrs barton was not an affectionate mother but it did seem lonesome without abner as for herbert she did not care for his absence if willis ford did not continue to pay his board she felt that she would rather have him away on the sixth day after the departure of the boys there came a surprise for mrs barton as she was at work in the kitchen she heard a loud knock at the door can it be abner she thought he wouldnt knock she went to the door however feeling rather curious as to who could be her visitor and on opening it started in surprise to see willis ford mr ford she ejaculated i thought i would make you a call answered ford hows the boy getting along if you mean the boy you left here she answered composedly hes run away and took my boy with him run away ejaculated ford in dismay yes he made tracks about a week ago he and my abner have gone off to make their fortunes why didnt you take better care of him woman exclaimed ford angrily its your fault his running away look here ford retorted mrs barton dont you sass me for i wont stand it ef it hadnt been for you abner would be at home now i didnt mean to offend you my dear mrs barton said ford seeing that he had made a false step tell me all you can and ill see if i cant get the boys back now youre talkin said mrs barton smoothing her ruffled plumage come into the house and ill tell you all i know chapter xxxv herbert breaks down i dont think i can walk any further abner i feel sick faltered herbert abner who had been walking briskly turned round to look at his young companion herbert was looking very pale and had to drag one foot after the other day after day he had tried to keep up with abner but his strength was far inferior to that of the other boy and he had finally broken down you do look sick bub said abner struck by herberts pallid look was i walking too fast for you i feel very weak said herbert would you mind stopping a little while i should like to lie under a tree and rest all right bub theres a nice tree dont you feel tired abner no i feel as strong as hearty as a horse you are bigger than i am i guess that is the reason abner was a rough boy but he showed unusual gentleness and consideration for the little boy whose weakness appealed to his better nature he picked out a nice shady place for herbert to recline upon and taking off his coat laid it down for a pillow on which his young companion might rest his head there bub i reckon youll feel better soon he said i hope so abner i wish i was as strong as you are so do i i reckon i was born tough i was brought up different from you i wish i were at home sighed herbert is it a long way from here i reckon it is but i dont know answered abner whose geographical notions were decidedly hazy an hour passed and still herbert lay almost motionless as if rest were a luxury with his eyes fixed thoughtfully upon the clouds that could be seen through the branches floating lazily above dont you feel any better bub asked abner i feel better while i am lying here abner dont you feel strong enough to walk a little further must i asked herbert sighing it is so nice to lie here i am afraid we shall never get to new york if we dont keep goin ill try said herbert and he rose to his feet but he only staggered and became very white i am afraid i need to rest a little more he said all right bub take your time more critically abner surveyed his young companion he was not used to sickness or weakness but there was something in the little boys face that startled him i dont think youre fit to walk any further today he said i wish we had some good place to stay at this moment a carriage was seen approaching it was driven by a lady of middle age with a benevolent face her attention was drawn to the two boys and especially to herbert her experienced eyes at once saw that he was sick she halted her horse what is the matter with your brother she said to abner i reckon hes tuckered out said abner tacitly admitting the relationship weve been travelin for several days he aint so tough as i am he looks as if he were going to be sick have you any friends near here no maam the nighest is over a hundred miles off the lady reflected a moment then she said i think you had better come to my house my brother is a doctor he will look at your little brother and see what can be done for him i should like it very much said abner but we havent got any money to pay for doctors and sich i shant present any bill nor will my brother said the lady smiling do you think you can help him into the carriage oh yes maam abner helped herbert into the carriage and then by invitation got in himself may i drive he asked eagerly yes if you like the kind lady supported with her arm herberts drooping head and so they drove on for a mile when she indicated that they were to stop in front of a large substantial square house built after the new england style herbert was taken out and after abner helped him upstairs into a large square chamber with four windows what is his name asked the lady herbert and yours abner he had better lie down on the bed and as soon as my brother comes i will send him up herbert breathed a sigh of satisfaction as he reclined on the comfortable bed which was more like the one he slept in at home than the rude straw bed which he had used when boarding with mr and mrs barton half an hour passed and the doctor came into the room and felt herberts pulse the boy is tired out he said that is all his strength has been exhausted by too severe physical effort what shall we do to bring him round asked his sister rest and nourishing food are all that is required shall we keep him here have you any objection i should object to letting him go in his present condition he will be a care to you emily i shall not mind that we shall have to keep the other boy too certainly theres room enough for both when abner was told that for a week to come they were to stay in dr stones comfortable house his face indicated his satisfaction ef youve got any chores to do maam he said ill do em im strong and not afraid to work then i will make you very useful said miss stone smiling the next day as she was sitting in herberts chamber she said herbert you dont look at all like your brother do you mean abner miss stone herbert asked yes have you any other brother abner is not my brother at all how then do you happen to be traveling together because weve both run away i am sorry to hear that i dont approve of boys running away where do you live in new york in new york repeated miss stone much surprised surely you have not walked from there no miss stone i was stolen from my home in new york about a month ago and left at abners house it was a poor cabin and very different from anything i was accustomed to i did not like mr and mrs barton but abner was always kind to me is your father living asked miss stone who had become interested yes he is a broker and no doubt you have a nice home yes very nice it is a brownstone house uptown i wonder whether i shall ever see it again surely you will i am surprised that you have not written to tell your father where you are he must be feeling very anxious about you i did write asking him to send me money to come home abner was going with me but no answer came to my letter that is strange your father cant have received the letter so i think miss stone but i directed it all right do you think any one would intercept it mrs estabrook might said herbert after a pause for consideration who is she the housekeeper what makes you think so didnt she like you no besides it was her nephew who carried me off miss stone asked further questions and herbert told her all the particulars with which the reader is already acquainted when he had finished she said my advice is that you write to your boy friend grant thornton or tell me what to write and i will write to him his letters will not be likely to be tampered with i think that will be a good idea said herbert grant will tell papa and then hell send for me miss stone brought her desk to the bedside and wrote a letter to grant at herberts dictation this letter she sent to the village postoffice immediately by abner chapter xxxvi grant receives a letter mr reynolds had spared no expense in his efforts to obtain tidings of his lost boy none of his agents however had succeeded in gaining the smallest clew to herberts whereabouts through the public press the story had been widely disseminated and in consequence the broker began to receive letters from various points from persons professing to have seen such a boy as the one described one of these letters came from augusta ga and impressed mr reynolds to such an extent that he decided to go there in person and see for himself the boy of whom his correspondent wrote the day after he started grant on approaching the house at the close of business fell in with the postman just ascending the steps have you got a letter for me he asked i have a letter for grant thornton was the reply that is my name said grant he took the letter supposing it to be from home he was surprised to find that it had a western postmark he was more puzzled by the feminine handwriting have you heard anything from the little boy asked the postman for mr reynolds loss was well known grant shook his head nothing definite he said mr reynolds has gone to georgia to follow up a clew two weeks since said the postman i left a letter here dated at scipio i it was in a boys handwriting i thought it might be from the lost boy a letter from scipio in a boys handwriting repeated grant surprised mr reynolds has shown me all his letters he has received none from there i cant understand it i left it here i am positive of that at what time in the day asked grant quickly about eleven oclock in the forenoon can you tell to whom you gave it to the servant it is very strange said grant thoughtfully and it was in a boys handwriting yes the address was in a round schoolboy hand the servant couldnt have lost it could she no sarah is very careful well i must be going by this time grant had opened the letter he had glanced rapidly at the signature and his face betrayed excitement this is from herbert he said you may listen if you like he rapidly read the letter which in part was as follows dear grant i write to you or rather i have asked miss stone who is taking care of me to do so because i wrote to papa two weeks since and i am afraid he did not get the letter for i have had no answer i wrote from the town of scipio in illinois just what i said interrupted the postman i wrote that mr ford had carried me away and brought me out west where he put me to board in a poor family where i had scarcely enough to eat mr barton had one son abner who treated me well and agreed to run away with me to new york if we could get money from papa but we waited and waited and no letter came so at last we decided to run away at any rate for i was afraid mr ford would come back and take me somewhere else i cant tell you much about the journey except that we walked most of the way and we got very tired or at least i did for i am not so strong as abner till i broke down i am stopping now at the house of dr stone who is very kind and so is his sister who is writing this letter for me will you show papa this letter and ask him to send for me if he cannot come himself i do so long to be at home once more i hope he will come before willis ford finds me out i think he has a spite against papa and that is why he stole me away your affectionate friend herbert reynolds please say nothing about this said grant to the postman i dont want it known that this letter has come what will you do i shall start for the west myself tonight mrs estabrook intercepted that letter said grant to himself i am sure of it chapter xxxvii willis ford finds the runaways i shall be absent for a few days mrs estabrook said grant to the housekeeper as he entered the house where are you going she inquired i cant tell you definitely hadnt you better wait till mr reynolds gets back no business is not very pressing in the office and i can be spared the housekeeper concluded that grant was going to colebrook and did not connect his journey with the lost boy oh well i suppose you understand your own business best herbert will miss you if he finds you away when his father brings him back do you think he will asked grant eyeing the housekeeper sharply im sure i dont know i suppose he expects to or he would not have traveled so far in search of him shall you be glad to see him back mrs estabrook of course what makes you doubt it demanded the housekeeper sharply i thought you didnt like herbert i wasnt always petting him it isnt in my way to pet boys do you often hear from willis ford that is my business answered mrs estabrook sharply why do you ask i was wondering whether he knew that herbert had been abducted that is more than we know very likely the boy ran away grant called on the cashier at his private residence confided to him his plan and obtained a sum of money for traveling expenses he left the grand central depot by the evening train and by morning was well on his way to chicago meanwhile willis ford had left no stone unturned to obtain news of the runaways this he did not find difficult though attended with delay he struck the right trail and then had only to inquire as he went along whether two boys had been seen one small and delicate the other large and wellgrown wandering through the country plenty had seen the two boys and told him so are they your sons mister asked a laborer of whom he inquired not both of them only the smaller answered ford with unblushing falsehood and what made them run away now my son probably did not like the boarding place i selected for him why didnt he write to you he didnt know where to direct who is the other lad the son of the man i placed him with i think he may have induced sam to run away finally ford reached claremont the town where the boys had actually found refuge here he learned that two boys had been taken in by dr stone answering to the description he gave one the younger one had been sick but now was better this information he obtained at the hotel fords eyes sparkled with exultation he had succeeded in his quest and once more herbert was in his hands or would be very soon he inquired the way to dr stones everybody knew where the doctor lived and he had no trouble in securing the information he sought indeed before he reached the house he caught sight of abner walking in the same direction with himself but a few rods ahead he quickened his pace and laid his hand on the boys shoulder abner turned and an expression of dismay overspread his face ha my young friend i see that you remember me said ford ironically well what do you want asked abner sullenly you know well enough i want the boy you have persuaded to run away with you i didnt persuade him never mind about quibbling i know where the boy is and i mean to have him do you want me too no i dont care where you go i reckon herbert wont go with you and i reckon he will that is dr stones isnt it never mind answering i know well enough it is hell have bub sure said abner disconsolately but ill follow em and ill get him away as sure as my names abner barton chapter xxxviii ford takes a bold step but fails i wish to see miss stone said willis ford to the servant ill tell her what name shall i say never mind about the name i wish to see her on business of importance i dont like his looks thought the maid shure he talks as if he was the boss she told miss stone however that a gentleman wished to see her who would not tell his name miss stone was in herberts chamber and the boy now nearly well quite well in fact but for a feeling of languor and weakness heard the message what is he like he asked anxiously hes slender like with black hair and a black mustache and he talks like he was the master of the house i think it is willis ford said herbert turning pale the man who abducted you ejaculated miss stone yes the same man dont let him take me away implored herbert i wish my brother were here said miss stone anxiously wont he be here soon i am afraid not he has gone on a round of calls bridget tell the young man i will be down directly five minutes later miss stone descended and found willis ford fuming with impatience i am here sir she said coldly i understand you wish to see me yes madam will you answer me a few questions possibly let me hear what they are you have a boy in this house named herbert reynolds yes a boy who ran away from mr joel barton with whom i placed him what right had you to place him anywhere mr ford demanded the lady thats my business permit me to say that it is no affair of yours i judge differently the boy is sick and under my charge i am his natural guardian madam who made you so mr ford i shall not argue that question it is enough that i claim him as my cousin and ward your cousin certainly that doubtless conflicts with what he has told you he was always a liar his story is that you beguiled him from his home in new york and brought him against his will to this part of the country and you believe him sneered ford i do it matters little whether you do or not he is my sisters child and is under my charge i thought fit to place him with mr joel barton of scipio but the boy who is flighty was induced to run away with bartons son a lazy shiftless fellow supposing this to be so mr ford what is your object in calling to reclaim him it does not suit me to leave him here fords manner was so imperative that miss stone became alarmed the boy is not fit to travel she said wait till my brother comes and he will decide being a physician whether it is safe to have him go madam this subterfuge will not avail said ford rudely i will not wait till your brother comes i prefer to take the matter into my own hands he pressed forward to the door of the room and before miss stone could prevent it was on his way upstairs she followed as rapidly as she could but before she could reach him ford had dashed into the room where herbert lay on the bed herbert was stricken with terror when he saw the face of his enemy i see you know me said ford with an evil smile get up at once and prepare to go with me leave me here mr ford i cant go with you indeed i cant said herbert well see about that said ford i give you five minutes to rise and put on your clothes if you dont obey me i will flog you looking into his cruel face herbert felt that he had no other resource trembling he slipped out of bed and began to draw on his clothes he felt helpless but help was nearer than he dreamed mr ford i protest against this highhanded proceeding exclaimed miss stone indignantly as she appeared at the door of the chamber what right have you to go over my house without permission if it comes to that sneered ford what right have you to keep my ward from me i am not his ward said herbert quickly the boy is a liar exclaimed ford harshly get back into the bed herbert said miss stone this man shall not take you away perhaps you will tell me how you are going to help it retorted ford with an evil smile if my brother were here but your brother is not here and if he were i would not allow him to interfere between me and my cousin herbert unless you continue dressing i shall handle you roughly but sounds were heard upon the stairs and ford as well as miss stone turned their eyes to the door the first to enter was abner oh its you is it said ford contemptuously he had thought it might be dr stone whom he was less inclined to face than he professed yes it is what are you doing here it is none of your business you cub hes got to come with me maybe you want me too i wouldnt take you as a gift ho ho laughed abner i reckon youd find me a tough customer you wont take bub either who is to prevent me i will said a new voice and grant thornton who had fallen in with abner outside walked quietly into the room willis ford started back in dismay grant was the last person he expected to meet here he had no idea that any one of the boys home friends had tracked him this far he felt that he was defeated but he hated to acknowledge it how are you going to prevent me you young whippersnapper he said glaring menacingly at grant mr willis ford unless you leave this room and this town at once said grant firmly i will have you arrested there is a local officer below whom i brought with me suspecting your object in coming here oh grant how glad i am to see you is papa with you exclaimed herbert overjoyed i will tell you about it soon herbert you wont let him take me away there is no danger of that said grant reassuringly i shall take you home to new york as soon as this good lady says you are well enough to go ford stood gnawing his nether lip if it had been mr reynolds he would not have minded so much but for a mere boy like grant thornton to talk with such a calm air of superiority angered him boy he said it sounds well for you to talk of arrest you who stole my aunts bonds and are indebted to her forbearance for not being at this moment in states prison your malicious charge does not affect me mr ford returned grant it was proved before you left new york that you were the thief and even your stepmother must have admitted it mr reynolds discharged you from his employment and this is the mean revenge you have taken the abduction of his only son i will do you an injury yet you impudent boy said ford furiously i shall be on my guard mr ford answered grant i believe you capable of it dont you think you had better leave us sir said miss stone i shall take my own time about going he answered impudently but his words were heard by dr stone who had returned sooner than he anticipated and was already at the door of the room he was a powerful man and of quick temper his answer was to seize ford by the collar and fling him downstairs this will teach you to be more polite to a lady he said now what does all this mean and who is this man the explanation was given i wish i had been here before said the doctor you were in good time said grant smiling i see that herbert has found powerful friends willis ford angry and humiliated picked himself up but did not venture to return to the room he had left so ignominiously like most bullies he was a coward and he did not care to encounter the doctor again within an hour grant telegraphed to the broker at his office i have found herbert and will start for new york with him tomorrow mr reynolds had only just returned from his fruitless southern expedition weary and dispirited but he forgot all his fatigue when he read this message god bless grant thornton he ejaculated chapter xxxix the housekeepers retribution the train from chicago had just reached the grand central depot from the parlor car descended two boys who are well known to us grant thornton and herbert reynolds herbert breathed a sigh of satisfaction oh grant he said how glad i am to see new york once more i wonder if papa knows we are to come by this train the answer came speedily the broker who had just espied them hurried forward and his lost boy was lifted to his embrace thank god i have recovered you my dear son he exclaimed fervently you must thank grant too papa said the little boy it was he who found me and prevented mr ford stealing me again mr reynolds grasped grants hand and pressed it warmly i shall know how to express my gratitude to grant in due time he said on their way home grant revealed to mr reynolds for the first time the treachery of the housekeeper who had suppressed herberts letter to his father and left the latter to mourn for his son when she might have relieved him of the burden of sorrow as mr reynolds listened his face became stern that woman is a viper he said in my house she has enjoyed every comfort and every consideration and in return she has dealt me this foul blow she will have cause to regret it when they entered the house mrs estabrook received them with false smiles so you are back again master herbert she said a fine fright you gave us you speak as if herbert went away of his own accord said the broker sternly you probably know better i know nothing sir about it then i may inform you that it was your stepson willis ford who stole my boy a noble revenge truly upon me for discharging him i dont believe it said the housekeeper i presume it is your office boy who makes this charge she added pressing her thin lips together there are others who are cognizant of it mrs estabrook grant succeeded in foiling mr ford in his attempt to recover herbert who had run away from his place of confinement you are prejudiced against my son mr reynolds said mrs estabrook her voice trembling with anger not more than against you mrs estabrook i have a serious charge to bring against you what do you mean sir asked the housekeeper nervously why did you suppress the letter which my boy wrote to me revealing his place of imprisonment i dont know what you mean sir she answered half defiantly i think you do did master herbert write such a letter yes then it must have miscarried on the contrary the postman expressly declares that he delivered it at this house i charge you with concealing or suppressing it the charge is false you cant prove it sir i shall not attempt to do so but i am thoroughly convinced of it after this act of treachery i cannot permit you to spend another night in my house you will please pack at once and arrange for a removal i am entitled to a months notice mr reynolds you shall have a months wages in lieu of it i would as soon have a serpent in my house mrs estabrook turned pale she had never expected it would come to this she thought no one would ever be able to trace the suppressed letter to her she was not likely again to obtain so comfortable and desirable a position instead of attributing her ill fortune to her own malice and evil doing she chose to attribute it to grant i am to thank you for this grant thornton she said in sudden passion i was right in hating you as soon as i first saw you if ever i am able i will pay you up for this i dont doubt it mrs estabrook said grant quietly but i dont think you will have it in your power she did not deign to answer but hurried out of the room in half an hour she had left the house now i can breathe freely said the broker that woman was so full of malice and spite that it made me uncomfortable to feel that she was in the house i am so glad that she has gone papa said herbert that evening after herbert had gone to bed mr reynolds invited grant into his library my boy he said i have settled accounts with mrs estabrook now i want to settle with you not in the same way i hope sir said grant yes in the same way according to your deserts you have done me a service that which none can be greater you have been instrumental in restoring to me my only son i dont want any reward for that sir perhaps not but i owe it to myself to see that this service is acknowledged i shall raise your salary to fifteen dollars a week thank you sir said grant joyfully how glad my mother will be when you tell her this you may also tell her that i have deposited on your account in the bowery savings bank the sum of five thousand dollars this is too much mr reynolds said grant quite overwhelmed why i shall feel like a man of fortune so you will be in time if you continue as faithful to business as in the past it seems to me like a dream said grant i will give you a weeks leave of absence to visit your parents and tell them of your good fortune chapter xl conclusion there were anxious hearts in the parsonage at colebrook for some weeks the minister had shown signs of overwork his appetite had failed and he seemed weary and worn he needs change said the doctor a run over to europe would do him good he has no disease he only wants change a trip to europe said mr thornton shaking his head it is impossible it has been the dream of my life but a country minister could not in half a dozen years save money enough for that if your brother godfrey would lend you the money grant might in time help you to pay it godfrey never had forgiven grant for running counter to his plans i wish i could spare the money myself mr thornton said the doctor five hundred dollars would be sufficient and it would make a new man of you it might as well be five thousand said the minister shaking his head no my good friend i must toil on as well as i can and leave european trips to more favored men it was noised about through the parish that the minister was sick and the doctor recommended a european trip its ridikilus was deacon gridleys comment i work harder than the minister and i never had to go to europe its just because its fashionable mr thornton is looking pale and haggard said mrs gridley what if he is he ought to work outdoors like me then hed know what work was accordin to my notion ministers have a pooty easy time mr tudor was of the same opinion its all nonsense deacon he said father wanted me to be a minister and id have had a good deal easier time if i had followed his advice you wouldnt have had so much money mr tudor said miss lucretia spring who heard this remark mebbe not but what ive got ive worked for for my part although i am not near as rich as you are id give twenty dollars toward sending the minister abroad said kindly miss spring i wouldnt give a cent said mr tudor with emphasis nor i said deacon gridley i dont believe in humorin the clergy saturday came and the minister was worse it seemed doubtful if he would be able to officiate the next day no wonder he became dispirited just before supper the stage drove up to the door and grant jumped out i am afraid he has been discharged said mr thornton nervously he does not look like it said mrs thornton noticing grants beaming countenance what is the matter with father asked grant stopping short as he entered he is not feeling very well grant he has got run down what does the doctor say he says your father ought to take a threemonths trip to europe which of course is impossible said mr thornton smiling faintly not if your brother would open his heart and lend you the money he would not do it and we wont ask him said grant quickly but you shall go all the same father my son it would cost five hundred dollars and for twice as much mother could go with you you would need her to take care of you besides she needs a change too it is a pleasant plan grant but we must not think of it thats where i dont agree with you you and mother shall go as soon as you like and i will pay the expenses is the boy crazy said the minister ill answer that for myself father i have five thousand dollars in the bowery savings bank in new york and i dont think i can spend a part of it better than in giving you and mother a european trip then the explanation came and with some difficulty the minister was made to understand that the dream of his life was to be realized and that he and his wife were really going to europe well well whod have thought it ejaculated deacon gridley that boy of the ministers must be plaguey smart i never thought hed be so successful all the same it seems to me a mighty poor investment to spend a thousand dollars on racin to europe that money would buy quite a sizable farm others however less narrow in their notions heartily approved of the european trip when three months later the minister came home he looked like a new man his eye was bright his face bronzed and healthy his step elastic and he looked half a dozen years younger this all comes of having a good son he said smiling in reply to congratulations a son who in helping himself has been alive to help others half a dozen years have passed grant thornton is now a young man and junior partner of mr reynolds he has turned his money to good account and is counted rich for one of his age he has renewed his acquaintance with miss carrie clifton whom he met for the first time as a summer boarder in colebrook and from their intimacy it wouldnt be surprising if grant should some day become the wealthy jewelers soninlaw uncle godfrey has become reconciled to grants following his own course it is easy to become reconciled to success willis ford is confined in a penitentiary in a western state having been convicted of forgery and there is small chance of his amendment he has stripped his stepmother of her last penny and she is compelled to live on the charity of a relative who accords her a grudging welcome and treats her with scant consideration the bitterest drop in her cup of humiliation is the prosperity of grant thornton toward whom she feels a fierce and vindictive hatred as she has sown so she reaps malice and uncharitableness seldom bring forth welcome fruit the end
