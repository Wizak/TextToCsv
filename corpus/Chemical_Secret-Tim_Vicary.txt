 chapter one a new start mr duncan come in please mr wilson will see you now thank you john duncan stood up and walked nervously towards the door he was a tall thin man about fortyfive years old in an old grey suit it was his best suit but it was ten years old now he had grey hair and glasses his face looked sad and tired inside the room a man stood up to welcome him mr duncan pleased to meet you my names david wilson this is one of our chemists mary carter john duncan shook hands with both of them and sat down it was a big office with a thick carpet on the floor and beautiful pictures on the walls david wilson was a young man in an expensive black suit he had a big gold ring on one finger he smiled at john i asked miss carter to come because shes one of our best chemists she discovered our wonderful new paint in fact when i mean if you come to work here you will work with her oh i see john looked at mary she was older than wilson about thirtyfive perhaps with short brown hair and a pretty friendly face she was wearing a white coat with a lot of pens in the top pocket she smiled at him kindly but john felt miserable ill never get this job he thought im too old employers want younger people these days david wilson was looking at some papers now mr duncan he said i see that you are a very good biologist you worked at a university and then for two very famous us companies but you stopped working as a biologist nine years ago why was that ive always had two interests in my life john said biology and boats my wife was a famous sailor rachel horsley perhaps you remember her she sailed around the world alone in a small boat yes said david wilson i remember her so we started a business said john we made small boats together and sold them and did the business go well asked wilson very well at first then we wanted to build bigger belter boats we borrowed too much money and then my wife john stopped speaking yes the sevens race i remember now said david wilson both men were silent for a moment wilson remembered the newspaper reports of the storm and the lives lost at sea he looked at the man who sat sadly in front of him so after my wife died continued john i closed the business that was five years ago i see said david wilson its a hard world the world of business he looked at johns old grey suit so now you want a job as a biologist well this is a chemical company mr duncan we make paint but we need a biologist to make sure that everything in this factory is safe we want someone to tell the government that its safe to work here and that its safe to have a paint factory near the town thats important to us and if somethings not safe then of course well change it mary carter said david wilson looked at her hut he didnt say anything yes i see john began nervously well i think i could do that i mean when i worked for harper chemicals in london i he talked for two or three minutes about his work david wilson listened but he didnt say anything then he smiled it was a cold hard smile and it made john feel uncomfortable he remembered his old suit and grey hair and he wished he hadnt come you really need this job dont you mr duncan david wilson said you need it a lot yes i do he said quietly but he thought i hate you wilson youre enjoying this you like making people feel small i hate people like you wilsons smile grew bigger he stood up and held out his hand ok he said when can you start what john was very surprised what did you say i said when can you start mr duncan we need you in our factory as soon as possible will monday be ok you mean ive got the job of course congratulations wilson shook johns hand my secretary will tell you about your pay youll have your own office and a company car of course id like you to start work with mary on monday is that ok i yes yes of course thats fine thank you thank you very much chapter two at home hi dad your suppers in the kitchen johns sixteenyearold daughter christine was sitting at the table doing her homework his son andrew who was thirteen was watching television thanks christine john said im sorry im late is everything ok fine thanks christine gave him a quick smile then go with her work john got his food from the kitchen fried fish and chips the food was dry and didnt taste very good but he didnt say anything about that john was not a good cook himself and his children were no better his wife had been a good cook he remembered john tried to eat the terrible supper and looked around the small miserable flat the furniture was twenty years old the wallpaper and carpets were cheap and dirty the rooms were all small and he could see no trees or gardens from the windows just the lights from hundreds of other flats and there were hooks clothes and newspapers on the floor once when his wife had been alive he had had a fine house a beautiful big house in the country with a large garden they had had lots of new furniture two cars pensive holidays everything they needed he had have a good job they hadnt needed to think about money and then he had started the boatbuilding company and his look had ended when rachel had died john had been terribly unhappy much too unhappy to think about business a few months later his company had closed and he had lost all his money john had had to sell his beautiful house in the country and move to this miserable flat and for the last two years he hadnt had a job at all he was a poor man and an unlucky one too he had tried for lots of jobs and got none of them there were too many bright young biologists but now that was all going to change he looked at his daughter and smiled did you have a good day at school christine he asked her oh all tight i suppose she said she didnt look very happy ive got a letter for you she pushed the letter across the table and he opened it it was from her school one of the teachers was taking the children on a skiing holiday to the mountains in switzerland it cost pounds for ten days parents who wanted their children to go had to send the money to the school before february th johns smile grew bigger do you want to go on this holiday christine he asked she looked at him strangely of course i do dad she said but i cant can i we havent got pounds no i suppose not he looked at her carefully through his thick glasses she was a clever strong girl good at her school work good at sports but she had never been skiing john hadnt had enough money are your friends going he asked her some of them yes miranda jane nigel the rich ones you know but they often go skiing its easy for them i know i cant go dad throw the letter away john looked at her and felt his heart beating quickly no dont do that christine he said perhaps you can go if you want to why not christine laughed whats happened dad have you robbed a bank or something john stood up he went into the kitchen and got himself a drink no he said when he came back but something interesting happened today put your homework away christine and turn that tv off andrew ive got something to tell you oh not now dad said andrew this is an exciting story john smiled ive got an exciting story too andrew come and listen john duncans children lived in an old untidy flat they had no money and they often ate awful food but they could still talk to their father so andrew turned off the tv and sat down in a big armchair beside his father and christine the story didnt sound very exciting at first i went to a factory today john said that paint factory by the river no wait andrew paint factories can be very exciting they gave me a job there im going to have my own office a big cat lots of money in fact were going to be rich chapter three rich man john duncan started work on monday and mary carter showed him round the factory the most important thing that the company produced was a new paint for cars it was a very strong hard paint which nothing could damage mary and her chemists had developed it and they had tested it all over the world neither acid nor salt water could damage it and cars came back from both the arctic and the sahara looking like new the company was beginning to make a lot of money from this paint and it had brought four hundred new jobs to the town one day when he was working with the paint john spilt some of the waste products on his leg he cleaned it off quickly but it left a red painful place on his skin which would not go away it kept him awake at night he told his doctor what he had spilt on it and the doctor looked at him strangely so these chemicals had something to do with the new paint did they the doctor asked carefully yes i told you it was a bottle of the waste products i was looking at them in my office i see the doctor looked out of the window thoughtfully his lingers moved quietly on his desk and your company is producing a lot of these waste products now i suppose yes of course john was in a hurry he had to meet someone important in ten minutes look can you give the something to put on it or not oh yes the doctor began to write something on a piece of paper put this on night and morning and the pain will go in a day or two but im afraid the skin there will stay red for a year or two theyre nasty chemicals mr duncan you know yes i know john smiled at him but dont worry doctor were very careful with them in the factory no one can go near them without special safe clothing you can come and see if you like im very pleased to hear it said the doctor he gave the piece of paper to john thank you said john he went towards the door mr dunkan yes john looked back surprised where do these waste products go when the factory has finished with them into the river well yes of course said john but its all right you know in added quickly its very carefully checked all the time its a big river and we only produce a few hundred liters of the waste products a day and were only two kilometres from the sea after all good said the doctor i wouldnt want anyone to drink those waste products thats all they wont doctor said john all the drinking water comes out of the river five kilometres upstream you know that whos going to drink salt water from the river mouth lot heavens sake chemists from london have checked it you know and our company lawyers know all about it so its not dangerous and were not doing anything wrong dont worry about it he went out of the door and after half an hour he had forgotten the conversation he was a very busy man now all day he had to test different types of paints and make sure they were safe he was also busy buying a big comfortable house for his family with a large field beside it where christine could keep a horse the house was half a kilometre from the sea and its gardens went down to the river there was an empty boathouse there can we have a boat dad andrew asked i mean not now of course but one day when youve finished paying for the house perhaps john laughed his children had been poor for so long but now he could buy them anything they wanted you can have a boat now if you want my son he said happily if i can afford a big house like this i can certainly afford a small boat well go fishing every week shall we and ill teach you both to sail in the evenings ive always wanted to do that you know he could not believe how lucky he was he had a good job at last a fine home and his children had everything they wanted he only wished his wife rachel was alive to enjoy it with him there was only one thing that he could not give his children now he could not give them back their mother chapter four the seals a few months later john invited mary to a meal in the new house it was a difficult evening he had never invited anyone to their old flat and the childrens friends never came for meals the new house was very untidy and john was nervous about the food he and christine cooked a chicken because they thought it was easy but the chicken was tasteless and the rice was too soft mary smiled and pretended not to notice but the evening went badly christine was angry with her because she tidied up the kitchen and andrew was angry with her because she didnt want to watch tv both the children went to bed early and thought about their mother but mary came again on a sunday and john took them m all our in their new boat that was much better mary didnt know how to sail so the children had to tell her what to do she did what she was told and seemed to be happy john sat at the back of the boat and watched his children quietly he felt proud of them and he thought were proud of him too the first time mary and the children laughed together john felt a big smile come onto his face it was a beautiful sunny day in the middle of may there was a good wind and the sailing was fun the boat sail fast over small whitetopped waves the sky was blue and clear they sailed down to the mouth of the river where there were lots of small islands and sandbanks look dad quick over there what are they andrew pointed excitedly to one of the long low sandbanks seals said joint havent you seen them before no said andrew only in films not in real life his face was shining excited happy do they really live here yes its a group of seal families the mothers come here every year to have their babies they sailed closer to the sandbank until they were only about twenty metres away from the seals wet shiny seal mothers lifted their heads and looked at them with their blue eyes the baby seals were drinking milk from their mothers climbing over them and playing in the shallow water then a big father seal lifted his head and stared angrily at them i think theyre beautiful said mary i never knew they lived here so close to the town it makes me feel really happy just to see them yes it does doesnt it said christine i think nothing can be really wrong with the world if they can live here all by themselves with no one looking after them yes said mary and theyre really beautiful too look did you see that little one playing on his mothers back i wish i could do that john smiled as he watched mary and his children laughing and talking together he thought the world was a good place too chapter five the new experiment a few days later john asked mary to look at another experiment he took her into a long quiet room at the back of the factory the room was full of the noises of small animals ive been testing the waste products he said here look at this he gave her a sheet of paper some of these rats have had the waste products in their food and drinking water theres no real problem yet one or two have become ill but not many theres nothing very serious mary read the results carefully she didnt like this kind of experiment but she knew it was necessary and john was right no rats had died and not very many were ill so what do you want to show me she asked this he said he opened a box by the window these ten rats have had the waste products in their drinking water for two weeks now i gave them a lot five parts per million theyre going to have babies today if the babies are ok weve got nothing to worry about oh john she said what an awful thing to do i know i know he said but he wasnt listening look he said excitedly some of them have been born already he lifted some of the baby rats out of the box and looked at them through a magnifying glass oh dear he said at last sadly perhaps there is a problem look mary looked through the magnifying glass she began so feel ill there was a long silence there certainly is a problem marys voice sounded loud and high in the quirt room she stared at the small animals under the magnifying glass baby rats with no eyes no care six legs oh john john what have you done he looked at her strangely its awful isnt it rut i had to know and remember mary their mothers have had five parts per million of these chemicals in their drinking water for two weeks thats a lot much much more than were putting in the river mary looked away from the rats she remembered the beautiful afternoon that they had spent with johns children sailing on the dear blue water john these waste products are dangerous she said weve got to stop putting them in the river of course of course john put his hand on her arm but it was the same hand the hand that had held the rats of course well stop it if we need to mary the company can build machines to clean the waste products ill start my report for david wilson next week but she turned round to face him his hand fell from her arm dont you think we should stop making the paint now john perhaps itll take years to build those machines and were putting the chemicals into the river right now a shadow crossed his face his eyes looked at hers they away out of the window i dont think we need to do that now mary were putting very little into the river at the moment and the company will build those machines wont they she remembered her long years of work the hundreds of unsuccessful experiments she touched his hand and smiled i hope so john she said i really hope so she turned and went quickly out of the room chapter six the report johns report took longer than he had thought it was nearly six weeks later when he went to discuss the results with david wilson mr wilson wasnt a scientist he was a businessman he knew how to run a business how to make money thanks for coming john david wilson came out from behind his desk and shook hands with john they sat in two big comfortable armchairs by the window david wilsons office was large with a thick carpet and beautiful pictures on the walls from the window john could see the river and the woods and fields on the other side he felt comfortable happy safe ive read your report wilson began then he stopped and lit a cigarette not very good is it what john stared at him in surprise wilson smiled and moved his hand through the clouds of smoke no no dont worry i dont mean the report is bad of course not youve worked very hard and done your job well what i mean is i dont like the ideas at the end of the report whats wrong with them theyre too expensive the two men stared at each other for a moment and john felt cold and sick in his stomach wilson smiled but it wasnt the kind of smile that john liked look john he said your report says that we should build some new machines to clean up the waste products before they go into the river right and those machines will cost two million pounds where do you think we can find all that money doesnt grow on trees you know no of course not johns mouth was dry he took a drink of water and felt his hand shaking but were selling a lot of the new paint were making millions of pounds every month from that arent we were doing very well yes said wilson but if we spend two million pounds to build these new machines the paint will have to cost more and we wont sell so much but weve got to do it said john these waste products are much more dangerous than id thought didnt you read that in my report when i put the chemicals in rats drinking water some of the baby rats were born without eyes and ears one didnt have any legs and one had six he shivered and some were born without legs when they drank only two parts per million we cant put those chemicals in the river of course i read that john i read your report very carefully indeed and your report also says that on most days we put less than two parts per million into the river no wait listen to me for a minute we both know that no drinking water comes out of this part of the river dont we and in two kilometres the river goes out into the sea so why is it dangerous nobody is ever going to drink it john we dont need to build these new machines john thought of his children sailing on the river in their boat he thought of the seals and people fishing and little children playing on the beach and swimming weve got to build them he said david wilson looked at him carefully his voice when he spoke was very quiet and hard listen to me john youre a very good scientist and were lucky to have you in this company but youre not a businessman and i am look at this he picked up a sheet of paper and held it across the table for john to see it showed how much money the company had we borrowed ten million pounds last year and we employed four hundred more people think how much that means to a small town like this i know said john but just a minute listen to me if we build these cleaning machines of yours people will lose their jobs a lot of people this company cant afford to borrow any more money john we just cant do it john stood up and what happens if people get ill because of this have you thought of that what will the newspapers say then no one will get ill because no one drinks that water john the newspapers will never know about it they will if i tell them there was a long silence then david wilson stood up he walked past john duncan without looking at him and sat down behind his desk when he looked up his were cold and grey like stones from the beach if you do that john i shall say youre a liar youll lose your job youll have to sell your house and go back to living in a nasty little flat youll never get another job and youll never have a house or any money again youll past be an old man walking the streets without friends or money is that what you want john didnt answer he stood for a long time and started at david wilson and didnt say a word after nearly two minutes wilson smiled a thin quiet smile but if you stay with us you will be paid twice as much him year and no one will ever be hurt because no one will ever drink that water he got up from his desk came round to the front and in id out his hand john stood still for a long moment then he shook hands think about it john said david wilson john duncan turned and walked slowly towards the door chapter seven christine and simon mary talked to mr wilson too but it was no good she came out looking tired and very sad for many months she argued with david wilson about the danger of the waste products but he would not listen to her and so eighteen months after johns report mary decided to move to another company she was pleased because it was a more important job but that wasnt the reason she was going she knew that the cleaning machines would never be built john was sad to see her go he had enjoyed working with her and she had come to his house several times over the last year and a half his children liked her now they had never been so friendly with any woman since their mother had died on her last day mary and john had lunch in the factory restaurant together you dont have to go you know mary john said this company is very successful and its growing all the time your new paint has meant four hundred new jobs all because of your discovery this isnt a poor town any more its becoming successful rich people will want to move here from other places he talked about the new sports centre at andrews school which was built with money from the paint company there were two big new shops in the town as well and a new theatre and a lot of new houses and its all because of you he said its wonderful mary dont you think he smiled at her across the table and took her hand in his she looked at him quietly he had changed a lot since he had first started working at the factory for the first six months after he had got the job he had been really happy and lively she had always known where he was in the factory because he was always laughing or singing to himself but for the last eighteen months he had been much quieter he was always busy but he didnt sing or laugh and he didnt often look mary in the eyes and when he was alone he looked tired and sad she took her hand away from his gently you know why im going john she said i know whats going into the liver and i dont like to think about it you should leave too and get a job in another company im too old john stared at her angrily it isnt easy for me to get a new job and mary the company has been making the paint for more than two years now and no ones been hurt have they mary didnt answer for a moment then she said only you what do you mean only me she looked at him sadly his head was bald now and he was beginning to look like an old man once she had wanted to marry him now she was pleased that he hadnt asked her oh i just meant your leg of course john still had a painful red place on his leg and sometimes he walked badly because of it but that wasnt what mary meant john smiled my legs nearly better id almost forgotten about it but mary before you go i wonder if you could help me its a family matter i see well how can i help i dont know your children very well you know no of course not but youre a woman and well its sometimes difficult for me as a father on my own christines a young woman now and she hasnt got a mother to discuss things with i dont always know what to say no mary looked at him sadly she often wondered why he didnt ask her to his house more often she liked him and his children and she thought he liked her how old is christine now eighteen and she wants to get married already shes rather young isnt she john looked unhappy well thats what i say but she had been so angry with me mary really angry whos the young man hes called simon macdonald hes a journalist he works for the local newspaper hes a nice young man i suppose but every time i speak to him we argue and then christine always agrees with him and i get angry with her too i dont want to mary but i do i feel im losing her you see what do you argue about oh i dont know stupid things really he belongs to one of these environmental groups greenworld i think and hes always talking about it he thinks only young people are right and everyone over twentyfive is always wrong mary looked at john thoughtfully well what do you want me to do john im not a mother and ive never been married no but you could talk to christine perhaps if son came to our house for sunday lunch so mary went to johns house simon was there too they had a meal and talked about horses and sailing everyone was polite and there were no arguments later mary went with christine to look at her horse and simon stayed with john in the field mary began to talk about simon hes a fine young man christine hes very clever and kind he makes me think of your father my father hes nothing like my father and dad hates him im sure he doesnt he does he says hes too old for me and i mustnt see him he thinks im still a little girl mary but im eighteen i want to get married tell me more about simon and so for a long time mary stood in the quiet lonely field she helped christine give food to her horse and listened to her talk about simon simon christine said was kind intelligent very hardworking he liked sailing and riding and he wanted to make the world a cleaner better place he made her feel important like an adult not a child any more she had met his parents and they liked her a lot it was only her father so what should i do mary christine asked mary put her hand on the horses neck im not sure she said i think you should marry him but you dont want to make your father angry do you thats not the best way to start your life with simon no but i will if i have to would you like me to talk to him perhaps hell listen to me its difficult for him youre his only daughter and hes probably very worried about it oh would you mary please i want dad to like simon really but hes always nasty to him ill do my best my dear but i dont know if itll work mary did try very hard before she moved to scotland for her new job she spoke to john on the phone and sometimes they had a cup of coffee together in town she was surprised how carefully john listened to her and how grateful he seemed for her help hes really a very lonely man she thought it must be hard for him with two children and no wife he used to talk to his children a lot but he doesnt now at last john agreed to the marriage mary was invited to a special supper because of the good news christine was very happy she kissed mary when she arrived and gave her a small secret present to thank her it was a pair of pretty earrings at the meal john seemed a little nervous but happy too he tried hard to smile and thanked mary although he didnt think of giving her a present he watched christine all through the meal he seemed to be afraid that he would never see her again and he was very happy when she smiled at him then simon stood up to say something mr duncan he said ill always remember this night i know how much you love your daughter and believe me sir i love her too youve been worried about me because you want her to have the best husband possible and i well i cant promise anything but pm going to try to be that man youre a rich man mr duncan and of course christine and i wont have a lot of money at first but i hope well manage he smiled at christine and yesterday mr duncan i spoke to my employer and hes going to pay me a little more than before john looked surprised oh really why is that well because hes given me a new job hes asked me to write about the environment for our newspaper i have to write a fullpage article every week on the environment and this is the first one look here he pulled a page of newspaper out of his pocket and held it up in front of them there were pictures of water sandbanks and some seals the headline read seals at river mouth have strange disease four baby seals found dead chapter eight the wedding day the disease among the seals got worse three more baby seals died and one was born without a tail scientists came from london to look at them and there were long articles in the newspapers but no one was sure what the reasons were some people said that it was a disease that was always in the water some people said the seals were eating diseased fish and some people said that it was the paint factory near the river there was a sewage works near the river too the sewage from another small town came to it one day in the factory john duncan found two young chemists testing samples of water from the river the water came from two kilometres upstream near the sewage works why are you doing that he asked surprised its a special experiment one of them answered david wilson asked us to do it himself didnt he tell you sir john didnt answer he watched them quietly for several minutes what are the results he asked theyre bad sir said the young man but he didnt look worried he looked pleased proud of himself that sewage works is putting a lot of nasty things into the river you know i think the newspapers will be very interested the newspapers john asked the young man smiled yes mr duncan of course our company cares about the environment doesnt it thats why were doing this we want to help those poor seals if we can as john walked away he listened for the sound of quiet laughter behind him but he heard nothing perhaps the young man really believed what he said christine and simon were married on a fine day in june when they came back from the church they had a party in the garden at johns house everyone seemed very happy john liked simons parents and talked to them a lot youre very lucky mr duncan simons father said you have a beautiful house with a lovely river at the end of the garden i havent always been lucky john answered people used to say i was a very unlucky man he stood still thinking he remembered how unhappy he had been in the little flat in the middle of the town he had been unemployed then with no money to buy good things for his children but he had always been able to talk to them now he was a rich man a success and his children didnt want to talk to him he smiled at mr and mrs macdonald yes he said im a very lucky man i have simon for my soninlaw im very pleased for my daughter mrs macdonald was pleased were very pleased to have christine for our daughterinlaw too she said and im sure simon will help you with this river mr duncan i understand theres a disease in it which is making the seals ill simon told me hes going to work very hard to find the reason for that and clean up the river im sure youre pleased about that mr duncan yes of course john had seen simons article in the newspaper last night about the diseases that came from the sewage works david wilson had shown it to him john didnt want to talk about it he saw his daughter laughing with simon andrew and some friends he had never seen her look so happy he remembered his own wedding and the hopes he and rachel had had let me get you another drink mrs macdonald he said we must drink to our childrens future and wish them luck at the bar in the house he met mary she came back to the town sometimes and twice he had visited her in scotland this days been a great success john she said you must be a happy man he touched her arm thoughtfully id like to be mary he said ive tried you know ive done my best but its their world now they must do what they can with it chapter nine i dont believe you its not true christine simons information is wrong i dont believe you father john and christine stared at each other angrily it was a miserable frightening moment for them both it was a night three months after the wedding and christine had come with some happy news she had come to tell her father that she was going to have a baby his first grandchild for a while they had talked about that but then christine had begun to talk about simons new job simon had found some information about the waste products from the paint factory his information was dangerous for the company simon had written an article in the newspaper saying that waste products from the paint factory could be killing the baby seals david wilson had written to the newspaper immediately saying that simons article was completely untrue and so instead of talking happily about the baby christine and her father had argued all evening john had known for a long time that they would have this argument and next week in the town there would be a public enquiry when government officials would try to discover the truth scientists and lawyers would speak on both sides of the argument everyone in the town was talking about the enquiry and about simons newspaper article why did david wilson write to the paper father christine asked hes not a scientist hes just a businessman why didnt you write to the paper i have written to the paper said john sadly youll probably read my letter tomorrow oh what did you say christine asked john felt sad he hadnt wanted to write the letter he and david wilson had had a big argument about it but in the end he had agreed he had agreed to hide many bad things before so one more didnt make any difference i said that our waste products dont make the river water dangerous weve tested them very carefully for many years and if they are diluted in water they are not dangerous at all there are usually only one and a half parts per million in the river water thats all and the seals arent in the river theyre out at sea i wrote that in my letter and ill say the same thing at the enquiry next week christine was watching him carefully as he spoke she saw how tired and sad his face was he was looking at his bands most of the time not at her father i want to believe you but i cant she said softly he looked up dont then he said angrily you believe simon if you want to hes a journalist after all im only a biologist and your father why should you believe me he stood up angrily walked to the door and opened it im sorry christine ive had a hard day im tired and i dont want to sit here listening to my daughter telling me im a liar go home to simon im going to bed she got up slowly its important father she said slowly its important for everyone i know it is christine but the paint factorys important too its given a lot to you and me and to the people of this town try to remember that and forget about the seals for a while cant you there are more important things than money father are there you tell that to all the people who work in the company and live in this town what are they going to live on when the factorys closed because of simons stupid articles can they give their children photographs of baby seals to eat christine looked at him for a long moment before she went out of the door and what about children who play by the river father what if they drink the river water what then nobody drinks water from that part of the river he said and ive told you it isnt dangerous to children christine closed the door quietly behind her chapter ten greenworld two days later christine and simon arrived at johns house it was very early five oclock in the morning and they didnt knock at the door or try to wake anyone up in fact john wasnt there christine knew he had gone to scotland to see mary he was coming back on the morning of the enquiry christine and simon walked quietly down to the boathouse by the river without talking they put the boat in the water and sailed away across the river on the other side of the river they met two friends peter and susan their friends were wearing white clothes with greenworld written on them simon and christine also put on white clothes then they all got into the boat and sailed upstream towards the paint factory it was a windy morning and the waves on the river were quite big but christine was a good sailor and in about half an hour they reached the factory two photographers stood by the river taking photos of them ok simon where is it shouted christine over there look in front of that post he said christine sailed the boat towards the post when they were near it they could see under the water it was the pipe that took the waste products out of the factory ok here shouted simon christine turned the boat towards the wind and susan caught hold of the post then simon and peter climbed out of the boat into the water the water was moving fast here and they had to hold onto the pipe and the boat peter then took several strong paper bags out of the boat the bags were small but very heavy because they were filled with building cement peter passed the bags one at a time to simon and simon went down under the water and pushed each bag into the pipe a few minutes later the mouth of the pipe was full of bags of cement simon came up out of the water for the last time its ok he shouted weve done it the cement is wet already and in a few hours itll be as hard as a rock nothing can come out of that pipe now the two men climbed back into the boat and smiled at the photographers then simon stood up in the boat with christine and held up a long white sheet on the sheet was written green world this pipe kills seals at that moment two things happened a man ran out of the factory shouting angrily and the wind suddenly became stronger it caught the sail and sent it quickly from one side of the boat to the other the back of the sail hit christine hard on the back of the head she fell into the water like a bag of potatoes then the wind caught the sail again and threw it back across the boat this time the boat fell over on its side and lay with its sail under the water simon was under the sail the sail and the sheet were all around him and for several seconds he could see nothing then he came up into the air he saw a foot kicking hard in the water beside him someone was moving under the sail quickly he went down under the water again and tried to help peter but peter caught hold of simon and pulled him under water too there was a quick frightening fight and then simon managed to pull them both up into the air again they held onto the side of the boat together breathing deeply simon saw susan holding onto the back of the boat then he heard someone shouting he looked behind him and saw the man from the factory he was shouting and pointing downstream but simon had water in his ears and at first he couldnt hear the words very well then he understood look the man said the girl shes drowning simon looked downstream where the man was pointing he saw something white floating far away it was not doing anything just floating round and round like a bag of old clothes on the water christine the river was taking her quickly downstream towards the sea hurriedly simon began to swim after her he was a good swimmer but the white clothes slowed him down he swam as fast as he could but he seemed to go slowly so slowly the water seemed heavy and held him back for the rest of his life he would dream about that long slow swim towards a white body that floated quickly away in front of him at last he reached christine she was floating with her face down unconscious he tried to turn her over but it was so difficult she was heavy and her arms fell back in the water when he dropped them he got her face out of the water but her head fell backwards lifeless and she was not breathing he caught hold of her face then put his mouth over hers and blew into it he rested and then blew into her mouth again and again nothing happened he looked around him they were in the middle of the river moving quickly downstream here it was about twentyfive metres to the bank but about two hundred metres downstream a second river came in from the left the bank was further away there and the water moved faster simon was tired and afraid it had rained last night and there was a lot of water moving downstream to the sea the strong wind blew little waves into his face he began to swim on his back pulling christine towards the trees on the bank he swam for half a minute then stopped and blew four times into her mouth once he thought he saw her breathe but he couldnt be sure her face was very white and he had no idea if her heart was beating the river was taking them quickly to the sea he swam harder kicking strongly with his legs nearer only five metres to go now but the bank was moving past very quickly there was a tree near the bank its branches were low over the water simon kicked hard caught the branch and held onto it the water tried to pull him away he took a deep breath and blew strongly into christines mouth again and this time he was sure she took a breath by herself afterwards it took him nearly five minutes to pull her on to the bank when they got there he put her on the ground breathed into her mouth again and then felt for her heart at first he couldnt find it his hands were too cold then yes it was beating for another five minutes he helped her breathe until he was sure she could do it by herself then he began to shiver the wind made his wet clothes cold on his body he wondered what to do then he looked down and saw that christines eyes were open chris he said are you all right she said something but very quietly and he could not hear it he lay down and put his arms around her to keep her warm he could feel her heart beating and her body breathing under him simon began to cry chapter eleven the public enquiry two days later the enquiry began scientists came from london to ask questions about the disease that was killing the seals before he had gone to scotland john had been to see david wilson about the enquiry david wilson had asked john to speak for the company youre our chief biologist john he said youre an important man theyll believe you john said nothing he didnt want to speak at the enquiry but he knew he had to david wilson smiled or at least his mouth smiled but his eyes watched john carefully all the time like the cold eyes of a fish think carefully about what you say john if you say the wrong thing next week hundreds of people will lose their jobs and the first person to lose his job will be you john i promise you that the enquiry room was crowded there were a lot of journalists and photographers there and a lot of people from the town and the factory too johns train was late and he caught a taxi from the station when he came into the room he saw simon sitting with the journalists christine was near him with andrew and some young people from greenworld john smiled at her but she didnt smile back she looks very white and ill he thought its probably the baby he remembered how ill his wife rachel had been in the mornings before christine was born and he smiled sadly to himself mr john duncan please he walked to the front of the room as he sat down he saw david wilsons cold grey eyes watching him from the other side of the room that man should be up here instead he thought he should tell his own lies a lawyer began to ask him questions at first it was easy john explained how long he had worked for the company and how much paint the factory produced then the lawyer asked about the waste products these are very dangerous chemicals arent they the lawyer said well yes of course john answered most chemicals are dangerous if people arent careful with them but were very careful with them in our factory everyone wears special clothing we havent had a single serious accident in three years im pleased to hear it said the lawyer but what happens outside the factory do you really put these very dangerous chemicals into the river yes we do said john there was a noise in the room someone near christine shouted something angrily and a policewoman told him to be quiet john went on of course we put these chemicals in the river hut we dont put a lot in only two or three hundred litres every day thats not much and we check the river all the time three times every day there are usually only two parts per million or less in the water near the factory and there is much less downstream thats not dangerous not dangerous mr duncan said the lawyer slowly are you sure yes i am john said he looked up at the hundreds of eyes watching him david wilsons eyes christines eyes simons i understand the lawyer said slowly that there has been an experiment with some rats some mother rats were given these chemicals in their drinking water and some of their babies were born without legs is that right mr duncan john looked at the lawyer for the first time he was a small uninterestinglooking man in grey clothes with grey hair and a thin face he looks like a rat himself john thought the mans eyes were small and bright and for some strange reason he had a newspaper in his hand john began to feel afraid of him yes he said thats right but rats are much smaller than people and they were given nearly five parts per million in their drinking water for ten days thats very different no one drinks the river water it goes straight out to sea he looked at the lawyer and waited for the question about the seals but it didnt come instead the lawyer said so you wont be worried mr duncan if someone falls into the river by accident and drinks a lot of river water your own daughter for example theres no danger in an accident like that is that right john looked at christine across the room how big her eyes look in that white face he thought it must be because of the baby no he said theres no danger at all there was the sound of voices in the room the lawyer smiled a small ratlike smile he held his newspaper out towards john youve been away in scotland mr duncan he said have you seen this as john read the newspaper his hands began to shake and he had to hold the side of the table there was a picture of christine standing up in a boat near the factory and another picture of her lying in an ambulance with simon beside her the headline said biologists daughter nearly drowns in river there was a long silence he tried to read the newspaper carefully but there was something wrong with his eyes and his head was full of pictures of christine in the river drowning and his wife rachel drowning in the storm long ago he shook his head quickly from side to side then took his glasses off and cleaned them no he said in a quiet voice i havent read this before its all right mr duncan said the lawyer softly your daughter is safe her husband saved her and she hasnt lost her baby but she did drink a lot of river water it was near the factory too youre not worried about that are you the lawyers bright eyes were staring at him like a rat that has just seen its food behind him david wilson suddenly stood up that is a terrible question he shouted into the silence you cant ask a man questions like that of course hes worried about his daughter you must stop this enquiry at once just a minute mr wilson said the lawyer mr duncan can go in a minute he just has to answer one question are you worried because your daughter has drunk so much river water mr duncan are you worried about her baby john duncan stared at the lawyer with fear in his eyes suddenly he hated him he picked up the newspaper and threw it into the little mans ratlike face yes he shouted wildly yes yes yes of course im worried about the baby of course its dangerous now let me go he ran down the room out of the door into the street a hundred staring eyes watched him go chapter twelve the future six months later john duncan was living in a small flat near the sea he had lost his job and had had to sell his expensive house he couldnt afford the payments on it from a window in his flat he could look at the sea he sat and looked at the cold grey sea for hours every day christine would have her baby soon he had bought lots of baby clothes to give her his bedroom was full of baby clothes little pink coats and trousers for a girl blue ones for a boy there were little soft toys too teddy bears and small animals with blue empty eyes but he hadnt given any of these things to her because she wouldnt talk to him when he went to see her she closed the door in his face when he rang she put the phone down when he wrote she sent the letters back unopened there were a lot of books and magazines in his bedroom too but he kept them under his bed he read them sometimes at night but he didnt like to see them during the day they were about babies and the diseases that babies could get before they were born there were some terrible things in the books terrible pictures he didnt like to think about them but he couldnt stop he thought about them all day all the time today as he sat staring out of the window at the sea he could not stop his hands shaking every morning he rang the hospital to ask if his daughter christine macdonald was there he had rung this morning and a nurse had said yes christine was there and the baby was coming that had been four hours ago for two hours john had sat by the telephone afraid to ring the hospital again three times he had picked it up and three times he had put it down again he picked it up again and rang the number seven five eight three it was no good he put the phone down again he could not hear the news from the cold voice of a nurse over the telephone he had to see the baby for himself he got up put on his coat and went downstairs there was a cold wind outside blowing from the sea the sea and the sky were grey and miserable he went into a shop and bought some flowers he chose them carefully bright red and yellow colours and the shopkeeper put paper around them to keep them safe john took them and walked quickly nervously along the windy road by the sea towards the hospital it was raining out at sea already the rain was falling on the sandbanks where the seals used to live soon it would be falling on the town john duncan shivered and turned his coat collar up then with his bright flowers in his hand he walked on into the winter wind the end
