 chapter one shooting in stockholm the woman standing on the wing of the boeing stearman plane was wearing dark glasses the plane flew under a bridge and then low over the crowd the woman waved the crowd waved back it was august th the third day of the stockholm water festival had begun it was twelve oclock and today there was a flying show there were over a hundred thousand people in the centre of stockholm sweden the roads and squares were full of people who also stood on the bridges which joined the citys many islands on the water there were thousands of sailing boats and some larger passenger boats a jet plane screamed through the blue summer sky everyone looked up a smaller plane flew over the crowd near the royal palace half a kilometer from the royal palace a tall blonde woman stood in the crowd outside the city hall she was wearing blue shorts and a yellow shirt and had a yellow bag over her shoulder the woman name was monika lundgren she was twentysix years old monika watched the woman on the wing of the boeing stearman it would be an exciting job she thought it would also be dangerous flying high in the clouds and low under bridges and probably lonely hey you a mans voice said loudly monika turned a young man was standing next to her he was about eighteen he was wearing red white and blue shorts his tshirt said mad about football his head was shaved and his face was red he was holding a glass in his hand he was english and his voice was very loud monika smiled hello she said and turned away she looked back at the city hall the sun was hot and everyone else was watching the planes monika felt a hand on her arm she heard a voice it was the english football fan i said hello the fan shouted monika turned again to the young man she pushed his hand away and stepped back from him then she smiled again and turned away a moment later she felt a hand on her shoulder the football fan pulled her shoulder and turned her around then he pulled her towards him give me a kiss the fan said youre lovely he smelt of cigarettes a few people in the crowd saw what was happening but they didnt do anything everyone else was watching the planes monika looked into the fans red eyes he was holding her with one arm and the glass with the other hand monika suddenly put her arms up over her head the fans arms flew up in the air and he dropped the glass monika was free she quickly hit the fan hard in the stomach his head came forward and down as his hands moved to his stomach there was a look of surprise and pain on his face quickly monika brought her knee up into his face the fan fell forward monika moved behind him her right hand held the fans left arm behind his back while she put her left hand over his mouth she moved the fan towards the water then monika kicked him hard from behind he fell forward into the water the crowd watched as another jet screamed past in the sky monika looked around and then walked away from the water she turned her head left towards her yellow shoulderbag she put her mouth near the bag and spoke quietly into it an engine started and from near the city hall a black boat appeared the boat went quickly across the water to the football fan people in the crowd heard the boat and looked towards it the boat stopped near the fan and two men wearing wet suits pulled the fan into the boat he was alive and very wet he was also very angry he looked at monika and started to shout something at that moment one of the men started the engine and the fans cries were lost the boat disappeared behind the city hall the crowd looked up to the sky again monika lundgren of the smi swedens secret military intelligence department smiled to herself keep him locked up for the rest of the day and then let him out she said into her shoulderbag radio then she turned to look at the city hall monika was not there to enjoy the water festival today she was working with the police it was important to stop any trouble outside the city hall while the festival crowds were enjoying the sunshine something much more serious was happening in the nobel prize room in the city hall twelve men and women were meeting they were the leaders of the largest businesses in europe north and south america and asia the united nations had planned the meeting and the chairman was an important swedish minister kurt carlsson he had been the swedish ambassador in moscow for three years in the early s he was fortyfive but looked younger his long brown hair made him look more like a rock star than an ambassador his voice was loud and clear the former soviet union had tens of thousands of nuclear weapons the russian army has destroyed some of these weapons already destroying a nuclear weapon is dangerous and expensive work the russian army would like to destroy many more weapons but it doesnt have enough money to do so this is where we must help but why someone asked why must we help the russians they are their nuclear bombs not ours its possible carlsson explained that criminals in the former soviet union may steal these nuclear weapons if these bombs get into the hands of terrorists it would be terrible the world will only be safe when these weapons are destroyed carlsson paused for a moment noone around the table said anything they waited for carlsson to continue then a door opened quietly at the back of the room a man in a wheelchair moved quickly up to the table and joined the meeting let me introduce general anders blom of smi swedish military intelligence said kurt carlsson anders blom had short grey hair and a strong face he was in his midfifties twenty years ago someone had shot him while he was working with the united nations in africa the shot had broken his back since then he had been in a wheelchair blom looked around the table and smiled he spoke slowly in a low voice its really quite simple blom explained sweden has a very good relationship with the russian government and with the other countries of the former soviet union we are ready to help them destroy their nuclear weapons but they need money to do this a lot of money and time is short we must do something quickly we know that terrorists are already trying to buy the old soviet weapons as blom says kurt carlsson continued it is simple we can help destroy the nuclear weapons or we can let terrorists get the weapons and they may destroy the world what can we do to help asked a whitehaired japanese woman she was the managing director of an international electrical company it will cost one billion american dollars to destroy the weapons blom replied quickly and there is something else if the russians destroy their weapons the usa will follow and destroy theirs yes carlsson said and that is why you are here we want you to give one billion dollars and save the world from nuclear weapons everyone started to talk at once it was going to be a long meeting outside the city hall monika waited in the sunshine she watched the crowd her job was to make sure that no one tried to get into the meeting time passed and soon it was three oclock in the afternoon the side door of the city hall opened kurt carlsson with police all around him stepped out on to a small platform journalists photographers and tv news reporters stood around the platform behind the journalists some of the festival crowd watched a little surprised people in the boats by the city hall looked up fifty metres out in the water one of stockholms old passenger boats slowed down and stopped kurt carlsson started to speak to the journalists monika felt worried she stood by the platform and looked over the crowd and the water the sun was shining on the water as monika looked at the old passenger boat the name across the front of the boat was ss vaxholm there were people standing along the sides of the vaxholm looking at the city hall there was a sudden bright light from the boat someone taking a photograph monika thought aaaah aaaah it was carlsson his hands were holding his shoulder blood ran out from between his fingers he fell to his knees and then forward face down monikas face did not change she spoke into her shoulderbag radio someone has shot carlsson she said quietly chapter two try and remember exactly what happened blood ran out from under carlssons body two police officers were on their knees beside him people in the crowd screamed police cars and an ambulance arrived monika remained calm she was thinking about the few moments before carlsson fell the ss vaxholm had stopped near the city hall there had been a sudden light on the boat monika hadnt heard anything like a shot but she had heard something just as carlsson fell it was a loud metal sound like money falling to the ground an ambulance took carlsson to hospital and the police started to clear the crowd away monika walked away from the city hall as she went across the central bridge she saw the ss vaxholm disappearing in the distance the narrow streets of the old town were full of tourists monika made her way along stora nygatan which means the big new street even though it is over six hundred years old then she turned off into a narrower street she stopped at a dark doorway took a plastic card out of her bag and pushed it into a hole in the door the door opened and monika went in inside the large old building there was light and lots of activity this was the offices of the smi swedish military intelligence the shooting of kurt carlsson would keep the smi very busy without speaking to anyone monika went into her office her face looked white and worried someone had tried to kill carlsson and she hadnt done anything to stop it monika sat at her desk and looked around her small office there were two photographs on the desk monika picked up one of the photographs and looked at it it was a picture of her parents monikas mother and father were smiling and they looked happy monika had taken the photo when they were on holiday in spain ten years ago soon after their spanish holiday monikas parents had died in a car crash monika was sixteen at the time of the accident she had felt terrible and had missed her parents very much she had gone to live with her grandmother just outside stockholm she didnt have any brothers or sisters and had sometimes been very lonely the telephone on her desk rang it was blom her boss im in my car on the way back to the office he said carlssons alive and hes going to be ok thats good news monika said i want to see you as soon as i get to the office blom continued you were one of the people who were closest to carlsson when he was shot try and remember exactly what happened yes sir monika replied and put down the phone she felt both happy and angry happy because carlsson was alive and angry because of bloms words try and remember exactly what happened blom had said he had spoken to her as if she was a child but she wasnt a child she was the youngest and the best agent in the smi after her parents death she had worked hard at school and had been very good at languages she had also been very good at sport after school monika had joined the army ten months later she had finished her basic training as the best soldier of the year the army then sent her to the usa where she trained with american soldiers for a year she had learnt to parachute and to scubadive back in sweden she was chosen to join the smi partly because she spoke russian and spanish as well as swedish and english of course she was sent to south america where she had done difficult and dangerous work for the smi while there she had saved the lives of two swedish tourists who had been kidnapped by terrorists monika picked up the telephone and rang the shipping company which owned the ss vaxholm she quickly found out that an english football team were on the vaxholm the team was called millham united and came from london millham united were in sweden as part of a tour of scandinavia they were on the ss vaxholm for a sightseeing trip around stockholms many islands monika made another phone call strand hotel can i help you yes my names monika lundgren im a journalist on the newspaper dagens nyheter i believe the millham united team are staying at the strand yes that is they were staying here but theyve just left theyre on their way to finland do you know how theyre travelling monika asked by ferry on the mariella chapter three on the mariella monika knocked on bloms door and went into his office im happy that carlsson is ok she began but i should have seen the danger there was nothing you could do blom said in his low voice tell me what you did see she told blom about the light from the boat the metal noise and that she didnt hear the noise of a gun and do we know who was on the ss vaxholm blom asked an english football team called millham united interesting blom said slowly ive just sent a fax to mi in london i think rightwing terrorists in britain and sweden might be working together perhaps these terrorists have something to do with the shooting of carlsson where are the football team staying they were staying at the strand hotel monika replied but now theyre going to finland how are they travelling blom asked theyre leaving this evening by ferry the mariella monika replied take the ferry with them blom said watch them and find out all you can you can be back in stockholm by tomorrow night monika left the smi offices and walked quickly through the crowds towards stadsgarden and the ferry to finland the mariella was a huge white and red ship it was as big as a city building monika bought a ticket to helsinki and went on to the ferry she watched cars and lorries drive on to the ferry there were quite a few coaches as well monika smiled when she saw a coach with a sign saying millham united an hour later the mariella moved slowly away from stadsgarden and out into stockholms archipelago it would take two hours to move slowly through the hundreds of small islands of the archipelago before reaching the sea then it would cross to helsinki during the night while everyone slept monika enjoyed travelling by ship it was relaxing monika looked down as the mariella passed close to a small island with a red and white house on it the house seemed so small next to the huge ship two small blonde haired children ran out of the house the children waved their hands at the ship monika waved back to the children the mariella passed sailing boats with yellow and blue swedish flags and a larger white passenger boat like the ss vaxholm she thought about who had shot carlsson why why hadnt she heard a gun what was the sudden bright light on the ss vaxholm how can you shoot someone without a gun monika went inside and had a meal the restaurant was full of passengers but she couldnt see any who looked like english footballers the ships nightclub was open monika went in and sat on her own a waiter brought her a drink the nightclub was quite dark and a band was playing on a platform in one corner some people were dancing men and women together and women in groups of women a group of young men stood by the bar with glasses in their hands they were laughing and talking now and then they watched the women dancing they looked like sportsmen monika couldnt hear what language they were speaking but their clothes didnt look swedish she was sure they were the millham united team the band stopped to have a twentyminute break does anyone want to play the guitarist asked as the band left the room one of the men at the bar shouted yes me he walked over from the bar to the guitarist he was a tall man with long red hair he sat down and picked up the guitar he was very good he played fast rock music and then slow love songs monika watched him she couldnt help watching she loved music she let the music fill her the guitarist saw monika watching him he smiled at her she smiled back when the band came back the redhaired man returned the guitar he smiled and then walked over to monika hi the man said in english im bruce you play wonderfully monika said thank you bruce replied with a smile do you want to dance monika thought why not she smiled and got up bruce and monika danced for half an hour bruce danced as well as he played the guitar are you on holiday she asked yes bruce replied im travelling with millham united i go everywhere to see them play do you like football yes monika lied and are you on holiday bruce continued yes monika lied again im going to visit some friends in helsinki after they had danced bruce introduced monika to some of the players in the football team they all seemed very friendly she asked questions and learnt a lot about millham united they had finished their visit to sweden and were now going to play one game in helsinki then they would go back to london by coach and ferry but they were coming back to stockholm for a match in two weeks time do you always travel by coach monika asked one of the players yes he said always although we did fly when we went to south africa bruce asked monika to dance again but she said she had to get up early then she left the nightclub went to her room and locked the door millham united seem ok she thought it was strange though that they always travelled by coach chapter four leave her alone the mariella moved slowly into helsinki it was morning monika watched the city get closer soon she could see the roofs of houses a church and tall buildings suddenly she heard a voice she knew here its her shes the one who pushed me in the water it was the english football fan it was the young man who she had pushed into the water outside the city hall his face was even redder he looked very angry and he wasnt alone six other young men with shaved heads and big boots were with him the english fans started singing here we go here we go they sang as they quickly made a circle around monika the circle closed around her get her one of the fans shouted monika looked at the circle of red smiling faces they were like animals the leader was the fan who she had pushed in the water he came closer to her stop monika heard someone shout stop it now it was bruce the football fans turned to look at him do what i say bruce said leave her alone go and get on the bus then a strange thing happened the young men did what bruce told them they went away thank you monika said i dont know what to say thats all right bruce said im sorry some of these fans dont know when to stop but they did stop they did what you told them monika said in surprise yes bruce said i know them quite well we travel together a lot i see monika said slowly i didnt realised they were your friends bruce smiled were all millham fans he said its lucky we met now i wanted to see you again im not doing anything today would you like to have lunch and a look around helsinki no im sorry she said i cant ive got to go back to stockholm she really

your phone number bruce continued give me your phone number in stockholm no im sorry monika replied i have to go now she turned and walked away from bruce the mariella was in helsinki now and monika left the ship two hours later she was on a plane back to stockholm mi are sending a man called chapman over this evening on the late british airways flight blom said to monika they were in his office chapmans going to help us can you go and meet him at the airport and what about the millham united team monika asked well ask the police in finland to watch them replied blom and theres something else you should know we still dont know how carlsson was shot the police havent found a bullet james chapman was a tall slim englishman of about thirty he had a small moustache black hair and blue eyes he was wearing an expensive suit and had a small bag over his shoulder oh chapman said in a cold voice when monika introduced herself so youre lundgren i was expecting a man not a girl im not a girl monica replied gently im a woman chapman then refused to go into stockholm by bus he wanted to go by taxi but taxis are very expensive monika explained never mind replied chapman in the taxi chapman talked about himself and how good a secret agent he was he didnt seem interested in the carlsson shooting he told her about all the countries he had visited ive never been to sweden before he said i expect its an interesting little place monika looked angrily at him sweden is not a little place she said its much bigger than england oh i say said chapman now now dont get angry lets talk about the shooting of carlsson monika replied chapman listened and said nothing as monika told him what had happened by the time monika had finished the taxi had arrived at the strand hotel where chapman was staying now my dear chapman said taking monikas arm lets go somewhere nice and have dinner im terribly sorry she said im afraid i cant join you ill call at the hotel for you at eight oclock tomorrow morning she was pleased to leave chapman she thought he was boring and rude the next morning monika took chapman to the city hall to see the place where carlsson was shot the police were still there divers were working underwater to try and find the bullet id like to dive underwater chapman said ok monika said me too she had become an expert diver in the usa they put on wet suits in the city hall and then they dived for an hour they found nothing they dived again in the afternoon nothing at four oclock the police were ready to stop chapman had started to take off his wet suit once more monika said there must be something in the water monika worked carefully in the dark water then she felt something under her fingers on the bottom she picked it up and swam up to the top she looked at what she had found it was a small piece of metal like the top of a pen what do you think it is monika asked i dont know said chapman im sure its nothing throw it away no monika replied i think ill show it to blom they took off their wet suits and went back to the smi offices monika walked in and put the piece of metal on bloms desk whats this she asked blom picked up chef piece of metal and looked at it its a crossbow bolt he replied now a crossbow looks like this and he drew a picture its an old weapon that people used to use hundreds of years ago its not heavy and its very strong it shoots a heavy piece of metal called a bolt a crossbow bolt can kill someone over a hundred metres away thats why i didnt hear a shot said monika and perhaps the noise i heard was the bolt the bolt went right through carlsson it hit the ground and fell into the water blom looked up at monika yes i think youre right he said and perhaps the bolt came from the ss vaxholm but what was the light i saw on the ss vaxholm monika asked i dont know yet blom answered but well find out chapman said nothing then coughed excuse me he said if you dont need me i think ill go back to the hotel fine blom said see you tomorrow bye monika said she watched chapman leave the room after he had gone she turned to blom hes not much help she said chapter five i want you to go to london the next day blom monika and chapman met in bloms office blom was talking about a terrorist group in sweden called nordlandet basically he said nordlandet believe that white people should rule the world they are a small group they are not very strong few people agree with them we have similar groups in britain chapman replied he started to talk about terrorism but was soon talking about himself he talked for forty minutes blom and monika learnt a lot about how clever chapman was and very little about terrorists excuse me blom said can i ask a question is it possible that terrorists use football clubs to hide their activities chapman laughed what a strange question he said no i dont think so but anything is possible chapman stayed in stockholm for two more days blom and monika showed him what they knew about nordlandet and other groups chapman talked and talked but said very little each night he asked monika to have dinner with him and each night she refused then it was friday and time for chapman to return to london he said goodbye to blom and monika at the smi offices would you like me to come to the airport with you monika asked politely thank you chapman replied but its not necessary ive enjoyed my visit to your little country and ive learnt a lot i hope you find the person who shot carlsson and from what ive seen id forget about all these terrorist groups if i were you cheerio he said and left do you think hes right monika asked a terrorist group didnt try and kill carlsson i dont know but i want you to go to london this afternoon i want you to find out more about this football team blom said monika nodded shall i tell chapman im coming to london she asked not immediately blom said in my opinion he talks a lot and does very little mi were probably happy to send him away now they can have him back no go to london and see what you can find out yourself chapter six monika couldnt believe her eyes monika took the early afternoon sas flight to london and checked into the scandic crown hotel near victoria station she had a map of london and knew where millham uniteds stadium was she decided to go there first she left the hotel at eight oclock in the evening and took a taxi to the millham united stadium in east london there were lots of people near the stadium and the lights were on is there a match tonight monika asked the taxi driver no the taxi driver replied theres a concert then monika saw a large sign white rock concert monika paid and went in there were about two thousand people in the stadium most were men and most had shaved heads and big boots there was a platform in the middle of the stadium the lights went on a tall redhaired man carrying a guitar walked on to the front of the platform everyone shouted then the redhaired man began to play monika watched in great surprise it was bruce the man she had met on the mariella bruce started to play he was brilliant even better than on the mariella monika listened and watched for half an hour forgetting where she was she liked this man maybe when this is over she thought we can go out together then she remembered why she was at millham united stadium and left the concert the rest of the football stadium was dark outside there was a car park and some lights were on here monika found a door it was open so she went in inside she saw changing rooms showers and football things there was noone there she went on to an area of offices there were lots of doors but they were all locked everything was dark then she saw a light coming from under a door monika walked quietly up to the door she could hear voices monika listened carefully there were several men talking it was hard to hear what they were saying they were speaking english but monika was sure at least one of the men was foreign perhaps swedish she thought monika heard people moving in the room someone was coming to the door there was nowhere to hide if she ran away they would see her the sound of someone walking towards the door became clearer monika turned there was another door opposite and she ran over to it the door wasnt locked she opened it and felt fresh air on her face she was out in the car park she quickly closed the door and looked around she saw some cars and a coach the only light came from a high window it was the room where the men were monika climbed on to one of the cars then she jumped from the car roof to the coach the coach was next to the window moving carefully she went across the roof to the office window it was easy to see into the office from the coach roof there were four men and one woman in the room one man was sitting at a table he was aged about fifty and had lots of black hair sitting next to him was a tall man in sports clothes and trainers he looked about thirty standing near the desk were three people the woman was in her early twenties she had short blonde hair and was wearing jeans and a black jacket next to her was a man of the same age with a shaved head also in jeans and a black jacket he had his hand on the womans shoulder the couple in black jackets were laughing they were laughing at something the fifth person was saying he was much older at least sixty he had white hair a white beard a dark suntan and was very fat damn monika said to herself now i can see them but i cant hear them im sure the couple in black jackets are swedish but who are the others she watched and waited the whitehaired man and the young couple sat down at the table the whitehaired man took some papers and a map out of a bag he talked to the others and pointed at the map i wish i could hear what he is saying monika thought and what country does the map show suddenly the man in sports clothes stood up the others looked at him hes seen me monika thought but the man hadnt seen monika he walked over to the door and opened it another man walked into the room he went up to the table and shook hands with everyone then he started talking quickly the others listened carefully monika couldnt believe her eyes she knew the man who had just come into the room it was chapman monika felt in her jeans pocket she carefully took out a very small camera which looked like a cigarette lighter monika photographed the people in the room through the window noone saw her on the coach roof noone heard her jump down from the coach and run across the car park noone saw her climb the car park wall and get out into the street outside the football stadium a taxi passed and monika stopped it the scandic crown hotel please near victoria station the next morning monika got up early and took the sas flight back to stockholm by one oclock she was at the smi offices by two oclock her photographs were ready monika looked at the photos carefully and then made some phone calls then she took the photos with her to bloms office she told blom about her evening at millham uniteds stadium and showed him the photos i know who the two men at the table are now monika said ive just spoken to a football reporter on dagens nyheter they are harry dixon chairman of millham united and danny worthington the clubs manager and of course you recognise chapman but i dont know who the others are blom studied the photos for a minute then he looked up im pretty sure that the young man and woman are kent nystrom and gunilla lippich both from gothenburg and both members of a rightwing group well have to check but what was chapman doing there monika asked perhaps he was finding out about the football team blom said slowly perhaps hes changed his mind about terrorists and football clubs but he was telling them something monika replied he wasnt listening lets find out who the older man is blom said then well decide what to do monika left bloms office and went to the smi information centre she put a description of the white haired man into a computer and waited a minute later there was a list of names on the screen it was a long list monika printed out the list and studied it then she went back to the computer and started work she put in the names one by one and pictures appeared on the screen the list of over two hundred names was in alphabetical order it wasnt until she got to the letter v that monika had some luck thats him im sure she thought she printed out the picture and some details and ran to bloms office the old man is adolf vitjord monika shouted excitedly hes the leader of a south african rightwing party now thought to be living part of the time in mozambique well done blom replied with a big smile now why were the football team manager and chairman meeting two young swedes and a south african and what has it got to do with the shooting of carlsson and what was chapman doing there monika added lets ask chapman himself blom said and picked up the phone get me mi in london he said quietly i want to speak to mr chapman chapter seven heres something for you is that chapman blom asked blom here listen theres something i want to tell you and a question i want to ask you monika watched bloms face as he talked to chapman blom told him about monikas visit to millham united and the meeting she had seen but he didnt say that she had taken photographs he also didnt say that they knew who the people at the meeting were then blom said and my question is what were you doing there blom was silent and listened from time to time he nodded and said yes i see then blom said no she couldnt hear what the people in the room were saying and no blom raised his voice and sat forward in his wheelchair she wasnt spying on you how could she know you would be there blom was silent again then said thank you and put the phone down he sat silently for a moment and thought then he looked at monika well blom said our friend mr chapman says he went to millham uniteds stadium to help us he was trying to find out about the football club for us he says that he was at the meeting to ask questions he says the other people at the meeting were football fans they were discussing the teams next visit to sweden hes very angry that we didnt tell him you were in london blom continued he thinks you were spying on him do you believe him monika asked i dont know maybe its

surprise but hes in london she said vitjord was in london yesterday blom said but hell return to south africa go and wait for him try and find out why hes so interested in millham united football team

sure she had never been to south africa and she hadnt liked what she had seen of vitjord and what has all this got to do with the shooting of carlsson she asked herself an hour later monika was back in bloms office youre booked on this evenings sas flight to johannesburg from copenhagen blom said with a quick smile your flight to copenhagen leaves in two hours we havent got much time heres a copy

like something to wear monika took the present out it was a blue bikini monika looked at the bikini in surprise she laughed blom took the bikini from her and held up the top half do you see this he asked yes replied monika its a bikini top yes but it is also a radio said blom there are very small wires in the top which catch sounds the sounds are sent to the walkman when you wear the bikini and listen to the walkman you can hear peoples conversations from twenty metres away well monika said of course ill take it but im going to work not lie on the beach take it with you anyway blom said we know vitjord stays at the carlton hotel sometimes and there is a swimming pool at the hotel all right she said and put the walkman and bikini in her bag she looked at her watch i must go chapter eight whos the girl monika felt a push in her back as the giant plane started to move slowly at first then quicker and quicker suddenly the nose of the plane lifted and the sas took off for johannesburg she looked out onto the wing and remembered the woman standing on the wing of the boeing stearman plane at the water festival she wondered if it really was a dangerous thing to do and then she wondered how dangerous vitjord was ten hours later the was over johannesburg monika looked down at the city she could see tall modern buildings large areas of low poor houses on the edge of the city and huge piles of earth from the gold mines the carlton hotel was big and expensive a smartly dressed hotel porter opened monikas taxi door another porter carried her suitcase into the hotel monika checked in and found there was a note for her have a rest i will get in touch with you soon blom she went to her room had a shower and slept it was early evening when she woke she got dressed and went for a walk outside the hotel but didnt go far she passed lines of people waiting for minibuses the women wore colored woolen hats and scarves a barber was shaving a mans head by the side of the road monika was the only white person walking and people looked at her a police car stopped and asked if she wanted help monika said no but walked quickly back to the hotel monika woke up there were other people by the pool now three men were sitting at a table about ten metres away another man was walking towards them he had white hair and a beard it was vitjord hi vitjord said again to the three men he sat down at the table and they started talking monika put on her sunglasses and pulled her hat down over her head then she lay on her side put a cassette into the walkman and pressed record she could hear every word of the mens conversation vitjord was telling the men about his visit to london monika listened in horror she couldnt believe her ears vitjord was buying a nuclear weapon were getting the bomb this week he said our friends are picking it up in russia and bringing it to london then my private plane will fly the bomb to mozambique from mozambique we will bring the bomb here when weve got it here we can take over the south african government we will have the power here and make south africa once again the greatest white country in the world the other men smiled and nodded vitjord smiled back then his face became serious again theres only one problem vitjord continued carlsson he is much better now governments and businesses have given a lot of money since he was shot soon carlsson will have enough money and then the russians will be able to destroy their nuclear weapons we must stop carlsson one bomb is not enough for us we need lots of bombs why didnt we kill carlsson in stockholm one of the men asked therell be another chance vitjord replied carlssons out of hospital now its friday today hes having another meeting in stockholm next friday first well get our bomb and then well get carlsson vitjord hit the table with his hand then one of the men looked around and saw monika whos the girl he said she keeps on looking at you i dont know replied vitjord go and get her monika quickly got to her feet and walked over to the lift she heard someone behind her one of the men shouted hey stop monika jumped into the lift and pressed ground floor there was someone else in the lift it was joseph she pulled the cassette out of the walkman and gave it to joseph send this to blom please she said the lift stopped at the third floor and joseph got out monika continued to the ground floor the hotel entrance hall was busy people looked at monika in her bikini she saw two men talking into radios the men walked towards her she tried to get back into the lift but the doors were closed she waited the lift doors opened and monika stepped in hi a voice said it was vitjord the lift doors closed chapter nine why were you looking at me the smartlydressed hotel porter closed the back door of the white mercedes the car was new and had dark windows the driver started the engine and the car moved quietly and smoothly away from the carlton hotel traffic was heavy in the city and the white car moved slowly as the car left the city centre the traffic became much easier and the car went faster it headed to the north of the city where rich people lived the car passed tall green and purple trees and high walls with glass on the top behind the walls were large houses with swimming pools a few people walked along the side of the road but these people didnt live in that area they were the people who worked in the large houses the people who did the cooking and cleaning monika sat in the back seat of the mercedes with vitjord she was his guest he was taking her to his house for lunch when the lift doors had closed in the carlton monika had thought quickly why were you looking at me vitjord had asked because ive always wanted to meet you monika had replied she had told vitjord that she was on holiday in south africa and that she was swedish she had said that some of her friends kent and gunilla had told her about him and that she thought he was wonderful and whats your name vitjord had asked maria monika had replied maria svenson well maria vitjord had said taking monikas arm and smiling would you like to have lunch with me monika had agreed she had gone to her room and changed in her jeans pocket she had put her wallet and her passport then she had joined vitjord outside the hotel as she sat in the back of the mercedes monika thought to herself what am i doing here in the back of a car with the man who tried to kill carlsson i must be mad the mercedes slowed down turned and then stopped outside tall wooden doors the doors were in a tall yellow wall and there was broken glass on top of the wall the mercedes drove in up to a large yellow house which was set in a beautiful garden there was a big swimming pool and a black gardener was watering the grass monika went into the house with vitjord they sat in a beautiful room which had lots of photographs on the walls vitjord offered monika a drink an orange juice please she replied nothing stronger vitjord asked and gave himself a large drink monika didnt know what would happen next she was afraid vitjord would ask her lots of questions she neednt have worried vitjord was happy to talk about himself he told monika how he hated black people he explained that he now lived in mozambique for part of the year he had his own army there one day he would return to south africa with his army and take over he told her that soon the whole world would know who he was soon he would be one of the most important men in the world monika listened and said nothing she was afraid vitjord was mad completely mad and he was buying a nuclear weapon her mother had been right she should have gone to university and not joined the army a telephone rang in another room excuse me vitjord said and got up help yourself to another drink he left the room monika got up but she didnt get herself a drink she walked around the room looking at the photographs they were all pictures of vitjord vitjord dressed as a soldier vitjord talking to a crowd vitjord with guns vitjord standing by what looked like dead bodies you like my pictures yes monika jumped vitjord was standing right behind her although he was a big man he moved very quietly monika nodded wheres that she asked pointing to the picture with the bodies namibia vitjord replied we killed lots of blacks there monika felt sick what was she doing here she thought again vitjord was still standing behind monika suddenly she felt his arms around her he held her strongly so she couldnt move just a moment monika said with a weak laugh wheres the toilet ive just got to go to the toilet vitjord laughed loudly and let her go its near the front door dont be long he said ill be waiting she walked quickly to the toilet and opened the door but she didnt go into the toilet she closed the toilet door loudly and walked out of the front door she suddenly felt the hot air on her face she looked around the garden and saw that the gardener was still watering the mercedes was there and the keys were inside monika jumped into the mercedes and started the engine there was a shout it was the gardener another shout the driver was running out of the house monika turned the car quickly on the wet grass she looked in the mirror and saw vitjord at the front door he had a gun there was a loud bang vitjord was shooting at her monika drove the mercedes straight at the wooden doors the engine screamed the doors broke and the mercedes drove through into the street vitjord ran out into the street behind the mercedes and shot several times he hit the car twice but didnt hurt monika she had escaped then she started thinking how was she going to get out of south africa she couldnt go back to the hotel luckily she had her passport with her and vitjord was looking for a blonde called maria svenson monika slowed down when she had driven a few kilometres away from vitjords house she didnt want to be stopped by the police she drove slowly and soon found what she was looking for a shopping centre she bought a red dress red shoes a large white hat and dark glasses she also bought a bottle of black hair color and went into the nearest toilet twenty minutes later she came out with black hair wearing the new clothes she then drove the mercedes to jan smuts airport it was two oclock as she walked into the building she was stopped by a white policeman monikas heart jumped yes she said any guns the policeman asked and searched her thank you have a nice day monika smiled to herself now all she had to do was buy a ticket she looked at the tv screen with flight information oh no the first flight to europe was not until eight in the evening she couldnt wait until then then monika saw a face she knew it was one of vitjords friends from the carlton he walked past her without stopping the disguise was working monika knew she couldnt stay at the airport all day where was the next flight going to she looked at the flight information maputo in mozambique great shed always wanted to go to mozambique the lam mozambican airways flight to maputo left half an hour later the flight to maputo was quite short monika thought about washing her hair in the toilet but there was no water she sat back in her seat and thought about vitjord and his plans she hoped that joseph had sent the cassette to blom when she got to maputo she would try and get another flight to stockholm as soon as possible i wonder what my parents would say if they could see me now she thought then she heard a voice that she knew it was one of vitjords friends from the carlton the one she had seen at the airport he was sitting right in front of her there was another man beside him i wonder where that swedish woman is the one who stole vitjords car the voice said she wasnt at the airport and she isnt on this plane ive looked and there arent any blonde women well the other man replied i wouldnt like to be her when vitjord catches her they both laughed chapter ten can i help you the lam turned and began to lose height as it got closer to maputo the capital of mozambique monika could see the silver indian ocean with a few small fishing boats and a large ship near the coast the land was flat and brown with a few small trees here and there the airport came closer and monika could see its name maputo in white stones on the grass the turned and came in to land she was on the wing of the plane again she thought living dangerously the plane landed and stopped outside a small green airport building the passengers got off the plane and walked to the building there was a sign saying passports vitjords friends from the carlton were right behind monika as she went into the airport building monika showed her passport to the mozambican passport officer excuse me he said what is your name monika lundgren monika replied with another smile but this isnt you the passport officer said he held the passport in his hand and showed monika the photograph in the passport then she felt someone pushing her from behind it was one of the men from the plane one of vitjords men he was looking at her photo in the passport im sorry this isnt your photo the mozambican passport officer said to monika please come this way monika followed the passport officer into a small office she was happy to be there anywhere rather than next to vitjords men monika sat and waited alone it was hot in the office and the window was open im sorry to keep you waiting a voice said the speaker was a short man with a smiling round face and a beard my names cabinda he said passport police i can explain monika said quickly my hair its not like the photograph i know i bought hair color in south africa i can wash it and show you cabinda looked carefully at monika and then at the photo no thats ok i can see that its you cabinda said theres one more thing you need a visa its ten dollars you can pay the passport officer welcome to mozambique monika paid for her visa and as she didnt have a suitcase walked straight out into the warm air there were a few people waiting outside the airport building but the bus to maputo had gone the air was warm and monika felt happy other people were walking into maputo and she decided to walk too as she was walking a van slowed and stopped beside her it was a big white van with black windows the van stopped in front of her two men got out they were vitjords men one of them opened the vans back doors get in the bearded man said and tried to take her arm monika pulled away from him some people stopped to look noone said anything then monika heard another engine and then a friendly voice can i help you the voice said monika turned around it was cabinda from the passport police he was getting out of an old yellow lorry which was full of people monika smiled yes please she replied can i help you cabinda asked the men the men stood for a minute and looked at him then they got back into the white van the bearded man looked out of the black window and spoke to monika well find you he said maputos a small town the white van drove off towards the city centre do you know those men cabinda asked no monika replied not really thank you very much for your help cabinda smiled its nothing he said but its quite a long way to the city centre where are you staying i dont know monika said well cabinda said in his friendly voice well find you somewhere but first we must get to the centre cabinda pointed to the lorry we call this a chapa he said come with us monika looked at the chapa it was old and there seemed to be at least fifty people standing in the back ok she replied thank you very much the chapa drove slowly into maputo there were more and more people walking along the road the air was hot and dry there were small houses made from wood beside the road children were playing outside them slowly the wooden houses became bigger and then became large buildings monika held on to cabindas arm as the chapa hit a hole in the road the chapa stopped from time to time and people got on and off whats that monika asked as they passed a very tall halffinished building cabinda smiled and then replied he had to shout because of the noise of the chapa its a present from the portuguese he said when the portuguese left my country in they took everything they could with them and they destroyed everything they couldnt take that building was going to be a hotel but as they left the portuguese filled the inside with concrete now its no use to anyone the chapa was soon near the centre of maputo lets get off here cabinda said and well find you somewhere to stay he helped monika down from the high lorry i need to find a hotel monika said and make a phone call and find the swedish embassy but im sure i can look after myself dont be silly cabinda replied you are a guest in our country i would invite you to stay in my apartment but its very small and i have a very large family he laughed the first hotels cabinda and monika tried were all full finally they found a room at the polana hotel a little way out of the centre of town thank you very much for all your help monika said i dont know what to say then say nothing cabinda replied tonight my wife and i will take you out to dinner at the feira popular there are a lot of good restaurants there be ready well come for you at eight oclock with a smile and a wave cabinda left the polana and monika was shown to her room it was a very pleasant hotel with a view of some yellow palm trees and the deep blue indian ocean monika wanted to call smi the hotel though wasnt safe she would have to find the swedish embassy the swedish embassy was close to the polana on avenida julius nyerere christer sandelin was the swedish consul he was tall and thin with a blonde beard he was a nice man and after making a few phone calls to check monikas identity he rang anders blom what are you doing in mozambique asked blom monika explained and then asked have you received a cassette from me i gave it to joseph this morning at the carlton no blom replied not yet joseph will send it with the plane tonight and i will get it tomorrow morning vitjord tried to kill carlsson once and is going to try again monika said i think he knows who i am he tried to kill me i want you back in stockholm as soon as possible blom replied and stay in the hotel dont go out i dont want vitjords men to catch you ok monika said i promise ill stay in the hotel and ill let you know when ive got a plane ticket they said goodbye monika thanked christer and left the embassy she walked slowly back to the hotel enjoying the soft early evening air when she got back she washed the black hair color out of her hair then she remembered that she was having dinner with cabinda and his wife chapter eleven now weve got you at ten past eight the telephone in monikas room rang were waiting for you at reception cabinda said monika opened her mouth to say that she was not going out then she changed her mind it was just like blom talking to her like a child and telling her to stay in the hotel im coming monika said cabinda and his wife amelia were waiting in reception hello cabinda said everything ok you look like your passport photo now they both smiled the feira popular cabinda explained is a fun fair with lots of good restaurants cabindas wife amelia spoke good english and monika soon felt comfortable with them at the fair they looked at several restaurants and then chose one that served seafood the restaurant wasnt full and they were able to talk easily people here usually eat quite late cabinda said its always full at midnight monika enjoyed being with cabinda and amelia they told her about life in mozambique its joys and problems monika felt very much at ease with them then cabinda asked and what do you do for a living are you here on holiday so far from sweden and without a suitcase cabinda had helped her and monika felt she should explain she didnt tell cabinda and amelia who she worked for but she did tell them about vitjord and the men at the airport cabinda listened carefully and nodded this man vitjord is wellknown here cabinda said when monika had finished mozambique is a very big country and vitjord lives in an empty area near south africa people say he has his own army there our country is at peace now but men like vitjord are still very dangerous here you must be careful while you are in maputo monika told amelia and cabinda that she had to return to stockholm at once oh dear amelia said mozambique is beautiful you must come again and stay longer there are direct flights from maputo to portugal and france cabinda said theres an air france flight on sunday to paris ill try and get a seat on that tomorrow monika said now let me pay for this lovely meal certainly not cabinda said with a wide smile while you are here you are our guest monika tried to make him change his mind but it was impossible cabinda got up and went to pay amelia left the table to go to the toilet monika sat on her own what kind friendly people she thought hello miss a voice said monika knew the voice she looked up vitjords friends were standing by her table we said wed find you the man with the beard said monika looked around she couldnt see cabinda or amelia behind the two men she could see their white van the bearded man took monikas arm come for a ride with us he said with a nasty smile and pulled monika up monika let the man pull her towards him when she was very close to him she stepped very hard on his right foot with the sharp heel of her left foot the man cried out in pain and let go of her monika turned and ran into the crowds at the fair it was hard to run fast as there were lots of people there now she looked back over her shoulder the bearded man and his friend were close behind her in front of her there was a queue of people waiting for something monika pushed her way to the front of the queue then she saw what they were waiting in line for it was the big wheel monika looked around she couldnt see cabinda or amelia behind the two men she could see their white van the bearded man took monikas arm come for a ride with us he said with a nasty smile and pulled monika up monika let the man pull her towards him when she was very close to him she stepped very hard on his right foot with the sharp heel of her left foot the man cried out in pain and let go of her monika turned and ran into the crowds at the fair it was hard to run fast as there were lots of people there now she looked back over her shoulder the bearded man and his friend were close behind her in front of her there was a queue of people waiting for something monika pushed her way to the front of the queue then she saw what they were waiting in line for it was the big wheel monika jumped onto one of the big wheels seats a man asked for her ticket my friends will pay monika replied pointing to the two men behind her the big wheel started and monika rose up in the air above the feira popular the wheel stopped monika looked down and saw the two men getting on to a seat behind her the wheel started again and monika went up even higher she could see the lights of maputo beneath her but now monika didnt have time to enjoy the view there was a loud bang and a singing noise as something hit the seat she was on monika looked back one of vitjords men had a gun he was shooting at her i cant stay here monika thought i must do something carefully she stood up on her seat and caught hold of one of the metal bars above it then she lifted herself up on to the next seat there was another shot the big wheel stopped and monika looked down a crowd of people were looking up at her monika could see cabindas worried face in the crowd the wheel started again vitjords men were now above monika monika stood up again and jumped to the next seat in front of her her hands moved and she almost fell there was a cry from the crowd now she was two seats away from the men and they couldnt see her the wheel continued to turn and monika was near the bottom as the ground came closer she got ready and then jumped she landed with a bump and fell to the ground the wheel continued to turn carrying the men up again are you all right monika cabinda asked monika looked up at him and smiled yes i think so she said look ive got an idea can you ask the man to stop the wheel and leave those two high up in the air cabinda laughed and went over to the man who was working the wheel monika got to her feet and waited cabinda came back with a big smile on his face thats ok he said hell keep them up there for ten minutes enough time for us to get away in a taxi the next morning cabinda helped monika get a ticket for the sunday flight she spent the rest of saturday sightseeing with cabinda and amelia in maputo at the airport on sunday monika thanked cabinda and amelia for everything they had done for her and promised to come back and visit them soon two hours later the air france took off monika closed her eyes and fell asleep she dreamed she was walking on the wing of the plane when she woke the plane was landing where am i she thought we cant be in paris already she saw a sign on an airport building jan smuts airport johannesburg oh no monika thought im back in south africa chapter twelve help im dying monika looked out of the window of the air france in surprise she had thought she was on a flight to paris not johannesburg then she heard the pilots voice were staying in johannesburg for fortyfive minutes to take on more passengers you may stay on the plane if you wish oh yes monika thought im staying on the plane i dont want to meet vitjord again the flight took off for paris on time and arrived early on monday morning monika then took an sas plane to stockholm and was in anders bloms office in the old town by lunchtime so thats what happened monika said as she finished telling blom about her adventures in south africa and mozambique well done blom said he had monikas cassette from the carlton in his hand ive listened to this with great interest what we must do now is clear first of all we must make sure that carlsson is safe we dont want another shooting secondly we must try and stop vitjord getting the nuclear bomb monika nodded when is carlssons meeting she asked its on friday evening at the strand hotel blom replied weve been busy while youve been away im sure that millham united the english football team are part of this plan they arrived in gothenburg on the ferry from england on sunday then they drove straight here to stockholm and took the evening ferry to st petersburg they are staying in russia for three days and playing a match in st petersburg then they are returning to stockholm by ferry playing a match here on friday and going down to gothenburg on friday evening monika thought for a minute how strange she said slowly why go by coach and ferry why dont millham united fly to russia exactly blom said with a smile we have to find out what is so special about their coach when they get back to stockholm on friday i want you to search their coach now weve got three days to plan the security for carlssons meeting at the strand monika spent the rest of the week working to make sure that noone would shoot carlsson everyone going into the strand hotel was going to be searched and all the rooms were being checked meanwhile millham united were in russia their ferry arrived in st petersburg at four oclock on monday the football team went to their hotel then the coach with only dixon and worthington the chairman and manager of the club and kent nystrom and gunilla lippich the two young swedes drove out of st petersburg on the road to moscow after about a hundred kilometres the coach turned off onto a side road the side road ran through a forest it was soon dark the coach stopped by a high wall where someone was waiting for it big doors in the wall opened and the coach drove through two men in hats and long coats got into the coach dixon gave them a very heavy sports bag the men opened the bag and then smiled there was something shiny and yellow in the bag the best south african gold dixon said with a laugh the men in long coats took the heavy bag and put it in a black car the others got off the coach then the men in long coats carried what looked like a very large heavy suitcase over to the coach from the car worthington opened a door in the side of the coach the huge suitcase was put in and the door was locked then the bus returned to st petersburg millham united played their match in st petersburg and then took the ferry back to stockholm as planned on thursday evening in stockholm the team again stayed at the strand monika and a group of twenty smi agents followed millham united everywhere in stockholm the smi searched the teams hotel bedrooms they listened to the teams phone calls they taperecorded the teams conversations nothing monika told blom we cant find anything theyre just a football team there is one strange thing though we cant search the coach there are always people with it dont give up said blom stay with them until they leave the city then join me at the strand carlssons meeting is at eight oclock tonight monika didnt give up she watched millham united play at the stadion the olympic stadium in stockholm millham united won the police locked up twelve millham fans then the team left the strand hotel to go to gothenburg in their coach nothing monika told blom they were in his office we found nothing but we couldnt get near the coach we will blom said ive got an idea but how monika asked they are on their way to gothenburg now and theyre leaving sweden in the morning ill tell you on the way to the meeting blom replied with a quick smile lets think about carlsson now it was six oclock when blom and monika got to the strand hotel they were searched as they entered the hotel by an smi man good blom said i told them to search everyone we cant take any chances the hotel was still partly full of tourists and businessmen but the hotels main restaurant was closed for the night for carlssons meeting the restaurant was in the middle of the hotel blom and monika went in and looked around the restaurant didnt have a ceiling above the restaurant there were rows of windows going up six floors to a glass roof a large tree grew in the middle of the restaurant in front of the tree there was a long table with a microphone weve checked all the rooms blom said and all the hotel guests and staff have been searched there are no weapons here carlsson is safe in room on the sixth floor a man was very busy he had checked into the hotel the day before security men had searched his bag and his guitar case but now he took a shiny electric guitar out of the case he started working to turn the guitar into a crossbow by half past seven he was ready his guitar had become a weapon able to kill a man at a hundred metres he took out a heavy metal bolt and put it into the crossbow then he looked at his watch and sat and waited the window of the mans room looked down at the restaurant people were arriving for carlssons meeting now and the restaurant was filling up there were more people than had been at the first meeting at the city hall the shooting of carlsson had increased international interest in his idea the man in room waited by the restaurant door monika and blom waited at exactly eight oclock a man in a dark suit came into the restaurant it was carlsson everyone stood up in room the man opened the window a little he picked up the crossbow and looked down at the people in the restaurant monika looked up at the windows above the restaurant something caught her eye it was a bright light she had seen a light like that before outside the city hall at the water festival the man in room stood at the window and held up the crossbow monika saw the light again then she saw the shiny guitar she turned to blom theres someone at that window im going up to see what it is monika said she ran up the stairs to the sixth floor there were lots of doors which room was it monika tried to remember where the room was she kicked open the door of room empty room empty in room the man was ready to shoot then there was a loud crash as monika kicked down the door the man turned and pointed the crossbow at her monika threw herself across the room at the man she crashed into his legs knocking the crossbow which fell to the floor the man tried to push monika away and hit her on the head with the side of his hand her hands let go of him for a moment and he threw her down to the floor monika hit the floor with a bang the man ran across the room to the door lying on the floor monika picked up the crossbow stop she shouted the man didnt stop monika shot him in the right leg with the crossbow and he fell to the floor by the door monika got up and ran over to the man he was lying face down monika turned him over with her foot to her great surprise she knew who the man was it was bruce the man she had met on the mariella the guitarist his face was full of pain im dying he cried help monika stopped for a moment this was the man who had shot carlsson but this was also the man whose music she liked the man she liked she felt sorry for him he was lying at her feet crying with blood on his leg he needed her help monika got down beside bruce he looked at her in surprise please help me he said youre not dying so stop crying monika said roughly who are you you know who i am bruce said and now i know who you are why did you shoot carlsson monika asked no reply monika got up and walked over to the crossbow she picked it up and put another bolt in it then she walked back and pointed the crossbow at bruces left leg answer my questions or ill shoot she said bruce looked at her then his face changed and became angry yes he said in a loud voice i shot carlsson at the city hall and tonight i was going to kill him but why monika asked for my father bruce replied my father wants carlsson dead and who is your father monika asked you dont know him bruce said hes a great man one day he will be the leader of my country his names vitjord monika looked at bruce in surprise hes your father is he vitjord she said yes bruce replied do you know him unfortunately i do monika said she looked up as two smi men ran into the room heres the man who shot carlsson she said hes hurt his leg take care of him she then threw the crossbow onto the bed and walked out of the room chapter thirteen what are you doing here monika walked slowly down the stairs to the restaurant her mind was full of thoughts why did she do this job she had just shot a man she liked a few days before she had danced with him not knowing that he had tried to kill carlsson but she was pleased she had saved carlsson blom was waiting for her outside she told him what had happened he listened and nodded youre the best agent we have he said monika smiled it was as if her parents were saying how good she was now blom went on do you remember what i told you on the way here yes monika replied with a smile im flying to gothenburg tomorrow im going on the ferry to england when the ship is at sea i am to search the coach exactly blom said because on a ferry noone is allowed to stay with the cars and coaches you will be able to search the coach with noone there theres just one thing monika said what if something goes wrong blom smiled yes ive thought of that twelve smi agents will also be on the ferry with you they are already in gothenburg lars nilsson is their leader you know him dont you monika nodded she and blom spent the rest of the evening at the strand carlssons meeting was a great success he got the one billion dollars he needed to destroy the nuclear weapons it was nearly midnight before blom and monika left the hotel ive just thought of something monika said its too late to get a plane to gothenburg tonight oh no it isnt blom replied youre going on a military plane and youll be the only passenger a car took monika to a military airport and she was flown to gothenburg after a few hours sleep she went to the skandiahamn where the blue and white ferries left for england lars nilsson was waiting for her he was tall with short grey hair from the top of the harbor building monika and lars watched cars drive on to the ferry the ship was called the princess of scandinavia and was long and thin when the cars were on the ferry the coaches were driven on there it is monika said theres the millham united coach she could see the driver and two other people on the coach thats strange she said to lars there are three people on the coach usually all the passengers walk on and only the driver stays with the coach monika and lars left the harbor building and went on to the ferry they met the other smi agents in a quiet room near the floor where the coaches were parked the room was full of tv screens right men lars said this is the plan monika is going to search the coach alone we will be able to see what is happening on these tv screens there are lots of cameras on the car and coach floor of the ferry when the ferry leaves the harbor the doors to the car and coach floor will be locked and noone will be allowed in except me monika said brightly it was good to work with other people and not always to be on her own any questions lars asked no ok its just a question of waiting now they watched the passengers leave their cars on the tv screens they saw the millham united coach driver check the coach carefully and lock it monika wondered what had happened to the other two people on the coach perhaps they had already got off half an hour later monika could hear the noise of the engines as the ship started the smi agents watched the tv screens there were still people getting bags from the cars monika waited two hours later monika was ready lars helped her open the locked door to the car and coach floor good luck he said monika walked quietly over to the millham united coach she had lots of keys with her and the first thing she did was to open the drivers door and get in it was empty she got out again and looked at the coach it was very high and on the side there were two big doors she opened the first door and stepped in suitcases the second door would not open at first then a key worked and the door opened monika looked into blackness there seemed to be nothing there she climbed in there was plenty of room for her to stand but she could see nothing she put her hands out in front of her then she touched something it was warm it was a person suddenly two hands held her throat she couldnt breathe her head was banged against the side of the coach again and again help she thought lars wont be able to see me on the tv screens she tried to hit the person holding her by chance she hit something on the wall and a light came on she could see who the person in the coach was it was vitjord he had been hiding inside the coach vitjord let go of monikas throat then he hit her across the face she fell to the floor of the coach vitjord kicked her hard now my little swedish friend vitjord said what are you doing here have you come to see my toy well have a look at it before i kill you vitjord pressed something and part of the floor opened monika could see a large green box like a suitcase there were russian letters on the box this is my little toy vitjord said and youre not going to take it away from me this bomb is going to make me leader of south africa monika looked at him there was nothing she could do lars couldnt see her on the tv screens now vitjord said taking out a knife im going to kill you stop a voice said monika recognised the voice it was chapman he had come to save her dont kill her chapman was standing behind vitjord dont kill her yet chapman said lets make her talk first monika understood now chapman wasnt going to save her he was working with vitjord he and vitjord were the people she had seen on the coach at gothenburg when it drove onto the ferry chapman was also the person who had told vitjord that monika was in johannesburg what are you doing here she asked chapman he looked down at her and then kicked her in the side of the

monika didnt say anything vitjord touched her face with his knife answer now vitjord said as his face came close to hers the police have got your son vitjord we know he tried to murder carlsson said monika for a second vitjord thought about this monika moved quickly bringing her knee up between vitjords legs he cried in pain and dropped the knife monika got to her feet and turned towards chapman he had a gun in his hand monika moved sideways towards the knife she picked it up quickly and threw it at chapman it hit him in the shoulder and he fell backwards out of the coach monika jumped after him but chapman was waiting he hit her across the face with the gun and monika fell to the floor chapman raised the gun there was a mad look in his eyes kill her kill her shouted vitjord from the
