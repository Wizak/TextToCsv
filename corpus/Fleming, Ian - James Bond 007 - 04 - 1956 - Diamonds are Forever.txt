diamonds are forever ian fleming contents to jfcb and elc and to the memory of wwjr at saratoga and printed in england by hazell watson and viney ltd aylesbury bucks the pipeline opens with its two fighting claws held forward like a wrestlers arms the big pandinus scorpion emerged with a dry rustle from the fingersized hole under the rock there was a small patch of hard flat earth outside the hole and the scorpion stood in the centre of this on the tips of its four pairs of legs its nerves and muscles braced for a quick retreat and its senses questing for the minute vibrations which would decide its next move the moonlight glittering down through the great thorn bush threw sapphire highlights off the hard black polish of the sixinch body and glinted palely on the moist white sting which protruded from the last segment of the tail now curved over parallel with the scorpions flat back slowly the sting slid home into its sheath and the nerves in the poison sac at its base relaxed the scorpion had decided greed had won over fear twelve inches away at the bottom of a sharp slope of sand the small beetle was concerned only with trudging on towards better pastures than he had found under the thorn bush and the swift rush of the scorpion down the slope gave him no time to open his wings the beetles legs waved in protest as the sharp claw snapped round his body and then the sting lanced into him from over the scorpions head and immediately he was dead after it had killed the beetle the scorpion stood motionless for nearly five minutes during this time it identified the nature of its prey and again tested the ground and the air for hostile vibrations reassured its fighting claw withdrew from the halfsevered beetle and its two small feeding pincers reached out and into the beetles flesh then for an hour and with extreme fastidiousness the scorpion ate its victim the great thorn bush under which the scorpion killed the beetle was quite a landmark in the wide expanse of rolling veld some forty miles south of kissidougou in the southwestern corner of french guinea on all horizons there were hills and jungle but here over twenty square miles there was flat rocky ground which was almost desert and amongst the tropical scrub only this one thorn bush perhaps because there was water deep beneath its roots had grown to the height of a house and could be picked out from many miles away the bush grew more or less at the junction of three african states it was in french guinea but only about ten miles north of the northernmost tip of liberia and five miles east of the frontier of sierra leone across this frontier are the great diamond mines around sefadu these are the property of sierra international which is part of the powerful mining empire of afric international which in turn is a rich capital asset of the british commonwealth an hour earlier in its hole among the roots of the great thorn bush the scorpion had been alerted by two sets of vibrations first there had been the tiny scraping of the beetles movements and these belonged to the vibrations which the scorpion immediately recognized and diagnosed then there had been a series of incomprehensible thuds round the bush followed by a final heavy quake which had caved in part of the scorpions hole these were followed by a soft rhythmic trembling of the ground which was so regular that it soon became a background vibration of no urgency after a pause the tiny scraping of the beetle had continued and it was greed for the beetle that after a day of sheltering from its deadliest enemy the sun finally got the upper hand against the scorpions memory of the other noises and impelled it out of its lair into the filtering moonlight and now as it slowly sucked the morsels of beetleflesh off its feeding pincers the signal for the scorpions own death sounded from far away on the eastern horizon audible to a human but made up of vibrations which were far outside the range of the scorpions sensory system and a few feet away a heavy blunt hand with bitten finger nails softly raised a jagged piece of rock there was no noise but the scorpion felt a tiny movement in the air above it at once its fighting claws were up and groping and its sting was erect in the rigid tail its nearsighted eyes staring up for a sight of the enemy the heavy stone came down black bastard the man watched as the broken insect whipped in its death agony the man yawned he got to his knees in the sandy depression against the trunk of the bush where he had been sitting for nearly two hours and his arms bent protectingly over his head scrambled out into the open the noise of the engine which the man had been waiting for and which had signed the scorpions death warrant was louder as the man stood and stared up the path of the moon he could just see a clumsy black shape coming fast towards him out of the east and for a moment the moonlight glinted on whirling rotor blades the man rubbed his hands down the sides of his dirty khaki shorts and moved quickly round the bush to where the rear wheel of a battered motorcycle protruded from its hiding place below the pillion on either side there were leather toolboxes from one of these he extracted a small heavy package which he stowed inside his open shirt against the skin from the other he took four cheap electric torches and went off with them to where fifty yards from the big thorn bush there was a clear patch of flat ground about the size of a tennis court at three corners of the landing ground he screwed the butt end of a torch into the ground and switched it on then the last torch alight in his hand he took up his position at the fourth corner and waited the helicopter was moving slowly towards him not more than a hundred feet from the ground the big rotor blades idling it looked like a huge badlyconstructed insect to the man on the ground it seemed as usual to be making too much noise the helicopter paused pitching slightly directly over his jiead an arm came out of the cockpit and a torch flashed at him it flashed dotdash the morse for a the man on the ground flashed back a b and a c he stuck the fourth torch into the ground and moved away shielding his eyes against the coming whirl of dust above him the pitch of the rotor blades flattened imperceptibly and the helicopter settled smoothly into the space between the four torches the clatter of the engine stopped with a final cough the tail rotor spun briefly in neutral and the main rotor blades completed a few awkward revolutions and then drooped to a halt in the echoing silence a cricket started to zing in the thorn bush and somewhere near at hand there was the anxious chirrup of a nightbird after a pause to let the dust settle the pilot banged open the door of the cockpit pushed out a small aluminium ladder and climbed stiffly to the ground he waited beside his machine while the other man walked round the four corners of the landing ground picking up and dowsing the torches the pilot was half an hour late at the rendezvous and he was bored at the prospect of listening to the other mans inevitable complaint he despised all afrikaners this one in particular to a reichsdeutscher and to a luftwaffe pilot who had fought under galland in defence of the reich they were a bastard race sly stupid and illbred of course this brute had a tricky job but it was nothing to navigating a helicopter five hundred miles over the jungle in the middle of the night and then taking it back again as the other man came up the pilot half raised his hand in greeting everything all right i hope so but youre late again i shall only just make it through the frontier by first light magneto trouble we all have our worries thank god there are only thirteen full moons a year well if youve got the stuff lets have it and well tank her up and ill be off without speaking the man from the diamond mines reached into his shirt and handed over the neat heavy packet the pilot took it it was damp with the sweat from the smugglers ribs the pilot dropped it into a side pocket of his trim bush shirt he put his hand behind him and wiped his fingers on the seat of his shorts good he said he turned towards his machine just a moment said the diamond smuggler there was a sullen note in his voice the pilot turned back and faced him he thought its the voice of a servant who has screwed himself up to complain about his food ja what is it things are getting too hot at the mines i dont like it at all theres been a big intelligence man down from london youve read about him this man sillitoe they say hes been hired by the diamond corporation thereve been a lot of new regulations and all punishments have been doubled its frightened out some of my smaller men i had to be ruthless and well one of them somehow fell into the crusher that tightened things up a bit but ive had to pay more an extra ten per cent and theyre still not satisfied one of these days those security people are going to get one of my middlemen and you know these black swine they cant stand a real beating he looked swiftly into the pilots eyes and then away again for the matter of that i doubt if anyone could stand the sjambok not even me so said the pilot he paused do you want me to pass this threat back to abc im not threatening anyone said the other man hastily i just want them to know that its getting tough they must know it themselves they must know about this man sillitoe and look what the chairman said in our annual report he said that our mines were losing more than two million pounds a year through smuggling and ide and that it was up to the government to stop it and what does that mean it means stop me and me said the pilot mildly so what do you want more money yes said the other man stubbornly i want a bigger cut twenty per cent more or ill have to quit he tried to read some sympathy in the pilots face all right said the pilot indifferently ill pass the message on to dakar and if theyre interested i expect theyll send it on to london but its nothing to do with me and if i were you the pilot unbent for the first time i wouldnt put too much pressure on these people they can be much tougher than this sillitoe or the company or any government ive ever heard of on just this end of the pipeline three men have died in the last twelve months one for being yellow two for stealing from the packet and you know it that was a nasty accident your predecessor had wasnt it funny place to keep gelignite under his bed unlike him he was always so careful about everything for a moment they stood and looked at each other in the moonlight the diamond smuggler shrugged his shoulders all right he said just tell them im hard up and need more money to pass down the line theyll understand that and if theyve got any sense theyll add another ten per cent on for me if not he left the sentence unfinished and moved towards the helicopter come on ill give you a hand with the gas ten minutes later the pilot climbed up into the cockpit and pulled the ladder in after him before he shut the door he raised a hand so long he said see you in a month the man on the ground suddenly felt lonely totsiens he said with a wave of the hand that was almost the wave of a lover alles van die beste he stood back and held a hand up to his eyes against the dust the pilot settled into his seat and fastened the seatbelt feeling for the rudder pedals with his feet he made sure that the wheel brakes were on pushed the pitch control lever right down turned on the fuel and pressed the starter satisfied with the beat of the engine he released the rotor brake and softly twisted the throttle on the pitch control outside the cabin windows the long rotor blades slowly swung by and the pilot glanced astern at the whirring tail rotor he settled himself back and watched the rotor speed indicator creep up to revolutions a minute when the needle was just over the he released the wheel brakes and pulled up slowly and firmly on the pitch lever above him the blades of the rotor tilted and bit deeper into the air more throttle and the machine slowly rose clattering towards the sky until at about feet the pilot simultaneously gave it left rudder and pushed forward the joystick between his knees the helicopter swung towards the east and gathering height and speed roared away back up the path of the moon the man on the ground watched it go and with it the ј worth of diamonds his men had filched from the diggings during the past month and had casually held out on their pink tongues as he stood beside the dentists chair and brusquely inquired where it hurt still talking about their teeth he would pick the stones out of their mouths and hold them up to the dentists spotlight and then softly he would say and they always nodded and took the notes and hid them in their clothes and went out of the surgery with a couple of aspirins in a twist of paper as an alibi they had to accept his price there was no hope of a native getting diamonds out when the miners did get out perhaps once a year to visit their tribe or to bury a relative there was a whole routine of xrays and castor oil to be gone through and a grim future if they were caught it was so easy to go to the dental surgery and pick the day when him was on duty and papermoney didnt show up on xrays the man wheeled his motorcycle over the rough ground on to the narrow trail and started off towards the frontier hills of sierra leone they were more distinct now he would only just have time to get to susies hut before dawn he grimaced at the thought of having to make love to her at the end of an exhausting night but it would have to be done money was not enough to pay for the alibi she gave him it was his white body she wanted and then another ten miles to the club for breakfast and the coarse jokes of his friends do a nice bit of inlay doc i hear she has the best set of frontals in the province say doc what is it the full moon does to you but each ј worth meant ј for him in a london safe deposit nice crisp fivers it was worth it by god it was but not for much longer no sir at јoooo he would definitely quit and then his mind full of lush dreams the man on the motorcycle bumped his way as fast as he could across the plainaway from the great thorn bush where the pipeline for the richest smuggling operation in the world started its devious route to where it would finally gush out on to soft bosoms five thousand miles away gem quality dont push it in screw it in said m impatiently james bond making a mental note to pass ms dictum on to the chief of staff again picked up the jewellers glass from the desk where it had fallen and this time managed to fix it securely into the socket of his right eye although it was late july and the room was bright with sunshine m had switched on his desk light and tilted it so that it shone straight at bond bond picked the brilliantcut stone up and held it to the light as he turned it between his fingers all the colours of the rainbow flashed back at him from its mesh of facets until his eye was tired with the dazzle he took out the jewellers glass and tried to think of something appropriate to say m looked at him quizzically fine stone wonderful said bond it must be worth a lot of money a few pounds for the cutting said m dryly its a bit of quartz now then lets try again he consulted a list on the desk in front of him and selected a fold of tissue paper verified the number written on it unfolded it and pushed it across to bond bond put the piece of quartz back into its own wrapping and picked up the second sample its easy for you sir he smiled at m youve got the crib he screwed the glass back into his eye and held the stone if it was a stone up to the light this time he thought there could be no doubt about it this stone also had the thirtytwo facets above and the twentyfour below of the brilliantcut and it was also about twenty carats but what he now held had a heart of bluewhite flame and the infinite colours reflected and refracted from its depths lanced into his eye like needles with his left hand he picked up the quartz dummy and held it beside the diamond in front of his glass it was a lifeless chunk of matter almost opaque beside the dazzling translucence of the diamond and the rainbow colours he had seen a few minutes before were now coarse and muddy bond put down the piece of quartz and gazed again into the heart of the diamond now he could understand the passion that diamonds had inspired through the centuries the almost sexual love they aroused among those who handled them and cut them and traded in them it was domination by a beauty so pure that it held a kind of truth a divine authority before which all other material things turned like the bit of quartz to clay in these few minutes bond understood the myth of diamonds and he knew that he would never forget what he had suddenly seen inside the heart of this stone he put the diamond down on its slip of paper and dropped the jewellers glass into the palm of his hand he looked across into ms watchful eyes yes he said i see m sat back in his chair thats what jacoby meant when i had lunch with him the other day at the diamond corporation he said he said that if i was going to get involved in the diamond business i ought to try and understand what was really at the bottom of it all not just the millions of money involved or the value of diamonds as a hedge against inflation or the sentimental fashions in diamonds for engagement rings and so forth he said one must understand the passion for diamonds so he just showed me what im showing you and m smiled thinly at bond if it will give you any satisfaction i was just as taken in by that bit of quartz as you were bond sat still and said nothing and now lets run through the rest said m he gestured towards the pile of paper packets in front of him i said id like to borrow some samples they didnt seem to mind sent this lot round to my house this morning m consulted his list opened a packet and pushed it across to bond what you were looking at just now was the besta fine bluewhite he gestured towards the big diamond in front of bond now this is a top crystal ten carats baguettecut very fine stone but worth about half a bluewhite youll see theres the faintest trace of yellow in it the cape im going to show you next has a slight brownish tinge according to jacoby but im damned if i can see it i doubt if anyone can except the experts bond obediently picked up the top crystal and for the next quarter of an hour m led him through the whole range of diamonds down to a wonderful series of coloured stones ruby red blue pink yellow green and violet finally m pushed over a packet of smaller stones all flawed or marked or of poor colour industrial diamonds not what they call gem quality used in machine tools and so forth but dont despise them america bought ј worth of them last year and thats only one of the markets bronsteen told me it was stones like these that were used for cutting the st gothard tunnel at the other end of the scale dentists use them for drilling your teeth theyre the hardest substance in the world last forever m pulled out his pipe and started to fill it and now you know as much about diamonds as i do bond sat back in his chair and gazed vaguely at the bits of tissue paper and glittering stones that lay scattered across the red leather surface of ms desk he wondered what it was all about there was the rasp of a match against a box and bond watched m tamp the burning tobacco down in the bowl of his pipe and then put the matchbox back in his pocket and tilt his chair in ms favourite attitude for reflection bond glanced down at his watch it was bond thought with pleasure of the intray piled with top secret dockets he had gladly abandoned when the red telephone had summoned him an hour before he felt fairly confident that now he wouldnt have to deal with them i guess its a job the chief of staff had said in answer to bonds inquiry the chief says he wont take any more calls before lunch and hes made an appointment for you at the yard for two oclock step on it and bond had reached for his coat and had gone into the outer office where he was pleased to see his secretary registering in another bulky file with a most immediate tab m said bond as she looked up and bill says it looks like a job so dont think youre going to have the pleasure of shovelling that lot into my intray you can post it off to the daily express for all i care he grinned at her isnt that chap sefton delmer a boy friend of yours lil just the stuff for him i expect she looked at him appraisingly your ties crooked she said coldly and anyway i hardly know him she bent over her registry and bond went out and along the corridor and thought how lucky he was to have a beautiful secretary there was a creak from ms chair and bond looked across the table at the man who held a great deal of his affection and all his loyalty and obedience the grey eyes looked back at him thoughtfully m took the pipe out of his mouth how long have you been back from that holiday in france two weeks sir have a good time not bad sir got a bit bored towards the end m made no comment ive been looking at your record sheet smallarms marks seem to be keeping well up in the top bracket unarmed combats satisfactory and your last medical shows youre in pretty good shape m paused the point is he went on unemotionally ive got rather a tough assignment for you wanted to make sure youd be able to take care of yourself of course sir bond was slightly nettled dont make any mistake about this job said m sharply when i say it may be tough im not being melodramatic there are plenty of tricky people you havent met yet and there may be some of them mixed up in this business and some of the most efficient so dont be tetchy when i think twice before getting you involved in it sorry sir all right then m put his pipe down and leant forward with his arms crossed on the desk ill tell you the story and then you can decide whether you want to take it on a week ago said m one of the highups in the treasury came to see me brought with him the permanent secretary to the board of trade it had to do with diamonds seems that most of what they call gem diamonds in the world are mined on british territory and that ninety per cent of all diamond sales are carried out in london by the diamond corporation m shrugged his shoulders dont ask me why the british got hold of the business at the beginning of the century and weve managed to hang on to it now its a huge trade fifty million pounds a year the biggest dollarearner weve got so when something goes wrong with it the government gets worried and thats whats happened m looked mildly across at bond at least two million pounds worth of diamonds are being smuggled out of africa every year thats a lot of money said bond where are they going to they say america said m and i agree with them its by far the biggest diamond market and those gangs of theirs are the only people who could run an operation on this scale why dont the mining companies stop it theyve done everything they can said m you probably saw in the papers that de beers took on our friend sillitoe when he left mi and hes out there now working in with the south african security people i gather hes put in a pretty drastic report and come up with plenty of bright ideas for tightening things up but the treasury and the board of trade arent very impressed they think the things too big to be handled by a lot of separate mining companies however efficient they are and theyve got one very good reason for wanting to take official action on their own whats that sir theres a big packet of smuggled stones in london at this very moment said m and his eyes glittered across the desk at bond waiting to go to america and the special branch know who the carrier is to be and they know whos to go out with him to keep an eye on him as soon as ronnie vallance came across the storyit was leaked to one of his narks in soho to one of his ghost squad as he chooses to call ithe went straight off to the treasury the treasury talked to the board of trade and then both their ministers formed up to the pm and the pm gave them authority to use the service why not let the special branch of mi handle it sir asked bond reflecting that m seemed to be going through a bad phase of mixing in other peoples business of course they could arrest the carriers as soon as they took delivery and tried to get out of the country said m impatiently but that wont stop the traffic these people arent the sort thai talk anyway the carriers are only small fry they probably just get the stuff from a man in a park and hand it over to another man in a park when they get to the other side the only way to get to the bottom of the business is to follow the pipeline to america and see where it goes to there and the fbi wont be much help to us im afraid its a very small part of their battle with the bigtime gangs and its not doing any harm to the united states rather the reverse if anything its only england thats the loser and america is outside the jurisdiction of the police and mi only the service can handle the job yes i see that said bond but have we got anything else to go on ever heard of the house of diamonds yes of course sir said bond the big american jewellers on west th street in new york and the rue de rivoli in paris i gather they rank almost as high as cartier and van cleef and boucheron nowadays theyve come up very quickly since the war yes said m those are the people theyve got a small place in london too hatton garden used to be very big buyers at the monthly showings of the diamond corporation but for the last three years theyve bought less and less although as you say they seem to be selling more and more jewellery every year must be getting their diamonds from somewhere it was the treasury who brought their name up at our meeting the other day but i cant find out anything against them theyve got one of their biggest men in charge over here seems odd as they do so little business man called rufus b saye nothing much known about him lunches every day at the american club in piccadilly plays golf at sunningdale doesnt drink or smoke lives at the savoy model citizen m shrugged his shoulders but the diamond business is a nice wellregulated sort of family affair and theres an impression that the house of diamonds has an awkward look about it nothing more than that bond decided it was time to put the sixtyfour thousand dollar question and where do i come in sir he asked looking across the desk into ms eyes youve got an appointment with vallance at the yard inm looked at his watchjust over an hour hes going to start you off theyre going to pull in this carrier tonight and put you into the pipeline instead of him bonds fingers curled softly round the arms of his chair and then and then said m matteroffactly youre going to smuggle those diamonds into america at least thats the idea what do you think of it hot ice james bond shut the door of ms office behind him he smiled into the warm brown eyes of miss moneypenny and walked across her office into the chief of staffs room the chief of staff a lean relaxed man of about bonds age put down his pen and sat back in his chair he watched as bond automatically reached for the flat gunmetal cigarette case in his hip pocket and walked over to the open window and looked down on to regents park there was a thoughtful deliberation in bonds movements that answered the chief of staffs question so youve bought it bond turned round yes he said he lit a cigarette through the smoke his eyes looked very directly at the chief of staff but just tell me this bill whys the old man got cold feet about this job hes even looked up the results of my last medical whats he so worried about its not as if this was iron curtain business americas a civilized country more or less whats eating him it was the chief of staffs duty to know most of what went on in ms mind his own cigarette had gone out and he lit it and threw the spent match over his left shoulder he looked round to see whether it had fallen in the wastepaper basket it had he smiled up at bond constant practice he said then there arent many things that worry m james and you know that as well as anybody in the service smersh of course the german cypherbreakers the chinese opium ringor at any rate the power they have all over the world the authority of the mafia and and hes got a damned healthy respect for them the american gangs the big ones thats all those are the only people that get him worried and this diamond business looks as if its pretty certain to bring you up against the gangs theyre the last people he expected us to get mixed up with hes got quite enough on his plate without them thats all thats whats giving him cold feet about this job theres nothing so extraordinary about american gangsters protested bond theyre not americans mostly a lot of italian bums with monogrammed shirts who spend the day eating spaghetti and meatballs and squirting scent over themselves thats what you think said the chief of staff but the point is that those are only the ones you see there are better ones behind them and still better ones behind those look at narcotics ten million addicts where do they get the stuff from look at gamblinglegitimate gambling two hundred and fifty million dollars a year is the take at las vegas then there are the undercover games at miami and chicago and so on all owned by the gangs and their friends a few years ago buggsy siegel got the back of his head blown off because he wanted too much of the take from the las vegas operation and he was tough enough these are big operations do you realize gamblings the biggest single industry in america bigger than steel bigger than motor cars and they take damned good care to keep it running smoothly get hold of a copy of the kefauver report if you dont believe me and now these diamonds six million dollars a year is good money and you can bet your life itll be well protected the chief of staff paused he looked impatiently up at the tall figure in the dark blue singlebreasted suit and into the obstinate eyes in the lean brown face perhaps you havent read the fbi report on american crime for this year interesting just thirtyfour murders every day nearly americans criminally killed in the last twenty years bond looked incredulous its a fact damn you get hold of these reports and see for yourself and thats why m wanted to make sure you were fit before he put you into the pipeline youre going to take those gangs on and youll be by yourself satisfied bonds face relaxed come on bill he said if thats all there is to it ill buy you lunch its my turn and i feel like celebrating no more paperwork this summer ill take you to scotts and well have some of their dressed crab and a pint of black velvet youve taken a load off my mind i thought there might be some ghastly snag about this job all right blast you the chief of staff put aside the misgivings which he fully shared with his chief and followed bond out of the office and slammed the door with unnecessary force behind him later punctually at two oclock bond was shaking hands with the dapper leveleyed man in the oldfashioned office which hears more secrets than any other room in scotland yard bond had made friends with assistant commissioner vallance over the moonraker affair and there was no need to waste time on preliminaries vallance pushed a couple of cid identification photographs across the desk they showed a darkhaired rather goodlooking young man with a cleancut swashbuckling face in which the eyes smiled innocently thats the chap said vallance near enough like you to pass with someone whos only got his description peter franks nicelooking fellow good family public school and all that then he went wrong and stayed wrong country house burglaries are his line may have been on the duke of windsor job at sunningdale a few years ago weve pulled him in once or twice but we could never get anything to stick now hes slipped up they often do when they get into a racket they know nothing about ive got two or three undercover girls in soho and hes keen on one of them funnily enough shes rather keen on him thinks she can make him go straight and all that sort of stuff but shes got her job to do and when he told her about this job just casually as if it was the hell of a lark she passed the word back here bond nodded specialist crooks never take other peoples lines seriously i bet he wouldnt have talked to her about one of his country house jobs not on your life agreed vallance or wed have had him inside years ago anyway it seems he was contacted by a friend of a friend and agreed to do a smuggling job to america for payable on delivery my girl asked him if it was drugs and he laughed and said nobetter still hot ice had he got the diamonds no his next job was to contact his guard tomorrow evening at the trafalgar palace five oclock in her room a girl called case she would tell him what to do and go over with him vallance got up and paced to and fro in front of the framed forgeries of five pound notes that lined the wall opposite the windows these smugglers generally go in pairs when big stuff is being moved the carrier is never quite trusted and the men at the other end like to have a witness in case anything goes wrong at the customs then the big men dont get caught napping if the carrier talks big stuff being moved carriers customs guards bond killed his cigarette in the ashtray on vallances desk how often in his early days in his own service had he been part of this same routinethrough strasbourg into germany through niegoreloye into russia over the simplon across the pyrenees the tension the dry mouth the nails ground into the palms of the hands and now having graduated away from all that here he was going through with it again yes i see said bond dodging his memories but whats the general picture got any ideas what sort of an operation was franks going to fit in to well the diamonds certainly come from africa vallances eyes were opaque probably not the union mines more likely the big leak out of sierra leone our friend sillitoes been looking for then the stones may get out through liberia or more likely french guinea then perhaps into france and since this packets turned up in london presumably londons part of the pipeline too vallance stopped his pacing and faced bond and now we know that this packet is on its way to america and what happens to it there is anybodys guess the operators wouldnt try and save money on the cuttingthats where half the price of a diamond goesso it looks as if the stones get funnelled into some legitimate diamond business and then get cut and marketed like any other stones vallance paused you wont mind if i give you a bit of advice dont be ridiculous well said vallance in all these jobs the payoff to subordinates is generally the weakest link how was this to be paid to peter franks who by and if he did the job successfully would he be taken on again if i was in your shoes id watch these points concentrate on getting through the cutout who does the paying off and try to get on farther up the pipeline towards the big men if they like the look of you it shouldnt be difficult good carriers arent easy to come by and even the top men are going to be interested in the new recruit yes said bond thoughtfully that makes sense the main trouble will be to get past the first contact in america lets hope the whole job doesnt blow up in my face in the customs shed at idlewild i shall look pretty silly if the inspectoscope picks me up but i expect this case woman will have some bright ideas about actually carrying the stuff and now whats the first step how are you going to substitute me for peter franks vallance started pacing to and fro again i think that ought to be all right he said were going to take in franks this evening and hold him for conspiring to evade the customs he smiled briefly itll break up a beautiful friendship with my girl im afraid but thats got to be faced and then the idea is for you to make the rendezvous with miss case does she know anything about franks just his description and his name said vallance at least thats what we guess i doubt if she even knows the man who contacted him cutouts all along the line everybody does one job in a watertight compartment then if theres a hole in the sock it doesnt run know anything about the woman passport details american citizen born san francisco blonde blue eyes height ft in profession single woman been over here a dozen times in the last three years may have been more often under a different name always stays at the trafalgar palace the hotel detective says she doesnt seem to go out much few visitors never stays more than two weeks never gives any trouble thats all dont forget that when you meet her youll have to have a good story yourself why youre doing the job and so on ill see to that anything else we can help over bond reflected the rest seemed to be up to him once he had got into the pipe it would just be a question of improvising then he remembered the jewellery firm what about this house of diamonds lead the treasury dreamed up seems a long shot any views quite honestly i hadnt bothered with them there was apology in vallances voice i checked on this man saye but again its a blank except for his passport details american diamond merchant and so on he goes to paris a lot been going once a month for the last three years as a matter of fact probably got a girl there tell you what why not go along and have a look at the place and at him you never can tell how would i set about that asked bond dubiously vallance didnt answer instead he pressed a switch on the big intercom on his desk yes sir said a metallic voice send up dankwaerts at the double please sergeant and lobiniere and then get me the house of diamonds on the telephone gem merchants in hatton garden ask for mr saye vallance went and looked out of the window at the river he took a cigarette lighter out of his waistcoat pocket and flicked at it absentmindedly there was a knock on the door and vallances staff secretary put his head in sergeant dankwaerts sir send him in said vallance hold lobiniere until i ring the secretary held open the door and a nondescript man in plainclothes came in his hair was thinning he wore spectacles and his complexion was pale his expression was kindly and studious he might have been any senior clerk in any business afternoon sergeant said vallance this is commander bond of the ministry of defence the sergeant smiled politely i want you to take commander bond to the house of diamonds in hatton garden he will be sergeant fames of your staff you think the diamonds from that ascot job are on their way out to the argentine through america you will say so to mr saye the top man there you will wonder if it is possible that mr saye has heard any talk from the other side his new york office may have heard something you know all very nice and polite but just look him in the eye put as much pressure on as you can without giving any grounds for complaint then apologize and leave and forget all about it all right any questions no sir said sergeant dankwaerts stolidly vallance spoke into the intercom and a moment later there appeared a sallow rather ingratiating man wearing extremely smart plainclothes and carrying a small attache case he stood waiting just inside the door good afternoon sergeant come and have a look at this friend of mine the sergeant came and stood close up to bond and politely turned him towards the light two very keen dark eyes examined his face minutely for a full minute then the man stepped away cant guarantee the scar for more than six hours sir he said not in this heat but the rests all right who is he to be sir hes to be sergeant james a member of sergeant dank waerts staff vallance looked at his watch only for three hours all right certainly sir shall i go ahead at vallances nod the policeman led bond to a chair by the window put his small attache case on the floor beside the chair and knelt down on one knee and opened it then for ten minutes his light fingers busied themselves over bonds face and hair bond resigned himself and listened to vallance talking to the house of diamonds not until in that case would you please tell mr saye that two of my men will be calling on him at sharp yes im afraid it is rather important only a formality of course routine inquiry i dont expect it will take up more than ten minutes of mr sayes time thank you so much yes assistant commissioner vallance thats right scotland yard yes thank you goodbye vallance put back the receiver and turned towards bond secretary says saye wont be back until i suggest you get there at never does any harm to have a look round first always useful to get your man a bit off balance hows it going sergeant lobiniere held up a pocket mirror in front of bond a touch of white at the temples the scar gone a hint of studiousness at the corners of the eyes and mouth the faintest shadows under the cheekbones nothing you could put your finger on but it all added up to someone who certainly wasnt james bond what goes on around here in the patrol car sergeant dankwaerts was occupied with his thoughts and they drove in silence along the strand and up chancery lane and into holborn at gamages they turned left into hatton garden and the car drew up near the neat white portals of the london diamond club bond followed his companion across the pavement to a smart door in he centre of which was a well polished brass plate on which was engraved the house of diamonds and underneath rufus b saye vicepresident for europe sergeant dankwaerts rang the bell and a smart jewish girl opened the door and led them across a thickly carpeted entrance hall into a panelled waitingroom i am expecting mr saye any minute now she said indifferently and went out and closed the door the waitingroom was luxurious and thanks to an unseasonable logfire in the adam fireplace tropically hot in the centre of the closefitted dark red carpet there was a circular sheraton rosewood table and six matching armchairs that bond guessed were worth at least a thousand pounds on the table were the latest magazines and several copies of the kimberley diamond news dankwaertss eyes lit up when he saw these and he sat down and started to turn over the pages of the june issue on each of the four walls was a large flower painting in a golden frame something almost three dimensional about these paintings caught bonds attention and he walked over to examine one of them it was not a painting but a stylized arrangement of freshly cut flowers set behind glass in niches lined with coppercoloured velvet the others were the same and the four waterford vases in which the flowers stood were a perfect set the room was very quiet except for the hypnotic tick of a large sunburst wallclock and the soft murmur of voices from behind a door opposite the entrance there was a click and the door opened a few inches and a voice with a thick foreign intonation expostulated volubly bud mister grunspan why being so hard vee must all make a lifting yes i am telling you this vonderful stone gost me ten tousant pounts ten tousant you tont pelieff me bud i svear it on my vort of honour there was a negative pause and the voice made its final bid bedder still i bet you fife pounts there was the sound of laughter willy youre a real card said an american voice but its no dice be glad to help you but that stone isnt worth more than nine thousand and ill give you a hundred on top of that for yourself now you go along and think about it you wont get a better offer in the street the door opened and a stage american business man with pincenez and a tightly buttoned mouth ushered out a small harassedlooking jew with a large red rose in his buttonhole they looked startled at finding the waitingroom occupied and with a muttered pardon me to no one in particular the american almost ran his companion across the room and out into the hall the door closed behind them dankwaerts looked up at bond and winked thats the whole of the diamond business in a nutshell he said that was willy behrens one of the bestknown freelance brokers in the street i suppose the other man was sayes buyer he turned again to his paper and bond resisting the impulse to light a cigarette went back to his examination of the flower pictures suddenly the rich carpeted ticking silence of the room struck like a cuckoo clock simultaneously a log fell in the grate the sunburst clock on the wall chimed the half hour the door was thrust open and a big dark man took two quick steps in the room and stood looking sharply from one to the other my name is saye he said harshly what goes on around here what do you want the door was open behind him sergeant dankwaerts rose to his feet and walked politely but firmly round the man and closed it then he returned to the middle of the room i am sergeant dankwaerts of the special branch of scotland yard he said in a quiet peaceful voice and this he made a gesture towards bond is sergeant james i am making a routine inquiry about some stolen diamonds it occurred to the assistant commissioner the voice was of velvet that you might be able to help us yes said mr saye he looked contemptuously from one to the other of these two underpaid flatfeet who had the effrontery to be taking up his time go ahead while sergeant dankwaerts in tones which to a lawbreaker would have sounded menacingly level and consulting from time to time a small black notebook recited a story studded with on the ith instants and it came to our knowledges bond made an unconcealed examination of mr saye which appeared to perturb mr saye no more than the undertones of sergeant dankwaertss recitation mr saye was a large compact man with the hardness of a chunk of quartz he had a very square face whose sharp angles were accentuated by short wiry black hair cut en brosse and without sidewhiskers his eyebrows were black and straight and tucked in below them there were two extremely sharp and steady black eyes he was cleanshaven and his lips were a thin and rather wide straight line the square chin was deeply cleft and the muscles bulged at the points of the jaw he was dressed in a roomy black singlebreasted suit a white shirt and an almost bootlacethin black tie held in place by a gold tieclip representing a spear his long arms hung relaxed at his sides and terminated in two very large hands now slightly curled inwards whose backs showed black hair his big feet in expensive black shoes looked to be about size bond summed him up as a tough and capable man who had triumphed in a variety of hard schools and who looked as if he was still serving in one of them and these are the stones we are particularly interested in concluded sergeant dankwaerts he referred to his black book one carat wesselton two fine bluewhites of about carats each one carat yellow premier one carat top cape and two carat cape unions he paused then he looked up from his book and very sharply into mr sayes hard black eyes have any of those passed through your hands mr saye or through your firm in new york he inquired softly no said mr saye flatly they have not he turned to the door behind him and opened it and now good afternoon gentlemen without bothering any further with them he walked decisively out of the room and they heard his footsteps go rapidly up a few stairs a door opened and banged shut and there was silence undismayed sergeant dankwaerts slipped his notebook into his waistcoat pocket picked up his hat and walked out into the hall and then out into the street bond followed him they climbed into the patrol car and bond gave the address of his flat off the kings road when the car was moving sergeant dankwaerts relaxed his official face he turned to bond he looked amused i quite enjoyed that he said cheerfully dont often meet a nut as tough as that one did you get what you wanted sir bond shrugged his shoulders tell the truth sergeant i didnt know exactly what i did want but i was glad to get a good look at mr rufus b saye quite a chap doesnt look much like my idea of a diamond merchant sergeant dankwaerts chuckled hes not a diamond merchant sir he said or ill eat my hat how do you know when i read out that list of missing stones sergeant dankwaerts smiled happily i mentioned a yellow premier and two cape unions yes it just happens that there arent such things sir feuilles mortes bond felt the liftman watching him as he walked down the long quiet corridor to the end room room bond wasnt surprised he knew there was more petty crime in this hotel than in any other large hotel in london vallance had once shown him the big monthly crime map of london he had pointed to the forest of little flags round the trafalgar palace that place annoys the maproom men he had said every month this corner gets so pitted with holes they have to paste fresh paper over it to hold the next months pins as bond neared the end of the corridor he could hear a piano swinging a rather sad tune at the door of he knew the music came from behind it he recognized the tune it was feuilles mortes he knocked come in the hall porter had telephoned and the voice was waiting for him bond walked into the small livingroom and closed the door behind him lock it said the voice it came from the bedroom bond did as he was told and walked across the middle of the room until he was opposite the open bedroom door as he passed the portable longplayer on the writing desk the pianist began on la ronde she was sitting half naked astride a chair in front of the dressingtable gazing across the back of the chair into the triple mirror her bare arms were folded along the tall back of the chair and her chin was resting on her arms her spine was arched and there was arrogance in the set of her head and shoulders the black string of her brassiere across the naked back the tight black lace pants and the splay of her legs whipped at bonds senses the girl raised her eyes from looking at her face and inspected him in the mirror briefly and coolly i guess youre the new help she said in a low rather husky voice that made no commitment take a seat and enjoy the music best light record ever made bond was amused he obediently took the few steps to a deep armchair moved it a little so that he could still see her through the doorway and sat down do you mind if i smoke he said taking out his case and putting a cigarette in his mouth if thats the way you want to die miss case resumed the silent contemplation of her face in the mirror while the pianist played jattendrai then it was the end of the record indifferently she flexed her hips back off the chair and stood up she half turned her head and the blonde hair that fell heavily to the base of her neck curved with the movement and caught the light if you like it turn it over she said carelessly be with you in a moment she moved out of sight bond walked over to the gramophone and picked up the record it was george feyer with rhythm accompaniment he looked at the number and memorized it it was vox he examined the other side and skipping la vie en rose because it had memories for him put the needle down at the beginning of avril an portugal before he left the gramophone he pulled the blotter softly from under it and held it up to the standard lamp beside the writingdesk he held it sideways under the light and glanced along it it was unmarked he shrugged his shoulders and slipped it back under the machine and walked back to his chair he thought that the music was appropriate to the girl all the tunes seemed to belong to her no wonder it was her favourite record it had her brazen sexiness the rough tang of her manner and the poignancy that had been in her eyes as they had looked moodily back at him out of the mirror bond had had no picture in his mind of the miss case who was to shadow him to america he had taken for granted that it would be some tough wellused slattern with dead eyesa hard sullen woman who had gone the route and whose body was no longer of any interest to the gang she worked for this girl was tough all right tough of manner but whatever might be the history of her body the skin had shone with life under the light what was her first name bond got up again and walked over to the gramophone there was a panamerican airways label attached to the grip it said miss t case t bond walked back to his chair teresa tess thelma trudy tilly none of them seemed to fit surely not trixie or tony or tommy he was still playing with the problem when she appeared quietly in the doorway to the bedroom and stood with one elbow resting high up against the doorjamb and her head bent sideways on to her hand she looked down at him reflectively bond got unhurriedly to his feet and looked back at her she was dressed to go out except for her hat a small black affair that swung from her free hand she wore a smart black tailormade over a deep olivegreen shirt buttoned at the neck goldentan nylons and black squaretoed crocodile shoes that looked very expensive there was a slim gold wristwatch on a black strap at one wrist and a heavy gold chain bracelet at the other one large baguettecut diamond flared on the third finger of her right hand and a flat pearl earring in twisted gold showed on her right ear where the heavy pale gold hair fell away from it she was very beautiful in a devilmaycare way as if she kept her looks for herself and didnt mind what men thought of them and there was an ironical tilt to the finely drawn eyebrows above the wide level rather scornful grey eyes that seemed to say sure come and try but brother youd better be tops the eyes themselves had the rare quality of chatoyance when jewels have chatoyance the colour in the lustre changes with movement in the light and the colour of this girls eyes seemed to vary between a light grey and a deep greyblue her skin was lightly tanned and without makeup except for a deep red on the lips which were full and soft and rather moody so as to give the effect of what is called a sinful mouth but not thought bond one that often sinnedif one was to judge by the level eyes and the hint of authority and tension behind them the eyes now looked impersonally into his so youre peter franks she said and the voice was low and attractive but with a touch of condescension yes he said and ive been wondering what t stands for she thought for a moment i guess you can find out at the desk she said it stands for tiffany she walked over to the gramophone and stopped the record in the middle of e nen connais pas la fin she turned round but its not in the public domain she added coldly bond shrugged his shoulders and moved over to the windowsill and leant easily against it with his ankles crossed his nonchalance seemed to irritate her she sat down in front of the writingdesk now then she said and her voice had an edge to it lets get down to business in the first place why did you take on this job somebody died oh she looked at him sharply they told me your line was stealing she paused hot blood or cold blood hot blood a fight so you want to get out thats about it and the money she changed the subject got a wooden leg false teeth no everythings real she frowned im always telling them to find me a man with a wooden leg well have you got any hobbies or anything any ideas about where youre going to carry the stones no said bond i play cards and golf but i thought the handles of trunks and suitcases were good places for this sort of stuff so do the customs men she said dryly she sat silent for a moment reflecting then she pulled a piece of paper and a pencil towards her what sort of golf balls do you use she asked unsmilingly theyre called dunlop he was equally serious maybe youve got something there she made no comment but wrote the name down she looked up got a passport well i have admitted bond but its in my real name oh she was suspicious again and what might that be james bond she snorted why not choose joe doe she shrugged her shoulders who cares anyway can you get an american visa in two days and a vaccination certificate dont see why not said bond theres nothing against me in america or at criminal records here for the matter of that under bond that is okay she said now listen immigration will need this youre going over to the states to stay with a man called tree michael tree youll be staying at the astor in new york hes an american friend of yours you met him in the war she unbent minutely just for the record this man really exists hell back up your story but hes not generally known as michael hes known as shady tree to his friends if any she added sourly bond smiled hes not as funny as he sounds said the girl shortly she opened a drawer in the desk and took out a packet of fivepound notes with a rubber band round it she riffled them through and detached about half their number and put these back in the drawer she rolled up the rest snapped the rubber band round them and tossed the packet across the room to bond bond leant forward and caught it near the floor theres about ј in there she said book yourself in at the ritz and give that address to immigration get a good used suitcase and put in it what you would take on a golfing holiday get your golf clubs keep out of sight boac monarch to new york thursday evening get a single ticket first thing tomorrow morning the embassy wont give you a visa without seeing your ticket car will pick you up at the ritz at thursday evening driver will give you the golf balls put em in your bag and she looked him straight in the eye dont think you can go into business for yourself with this stuff the driver will stay alongside you until your luggage has gone out to the plane and ill be at london airport so no funny business okay bond shrugged his shoulders what would i do with this kind of merchandise he said carelessly too big for me and what happens the other end another driver will be waiting outside the customs hell tell you what to do next now her voice was urgent if anything happens at the customs either end you know nothing see you just dont know how the balls got into your bag whatever they ask you just go on saying by me act dumb i shall be watching and maybe others too that i wouldnt know if they lock you up in america ask for the british consul and go on asking you wont get any help from us but thats what youre being paid for okay fair enough said bond the only person i could get into trouble would be you he looked appraisingly at her and i wouldnt like that to happen shucks she said scornfully youve got nothing on me dont worry about me my friend i can look after myself she got up and came and stood in front of him and dont little girl me she said sharply were on a job and i can take care of myself youd be surprised bond stood up and away from the windowsill he smiled down and into the flashing grey eyes that were now dark with impatience i can do anything better than you can dont worry ill be a credit to you but just relax and stop being so businesslike for a minute id like to see you again could we meet in new york if everything goes all right bond felt treacherous as he said the words he liked this girl he wanted to make friends with her but it would be a question of using friendship to get further up the pipeline she looked thoughtfully at him for a moment and her eyes gradually lost their darkness her sharply compressed lips relaxed and parted a little there was a hint of a stammer in her voice as she answered him i i that is she brusquely turned away from him hell she said but the word sounded artificial ive got nothing on friday night guess we might have dinner club on nd all the cab drivers know it eight oclock if the job goes off okay suit you she turned back towards him and looked at his mouth and not his eyes fine said bond he thought it was time to get out before he made a mistake now he said efficiently is there anything else no she said and then sharply as if she had just remembered something whats the time bond looked at his watch ten to six ive got to get busy she said with a movement of dismissal she walked towards the door bond followed her with her hand on the key she turned she looked at him and there was confidence and almost warmth in her eyes youll be all right she said just keep away from me in the plane dont panic if anything goes wrong if you work out okay the patronizing note came back to her voice ill try and get you some more of the same sort of jobs thanks said bond id appreciate that id enjoy working with you with a slight shrug of the shoulders she opened the door and bond walked out into the corridor he turned see you at this place of yours he said he wanted to say more to find an excuse to stay with her with this lonely girl who played the gramophone and gazed at herself in the mirror but now her expression was remote he might have been a complete stranger sure she said indifferently she looked at him once more and then she closed the door slowly but firmly in his face as bond walked away down the long corridor to the lift the girl stood just inside the door and listened until his footsteps had vanished then with brooding eyes she walked slowly over to the gramophone and switched it on she picked up the feyer record and searched for the groove she wanted she put the record on the machine and found the place with the needle the tune was e nen connais fas la fin she stood listening to it and wondering about the man who had suddenly out of the blue found his way into her life god she thought to herself with sudden angry despair another dam crook couldnt she ever get away from them but when the record stopped her face was happy and she hummed the tune as she powdered her nose and got ready to go out out on the street she paused and looked at her watch ten minutes past six five minutes to go she walked across trafalgar square to charing cross station arranging in her mind what she was going to say then she went into the station and into one of the callboxes she always used it was just when she dialled the welbeck number after the usual two rings she heard the click of the automatic recorder taking the call for twenty seconds she heard nothing but the sharp hiss of a needle on wax then the neutral voice that was her unknown master said the one word speak and then there was silence again except for the hiss of the recorder she had long got over being flustered by the abrupt disembodied command she spoke rapidly but distinctly into the black mouthpiece case to abc i repeat case to abc she paused carrier is satisfactory says real name is james bond and will use that name on passport plays golf and will carry golf clubs suggest golf balls uses dunlop s all other arrangements stand will call for confirmation at and thats all she listened for a moment to the hiss of the recorder then she put down the receiver and walked back to her hotel she called room service for a large dry martini and when it came she sat and smoked and played the gramophone and waited for then or perhaps not until she called back again at the neutral muffled voice would come back at her over the telephone wire abc to case i repeat abc to case and then would follow her instructions and somewhere in some rented room in london the hiss of the recorder would stop as she put back the receiver and then perhaps an unknown door would close and footsteps would softly sound on some stairs and out into an unknown street and away in transit it was six oclock on thursday evening and bond was packing his suitcase in his bedroom at the ritz it was a battered but once expensive pigskin revelation and its contents were appropriate to his cover evening clothes his lightweight black and white dogtooth suit for the country and for golf saxone golf shoes a companion to the dark blue tropical worsted suit he was wearing and some white silk and dark blue sea island cotton shirts with collars attached and short sleeves socks and ties some nylon underclothes and two pairs of the long silk pyjama coats he wore in place of twopiece pyjamas none of these things bore or had ever borne any nametags or initials bond completed his task and proceeded to fit his remaining possessions his shaving and washing gear tommy armour on how to play your best golf all the time and his tickets and passport into a small attache case also of battered pigskin this had been prepared for him by q branch and there was a narrow compartment under the leather at the back which contained a silencer for his gun and thirty rounds of ammunition the telephone rang he assumed it was the car early at the rendezvous but it was the hall porter saying that there was a representative of universal export with a letter to be delivered personally to bond send him up said bond wondering a few minutes later he opened the door to a man in plain clothes whom he recognized as one of the messengers from the pool at headquarters good evening sir said the man he took a large plain envelope out of his breast pocket and handed it to bond i am to wait and take this back when you have read it sir bond opened the white envelope and broke the seal of the blue envelope which it contained there was a page of blue typewritten foolscap paper with no address and no signature bond recognized the extralarge type used in ms personal communications bond waved the messenger to a chair and sat down at the writing desk opposite the window washington reports that rufus b saye is an alias for jack spang a suspected gangster who was mentioned in the kefauver report but who has no criminal record he is however twin brother to seraffimo spang and joint controller of the spangled mob which operates widely in the united states the brothers spang bought control of the house of diamonds five years ago as an investment and nothing unfavourable is known about this business which appears to be perfectly legitimate the brothers also own a wire service which serves offthecourse bookmakers in nevada and california and is therefore illegal the name of this is the sure fire wire service they also own the tiara hotel in las vegas and this is the headquarters of seraffimo spang and also to benefit from the nevada tax laws the company offices of the house of diamonds washington adds that the spangled mob is interested in other illegal activities such as narcotics and organized prostitution and these lines are handled from new york by michael tree who has five previous convictions for various offences the gang has branch headquarters in miami detroit and chicago washington describes the spangled mob as one of the most powerful gangs in the united states with excellent protection in state and federal governments and with the police with the cleveland outfit and the detroit purple gang the spangled mob has top classification our interest in these matters has not been divulged to washington but in the event that your inquiries lead you into dangerous contact with this gang you will report at once and be withdrawn from the case which will then be handed over to the fbi this is an order the return of this document in a sealed envelope will acknowledge your receipt of this order there was no signature bond ran his eyes down the page again folded it and placed it in one of the ritz envelopes he got up and handed the envelope to the messenger thanks very much he said can you find your own way downstairs yes thank you sir said the messenger he went to the door and opened it good night sir good night the door closed quietly bond walked across the room to the window and looked out over green park for a moment he had a clear vision of the spare elderly figure sitting back in his chair in the quiet office give the case to the fbi bond knew m meant it but he also knew how bitter it would be for m to have to ask edgar hoover to take a case over from the secret service and pick britains chestnuts out of the fire the operative words in the memorandum were dangerous contact what constituted dangerous contact would be a matter for bond to decide compared with some of the opposition he had been up against these hoodlums surely wouldnt count for much or would they bond suddenly remembered the chunky quartzlike face of rufus b saye well at any rate it could do no harm to try and get a look at this brother with the exotic name seraffimo the name of a nightclub waiter or an icecream vendor but these people were like that cheap and theatrical bond shrugged his shoulders he glanced at his watch he looked round the room everything was ready on an impulse he put his right hand under his coat and drew the beretta automatic with the skeleton grip out of the chamois leather holster that hung just below his left armpit it was the new gun m had given him as a memento after his last assignment with a note in ms green ink that had said you may need this bond walked over to the bed snapped out the magazine and pumped the single round in the chamber out on to the bedspread he worked the action several times and sensed the tension on the trigger spring as he squeezed and fired the empty gun he pulled back the breech and verified that there was no dust round the pin which he had spent so many hours filing to a point and he ran his hand down the blue barrel from the tip of which he had personally sawn the blunt foresight then he snapped the spare round back into the magazine and the magazine into the taped butt of the thin gun pumped the action for a last time put up the safe and slipped the gun back under his coat the telephone rang your cars here sir bond put down the receiver so here it was the off he walked thoughtfully over to the window and looked out again across the green trees he felt a slight emptiness in the stomach a sudden pang at cutting the painter with those green trees that were london in high summer and a loneliness at the thought of the big building in regents park the fortress which would now be out of reach except to a call for help which he knew it would not be in him to make there was a knock on the door and when a page came in for his bags bond followed him out of the room and along the corridor and his mind was swept clean of everything except what waited at the mouth of the pipeline that lay open for him outside the swingdoors of the ritz hotel it was a black armstrong siddeley sapphire with red trade plates youd like to sit up front said the uniformed chauffeur it was not an invitation bonds two bags and his golf clubs were put in the back he settled himself comfortably and as they turned into piccadilly he examined the face of the driver all he could see was a hard anonymous profile under a peaked cap the eyes were concealed behind black sun goggles the hands that expertly used the wheel and the gears wore leather gloves just relax and enjoy the ride mister the accent was brooklyn dont bother with conversation makes me nervous bond smiled and said nothing he did as he was told forty he thought twelve stone five feet ten expert driver very familiar with london traffic no smell of tobacco expensive shoes neat dresser no five oclock shadow query shaves twice a day with electric razor after the roundabout at the end of the great west road the driver pulled in to the side he opened the glove compartment and carefully removed six new dunlop s in their black wrapping paper and with the seals intact leaving the engine idling in neutral he got out of the front seat and opened the rear door bond looked over his shoulder and watched the man unstrap the ballpocket on his golf bag and one by one carefully add the six new balls to the miscellaneous old and new ones the pocket already contained then without a word the man climbed back into the front seat and the drive continued at london airport bond unconcernedly went through the luggage and ticket routine bought himself the evening standard allowing his arm as he put down his pennies to brush against an attractive blonde in a tan travelling suit who was idly turning the pages of a magazine and accompanied by the driver followed his luggage through to the customs just your personal effects sir yes and how much english money have you sir about three pounds and some silver thank you sir the blue chalk made a scribble on the three bags and the porter picked up the suitcase and clubs and loaded them on a trolley follow the yellow light to immigration sir he said and wheeled the trolley off towards the loading bay the driver gave bond an ironical salute the smudge of two eyes met his for a moment through the dark glass of the goggles and the lips narrowed in a thin smile good night sir pleasant trip thank you my man said bond cheerfully and had the satisfaction of seeing the smile vanish as the driver turned and walked quickly away bond picked up his attachй case showed his passport to a pleasant freshfaced young man who ticked his name off the passenger list and walked through into the departure lounge just behind him he heard tiffany cases low voice say thank you to the freshfaced young man and a moment later she also came into the lounge and chose a seat between him and the door bond smiled to himself it was where he would have chosen to sit if he had been tailing someone who might have second thoughts bond picked up his evening standard and casually examined the other passengers over the top of it the plane would be nearly full and he was relieved to see that among the forty people in the lounge there was not a face he recognized some miscellaneous english two of the usual nuns who bond reflected seemed always to be flying the atlantic in the summerlourdes perhapssome nondescript americans mostly of the businessman type two babies in armsto keep the passengers from sleeping and a handful of indeterminate europeans a typical load decided bond while admitting that if two of their number himself and tiffany case had their secrets there was no reason why many of these dull people should not also be bound on strange missions bond felt that he was being watched but it was only the blank gaze of two of the passengers he had put down as american businessmen their eyes shifted casually away and one of them a man with a young face but prematurely white hair said something to the other and they both got up picked up their stetsons which although it was summer were encased in waterproof covers and walked over to the bar bond heard them order double brandies and water and the second man who was pale and fat took a bottle of pills out of his pocket and swallowed one down with his brandy dramamine guessed bond the man would be a bad traveller the boac flight dispatcher was close to bond she picked up the telephoneto flight control bond supposedand said i have forty passengers in the final lounge she waited for the okay and then put the telephone back and picked up the microphone final lounge cheerful start to flying the atlantic reflected bond and then they were all walking across the tarmac and up into the big boeing and with a burst of oil and metanol smoke the engines fired one by one the chief steward announced over the loudspeaker that the next stop would be shannon where they would dine and that the flying time would be one hour and fifty minutes and the great doubledecker stratocruiser rolled slowly out to the eastwest runway the aircraft trembled against its brakes as the captain revved the four engines one at a time up to takeoff speed and through his window bond watched the wing flaps being tested then the great plane turned slowly towards the setting sun there was a jerk as the brakes were released and the grass on either side of the runway flattened as gathering speed the monarch hurtled down the two miles of stressed concrete and rose into the west aiming ultimately for another little strip of concrete carpet on the other side of the world bond lit a cigarette and was settling himself with his book when the back of the reclining seat on the left of the pair in front of him was lowered sharply towards him it was one of the two american business men the fat one lying slumped down with his safety belt still fastened round his stomach his face was green and sweating he held a brief case clutched across his chest and bond could read the name on the visiting card inserted in the leather label tag it said mr w winter and below in neat red ink capitals was written my blood group is f poor brute thought bond hes terrified he knows the plane is going to crash he just hopes the men who pull him out of the wreckage will give him the right blood transfusion to him this plane is nothing but a giant tubefull of anonymous deadweight supported in the air by a handful of sparking plugs and guided to its destination by a scrap of electricity he has no faith in it and no faith in safety statistics he is suffering the same fears he had as a small childthe fear of noise and the fear of falling he wont even dare to go to the lavatory for fear hell put his foot through the floor of the plane when he stands up a silhouette broke the rays of the evening sun that filled the cabin and bond glanced away from the man it was tiffany case she walked past him to the stairs leading down to the cocktail lounge on the lower deck and disappeared bond would have liked to follow her he shrugged his shoulders and waited for the steward to wheel round the tray of cocktails and the caviar and smoked salmon canapйs he turned again to his book and read a page without understanding a single word he put the girl out of his mind and started the page again bond had read a quarter of the book when he felt his ears begin to block as the plane started its fiftymile descent towards the western coastline of ireland fasten your seatbelts no smoking and there was the greenandwhite searchlight of shannon and the red and gold of the flarepath rushing towards them and then the brilliant blue of the groundlights between which the stratocruiser trundled towards the unloading bay steak and champagne for dinner and the wonderful goblet of hot coffee laced with irish whisky and topped with half an inch of thick cream a glance at the junk in the airport shops the irish horn rosaries the bog oak irish harp and the brass leprechauns all at and the ghastly irish musical cottage at the furry unwearable tweeds and the dainty irish linen doilies and cocktail napkins and then the irish rigmarole coming over the loudspeaker in which only the words boac and new york were comprehensible the translation into english the last look at europe and they were climbing to feet and heading for their next contact with the surface of the world the radio beacons on the weather ships jig and charlie marking time around their compass points somewhere in the middle of the atlantic bond slept well and awoke only as they were approaching the southern shores of nova scotia he went forward to the washroom and shaved and gargled away the taste of a night of pressurized air and then he went back to his seat between the lines of crumpled stirring passengers and had his usual moment of exhilaration as the sun came up over the rim of the world and bathed the cabin in blood slowly with the dawn the plane came alive twenty thousand feet below the houses began to show like grains of sugar spilt across a brown carpet nothing moved on the earths surface except a thin worm of smoke from a train the straight white feather of a fishing boats wake across an inlet and the glint of chromium from a toy motor car caught in the sun but bond could almost see the sleeping humps under the bedclothes beginning to stir and where there was a wisp of smoke rising into the still morning air he could smell the coffee brewing in the kitchens breakfast came that inappropriate assortment of foods that boac advertise as an english country house breakfast and the chief steward came round with the us customs formsform no of the treasury departmentand bond read the small print failure to declare any article or any wilfully false statement fine or imprisonment or both and wrote personal effects and cheerfully signed the lie and then there were three hours when the plane hung deadsteady in the middle of the world and only the patches of bright sunshine swaying slowly a few inches up and down the walls of the cabin gave a sense of motion but at last there was the great sprawl of boston below them and then the bold pattern of a cloverleaf on the new jersey turnpike and bonds ears began to block with the slow descent towards the pall of haze that was the suburbs of new york there was the hiss and sickly smell of the insecticide bomb the shrill hydraulic whine of the airbrakes and the landingwheels being lowered the dip of the planes nose the tearing bump of the tyres on the runway the ugly roar as the screws were reversed to slow the plane for the entrance bay the rumbling progress over the tired grass plain towards the tarmac apron the clang of the hatch being opened and they were there shady tree the customs officer a paunchy goodliving man with dark sweat marks at the armpits of his grey uniform shirt sauntered lazily over from the supervisors desk to where bond stood his three pieces of luggage in front of him under the letter b next door under c the girl took a packet of parliaments out of her bag and put a cigarette between her lips bond heard several impatient clicks at the lighter and the sharper snap as she put the lighter back in her bag and closed the fastening bond felt aware of her watchfulness he wished that her name began with z so that she would not be so close zarathustra zacharias zophany p mr bond yes is this your signature yes just your personal effects yes thats all okay mr bond the man tore a customs stamp out of his book and pasted it on the suitcase he did the same for the attachй case he came to the golf clubs he paused with the stamp book in his hand he looked up at bond what dya shoot mr bond bond had a moment of blackout theyre golf clubs sure said the man patiently but what dya shoot what dya go round in bond could have kicked himself for forgetting the americanism oh in the middle eighties i guess never broken a hundred in my life said the customs officer he gummed a blessed stamp on the side of the bag a few inches away from the richest haul of contraband that had ever been missed at idlewild have a good vacation mr bond thanks said bond he beckoned a porter and followed his bags across to the last hurdle the inspector at the door there was no pause the man bent over searched for the stamps overstamped them and waved him through mr bond it was a tall hatchetfaced man with mudcoloured hair and mean eyes he was wearing dark brown slacks and a coffeecoloured shirt i have a car for you as he turned and led the way out into the hot early morning sun bond noticed a square bulge in his hippocket it was about the shape of a smallcalibre automatic typical thought bond mike hammer routine these american gangsters were too obvious they had read too many horrorcomics and seen too many films the car was a black oldsmobile sedan bond didnt wait to be told he climbed into the front seat leaving the disposal of his luggage in the back and the tipping of the porter to the man in brown when they had left the cheerless prairie of idlewild and had merged into the stream of commuter traffic on the van wyck parkway he felt he ought to say something hows the weather been over here the driver didnt take his eyes off the road either side of a hundred thats pretty hot said bond we havent had it much over seventyfive in london that so whats the programme now asked bond after a pause the man glanced in his drivingmirror and pulled into the centre lane for a quarter of a mile he busied himself with passing a bunch of slowmoving cars on the inside lanes they came to an empty stretch of road bond repeated his question i said whats the programme the driver gave him a quick glance shady wants you does he said bond he was suddenly impatient with these people he wondered how soon he would be able to throw some weight about the prospect didnt look good his job was to stay in the pipeline and follow it farther any sign of independence or noncooperation and he would be discarded he would have to make himself small and stay that way he would just have to get used to the idea they swept into uptown manhattan and followed the river as far as the forties then they cut across town and pulled up half way down west th street the hatton garden of new york the driver doubleparked outside an inconspicuous doorway their destination was sandwiched between a grubbylooking shop selling costume jewellery and an elegant shopfront faced with black marble the silver italic lettering above the black marble entrance of the elegant shopfront was so discreet that if the name had not been in the back of bonds mind he would not have been able to decipher it from where he sat it said the house of diamonds inc as the car stopped a man stepped off the pavement and sauntered round the car everything okay he said to the driver sure boss in yeah want me to park the heap be glad if you would the driver turned to bond this is it bud lets get the bags out bond got out and opened the rear door he picked up his small attachй case and reached for the golf clubs ill take the sticks said the driver behind him obediently bond hauled out his suitcase the driver reached in for the clubs and slammed the door of the car the other man was already in the drivers seat and the car moved off into the traffic as bond followed the driver across the sidewalk and through the inconspicuous door there was a man in a porters lodge in the small hallway as they came in he looked up from the sports section of the news hi he said to the driver he looked sharply at bond hi said the driver mind if we leave the bags with you go ahead said the man be okay in here he jerked his head back the driver with bonds clubs over his shoulder waited for bond beside the doors of an elevator across the hall when bond followed him inside he pressed the button for the fourth floor and they rode up in silence they emerged into another small hallway it contained two chairs a table a large brass spittoon and a smell of stale heat they crossed the frayed carpet to a glassfronted door and the driver knocked and walked through without waiting for an answer bond followed him and shut the door a man with very bright red hair and a big peaceful moonshaped face was sitting at a desk there was a glass of milk in front of him he stood up as they came in and bond saw he was a hunchback bond didnt remember having seen a redhaired hunchback before he could imagine that the combination would be useful for frightening the small fry who worked for the gang the hunchback moved slowly round the desk and over to where bond was standing he walked roundbond making a show of examining him minutely from head to foot and then he came and stood close in front of bond and looked up into his face bond looked impassively back into a pair of china eyes that were so empty and motionless that they might have been hired from a taxidermist bond had the feeling that he was being subjected to some sort of test casually he looked back at the hunchback noting the big ears with rather exaggerated lobes the dry red lips of the big halfopen mouth the almost complete absence of a neck and the short powerful arms in the expensive yellow silk shirt cut to make room for the barrellike chest and its sharp hump i like to have a good look at the people we employ mr bond the voice was sharp and pitched high bond smiled politely london tells me you have killed a man i believe them i can see you are capable of it would you like to do more work for us it depends what it is said bond or rather he hoped he was not being too theatrical how much you pay the hunchback gave a short squeal of laughter he turned abruptly to the driver rocky get those balls out of the bag and cut them open here he gave a quick shake of his right arm and held his open hand out to the driver on it lay a doublebladed knife with a flat handle bound with adhesive tape bond recognized it as a throwing knife he had to admit that the bit of legerdemain had been neatly executed yes boss said the driver and bond noticed the alacrity with which he took the knife and knelt on the floor to unstrap the ballpocket of the golf bag the hunchback walked away from bond and back to his chair he sat down and picked up the glass of milk he looked at it with distaste and swallowed the contents in two huge gulps he looked at bond as if for comment ulcers asked bond sympathetically who spoke to you said the hunchback angrily his anger was transferred to the driver what are you waiting for rocky put those balls on the table where i can see what youre doing the number on the ball is the centre of the plug dig em out coming boss said the driver he stood up from the floor and put the six new balls on the desk five of them were still in their black wrapping he took the sixth and turned it round in his fingers then he picked up the knife and dug its point into the cover of the ball and levered a halfinch circular section of the ball came away on the tip of the blade and he passed the ball across the desk to the hunchback who tipped the contents three uncut stones of ten to fifteen carats on to the leather surface of the desk the hunchback moodily poked the stones with his finger the driver went on with his work until bond counted eighteen stones on the table they were unimpressive in their rough state but if they were of top quality bond could easily believe they might be worth ј after cutting okay rocky said the hunchback eighteen thats the lot now get those goddam golfsticks out of here and send the boy to the astor with them and this guys bags hes registered there have them sent up to his room okay okay boss the driver left the knife and the empty golf balls on the table strapped up the ballpocket on bonds bag hoisted the bag on his shoulder and left the room bond went over to a chair against the wall pulled it over to face the hunchback across the desk and sat down he took a cigarette and lit it he looked across at the hunchback and said and now if youre happy id be glad of those the hunchback who had been carefully watching bonds movements lowered his eyes to the untidy pile of diamonds in front of him he poked them into a circle then he looked up at bond you will be paid in full mr bond the high voice was precise and businesslike and you may get more than but the method of payment will be devised as much for your protection as for ours there will be no direct payment and you will understand why mr bond because you will have made payoffs during your career of burglary it is very dangerous for a man suddenly to be flush with money he talks about it he throws it around and if the cops catch up with him and ask him where it all came from he hasnt got an answer agree yes said bond surprised by the sanity and authority of what the man was saying that makes sense so said the hunchback i and my friends pay only very seldom and in small amounts for services rendered instead we arrange for the guy to make the money on his own account take yourself how much money have you got in your pocket about three pounds and some silver said bond all right said the hunchback today you met your friend mr tree he pointed a finger at his chest which is me a perfectly respectable citizen whom you knew in england in when he was concerned with the disposal of army surplus goods remember yes i owed you for a bridge game we had at the savoy remember bond nodded when we meet today i toss you double or quits for it and you win okay so you now have and i a taxpaying citizen will support your story here is the money the hunchback took a wallet out of his hippocket and pushed ten bills across the table bond picked them up and put them casually in the pocket of his coat and then continued the hunchback you say youd like to see some horseracing while youre over here so i say to you why not go and take a look at saratoga the meeting begins on monday and you say okay and you go on up to saratoga with your thousand bucks in your pocket okay fine said bond and you back a horse there and it pays off at least fives so you have your and if anybody asks where it came from you earned it and you can prove it what if the horse loses it wont bond made no comment so he was getting somewhere alreadyinto the gangster world with a bang the racing end of it he looked across into the pale china eyes it was impossible to tell whether they were receptive they stared blankly back at him but now for the big step through the cutout well thats fine said bond hoping that flattery was the key you people certainly seem to think things out i like working for careful people there was no encouragement in the china eyes id like to stay away from england for a bit i suppose you couldnt do with an extra hand the china eyes shifted away from his and inched reflectively over bonds face and shoulders as if the hunchback was judging horseflesh then the man looked down at the circle of diamonds in front of him and carefully thoughtfully poked it into a square there was silence in the room bond looked at his fingernails at last the hunchback looked up at him again could be he said thoughtfully could be thered be something else for you you made no mistakes so far you go on that way and keep your nose clean call me up after the race and ill tell you what the word is but like i said just take it easy and do what youre told okay bonds muscles relaxed he shrugged his shoulders why should i get out of line im looking for a job and you can tell your outfit that im not particular so long as the pays good for the first time the china eyes showed emotion they looked hurt and angry and bond wondered if he had overplayed who dyou think we are the hunchbacks voice rose to an indignant squeak some sort of a cheap crook outfit well hell he shrugged his shoulders resignedly cant expect a limey to understand the way things are over here these days the eyes went dull again now listen to what i say this is my number put it down wisconsin and write this down too but keep it to yourself or you may get your tongue cut out shady trees short shrill laugh was not merry fourth race on tuesday the perpetuities stakes mile and a quarter for three year olds and put your money on just before the windows close youll shift the odds with that grand of yours okay okay said bond a pencil poised obediently over his notebook right said the hunchback shy smile big horse with a blaze face and four white stockings and play him to win the eye that never sleeps it was when bond went down in the elevator and out on to the roasting street he turned right and walked slowly down towards times square as he passed the handsome black marble frontage of the house of diamonds he stopped to examine the two discreet showwindows lined with dark blue velvet in the centre of each there was just one piece of jewellery an earring consisting of a big pearshaped diamond hanging from another perfect stone circular and brilliantcut below each earring there was a thin plate of yellow gold in the shape of a visiting card with one edge turned down on each plate was engraved the words diamonds are forever bond smiled to himself he wondered which of his predecessors had smuggled those four diamonds into america bond sauntered on in search of an airconditioned bar where he could get out of the heat and do some thinking he was pleased with his interview at least it hadnt been the brushoff he had more than half expected he was amused by the hunchback there was something splendidly theatrical about him and his vanity about the spangled mob was appealing but he wasnt at all funny bond had walked for only a few minutes when it suddenly occurred to him that he was being followed there was no evidence for it except a slight tingling of the scalp and an extra awareness of the people near him but he had faith in his sixth sense and he at once stopped in front of the shop window he was passing and looked casually back along th street nothing but a lot of miscellaneous people moving slowly on the sidewalks mostly on the same side as himself the side that was sheltered from the sun there was no sudden movement into a doorway nobody casually wiping his face with a handkerchief to avoid recognition nobody bending down to tie a shoelace bond examined the swiss watches in his shop window and then turned and sauntered on after a few yards he stopped again still nothing he went on and turned right into the avenue of the americas stopping in the first doorway the entrance to a womens underwear store where a man in a tan suit with his back to him was examining the black lace pants on a particularly realistic dummy bond turned and leant against a pillar and gazed lazily but watchfully out into the street and then something gripped his pistol arm and a voice snarled all right limey take it easy unless you want lead for lunch and he felt something press into his back just above the kidneys what was there familiar about that voice the law the gang bond glanced down to see what was holding his right arm it was a steel hook well if the man had only one arm like lightning he swivelled bending sideways and bringing his left fist round in a flailing blow low down there was a smack as his fist was caught in the other mans left hand and at the same time as the contact telegraphed to bonds mind that there could have been no gun there came the wellremembered laugh and the lazy voice saying no good james the angels have got you bond straightened himself slowly and for a moment he could only gaze into the grinning hawklike face of felix leiter with blank disbelief his builtup tension slowly relaxing so you were doing a front tail you lousy bastard he finally said he looked with delight at the friend he had last seen as a cocoon of dirty bandages on a bloodstained bed in a florida hotel the american secret agent with whom he had shared so many adventures what the hell are you doing here and what the hell do you mean playing the bloody fool in this heat bond took out a handkerchief and wiped it over his face for a moment you almost made me nervous nervous felix leiter laughed scornfully you were saying your prayers and your conscience is so bad you didnt even know if you were going to get it from the cops or the gang right bond laughed and dodged the question come on you crooked spy he said you can buy me a drink and tell me all about it i just dont believe in odds as long as this in fact you can buy me lunch you texans are lousy with money sure said leiter he slipped his steel hook into the righthand pocket of his coat and took bonds arm with his left hand they moved out on to the street and bond noticed that leiter walked with a heavy limp in texas even the fleas are so rich they can hire themselves dogs lets go sardis is just over the way leiter avoided the fashionable room at the famous actors and writers eating house and led bond upstairs his limp was more noticeable and he held on to the banisters bond made no comment but when he left his friend at a corner table in the blessedly airconditioned restaurant and went off to the washroom to clean himself up he added up his impressions the right arm had gone and the left leg and there were imperceptible scars below the hairline above the right eye that suggested a good deal of grafting but otherwise leiter looked in good shape the grey eyes were undefeated the shock of strawcoloured hair had no hint of grey in it and there was none of the bitterness of a cripple in leiters face but in their short walk there had been a hint of reticence in leiters manner and bond felt this had something to do with him bond and perhaps with leiters present activities certainly not he thought as he walked across the room to join his friend with leiters injuries there was a medium dry martini with a piece of lemon peel waiting for him bond smiled at leiters memory and tasted it it was excellent but he didnt recognize the vermouth made with cresta blanca explained leitef new domestic brand from california like it best vermouth i ever tasted and ive taken a chance and ordered you smoked salmon and brizzola said leiter theyve got some of the finest meat in america here and brizzolas the best cut of that beef straightcut across the bone roast and then broiled suit you anything you say said bond weve eaten enough meals together to know each others tastes ive told them not to hurry said leiter he rapped on the table with his hook well have another martini first and while you drink it youd better come clean there was warmth in his smile but his eyes were watching bond just tell me one thing what business have you got with my old friend shady tree he gave his order to the waiter and sat forward in his chair and waited bond finished his first martini and lit a cigarette he swivelled casually in his chair the tables near them were empty he turned back and faced the american you tell me something first felix he said softly who are you working for these days still the cia nix said leiter with my gun hand gone they could only offer me desk work very nice about it and paid me off handsomely when i said i wanted an openair life so pinkertons made me a good offer you know the eye that never sleeps people so now im just adoorbasherprivate detective tut on some clothes and open up routine but its good fun theyre a nice crowd to work with and one day ill be able to retire with a pension and a presentation gold watch that goes green in summer as a matter of fact im in charge of their race gang squaddoping crooked running nightguards at the stables all that sort of thing good job and it takes you all over the country sounds all right said bond but i didnt know you knew anything about horses usent to be able to recognize a horse unless there was a milkwagon tied on behind admitted leiter but you soon pick it up and its mostly the people you have to know about not the horses what about you he lowered his voice still with the old firm thats right said bond on a job for them now yes undercover yes leiter sighed he sipped his martini reflectively well he said finally youre a dam fool to be operating alone if its anything to do with the spangled boys in fact youre such a bad risk im crazy even to be having lunch with you but ill tell you why i was gumshoeing around shadys neck of the woods this morning and maybe we can help each other without involving our outfits of course okay you know id like to work with you felix said bond seriously but im still working for the government while youre probably in competition with yours but if it turns out our targets the same theres no sense in getting wires crossed if were chasing the same hare ill be happy to run with you now bond looked quizzically at the texan am i right in thinking youre interested in someone with a blaze face and four white stockings called shy smile thats right said leiter not particularly surprised running at saratoga on tuesday and what might the running of this horse have to do with the security of the british empire ive been told to back him said bond one thousand dollars to win payoff for another job bond lifted up his cigarette and his hand covered his mouth i brought ј worth of uncut diamonds in by plane this morning for mr spang and his friends leiters eyes narrowed he gave a low whistle of surprise boy he said respectfully youre certainly in a bigger league than me im only interested because shy smile is a ringer the horse thats due to win on tuesday wont be shy smile at all shy smile wasnt even placed the last three times he ran and anyway theyve shot him itll be a very fast job called pickapepper just by chance hes got a blaze face and four white stockings too big chestnut and theyve done a good job with his hooves and various other small points of difference theyve been getting this job ready for over a year out in the desert in nevada where the spangs have some sort of a ranch and are they going to clean up its a big race with added and you can bet theyll plaster the country with their money just before the off cant fail to be better than fives more like ten or fifteen to one theyll make a packet but i thought all horses in america had to have their lips tattooed said bond how have they got round that grafted new skin on to pickapeppers mouth copied shy smiles marks on it this tattoo gimmick is getting old fashioned the word in pinkertons is that the jockey club are going to change to photos of the night eyes what are night eyes theyre those calluses on the inside of a horses knees the english call them chestnuts seems theyre different on every horse like a mans fingerprints but itll be the same old story theyll photo the night eyes on every racehorse in america and then find the gangs have dreamed up a way of altering them with acid the cops never catch up with the robbers how do you know all this about shy smile blackmail said leiter cheerfully i had a drugging rap all lined up on one of the spang stable boys i let him buy his way out of it with the details of this little caper what are you going to do about it remains to be seen going up to saratoga on sunday leiters face lit up hell why dont you come along with me driving up and ill get you in at my dump the sagamore swanky motel youve got to sleep somewhere better not be seen out together much but well be able to meet up in the evenings what do you say wonderful said bond couldnt be better and now its dam near two oclock lets have some lunch and ill tell you my end of the story the smoked salmon was from nova scotia and a poor substitute for the product of scotland but the brizzola was all that leiter had said so tender that bond could cut it with a fork he finished his lunch with half an avocado with french dressing and then dawdled over his espresso and thats the long and short of it bond concluded the story he had been telling between mouthfuls and my guess is that the spangs are doing the smuggling and the house of diamonds which they own is doing the merchandising any views leiter tapped a lucky strike out on to the table with his left hand and lit it at the flame of bonds ronson sounds possible he agreed after a pause but i dont know much about this brother of seraffimo jack spang and if jack spang is saye its the first ive heard of him for a long while weve got records on all the rest of the mob and ive come across tiffany case nice kid but shes been on the fringe of the gangs for years didnt have much chance from the cradle up her mother ran the snazziest cathouse in san francisco doing fine until she made one hell of a mistake decided one day not to pay the local outfits protection money she was paying the police so much i guess she reckoned theyd look after her crazy one night the mob turned up in force and wrecked the joint left the girls alone but had themselves a gangbang with tiffany she was only sixteen at the time not surprising she wont have anything to do with men since then next day she got hold of her mothers cash box busted it open and took to the hills then the usual roundhatcheck girl taxidancer studio extra waitressuntil she was about twenty then maybe life didnt seem so good and she took to liquor settled in a rooming house down on one of the florida keys and started drinking herself to death got so she was known as the boiled sweet down there then a kid fell in the sea and she jumped in and saved him got her name in the papers and some rich woman took a fancy to her and practically kidnapped her made her join alcoholics anonymous and then took her around the world as her companion but tiffany skipped when they got to frisco and went and lived with her old ma who had retired from the girl game by then but she never would settle down and i guess she found life a bit quiet so she went on the lam again and ended up in reno worked at harolds club for a bit came across our friend seraffimo and he got all excited because she wouldnt sleep with him offered her some sort of a job at the tiara at las vegas and shes been there for the last year or two doing these trips to europe in between i suppose but shes a good kid just never had a chance after what the gang did to her bond saw again the eyes gazing sullenly at him out of the mirror and he heard the record playing fettilles mortes in the lonely room i like her he said briefly he felt felix leiters eyes watching him speculatively he looked at his watch well felix he said it looks as if weve got hold of the same tiger but by different tails its going to be fun pulling at them both at the same time now im going to go and get some sleep got a room at the astor where shall we meet on sunday better keep away from this part of town said leiter meet you outside the plaza early so we can avoid the traffic on the parkway lets say nine oclock by the cabstand you know where the horsecabs are then if im late you can get to recognize a horse useful up at saratoga he paid the check and they walked down and out on to the grilling street bond hailed a cab leiter refused a lift instead he took bond affectionately by the arm just one thing james he said and his voice was serious you may not think the hell of a lot of american gangsters compared with smersh for instance and some of the other folk youve been up against but i can tell you these spangled boys are the tops theyve got a good machine even if they do care to have funny names and theyve got protection thats how it is in america these days but dont misunderstand me they really stink and this job of yours stinks too leiter let go of bonds arm and watched him climb into the taxi then he leant in through the window and do you know what your job stinks of you dumb bastard he asked cheerfully formaldehyde and lilies bitter champagne im not going to sleep with you said tiffany case in a matteroffact voice so dont waste your money getting me tight but ill have another and probably another one after that i just dont want to drink your vodka martinis under false pretences bond laughed he gave the order and turned back to her we havent ordered dinner yet he said i was going to suggest shellfish and hock that might have changed your mind the combinations supposed to have quite an effect listen bond said tiffany case itd take more than crabmeat ravigotte to get me into bed with a man in any event since its your check im going to have caviar and what you english call cutlets and some pink champagne i dont often date a goodlooking englishman and the dinners going to live up to the occasion suddenly she leant towards him and reached out a hand and put it over his sorry she said abruptly i didnt mean that about the check the dinners on me but i did mean it about the occasion bond smiled into her eyes dont be a goose tiffany he said using her name for the first time ive been longing for this evening and im going to have just the same as you and ive got plenty of money for the check mr tree tossed me double or quits for five hundred dollars this morning and i won at the mention of shady tree the girls manner changed that ought to cover it she said toughly just you know what they say about this joint all you can eat for only three hundred bucks the waiter brought the martinis shaken and not stirred as bond had stipulated and some slivers of lemon peel in a wine glass bond twisted two of them and let them sink to the bottom of his drink he picked up his glass and looked at the girl over the rim we havent drunk to the success of a mission he said the girls mouth turned down sarcastically at the corners she drank half the martini at a gulp and put the glass down firmly on the table or to the heartclutch i only just survived she said dryly you and your dam golf i thought you were going to tell that man all about the chip shot you holed in oughtyought a little encouragement and youd have taken out a club and one of those balls and shown him your swing you made me nervous clicking away at that dam lighter trying to get your cigarette to work i bet you put the wrong end of that parliament in your mouth and lit the filter she gave a short laugh you must have got eyes in your ears she admitted dam nearly did just that okay well call it quits she finished her martini come on youre not much of a spender i want another of these im beginning to enjoy myself and how about ordering dinner or dyou hope ill pass out before you get around to it bond beckoned to the maitre dhotel he gave the order and the wine waiter who came from brooklyn but wore a striped jacket and a green apron and had a silver chain with a tastingcup round his neck went off for the clicquot rose if i have a son said bond ill give him just one piece of advice when he comes of age ill say spend your money how you like but dont buy yourself anything that eats helln marier said the girl i must say this really is life with a small cant you tell me something nice about my dress or something instead of grumbling the whole time about how expensive i am you know what they say if you dont like my peaches why do you shake my tree i havent started to shake it yet you wont let me get my arms round the trunk she laughed and looked with approval at bond why heavens to betsy mistah bond she said yo all sure do say the purtiest things to a gal and as for the frock bond continued its a dream and you know it is i love black velvet especially against a sunburnt skin and im glad you dont wear too much jewellery and im glad you dont paint your fingernails altogether i bet youre the prettiest smuggler in new york tonight who are you smuggling with tomorrow she picked up her third martini and looked at it then very slowly in three swallows she drank it down she put down the glass and took a parliament out of the box beside her plate and bent towards the flame of bonds lighter the valley between her breasts opened for him she looked up at him through the smoke of her cigarette and suddenly her eyes widened and then slowly narrowed again i like you they said all is possible between us but dont be impatient and be kind i dont want to be hurt any more and then the waiter came with the caviar and suddenly the noise of the restaurant burst into the warm silent roomwithinaroom which they had built for themselves and the spell was broken what am i doing tomorrow repeated tiffany case in the voice one puts on in front of waiters why im going to sashay off to las vegas taking the th century to chicago and then the superchief to los angeles its a long way round but ive had enough flying for a few days what about you the waiter had gone for a while they ate their caviar in silence there was no need to answer the question immediately bond suddenly felt they had all the time in the world they both knew the answer to the big question for the answers to small ones there was no hurry bond sat back the wine waiter brought the champagne and bond tasted it it was ice cold and seemed to have a faint taste of strawberries it was delicious im going up to saratoga he said im to back a horse thats to make me some money i suppose its a fix said tiffany case sourly she drank some of the champagne her mood had changed again she shrugged her shoulders you seem to have made quite a hit with shady this morning she said indifferently he wants to put you to work for the mob bond looked down into the pink pool of champagne he could feel the fog of treachery creeping up between him and this girl he liked he closed his mind to it he must get on with tricking her thats fine he said easily id like that but who is the mob he busied himself with lighting a cigarette conjuring up the professional to keep the human quiet he could feel her looking sharply at him it put him on his mettle the secret agent took over and his mind began to work coldly watching for clues for lies for hesitations he looked up and his eyes were candid she seemed satisfied its called the spangled mob two brothers called spang i work for one of them in las vegas nobody seems to know where the other one is some say hes in europe and then theres somebody called abc when im on this diamond racket all the orders come from him the other one seraffimo hes the brother i work for hes more interested in gambling and horses runs a wire service and the tiara at vegas what do you do there i just work there she said closing the subject do you like it she ignored the question as being too stupid to answer and then theres shady she went on hes not a bad guy really except hes so crooked you shake hands with him you better count your fingers afterwards he looks after the cathouses and the dope and the rest of the stuff there are plenty of other fellershoodlums of one sort and another tough operators she looked at him and her eyes hardened youll get to know them she sneered youll like them just your type hell said bond indignantly its just another job ive got to earn some money there are plenty of other ways well these are the people youve chosen to work for youve got something there she laughed wryly and the ice was broken again but believe me youre getting into the big league when you sign up with the spangles if i were you id think the hell of a long time before you join our cosy little circle and dont go and get in wrong with the mob if youre planning anything of that sort youd better start taking lessons with a harp they were interrupted by the arrival of the cutlets accompanied by asparagus with mousseline sauce and by one of the famous kriendler brothers who have owned ever since it was the best speakeasy in new york hullo miss tiffany he said long time no see howare things out at vegas hello mac the girl smiled up at him tiaras going along okay she glanced round the packed room seems your little hot dog stand aint doing too badly cant complain said the tall young man too much expenseaccount aristocracy never enough pretty girls around you ought to come in more often he smiled at bond everything all right couldnt be better come again he snapped a ringer at the wine waiter sam ask my friends what theyd like to have with their coffee and with a final smile which embraced them both he moved to another table tiffany ordered a stinger made with white crиme de menthe and bond ordered the same when the liqueurs and the coffee came bond took up the conversation where they had left it but tiffany he said this diamond racket looks easy enough why shouldnt we just go on doing it together two or three trips a year will get us good money and that wont be often enough to make immigration or customs ask any awkward questions tiffany case was not impressed just you put it up to abc she said i keep telling you that these people arent fools theyre running a big operation with this stuff ive never had the same carrier twice and im not the only guard doing the run whats more im pretty certain we werent alone on that plane i bet they had someone else watching us both they check and double check on every dam thing they do she was irritated with his lack of respect for the quality of her employers why ive never even seen abc she said i just call up a number in london and get my orders on a wirerecorder anything ive got to say i send back to abc the same way i tell you all this is way above your head you and your dam country house burglaries she was crushing brother have you got another think coming i see said bond respectfully wondering how the hell he could get the abc telephone number out of her they certainly seem to think of everything bet your life said the girl flatly the subject was now boring she gazed moodily into her stinger and then drank it down bond sensed the beginning of a vin triste care to go somewhere else he said knowing that it hadbeen he who had killed the evening hell no she said dully take me home im getting tight whyn hell couldnt you dream up something else to talk about except these goddam hoodlums bond paid the check and in silence they went down and out of the cool envelope of the restaurant into the sultry night that stank of petrol and hot asphalt staying at the astor too she said as they got into a cab she pressed into the far corner of the back seat and sat hunched up with her chin in her hand looking out at the hideous deadly nightshade of the neon bond said nothing he looked out of the window and cursed his job all he wanted to say to this girl was listen come with me i like you dont be afraid it cant be worse than alone but if she said yes he would have been smart and he didnt want to be smart with this girl it was his job to use her but whatever the job dictated there was one way he would never use this particular girl through the heart in front of the astor he helped her out on to the sidewalk and she stood with her back to him while he paid the driver they walked up the steps in the stiff silence of a married couple after a bad evening ending in a row they got their keys at the deck and she said five to the boy on the elevator she stood with her face to the door as they rode up bond saw that the knuckles of the hand that held her evening bag were white at the fifth she walked quickly out and made no protest when bond followed her they walked round several corners until they came to her door she bent down and fitted the key into the lock and pushed the door open then she turned in the entrance and faced him listen you bond person it had started as the beginning of an angry speech but then she paused and looked straight into his eyes and bond saw that her eyelashes were wet and suddenly she had flung an arm round his neck and her face was against his and she was saying look after yourself james i dont want to lose you and then she pulled his face against hers and kissed him once hard and long on the lips with a fierce tenderness that was almost without sex but as bonds arms went round her and he started to return her kiss she suddenly stiffened and fought her way free and the moment was over with her hand on the knob of the open door she turned and looked at him and the sultry glow was back in her eyes now get away from me she said fiercely and slammed the door and locked it studillac to saratoga james bond spent most of saturday in his airconditioned room at the astor avoiding the heat sleeping and composing a hundredgroup cable addressed to the chairman universal export london he used a simple transposition code based on the fact that it was the sixth day of the week and that the date was the fourth of the eighth month the report concluded that the diamond pipeline began somewhere near jack spang in the shape of rufus b saye and ended with seraffimo spang and that the main junction in the pipe was the office of shady tree from which presumably the stones were fed into the house of diamonds for cutting and marketing bond requested london to put a close tail on rufus b saye but he warned that an individual known as abc seemed to be in direct command of the actual smuggling on behalf of the spangled mob and that bond had no clue to this individuals identity except that he appeared to be located in london presumably only this man would provide a lead back to the actual source of the smuggled diamonds somewhere on the continent of africa bond reported that his own intention was to continue working up the pipeline in the direction of seraffimo spang using as an unconscious agent tiffany case whose background he briefly reported bond sent the cable collect via western union had his fourth shower of the day and wentto voisins where he had two vodka martinis oeufs benedict and strawberries over dinner he read the racing forecasts for the saratoga meeting from which he noted that the joint favourites for the perpetuities stakes were mr c v whitneys come again and mr william woodward jnrs pray action shy smile was not mentioned then bond walked back to his hotel and went to bed punctually at nine on sunday morning a black studebaker convertible drew up to the sidewalk where bond was standing beside his suitcase when he had thrown his case on to the back seat and climbed in beside leiter leiter reached up to the roof and pulled back a lever then he pressed a button on the dash and with a thin hydraulic whine the canvas roof slowly raised itself up into the air and folded itself down and back into a recess between the rear seat and the boot then manipulating the steering wheel gearshift with easy movements of his steel hook he took the car fast across central park its about two hundred miles said leiter when they were down on the hudson river parkway almost due north up the hudson in new york state just south of the adirondacks and not far short of the canadian border well take the taconic parkway theres no hurry so well go easy and i dont want to get a ticket theres a fiftymile speed limit in most of new york state and the cops are fierce but i can generally get away from them if im in a hurry they dont book you if they cant catch you too ashamed to turn up in court and admit something is faster than their indians but i thought those indians could do well over ninety said bond thinking that his friend had become a bit of a showoff since the old days i didnt know these studebakers had it in them there was a straight stretch of empty road in front of them leiter gave a brief glance in his driving mirror and suddenly rammed the gear lever into second and thrust his foot into the floor bonds head jerked back on his shoulders and he felt his spine being rammed into the back of the bucket seat incredulously he glanced at the hooded speedometer eighty with a clang leiters hook hit the gear lever into top the car went on gathering speed ninety ninetyfive six sevenand then there was a bridge and a converging road and leiters foot was on the brake and the deep roar of the engine gave way to a steady thrumming as they settled down in the seventies and swept easily through the graded curves leiter glanced sideways at bond and grinned nearly another thirty in hand he said proudly not long ago i paid five dollars and put her through the measured mile at daytona she clocked a hundred and twentyseven and that beach surface isnt any too hot well ill be damned said bond incredulously but what sort of a car is this anyway isnt it a studebaker studillac said leiter studebaker with a cadillac engine special transmission and brakes and rear axle conversion job a small firm near new york turns them out only a few but theyre a damn sight better sports car than those corvettes and thunderbirds and you couldnt have anything better than this body designed by that frenchman raymond loewy best designer in the world but its a bit too advanced for the american market studebakers never got enough credit for this body too unconventional like the car bet i could give your old bentley a licking leiter chuckled and reached in his lefthand pocket for a dime as they came to the henry hudson bridge toll until one of your wheels came off said bond caustically as they accelerated away again this sort of hotrod jobs all right for kids who cant afford a real motor car they wrangled cheerfully over the respective merits of english and american sports cars until they came to the westchester county toll and then fifteen minutes later they were out on the taconic parkway that snaked away northwards through a hundred miles of meadows and woodlands and bond settled back and silently enjoyed one of the most beautifully landscaped highways in the world and wondered idly what the girl was doing and how after saratoga he was to get to her again at they stopped for lunch at the chicken in the basket a logbuilt frontierstyle roadhouse with standard equipmenta tall counter covered with the bestknown proprietary brands of chocolates and candies cigarettes cigars magazines and paperbacks a juke box blazing with chromium and coloured lights that looked like something out of science fiction a dozen or more polished pine tables in the centre of the raftered room and as many low booths along the walls a menu featuring fried chicken and fresh mountain trout which had spent months in some distant deepfreeze and a variety of shortorder dishes and a couple of waitresses who couldnt care less but the scrambled eggs and sausages and hot buttered rye toast and the millers highlife beer came quickly and were good and so was the iced coffee that followed it and with their second glass they got away fromshop and their private lives and got on to saratoga eleven months of the year explained leiter the place is just dead people drift up to take the waters and the mud baths for their troubles rheumatism and such like and its like any other offseason spa anywhere in the world everybodys in bed by nine and the only signs of life in the daytime are when two old gentlemen in panama hats get to arguing about the surrender of burgoyne at schuylerville just down the road or about whether the marble floor of the old union hotel was black or white and then for one monthaugustthe place goes hogwild its probably the smartest racemeeting in america and the place crawls with vanderbilts and whitneys the rooming houses all multiply their prices by ten and the race track committee lick the old grandstand up with paint and somehow find some swans for the pond in the centre of the track and anchor the old indian canoe in the middle of the pond and turn up the fountain nobody can remember where the canoe came from and an american racing writer who tried to find out got as far as that it was something to do with an indian legend he said that when he heard that he didnt bother any more he said that when he was in fourth grade he could tell a better lie than any indian legend he ever heard bond laughed what else he said you ought to know about it yourself said leiter used to be a great place for the englishthe belted ones that is the jersey lily used to be around there a lot your lily langtry about the time novelty beat iron mask in the hopeful stakes but its changed a bit since the mauve decade here he pulled a cutting out of his pocket thisll bring you up to date cut it out of the post this morning this jimmy cannon is their sports columnist good writer knows what hes talking about read it in the car we ought to be moving leiter left some money on the check and they went out and while the studillac throbbed along the winding road towards troy bond settled himself down with jimmy cannons tough prose as he read the saratoga of the jersey lilys day vanished into the dusty sweet past and the twentieth century looked out at him from the piece of newsprint and bared its teeth in a sneer the village of saratoga springs was the coney island of the underworld until the kefauvers put their show on the television it frightened the hicks and chased the hoodlums to las vegas but the mobs exercised dominion over saratoga for a long time it was a colony of the national gangs and they ran it with pistols and baseball bats saratoga seceded from the union as did the other gambling hamlets that placed their municipal governments in the custody of the racket corporations it is still a place where the decent inheritors of old fortunes and famous names come to run their stables under racing conditions that are primitive and suggest a country fair meeting for quarter horses before saratoga closed down hitchhikers were thrown into the can by a constabulary that banked its pay checks and lived off the tips of murderers and panderers impoverishment was a serious violation of the law in saratoga drunks who got loaded at the bars of dice joints were also considered menaces when they tapped out but the killer was extended the liberty of the place as long as he paid off and held an interest in a local institution it could be a house of prostitution or a backroom crap game where the busted could shoot two bits professional curiosity compels me to read the literature of the scratch sheets the racing journalists call back the tranquil years as though saratoga was always a town of frivolous innocence what a rotten burg it used to be it is possible that there are bustout gaffs sneaking in farmhouses on back roads such action is insignificant and the player must be prepared to be knocked out as rapidly as the dealer can switch the dice but the gambling casinos of saratoga were never square and anyone who caught a hot hand was measured for a trimming the road houses ran through the night on the shores of the lake the big entertainers shilled for the games which were not financed to be beaten the stick men and the wheel turners were the nomadic hustlers who were paid by the day and travelled the gambling circuit from newport ky down to miami in the winter and back up to saratoga for august most of them were educated in steubenville o where the pennyante games were trade schools for the industry they were drifters and most of them had no talent for mussing up a welsher they were clerks of the underworld and they packed up and left as soon as any heat was turned their way most of them have settled down in las vegas and reno where their old bosses have taken charge with licences hanging on the walls their employers were not gamblers in the tradition of old col e r bradley who was a stately man of courteous deportment but there are those who tell me that his gambling bazaar at palm beach would go along with a mark until his score piled up too high then according to those who have gone against bradleys games mechanics took over and used any device that would keep the house solvent it delights those who recollect bradley when they read his canonization as a philanthropist whose hobby was giving the rich a little divertisement denied them by the state of florida but com pared to the lice who controlled saratoga col bradley is entitled to all the praise he gets in the remembrances of the sentimentalists the track at saratoga is a ramshackle pile of kindling wood and the climate is hot and humid there are some such as al vanderbilt and jock whitney who are sportsmen in the obsolete sense of the identification horseracing is their game and they are too good for it so are such trainers as bill winfrey who sent native dancer to the races there are jockeys who would bust you in the nose if you propositioned them to pull a horse they enjoy saratoga and they must be glad that the likes of lucky luciano are gone from the rube town that flourished because it allowed tough guys to fleece the dropins the bookmakers were yegged as they left the track in the era of the handbooks there was one called kid tatters who was relieved of in the parking lot the heist guys told him they intended to kidnap him if he didnt come up with more kid tatters knew lucky had a piece of most of the gambling spots and appealed to him to settle his trouble lucky said it was a simple matter no one would bother the bookie if he did as he was told kid tatters had a permit to book at the track and his reputation was clean but there was only one way he could protect himself make me your partner lucky informed him and the conversation was repeated for me by a man who was present no one would stick up a partner of lucky s kid tatters thought of himself as an honourable guy in business sanctioned by the state but he gave in and lucky was his partner until he died i asked a guy if lucky put up any money or worked for his end of the bookmakers profit all lucky did was collect the fellow said but in those days kid tatters made himself a good bargain he was never bothered again it was a stinking town but all gambling towns arc bond folded the cutting and put it in his pocket it certainly sounds a long way from lily langtry he said after a pause sure said leiter indifferently and jimmy cannon doesnt let on he knows the big boys are back again or their successors but nowadays theyre owners like our friends the spangs running their horses against the whitneys and the vanderbilts and x the woodwards and now and again putting over a fast fix like shy smile they aim to net fifty grand on that job and thats better than knocking off a bookie for a few cs sure some of the names have changed around saratoga sos the mud in the mud baths there a big road sign loomed up on the right it said stop at the sagamore airconditioned slumberite beds television five miles to saratoga springs and the sagamorefor gracious living that means we get our tooth glasses wrapped in individual paper bags and the lavatory seat sealed with a strip of sanitized paper commented leiter sourly and dont think you can steal those slumberite beds motels used to lose one most weeks now they screw them down shy smile the first thing that struck bond about saratoga was the green majesty of the elms which gave the discreet avenues of colonialtype clapboard houses some of the peace and serenity of a european watering place and there were horses everywhere being walked across the streets with a policeman holding up the traffic being coaxed out of horseboxes around the sprawling groups of stables cantering along the cinder borders of the roads and being led to work on the exercise track alongside the racecourse near the centre of the town stableboys and jockeys white negro and mexican hung about at the street corners and there was the whinny and the occasional trumpeting scream of horses in the air it was a mixture of newmarket and vichy and it suddenly occurred to bond that although he wasnt in the least interested in horses he rather liked the life that went with them leiter dropped him at the sagamore which was on the edge of the town and only half a mile from the racetrack and went off about his business they agreed to contact each other only at night or casually in the crowds at the races but to pay a dawn visit to the exercise track if shy smile was being given a last workout at sunrise the next day leiter said he would know about this and much mare after an evening around the stables and at the tether the allnight restaurant and bar that was the home of the racing underworld when they came up for the august meeting bond checked himself in at the central office of the sagamore signed james bond hotel astor new york before a hatchetfaced woman whose steelrimmed eyes assumed that bond like most of her other seekers after gracious living intended to steal the towels and possibly the sheets paid thirty dollars for three days and was given a key to room he carried his bag across the parched lawn between the beds of beauty bush and forced gladioli and let himself into the neat spare double room with the armchair the bedside table the currier and ives print the chest of drawers and the brown plastic ashtray that are standard motel equipment all over america the lavatory and shower were immaculate and neatly designed and as leiter had prophesied the tooth glasses were contained in paper bags fox your protection and the lavatory seat was barred by a strip of paper which said sanitized bond took a shower and changed and walked down the road and had two bourbon oldfashioneds and the chicken dinner at in the airconditioned eating house on the corner that was as typical ofthe american way of life as the motel then he returned to his room and lay on his bed with the saratogian from which he learned that a certain t bell would be riding shy smile in the perpetuities soon after ten felix leiter knocked softly on the door and limped in he smelled of liquor and cheap cigar smoke and looked pleased with himself made some progress he said he hooked the armchair up to the foot of the bed on which bond was lying he sat down and took out a cigarette means getting up damned early in the morning five oclock the word is theyll be timing shy smile over four furlongs at id like to see whos around when theyre doing that the owners given as pissaro one of the directors of the tiara happens to be called that hes another one with a joke name lamebrain pissaro used to be in charge of their dope racket ran the stuff over the mexican border and then broke it down and parcelled it out to middlemen on the coast the fbi got on to him and he did a term in san quentin then he came out and spang gave him the job at the tiara in exchange for the rap hed carried and now hes a racehorse owner like the vanderbilts nice going ill be interested to see what sort of shape hes in these days he was almost a mainliner in the days he was dealing in coke they gave him the cure in san q but its left him a bit soft in the head hence the lamebrain then theres the jock tingaling bell good rider but not above this sort of caper if the moneys right and hes in the clear i want to have a word with tingaling if i can get him alone ive got a little proposition for him the trainers another hoodlumname of budd rosy budd they all sound pretty funny these names but you dont want to be taken in by it hes from kentucky so he knows all about horses hes been in trouble all over the south what they call a little habitch as opposed to a big habitchhabitual criminal larceny mugging rapenothing big enough to give him quite a bulky packet in police records but for the last few years hes been running straight if you care to call it that as trainer for spang leiter flicked his cigarette accurately through the open window into a bed of gladioli he got up and stretched those are the actors in the order of their appearance he said distinguished cast look forward to lighting a fire under them bond was mystified but why dont you just turn them over to the stewards who are your principals in all this who pays the bills retained by the leading owners said leiter they pay us a retainer and extra by results and i wouldnt get far with the stewards wouldnt be fair to put the stableboy in the box be the death sentence for him the veterinary has passed the horse and the real shy smile was shot and burned months ago no ive got my own ideas and theyre going to hurt the spangled boys far more than a disbarment from the tracks youll see anyway five oclock and ill come and hammer on the door just in case dont worry said bond ill be on the doorstep with my boots and my saddle while the coyotes are still baying the moon bond woke on time and there was a wonderful freshness in the air as he followed the limping figure of leiter through the half light that filtered through the elms among the waking stables in the east the sky was pearly grey and iridescent like a toy balloon filled with cigarette smoke and among the shrubs the mocking birds were beginning their first song blue smoke rose straight up in the air from the fires in the camps behind the stables and there was a smell of coffee and woodsmoke and dew there was the clank of pails and the other small noises of men and horses in the early morning and as they moved out from under the trees to the white wooden rail that bordered the track a file of blanketed horses came by with a boy at each head holding the leading rein right up close to the bit and talking with soft roughness to their charges hey lazybones pick yo feet up giddap you sho aint no manowar dis mornin theyll be getting ready for the morning works said leiter the gallops this is the time the trainers hate most when the owners come they leant against the rail thinking about the early morning and about breakfast and the sun suddenly caught the trees half a mile away on the other side of the track and brushed the topmost branches with pale gold and in minutes the last shadows had gone and it was day as if they had been waiting for the sign three men appeared from among the trees away to the left and one of them was leading a big chestnut with a blaze face and four white stockings dont look at them said leiter softly turn your back on the track and watch that file of horses coming up that old bent man with them is sunny jim fitzsimmons greatest trainer in america and those are the woodward horses most of them will be winners this meeting just look casual and ill keep an eye on our friends wouldnt do to seem too interested now lets see theres a stableboy leading shy smile and thats budd all right and my old friend lamebrain in a beautiful lavender shirt always a dresser nicelooking horse powerful shoulders theyve taken the blanket off him and he doesnt like the cold bucking around like mad with the stableboy hanging on sure hope he doesnt kick mr pissaro in the face now budds got him and hes quietened down budds given the boy a leg up leading him on to the track now hes cantering slowly up the far side of the track to one of the furlong posts the hoodlums have got their watches out theyre looking round theyve spotted us just look casual james once the horse gets going they wont be interested in us yeah you can turn round now shy smiles on the far side of the track and theyve got their glasses on her to be ready for the off and it will be four furlongs pissaros just by the fifth post bond turned and looked along the rail to his left at the two stocky intent figures with the sun glinting on their glassesand on the watches in their hands and although he didnt believe in these people the dusk seerned to seep out around them from under the golden elms hes off far away bond could see a flying brown horse rounding the top end of the track and turning into the long stretch towards them at that distance not a sound came to them but quickly there was a soft drumming on the tan track that grew until with a swift thunder of hooves the horse rounded the bend in front of them right up against the far rails and hurtled on the last furlong towards the watching men a tingle of excitement ran down bonds spine as the chestnut flashed by its teeth bared and its eyes wild with the effort its gleaming quarters pounding and the breath snorting out of its wide nostrils the boyon its back arched like a cat in the stirrups his face low down and almost touching the horses neck and then they had gone in a spray of sound and upflung earth and bonds eyes moved to the two watching men now crouching and he saw the two arms jerk downwards as they jammed down the stops on their watches leiter touched him on the arm and they moved casually away and back under the trees towards the car moving dam well commented leiter betterthan the real shy smile ever did no idea what the time was but he was certainly burning up the track if he can do that for a mile and a quarter hell get home and hell have an allowance of six pounds seeing as how he hasnt won a race this year and thatll give him an extra edge now lets go and have the hell of a breakfast its given me an appetite seeing these crooks so early in the morning and then he added softly almost to himself and then im going to see how much master bell will take to ride foul and get himself disqualified after breakfast and after hearing some more of leiters plans bond idled away the morning and then had lunch at the track and watched the indifferent racing that leiter had warned him he would see on the first afternoon of the meeting but it was a beautiful day and bond enjoyed absorbing the saratoga idiom the mixture of brooklyn and kentucky in the milling crowds the elegance of the owners and their friends in the treeshaded paddock the efficient mechanics of the parimutuel and the big board with its flashing lights recording the odds and the money invested the troublefree starts through the tractordrawn startinggate the toy lake with its six swans and the anchored canoe and everywhere that extra exotic touch of the negroes who except as jockeys are so much a part of american racing the organization looked better than in england there seemed less chance of crookedness where so much crookedness had been insured against but back of it all bond knew that the illegal wire services were relaying the results of each race throughout the states cutting the tote odds to a maximum of twentys for a win eights for first or second and fours for a place and that millions of dollars every year were going straight into the pockets of gangsters to whom racing was just another source of revenue like prostitution or drugs bond tried out the system made famous by chicago obrien he backed every firm favourite for a place or to show as his first tickethatch told him to call it and he had somehow made fifteen dollars and some cents by the end of the eighth race and the days meeting he walked home with the crowds had a shower and some sleep and then found his way to a restaurant near the sales ring and spent an hour drinking the drink that leiter had told him was fashionable in racing circlesbourbon and branchwater bond guessed that in fact the water was from the tap behind the bar but leiter had said that real bourbon drinkers insist on having their whisky in the traditional style with water from high up in the branch of the local river where it will be purest the barman didnt seem surprised when he asked for it and bond was amused at the conceit then he ate an adequate steak and after a final bourbon walked over to the sales ring which leiter had fixed as a rendezvous it was a whitepainted wooden enclosure roofed but without walls in which tiered benches descended to a circle of mock greensward enclosed with silverpainted ropes in front of the auctioneers platform as each horse was led in under the glare of the neon lighting the auctioneer the redoubtable swinebroad from tennessee would give the history of the horse and start the bidding at what he thought a likely figure and run it up through the hundreds in a kind of rhythmic chant catching with the help of two dinnerrjacketed men in the aisles every nod or raised pencil among the tiers of smartly dressed owners and agents bond sat down behind a scrawny woman in evening dress and mink whose wrists clanked and glittered with jewellery every time she bid beside her sat a bored man in a white dinner jacket and a dark red evening tie who might have been her husband or her trainer a nervous bay came chassying into the ring with the number pasted carelessly on his rump the harsh chant began im bid six thousand now seven thousand will yer im bid seven thousand and three and four and five only seven and a half for this goodlooking colt by tehran eight thousand thank you sir and nine will yer do it eight thousand five hundred i am bid will yer give me nine eight five will yer give me nine and six and seven and wholl bid the big figure a pause a bang of the hammer a look of sincere reproach towards the ringside seats where the big money sat folks this twoyearold is too cheap im selling more winning colt for this amount of money than ive sold all summer long now eight thousand seven hundred and wholl give me nine wheres nine nine nine and nine thousand is bid nine wilt yer give me ten will yer do it any increase on nine thousand do i hear nine one nine one nine one sold for nine thousand dollars thank you maam and the heads turned round and craned and the woman looked bored and said something to the man beside her who shrugged his shoulders and a bay colt was led from the ring and came sidling in to stand for a moment trembling with the shock of the lights and the wall of unknown faces and the fog of strange smells and there was a movement in the row of seats behind bond and leiters face came forward alongside his and leiters mouth said into his ear its done its cost three thousand bucks but hell play the doublecross foul riding in the last furlong just as hes due to make his winning sprint oh boy see you in the morning and the whisper ended and bond didnt look round but went on watching the sales for a while and then slowly walked home under the elms feeling sorry for a jockey called tingaling bell who was playing such a desperately dangerous game and for a big chestnut called shy smile who was now not only a ringer but was going to be ridden foul into the bargain the perpetuities bond sat high up in the grandstand and through hired glasses watched shy smiles owner eating softshell crabs the gangster was sitting in the restaurant enclosure four rows below bond opposite him sat rosy budd forking down frankfurters and sauerkraut and drinking beer out of a stein although most of the other luncheon tables were occupied there were two waiters hovering round this one and the maitre dhotel made frequent visits to see that all was going well pissaro looked like a gangster in a horror comic he had a round bladderlike head in the middle of which the features were crowded togethertwo pinpoint eyes two black nostrils a pursed wet pink mouth above the hint of a chin and a fat body in a brown suit and a white shirt with a longpointed collar and a figured chocolate bow tie he paid no attention to the preparations for the first race but concentrated on his food occasionally glancing across at his companions plate as if he might reach across and fork something off it for himself rosy budd was broad and hardlooking with a square immobile poker players face in which pale eyes were buried deep under thin fair eyebrows he was wearing a striped seersucker suit and a dark blue tie he ate slowly and rarely looked up from his plate when he had finished he picked up a race programme and studied it turning over the pages carefully without looking up he gave a curt shake of the head when the maitre dhotel offered him the menu pissaro picked his teeth until a mound of ice cream arrived and then he bent his head again and started spooning the ice cream rapidly up into his small mouth through his glasses bond examined the two men and wondered about them what did these people amount to bond remembered cold dedicated chessplaying russians brilliant neurotic germans silent deadly anonymous men from cen tral europe the people in his own servicethe doublefirsts the gay soldiers of fortune the men who counted life well lost for a thousand a year compared with such men bond decided these people were just teenage pillowfantasies the results went up for the third race and now there was only half an hour to go before the perpetuities bond put down his glasses and picked up his programme waiting for the big board on the other side of the track to start flickering as the money went on the tote and the odds began to move he took a final look at the details second day august said the programme the perpetuities stakes added nd running for threeyearolds by subscription of each to accompany the nomination starters to pay additional with the added of which to second to third and to fourth a trophy to be presented to the owner of the winner one mile and a quarter and then the list of twelve horses with owners trainers and jockeys and the morning line forecast of the odds the joint favourites noi mr c v whitneys come again and no mr william woodwards pray action were both forecast at six to four on mr p pissaros shy smile trainer r budd jockey t bell was forecast at to i the bottom horse in the betting his number was bond turned his glasses on the restaurant enclosure the two men had gone bonds eyes followed on across the track to where the lights were flashing on the big board the favourite was now no at to i on come again had gone out to evens shy smile was quoted at to i but he went down tos as bond watched the board another quarter of an hour to go bond sat back and lit a cigarette gong over again in his mind what leiter had told him wondering if it was going to work leiter had tracked the jockey down to his rooming house and had flashed his private detectives licence at him and then he had quite calmly blackmailed him into throwing the race if shy smile won leiter would go to the stewards expose the ringer and tingaling bell would never ride again but there was one chance for the jockey to save himself if he took it leiter promised to say nothing about the ringer shy smile must win the race but be disqualified this could be achieved if in the final sprint the jockey interfered with the running of the horse closest to him so that it could be shown that he had prevented this other horse from being the winner then there would be an objection which had to be upheld it would be easy for bell at the last corner before the run in to do this in such a way that he could argue to his employers that it had just been a bit of overkeen riding that another horse had crowded him over to the left that his horse had stumbled there was no conceivable reason why he should not wish to win and it was just one of those strokes of bad luck that happen in racing and leiter would now give tingaling and there would be another ofor him if he did what he was told and bell had bought it without any hesitation and he had asked for the to be passed to him after the days racing in the acme mud and sulphur baths where he went every evening to take a mud bath to keep his weight down six oclock and leiter had promised that this would be done and bond now had the in his pocket and he had reluctantly agreed to help leiter out by going to the acme baths to make the payoff if shy smile failed to win the race would it work bond picked up his glasses and swept them round the course he noted the four thick posts at the quarter miles that held the automatic cameras that recorded the whole race and whose film was available to the stewards within minutes of each finish it was this last one near the winning post whose eye would see and record all that happened at the final bend bond felt a tingle of excitement five minutes to go and the startinggate was being pulled into position a hundred yards up to his left once round the course plus an extra furlong and the winning post was just below him he put his glasses on the big board no change in the favourites or in shy smiles price and now here came the horses cantering easily down to the start first came noi come again the second favourite a big black horse carrying the light blue and brown colours of the whitney stable and there was a cheer for the favourite pray action a fastlooking grey carrying the woodward white with red spots of the famous belair stud and at the tail of the field there was the big chestnut with the blaze face and four white stockings and the palefaced jockey wearing a jacket of lavender silk with a big black diamond on chest and back the horse moved so well that bond glanced across at the board and was not surprised to see his price come quickly back to then is bond went on watching the board in a minute the big money would go on and the price would come down with a run the loudspeaker was announcing the race away to the left the horses were being marshalled behind the startinggate ping ping ping the lights opposite noio on the board started to wink and flash u and finally to i then the lights stopped talking and the tote was closed and how many more thousands had gone away by western union to harmless telegraphic addresses in detroit chicago new york miami san francisco and a dozen more offthecourse books throughout the states a handbell clanged sharply there was an electric smell in the air and a muting of the noise of the crowds then down thundered the ragged charging line towards the grandstand and past and away in a scud of hooves and flying eardi and tanbark there was a glimpse of sharp pale faces halfhidden by goggles a stream of pounding shoulders and hindquarters a flash of wild white eyes and a confusion of numbers amongst which bond caught only the vital noio well to the fore and close in to the rails and then the dust was settling and the brownblack mass was at the first corner and slowly streaming round the bottom straight and bond felt the glasses slip in the sweat round his eyes no a black outsider was leading by a length was this some unknown horse that was going to steal the show but then there was no level with him and then no and no half a length behind the leaders just these four out in front and the rest bunched three lengths away round the corner and now no was in the lead the whitney black and no was fourth down the long straight opposite and no was moving upwith tingaling bell on the chestnut at his heels they both passed no and were well up with no who was still leading by half a length and then the first top bend and the top straight and no was leading with shy smile second and no a length behind and shy smile was coming up level with the leader he was level and they were coming into the final corner bond held his breath now now he could almost hear the whirr of the concealed camera in the big white post no was ahead right on the bend but no was inside on the rails and the crowd was howling for the favourite now bell was inching towards the grey his head well down on his horses neck on the outside so that he could pretend that he couldnt see the grey horse on the rails inch by inch the horses drew closer and suddenly shy smiles head hid nos head then his quarters were in front and yes pray actions boy suddenly stood right up in his stirrups forced to takeup by the foul and at once shy smile was a length ahead there was an angry roar from the crowd bond lowered his glasses and sat back and watched as the foamflecked chestnut thundered past the post below him with pray action five lengths behind and come again just failing to beat him into second place not bad thought bond as the crowd howled around him not bad at all and how brilliantly the jockey had done it his head so well down that even pissaro would have to admit bell couldnt see the other horse the natural curvein for the final straight the head still well down as he passed the post and the whip flailing for the last few lengths as if tingaling still thought himself only half a length ahead of no bond watched for the results to be posted there was a chorus of whistles and catcalls no shy smile five lengths no pray action length no come again three lengths no pirandello three lengths and the horses came cantering back for the weighingin and the crowd yelled for blood as tingaling bell grinning all over his face threw his whip to the valet and slipped off the sweating chestnut and carried his saddle to the scales and then there was a great burst of cheering opposite the name of shy smile the word objection white on black had been slipped in and the loudspeaker was saying attention please in this race there has been an objection lodged by jockey t lucky on no pray action against the riding of jockey t bell on no shy smile do not destroy your tickets i repeat do not destroy your tickets bond took out his handkerchief and wiped his hands he could imagine the scene in the projection room behind the judges box now they would be examining the film bell would be standing there looking hurt and beside him nos jockey looking still more hurt would the owners be there would the sweat be running down pissaros fat jowls into his collar would some of the other owners be there pale and angry and then came the loudspeaker again and the voice saying attention please in this race no shy smile has been disqualified and no pray action has been declared the winner the result is now official amidst the thunder of the crowd bond got stiffly up from his seat and walked off in the direction of the bar and now for the payoff perhaps a bourbon and branchwater would give him some ideas about getting the money to tingaling bell he was uneasy about it and yet the acme baths sounded an easy enough place nobody knew him in saratoga but after that he would have to stop working for pinkertons call up shady tree and complain about not getting his five thousand worry him about his own payoff it had been fun helping leiter push these people around next would come bonds turn he pushed his way into the crowded bar acme mud and sulphur in the small red bus there was only a negress with a withered arm and beside the driver a girl who kept her sick hands out of sight and whose head was completely shrouded in a thick black veil which fell to her shoulders like a beekeepers hat without touching the skin of her face the bus which said acme mud and sulphur baths on its sides and every hour on the hour above the windscreen went through the town without picking up any more customers and turned off the main road down a badly maintained gravel track through a plantation of young firs after half a mile it rounded a corner and went down a short hill towards a cluster of dingy grey clapboard buildings a tall yellowbrick chimney stuck up out of the centre of the buildings and from it a thin wisp of black smoke rose straight up into the still air there was no sign of life in front of the baths but as the bus pulled up on the weedy gravel patch near what seemed to be the entrance two old men and a limping coloured woman emerged through the wirescreened doors at the top of the steps and waited for the passengers to alight outside the bus the smell of sulphur hit bond with sickening force it was a horrible smell from somewhere down in the stomach of the world bond moved away from the entrance and sat down on a rough bench under a group of deadlooking firs he sat there for a few minutes to steel himself for what was going to happen to him through the screen doors and to shake off his sense of oppression and disgust it was partly he decided the reaction of a healthy body to the contact with disease and it was partly the tall grim belsen chimney with its plume of innocent smoke but most of all it was the prospect of going in through those doors buying the ticket and then stripping his clean body and giving it over to the nameless things they did in this grisly ramshackle establishment the bus rattled off and he was alone it was absolutely quiet bond noticed that the two side windows and the entrance door made two eyes and a mouth the place seemed to be looking at him watching him waiting for him would he come in would they have him bond moved impatiently inside his clothes he got to his feet and walked straight across the gravel and up the wooden steps and the frame doors banged to behind him he found himself in a dingy reception room the sulphur fumes were stronger there was a reception desk behind an iron grill framed testimonials hung on the walls some of them with red paper seals below the signature and there was a glassfronted showcase full of packages in transparent wrapping above it a notice said in badly handwritten capitals take home an acmepak treat yourself in privacy there was a list of prices pasted on to a card advertising a cheap deodorant the slogan still showed it said let your armpits be your charmpits a faded woman with a screw of orange hair above a face like a sad creampuff raised her head slowly and looked at him through the bars keeping one ringer on her place in true love stones can i help you it was the voice reserved for strangers for people who didnt know the ropes bond looked through the bars with the cautious abhorrence she had expected id like a bath mud or sulphur she reached for the tickets with her free hand mud would you care for a book of tickets theyre cheaper just one please dollarfifty she pushed through a mauve ticket and kept a finger on it until bond had put his money down which way do i go right she said follow the passage better leave your valuables she slipped a large white envelope under the grill write your name on it she watched sideways as bond put his watch and the contents of his pockets into the envelope and scribbled his name on it the twenty hundreddollar bills were inside bonds shirt he wondered about them he pushed the envelope back thank you youre welcome there was a low wicket at the back of the room and two whitepainted wooden hands whose drooping index fingers pointed right and left on one hand was written mud and on the other sulphur bond went through the wicket and turned to the right along a dank corridor with a cement floor which sloped downwards he followed it and pushed through a swing door at the end and found himself in a long high room with a skylight in the roof and cabins along the walls it was hot and steamy and sulphurous in the room two youngish softlooking men naked except for grey towels round their waists were playing gin rummy at a deal table near the entrance on the table were two ashtrays full of cigarette butts and a kitchen plate piled with keys the men looked up as bond entered and one of them picked up a key from the plate and held it out bond walked over and took it twelve said the man got ya ticket bond handed it over and the man made a gesture towards the cabins behind him he jerked his head towards a door at the end of the room baths through there the two men went back to their game there was nothing in the frowzy cabin but a folded towel from which constant washing had removed all the nap bond undressed and tied the towel round his waist he folded the bulky packet of notes and stuffed them into the breast pocket of his coat under his handkerchief he hoped it would be the last place that a petty thief would look in a quick search he hung up his gun in the shoulder holster on a prominent hook and walked out and locked the door behind him bond had no idea what he would see through the door at the end of the room his first reaction was that he had walked into a morgue before he could collect his impressions a fat bald negro with a downturned straggling moustache came over and looked him up and down whats wrong with you mister he asked indifferently nothing said bond shortly just want to try a mud bath okay said the negro any heart trouble no okay over here bond followed the negro across the slippery concrete floor to a wooden bench alongside a pair of dilapidated shower cubicles in one of which a naked body hung with mud was being hosed down by a man with a cauliflower ear be right with you said the negro casually his big feet slapping against the wet floor as he sauntered off about his business bond watched the huge rubbery man and his skin cringed at the thought of putting his body into the dangling pudgy hands with their lined pink palms bond had a natural affection for coloured people but he reflected how lucky england was compared with america where you had to live with the colour problem from your schooldays up he smiled as he remembered something felix leiter had said to him on their last assignment together in america bond had referred to mr big the famous harlem criminal asthat damned nigger leiter had picked him up careful now james he had said people are so dam sensitive about colour around here that you cant even ask a barman for a jigger of rum you have to ask for a jegro the memory of leiters wisecrack cheered bond up he took his eyes off the negro and looked over the rest of the acme mud bath it was a square grey concrete room from the ceiling four naked electric light bulbs spotted with fly droppings threw an ugly glare on the dripping walls and floor against the walls were trestle tables bond automatically counted them twenty on each table was a heavy wooden coffin with a threequarter lid in most of the coffins the profile of a sweating face showed above the wooden sides and pointed up at the ceiling a few eyes were rolled inquisitively towards bond but most of the congested red faces looked asleep one coffin stood open its lid up against the wall and its side hinged down this seemed to be the one destined for bond the negro was draping a heavy uncleanlooking sheet over it and smoothing it down to form a lining to the box when he had finished he went to the middle of the room and chose two from a line of pails filled to the top with steaming dark brown mud and dropped them with a double clang beside the open box then he dug his huge hand into one of them and smeared the thick viscous stuff along the bottom of the shroud and went on doing this until the whole bottom of it was two inches thick with mud he then left itto cool bond supposedand went to a dented hipbath full of ice blocks and groped around and extracted several dripping hand towels he put these over his arm and made a round of the occupied coffins stopping every now and then to wrap a cool towel round the sweating forehead of one of the occupants nothing else was happening and the room was quite silent except for the hiss of the hose close to bond this stopped and a voice said all right mr weiss that should fix you for today and a fat naked man with a great deal of black bodyhair tottered weakly out of the shower cubicle and waited while the man with the cauliflower ear helped him into a terrycloth bath robe gave him a quick rub down inside it and led him to the door through which bond had come then the man with the cauliflower ear walked over to a door in the far corner of the room and went out for a few moments light streamed through the door and bond saw grass outside and a blessed glimpse of blue sky and then the man came back with two more steaming buckets of mud he kicked the door shut behind him and added to the line of buckets in the middle of the room the negro went over to bonds coffin and touched the mud with the flat of his hand he turned and beckoned to bond okay mister he said bond walked over and the man took his towel and hung his key on a hook above the box bond stood naked in front of him you ever had one of these before no thought mebbe not so im giving you the mud at no if youre acclimated you can take or even lie down there bond gingerly climbed into the box and lay down his skin smarting at its first contact with the hot mud he slowly stretched himself out full length and lowered his head on to the clean towel that had been placed over the kapok pillow when he was settled the negro dug both hands into one of the buckets of fresh mud and proceeded to slap it all over bonds body the mud was a deep chocolate brown and it felt smooth and heavy and slimy a smell of hot peat came up to bonds nostrils he watched the shining blubbery arms of the negro working over the obscene black mound that had once been his body had felix leiter known what this was going to be like bond grinned savagely at the ceiling if this was one of felixs jokes at last the negro had finished and bond was loaded with hot mud only his face and an area round his heart were still white he felt stifled and the sweat began to pour down his forehead with a swift movement the negro bent down and picked up the edges of the sheet and wrapped them tightly round bonds body and his arms then he reached up for the other half of the dirty shroud and bound this also round him bond could just move his fingers and his head but otherwise he had less freedom of movement than in a strait jacket then the man closed the open side of the coffin lowered the heavy wooden lid and that was that the negro took a slate down from the wall above bonds head and glanced at a clock high up on thefar wall and scribbled the time down it was just six oclock twenty minutes he said feel good bond gave a neutral grunt the negro moved away about his business and bond stared dumbly up at the ceiling he felt the sweat running down from his hair into his eyes he cursed felix leiter at three minutes past six the door opened to admit the naked scrawny figure of tingaling bell he had a sharp weasely face and a miserable body on which each bone showed he walked cockily into the middle of the room hi tingaling said the man with the cauliflower ear heard you had some trouble today too bad them stewards is a heap of obscenity said tingaling sourly why would i want to ride across tommy lucky one of my best pals and why would i need to the race was sewn up hey you black bastard he put out his foot to trip up the negro who was passing with a pail of mud you got to get six ounces off me just had me a plate of french fries on top of that theyve given me a heap of lead to carry in the oakridge tomorrow the negro stepped over the outstretched foot and chuckled fatly dont worry baby he said affectionately ah kin always break yo arm off get yo weight down easy dat way be right with you the door opened again and one of the card players put his head in hey boxer he said to the man with the cauliflower ear mabel says she cant get on to the delicatessen to order your chow phones busted line down or sumpn aw cheesus said the other tell jack to bring it on his next ride okay the door closed a telephone breakdown in america is a rare thing and this was the moment when a small danger signal might have shrilled in bonds mind but it didnt instead he looked at the clock another ten minutes in the mud the negro sauntered across with the cold towels over his arm and wrapped one round bonds hair and forehead it was a delicious relief and bond had a moment of thinking that perhaps the whole business was just supportable the seconds ticked by the jockey with a crackle of obscenities lowered himself into the box directly in front of bond and bond guessed that he was being given the mud at degrees he was wound up in the shroud and the lid was banged shut over him the negro wrote on the jockeys slate bond closed his eyes and wondered how he was going to slip the man his money in the restroom after the bath there was presumably somewhere one went to lie down after all this or in the passage on the way out or in the bus no better not in the bus better not be seen with him all right nobody move now just take it easy and no onell get hurt it was a hard deadly voice that meant business bonds eyes snapped open and his body tingled at the reek of danger that had come into the room the door to the outside the door through which the mud came was standing open a man stood in the opening and another man was advancing into the middle of the room they both had guns in their hands and they both had black hoods over their heads with holes cut for the eyes and mouth there was silence in the room except for the sound of water falling in the shower cubicles each cubicle contained a naked man they peered out into the room through the veil of water their mouths gulping for air and the hair streaming into their eyes the man with the cauliflower ear was a motionless pillar his eyes shifted whitely and the hose in his hand poured water over his feet the moving man with the gun was now in the middle of the floor by the steaming pails of mud he stopped in front of the negro who was standing with a full bucket in each hand the negro quivered slightly so that the handle on one of the buckets gave out a slight rattle while the man with the gun held the negros eyes in his bond saw him turn the gun round in his hand so that he was holding it by the barrel suddenly with a backhanded blow that had all his shoulder behind it he lashed the butt of the revolver into the centre of the negros huge belly there was only a sharp wet slap from the blow but the buckets crashed to the floor as the negros two hands leapt up and clutched at himself he let out a soft moan and sagged forward on to his knees his glistening shaven head bowing down almost to the mans shoes so that he appeared to be worshipping him the man drew back a foot wheres the jock he said menacingly bell which box the negros right arm shot out the man with the gun brought his foot down he turned and walked across to where bond was lying toe to head with tingaling bell he came up and looked first down at bonds face he seemed to stiffen two glittering eyes looked down through the diamond slits in the black hood then the man moved to the left and stood over the jockey for a moment he stood motionless then he took a quick jump and hoisted himself up so that he was sitting on the lid of tinga lings box looking down into his eyes well well damifitaint tingaling bell there was a ghasdy friendliness in his voice whatsamatter the jockeys voice was shrill and terrified why tingaling the man was reasonable what would be the matter got anything on your mind the jockey gulped mebbe you never heard of a horse called shy smile tingaling mebbe you werent there when he was rode foul at around this afternoon the voice ended on a hard edge the jockey started to cry softly jeesus boss that werent my fault happen to anybody it was the whimper of a child who is going to be punished bond winced my friends figure it may have been a doublecross the man was leaning close over the jockey and his voice was gaining heat my friends figure a jock like you could only done something like that intentional my friends looked over your room and found a grand plugged away in a lamp socket my friends wish me to inquire where that lettuce come from the sharp slap and the shrill cry were simultaneous give you bastard or ill blow your brains out bond heard the click of the hammer going back a stammering scream came out of the box my wad all i got hid it away in the lamp my wad i swear it christ you gotta believe me you gotta the voice sobbed and implored the man gave a disgusted grunt and lifted his gun so that it came into bonds line of vision a thumb with a big angry wart on the first joint eased the hammer back the man slipped down off the box he looked into the jockeys face and his voice went slimy you been riding too much lately tingaling he almost whispered youre in bad shape need a rest plenty of quiet like in a sanitarium or sumpn the man slowly moved back across the floor he went on talking quietly and solicitously now he was out of the jockeys line of vision bond saw him reach down and pick up one of the steaming buckets of mud the man came back holding the bucket low still talking still reassuring he came up to the jockeys box and looked down bond stiffened and felt the mud stir heavily on his skin like i said tingaling plenty of quiet nothing to eat for a whiles nice shady room with the drapes drawn to keep out the light the soft voice droned on in the dead silence slowly the arm came up higher higher and then the jockey could see the bucket and he knew what was going to happen and he started moaning no no no no no although it was hot in the room the black stuff steamed as it poured sluggishly out of the bucket the man stepped swiftly aside and hurled the empty bucket at the man with the cauliflower ear who stood still and let it hit him then he moved fast across the room to where the other man with the gun stood near the door he turned no funny business no cops phones busted he gave a harsh laugh better dig the guy out before his eyeballs fry the door banged and there was silence except for a bubbling sound and the noise of the water gushing in the shower we dont like mistakes then what happened leiter was sitting in bonds chair in the motel and bond was pacing up and down the room stopping every now and then to take a drink from the glass of whisky and water by the bed bloody chaos said bond everybody yammering to be let out of his box and the man with the cauliflower ear hosing the stuff off tingalings face and shouting for help to the two men in the next room the negro moaning on the floor and the naked guys from the showers teetering about like chickens with their heads cut off the two cardplaying men came busting in and they took the lid off tingalings box and unwrapped him and carried him under the shower i guess he was nearly gone half suffocated whole face puffed up with the burns ghastly sight then one of the naked men pulled himself together and went round opening the boxes and letting the people out and then there we were twenty men covered with mud and only one shower to spare it gradually got sorted out one of the help went off to drive into town for an ambulance someone poured some water over the negro and he gradually came to life without seeming too interested i tried to find out if anyone had any idea who the two gunmen were no one had a clue it was thought they were from an outoftown mob nobody cared now that no one had got hurt except the jockey all they wanted to do was get the mud off themselves and get the hell out of there bond took another swallow of whisky and lit a cigarette was there anything that struck you about these two guys asked leiter height clothes anything else i couldnt see much of the man by the door said bond he was smaller than the other and thinner wearing dark trousers and a grey shirt with no tie gun looked like a might have been a colt the other man the one who did the job was a big fattish guy quick moving but deliberate black trousers brown shirt with white stripes no coat or tie black shoes neat expensive police positive no wristwatch oh yes bond suddenly remembered he had a wart on the top joint of his right thumb redlooking as if he had sucked it wint said leiter flatly and the other guy was kidd always work together theyre the top torpedoes for the spangs wint is a mean bastard a real sadist likes it hes always sucking at that wart on his thumb hes called windy not to his face that is all these guys have crazy names wint cant bear to travel gets sick in cars and trains and thinks planes are death traps has to be paid a special bonus if theres a job that means moving around the country but hes cool enough when his feet are on the ground kidds a pretty boy his friends call him boofy probably shacks up with wint some of these homos make the worst killers kidds got white hair although hes only thirty thats one of the reasons they like to work in hoods but one day that fellow wint is going to be sorry he didnt have that wart burned away i thought of him as soon as you mentioned it guess ill get along to the cops and tip them off wont mention you of course but ill give them the lowdown on shy smile and they can work it out for themselves wint and his friendll be taking a train in albany by now but no harm in getting some heat on leiter turned at the door take it easy james be back in an hour and well go and get ourselves a good dinner ill find out where theyve taken tingaling and well mail the dough to him there might cheer him up a bit the poor little bastard be seeing you bond stripped and spent ten minutes under the shower lathering himself all over and washing his hair to get rid of the last filthy memory of the acme baths then he dressed in trousers and shirt and went over to the telephone booth in the reception hall and put in a call to shady tree the line is busy sir chanted the operator will i keep the call in yes please said bond relieved that the hunchback was still in his office and that now he would be able to say truthfully that he had tried to get through earlier he had an impression that shady might be wondering why he hadnt called up to complain about shy smile after seeing what had happened to the jockey bond was more inclined to treat the spangled mob with respect the telephone gave the dry muted burr that serves for a ring on the american system were you wanting wisconsin yes i have your party now sir go ahead new york and the high thin voice of the hunchback yes whos calling james bond i tried to reach you earlier yes shy smile didnt pay off i know the jockey bitched it so what money said bond there was silence at the other end then okay we start again ill wire you a grand the grand you won off of me remember yes stand by the phone ill call you back in a few minutes and tell you what to do with it where you staying bond told him okay youll get the money in the morning be calling you shortly the phone went dead bond walked over to the reception counter and glanced over the rack of paperbacks he was amused and rather impressed by the meticulous accounting of these people and the care they took to have each step of their operations protected by a legitimate cover plan they were right of course where would he an englishman be able to get except by gambling and what would the next gamble be the telephone crooked a mechanical finger at him and he went into the box and closed the door and picked up the receiver that you bond now listen carefully youre to get it at las vegas come down to new york and pick up a plane charge the ticket to me ill okay it through service to los angeles and theres a local plane every half hour to vegas you have a reservation at the tiara find your way around andnow listen to this carefullyat just five after ten on thursday evening go to the centre of the three blackjack tables at the tiara on the side of the room near the bar got that yes sit down and play the maximum thats a grand five times then get up and quit the table and dont gamble any more dyou hear me yes your check is paid at the tiara after the game hang around and wait for further instructions got that repeat bond did so check said the hunchback dont talk and dont make a mistake we dont like mistakes youll find that when you read tomorrows paper there was a soft click bond put down the receiver and walked thoughtfully across the lawn to his room blackjack the old of childhood days it brought back memories of big teas in other childrens playrooms of grownups counting out the coloured bone counters in piles so that each child had a shillings worth the excitement of turning up a ten and an ace and being paid double the thrill of that fifth card when one already had seventeen and wanted a four or less for five and under and now he was going to play the nursery game again only this time the dealer would be a crook and the coloured counters of his bet would be worth ј on each hand he had grown up and now this would be a real grownup game bond lay down on his bed and stared at the ceiling as he waited for felix leiter his mind was already reaching ahead to the famous gambling town wondering what it was going to be like wondering how much he would be able to see of tiffany case five cigarette ends had piled up in the plastic ashtray before he heard leiters limping step on the gravel path outside they walked across the lawn together to the studillac and as they drove down the avenue leiter brought him up to date the spangled boys had all checked outpissaro budd wint kidd even shy smile was already off on the first leg of his long journey by horsebox right across the continent to the ranch in nevada the fbi are on the case now said leiter but it will only be one more short story in their collected works of spang without you as a witness nobodys going to have any idea who the two gunmen were and id be surprised if the fbi get very worked up about pissaro and his horse theyll leave that to me and my outfit ive talked to head office and theyve told me to get out to vegas and somehow find out where the remains of the real shy smile are buried ive got to lay my hands on his teeth how dya like that before bond had time to comment they had drawn up outside the pavilion the only smart restaurant in saratoga they got out and left the car to be parked by the doorman its good that we can have a meal together again said leiter youve never eaten broiled maine lobster with melted butter like they do it here but it wouldnt taste so good if there was a chance that one of the spang boys might be munching spaghetti with caruso sauce at the next table it was late and most of the diners had finished their meal and gone off to the sales ring they had a corner table to themselves and leiter told the head waiter not to hurry with the lobsters but to bring two very dry martinis made with cresta blanca vermouth so youre going to las vegas said bond funny coincidence department he told leiter about his conversation with shady tree sure said leiter no coincidence about it were both travelling bad roads and all bad roads lead to the bad town ive got some cleaning up to do here in saratoga first and a pile of reports to write thats half my life with pinkertons writing reports but ill be over in vegas before the end of the week sniffing around shant be able to see much of you right under the spang nose but maybe we could meet up from time to time

all the dirt where the big fixes are whos in town from the outside mobs he even knows where you can find the onearmed bandits that pay the best percentages and the slots that pay best is the most valuable secret on the whole goddam strip and boy youve seen nothing until youve seen that strip five solid miles of gambling joints neon lighting that makes broadway look like a kids christmas tree monte carlo letter snorted steamage stuff bond smiled how many zeros have they got on the roulette two i guess theres your answer at least we play against the right percentage in europe you can have your neon lighting the other zero keeps it alight maybebut the craps only pay justover one per cent to the house and thats our national game i know said bond baby needs a new pair of shoes all that sort of kids talk id like to hear the banker for the greek syndicate whining baby needs a new pair of shoes when hes already got one nine against him at the high table and there are ten million francs on each tableau letter laughed hell he said youve got it easy with this crooked playoff at the blackjack table youll be able to swank around back in london and tell the story of how you took em at the tiara leiter took a pull at his whisky and sat back in his chair but i better give you some of the background to the games just in case you get it into your mind to stake your pennies against their pot of gold go ahead and i mean pot of gold continued leiter you see james the whole state of nevada which so far as the public cares consists of reno and las vegas is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow the answer to the public dream of something for nothing is to be picked up for the price of your plane fare on the strip at las vegas or on the main stem at reno and it really is there not so long ago when the stars and the dice were right a young gi made twentyeight straight passes at a crap table in the desert inn twentyeight if hed started with a dollar and been allowed to let it ride over the house limits which knowing mr wilbur clark at the inn i guess he might not have been he would have made two hundred and fifty million dollars of course he didnt let it ride sidebetters made a hundred and fifty thousand dollars the gi made seven hundred and fifty dollars and took to his heels as if the devil was after him they never even got his name today that pair of red dice is on a satin pillow in a glass case in the desert inn casino must have been good publicity betcha life said leiter all the ad men in the world couldnt have dreamed it up it made the wishingwell dream come trueand you wait till you see them wishing in those casinos in just one of them they use up eighty pairs of dice every twentyfour hours a hundred and twenty packs of plastic cards fifty slot machines go to the garage every day at dawn and wait till you see the little old ladies in gloves working those slots they have shopping baskets to carry their nickels and dimes and quarters they work those slots ten twenty hours a day without going to the restroom you dont believe me you know why they wear those gloves to stop their hands bleeding bond grunted noncommittally all right all right agreed leiter sure these people collapse hysteria heart attacks apoplexy the cherries and plums and bells climb through their eyes into their brains but all the casinos have house physicians on twentyfourhour call and the little old women just get carried out screaming jackpot jackpot jackpot as if it was the name of a dead lover and take a look at the bingo parlours and the wheels of fortune and the banks of slots downtown in the golden nugget and the horseshoe but dont you go and get the fever and forget your job and your girl and even your kidneys i happen to know the basic odds at all the games and i know how you like to gamble so do me a favour and get them into your thick head now you take them down bond was interested he took out a pencil and tore a strip off the menu card leiter looked at the ceiling per cent in favour of the house of craps per cent at blackjackhe looked down at bond except at your game you crook per cent at roulette up to per cent at bingo and the wheel of fortune and per cent at the slots not bad for the house hn every year eleven million customers play mr spang and his friends at those odds take two hundred dollars as an average suckers capital and you can work out for yourself how much stays in vegas over a years play bond put the pencil and the piece of paper away in his pocket thanks for the documentation felix but you seem to forget that i am not going to this place for a holiday okay damn you said leiter resignedly but dont you go fooling around in vegas its a big operation theyve got there and they wont stand for any monkey tricks leiter leant across the table let me tell you the other day there was one of these dealers blackjack i think it was decided to go into business for himself slipped a few bills into his pocket one evening during the play well they spotted him next day some innocent guy is driving into town from boulder city and he spots something pink sticking up out of the desert couldnt be a cactus or anything so he stops and has himself a look leiter prodded bonds chest with a finger my friend that pink thing sticking up was an arm and the hand at the top of the arm was holding a full deck of cards fanned out the cops came with spades and dug around and there was the rest of the guy under the ground at the other end of the arm that was the dealer theyd blown the back of his head off and buried him the fancy work with the arm and the cards was just to warn the others now how dya like that not bad said bond the dinner came and they started to eat mark you said leiter between mouthfuls of broiled lobster the dealer should have known better than get caught with his duke in the tambourine theyve got a good trick in these vegas casinos take a look at the ceiling lights very modern just holes in the ceiling with the light beamed through on to the tables they throw a very strong light with no sideways glare to upset the customers take another look and youll see theres no light coming from the alternate holes they just seem to be there to make a pattern leiter slowly shook his head from side to side not so my friend up on the floor above theres a television camera on a dolly that moves around the floor taking an occasional peek through those empty holes kind of a spotcheck on the play if theyre wondering about one of the dealers or about one of the players theyll take a picture of the whole of one session at that particular table and every damn card or throw will be watched by the guys sitting quietly upstairs smart hn these dumps are wired for everything except smell but the dealers know it and this guy just hoped the camera was looking somewhere else fatal error too bad bond smiled at leiter ill watch out he promised but dont forget ive somehow got to get another step down the pipeline to the tap at the end of it in fact ive got to get right up close to your friend mr seraffimo spang i cant do that by just sending up my card and ill tell you something else felix bonds voice was deliberate ive suddenly taken against the brothers spang i didnt like those two men in hoods the way the man hit that fat negro the boiling mud i wouldnt have minded so much if hed just beaten the jockey upordinary copsandrobbers stuff but that mud showed a nasty mind and i took against pissaro and budd i dont know what it is but ive just taken against all of them bonds voice was apologetic thought i ought to warn you okay leiter pushed away his empty plate ill be around and try and pick up the bits and ill tell ernie to keep an eye on you but dont think you can ask for a lawyer or the british consul if you get in bad with the mob only law firm out theres called smith and wesson he banged on the table with his hook better have one last bourbon and branchwater its desert where youre going dry as a bone and hottern hell at this time of year no rivers so no branches to get the water out of youll be drinking it with soda and then mopping it off your forehead itll be onetwenty in the shade out there only there isnt any shade the whisky came i shall miss you out there felix said bond glad to get away from his thoughts no one to teach me the american way of life and by the way i thought you did the hell of a fine job over shy smile wish you could come along and tackle spang senior with me together i believe we could take him leiter looked affectionately at his friend that sort of rough stuffs no good if youre working for pinkertons he said im after the guy too but ive got to get him legitimate if i can find out where the remains of the horse are buried that hoodlums going to have an ugly time its all right for you coming over here and tangling with him and getting away quick back to england the gang has no idea who you are from what you tell me they can never find out but ive got to live here if i had a shooting match or anything of that sort with spang his pals would get after me and after my family and after my friends and they wouldnt rest until theyd hurt me more than i ever hurt their pal even if i killed him its not so funny to come home and find your sisters house burned down with her inside it and im afraid that could still happen in this country today the gangs didnt go out with capone look at murder inc look at the kefauver report now the hoodlums dont run liquor they run governments state governments like nevada articles get written about it and books and speeches sermons but what the hell leiter laughed abruptly maybe you can strike a blow for freedom home and beauty with that old rusty equalizer of yours is it still the beretta yes said bond still the beretta you still got that double o number that means youre allowed to kill yes said bond dryly i have well then said leiter getting up lets go home to bed and give your shooting eye a rest my guess is youre going to need it rue de la pay the plane made a big curve out over the sparkling blue pacific and then swept round across hollywood and gained height so as to make the cajon pass through the great golden cliff of the high sierras bond caught a glimpse of endless miles of palmlined avenues of sprinklers whirling over emerald lawns in front of gracious homes of sprawling aircraft factories of the outside lots of film studios with their jumble of gimcrack setscity streets western ranches what looked like a miniature motorracing track a fullsize fourmasted schooner planted in the groundand then they were in the mountains and through them and over the interminable red desert that is the backstage of los angeles they flew over barstow the junction from which the single track of the santa fe strides off into the desert on its long run across the colorado plateau skirting on their right the calico mountains once the borax centre of the world and leaving far away to the left the bonestrewn wastes of death valley then came more mountains streaked with red like gums bleeding over rotten teeth and then a glimpse of green in the midst of the blasted martian landscape and then a slow descent and please fasten your seat belts and extinguish your cigarettes the heat hit bonds face like a fist and he had begun to sweat in the fifty yards between his cool plane and the blessed relief of the airconditioned terminal building the glass doors operated by seeingeye photoelectric cells hissed open as he approached and slowly closed behind him and already the slotmachines four banks of them were right in his path it was natural to bring out the small change and jerk the handles and watch the lemons and the oranges and the cherries and the bellfruits whirl round to their final clickpauseting followed by a soft mechanical sigh five cents ten cents a quarter bond gave them all a try and only once two cherries and a bell fruit coughed back three coins for the one he had played as he moved away waiting for the baggage of the halfdozen passengers to appear on the ramp near the exit his eyes caught a notice over a big machine that might have been for iced water it said oxygen bar he strolled over to it and read the rest breathe pure oxygen it said healthful and harmless for a quick lift eases distress of overindulgence drowsiness fatigue nervousness and many other symptoms bond obediently put a quarter into the slot and bent over so that his nose and mouth were enclosed in a wide black rubber mouthpiece he pressed a button and as instructed breathed in and out slowly for a full minute it was just like breathing very cold airno taste no smell at the end of the minute there was a click from the machine and bond straightened himself he felt nothing but a slight dizziness but later he recognized that there had been carelessness in the ironical grin he gave to a man with a leather shaving kit under his arm who had been standing watching him the man smiled briefly back and turned away the loudspeaker asked passengers to collect their luggage and bond picked up his case and pushed through the swing doors of the exit into the redhot arms of noon you for the tiara said a voice a chunky man with large very direct brown eyes under a chauffeurs peaked cap shot the question at him from a wide mouth from which a wooden toothpick jutted yes okay lets go the man didnt offer to carry bonds suitcase for him bond followed him over to a smartlooking chevrolet with a lucky raccoon tail tied to its chrome nakedlady mascot he threw his suitcase into the back and climbed in after it the car moved off and out of the airport on to the parkway it crossed into the far lane and turned left other cars hissed by bonds driver kept to the inside lane driving slowly bond felt himself being examined in the driving mirror he looked up at the drivers identification tag it said ernest cureo no and there was a photograph whose eyes also looked levelly at bond the cab smelled of old cigar smoke and bond pressed down the switch of the poweroperated window a furnaceblast of air made him close it again the driver half turned in his seat dont want to do that mister bond he said in a friendly voice cabs conditioned may not seem so but its bettern outside thanks said bond and then i believe youre a friend of felix leiter sure said the driver over his shoulder nice guy told me to watch out for ya be glad if i can do anything while yare here staying long i cant say said bond few days anyway tell ya what said the

save to house the artillery well thanks said bond annoyed with himself i can see ill have to keep a bit wider awake pretty good machine they seem to have here the driver grunted affirmatively and drove on in silence they were just entering the famous strip the desert on both sides of the road which had been empty except for occasional hoardings advertising the hotels was beginning to sprout gas stations and motels they passed a motel with a swimming pool which had builtup transparent glass sides as they drove by a girl dived into the bright green water and her body sliced through the tank in a cloud of bubbles then came a gas station with an elegant drivein restaurant gaseteria it said freshup here hot dogs jumboburgers atomburgers ice cool drinks drive in and there were two or three cars being served by waitresses in highheeled shoes and twopiece bathing suits the great sixlane highway stretched on through a forest of multicoloured signs and frontages until it lost itself downtown in a dancing lake of heat waves the day was as hot and sultry as a fire opal the swollen sun burned straight down the middle of the frying concrete and there was no shade anywhere except under the few scattered palms in the forecourts of the motels a glittering gunfire of lightsplinters shot at bonds eyes from the windscreens of oncoming cars and from their blaze of chrome styling and he felt his wet shirt clinging to his skin coming into the strip now said the driver otherwise known as the rue de la pay spelt pay joke see got it said bond on ya right the flamingo said ernie cureo as they passed a lowlying modernistic hotel with a huge tower of neon now dead outside it bugsy siegel built that back in he came over to vegas from the coast one day and took a looki round had a lot of hot money looking for investment vegas was goin great guns town wide open gambling legalized catshops nice setup it didnt take long for bugsy to catch on he saw the possibilities bond laughed at the pregnant phrase yes sir continued the driver bugsy saw the possibilities and moved right in stayed with it until when they blew some of his head off with so many bullets the cops never got around to finding them all then heres the sands plenty of hot money behind that one dont rightly know whose built a couple of years ago front guys a nice feller name of jack intratter used to be at the copa in new york mebbe you heard of him afraid not said bond well then heres the desert inn wilbur clarks place but the money came from the old clevelandcincinatti combination and that dump with the flatiron sign is the sahara latest thing listed owners are a bunch of smalltime gamblers from oregon funny thing they lost on their opening night would ya believe it all the big shots come along with their pockets full of dough to make some courtesy play make the fust night a success yunnerstand its a custom here for the rival outfits to gather round at an opening but boy the cards just wouldnt cooperate and the opposition guys walked off with fifty grand towns laffing about it still then he waved to the left where the neon was wrought into a twentyfoot covered wagon at full gallop ya get the last frontier thats a dummy western town on the left worth seein and over theres the thunderbird and across the roads the tiara snazziest joint in vegas guess ya know about mister spang and all that he slowed down and halted opposite the spang hotel which was topped by a ducal coronet of brilliant lights that winked on and off in a lost battle with the glaring sun and the reflections from the highway yes i know the outlines said bond but id be glad for you to fill them in some time and now what whatever ya say mister bond suddenly felt he had had enough of the ghastly glitter of the strip he only wanted to get indoors and out of the heat have some lunch and perhaps a swim and take things easy until the night he said so suits me said cureo guess ya shouldnt get into much trouble ya first night take it easy though and act kmda natural if ya got work to do in vegas ya better wait till ya know ya way around and watch the gambling friend he chuckled yever hear of those silence towers they have in india they say it takes those vultures only twenty minutes to strip a guy to the bones guess they take a bit longer at the tiara mebbe the unions slow em down the driver banged the gear lever into first all a same he said watching the traffic in his driving mirror there was one guy left vegas with a hundred grand he paused waiting for a chance to cross the parkway only thing he had half a million when he started to play the car swung across the traffic and under the pillared portico in front of the wide glass doors of the sprawling pink stucco building the bell captain in a sky blue uniform opened the cab door and reached in for bonds bag bond stepped out into the heat as he shouldered his way through the glass doors he heard ernie cureo say to the captain some crazy limey hired me for fifty bucks a day whaddya know about that and then the door swung to behind him and the beautiful cold air welcomed him with a chill kiss into the glittering palace of the man called seraffimo spang the tiara bond had lunch in the airconditioned sunburst room beside the big kidneyshaped swimming pool and having decided that only about one per cent of the customers were fit to wear bathing suits walked very slowly through the heat across the twenty yards of baked lawn that separated his building from the central establishment took off his clothes and threw himself naked on his bed there were six buildings containing the bedrooms of the tiara and they were named after jewels bond was on the ground floor of the turquoise its motif was eggshell blue with furnishing materials of dark blue and white his room was extremely comfortable and equipped with expensive and welldesigned modern furniture of a silvery wood that might have been birch there was a radio beside his bed and a television set with a seventeeninch screen beside the broad window outside the window there was a small enclosed breakfast patio it was very quiet and there was no sound from the thermostatcontrolled airconditioning and bond was almost instantly asleep he slept for four hours and during this time the wirerecorder concealed in the base of the bedside table wasted several hundred feet of wire on dead silence when he awoke it was seven the wirerecorder noted that he picked up the telephone and asked for miss tiffany case and after a pause said would you please tell her that mr james bond called and put back the receiver it then picked up the noise of bond moving about the room the hiss of the shower and at the click of his key in the lock as he went out and shut the door half an hour later the recorder heard a knock on his door and then after a pause the noise of the door opening a man dressed like a waiter with a basket of fruit bearing a note saying with the compliments of the management came into the room and walked quickly over to the bedside table he undid two screws removed the reel oј fine wire on the recorders turntable replaced it with a fresh reel put the basket of fruit on the dressing table and went out and closed the door and then for several hours the recorder whirred silently on recording nothing bond sat at the long bar of the tiara and sipped a vodka martini and examined the great gambling room with a professional eye the first thing he noticed was that las vegas seemed to have invented a new school of functional architecture the gilded mousetrap school he thought it might be called whose main purpose was to channel the customermouse into the central gambling trap whether he wanted the cheese or not there were only two entrances one from the street outside and one from the bedroom buildings and the swimming pool once you had come in through either of these whether you wanted to buy a paper or cigarettes at the news stand have a drink or a meal in one of the two restaurants get your hair cut or have a massage in the health club or just visit the lavatories there was no way of reaching your objective without passing between the banks of slot machines and gambling tables and when you were trapped in the vortex of the whirring machines amongst which there sounded always from somewhere the intoxicating silvery cascade of coins into a metal cup or occasionally the golden cry of jackpot from one of the changegirls you were lost beseiged by the excited backchat from the three big crap tables the seductive whirl of the two roulette wheels and the clank of silver dollars across the green pools of the blackjack tables it would be a mouse of steel who could get through without a tentative nibble at this delicious chunk of lucky cheese but reflected bond it could only be a trap for peculiarly insensitive micemice who would be tempted by the coarsest cheese it was an inelegant trap obvious and vulgar and the noise of the machines had a horrible mechanical ugliness which beat at the brain it was like the steady clanking of the engines of some old iron freighter on its way to the knackers yard unoiled uncared for condemned and the gamblers stood and tore at the handles of the machines as if they hated what they were doing and once they had seen their fate in the small glass window they didnt wait for the wheels to stop spinning but rammed in another coin and reached up a right arm that knew exactly where to go crankclatterting crankclatterting and when there was the occasional silvery waterfall the metal cup would overflow with coins and the gambler would have to go down on her knees to scrabble about under the machines for a rolling coin for as leiter had said they were mostly women elderly women of the prosperous housewife class and the droves of them stood at the banks of machines like hens in an egg battery conditioned by the delicious coolness of the room and the music of the spinning wheels to go on laying it on the line until their wad was gone then as bond watched a changegirls voice bawled jackpot and some of the women raised their heads and the picture changed now they reminded bond of dr pavlovs dogs the saliva drooling down from their jaws at the treacherous bell that brought no dinner and he shuddered at the thought of the empty eyes of these women and their skins and their wet halfopen mouths and their bruised hands bond turned his back on the scene and sipped at his martini listening with half his mind to the music from the famousnameband at the end of the room next to the halfdozen shops over one of the shops there was a pale blue neon sign which said the house of diamonds bond beckoned to the barman mr spang been around tonight aint seen him said the barman mostly comes in after the first show around eleven you know him not personally bond paid his check and drifted over to the blackjack tables he stopped at the centre one this one would be his at exactly five minutes past ten he glanced at his watch eightthirty the table was a small flat kidney of green baize eight players sat on high stools facing the dealer who stood with his stomach against the edge of the table and dealt two cards into the eight numbered spaces on the cloth in front of the stakes the stakes were mostly five or ten silver dollars or counters worth twenty the dealer was a man of about forty he had a pleasant halfsmile on his face he wore the dealers uniformwhite shirt buttoned at the wrists a thin black western gamblers tie a green eyeshade black trousers the front of the trousers was protected from rubbing against the table by a small green baize apron jake was embroidered in one corner the dealer dealt and handled the stakes with unruffled smoothness there was no talk at the table except when a player ordered a courtesy drink or cigarettes from one of the waitresses in black silk pyjamas who circulated in the central space inside the ring of tables from this central space the run of the play was watched over by two tough lynxeyed pitbosses with guns at their waists the game was quick and efficient and dull it was as dull and mechanical as the slot machines bond watched for a while and then moved away towards the doors marked smoking room and powder room on the far side of the casino on his way he passed four sheriffs in smart grey western uniform the legs of their trousers were tucked into halfwellingtons these men were standing about unobtrusively looking at nothing but seeing everything at each hip they carried a gun in an open holster and the polished brass of fifty cartridges shone at their belts plenty of protection around thought bond as he pushed his way through the swing door of the smoking room inside on the tiled wall was a notice which said stand up closer its shorter than you think western humour bond wondered if he dared include it in his next written report to m he decided it would not appeal he went out and walked back through the tables to the door beneath a neon sign which said the opal room the low circular restaurant in pink and white and grey was half full the hostess swept over and piloted him to a corner table she bent over to arrange the flowers in the middle of the table and to show him that her fine bosom was at least half real gave him a gracious smile and went away after ten minutes a waitress with a tray appeared and put a roll on his plate and a square of butter she also set down a dish containing olives and some celery lined with orange cheese then a second and older waitress bustled over and gave him the menu and said be right with you twenty minutes after he had sat down bond was able to order a dozen cherrystone clams and a steak and since he expected a further long pause a second vodka dry martini the wine waiter will be right over said the waitress primly and disappeared in the direction of the kitchen long on courtesy and short on service reflected bond and resigned himself to the gracious ritual during the excellent dinner that finally materialized bond wondered about the evening ahead and about how he could force the pace of his assignment he was thoroughly bored with his role as a probationary crook who was about to be paid off for his first trial job and might then if he found favour in the eyes of mr spang be given regular work with the restof the teenage adults who made up the gang it irked him not to have the initiativeto be ordered to saratoga and then to this hideous suckertrap at the sayso of a handful of bigtime hoodlums here he was eating their dinner and sleeping in their bed while they watched him james bond and weighed him up and debated whether his hand was steady enough his appearance trustworthy enough and his health adequate to some sleazy job in one of their rackets bond munched his steak as if it was mr seraffimo spangs fingers and cursed the day he had taken on this idiotic role but then he paused and went on eating more calmly what the hell was he worrying about this was a big assignment which so far had gone well and now he had penetrated right to the end of the pipeline right into the parlour of mr seraffimo spang who with his brother in london and with the mysterious abc ran the biggest smuggling operation in the world what did bonds feelings matter it was only a moment of selfdisgust a touch of nausea brought on by being a stranger who had spent too many days too close to these sordidly powerful american gangs too close to the gunpowderscented gracious life of gangland aristocracy the truth of the matter bond decided over coffee was that he felt homesick for his real identity he shrugged his shoulders to hell with the spangs and the hoodridden town of las vegas he looked at his watch it was just ten oclock he lit a cigarette and got to his feet and walked slowly across the room and out into the casino there were two ways of playing the rest of the game by lying low and waiting for something to happenor by forcing the pace so that something had to happen thanks for the ride the scene in the big gambling room had changed it was much quieter the orchestra had gone and so had the droves of women and there were only a few players at the tables there were two or three shills at the roulette attractive girls in smart evening dresses who had been given fifty dollars with which to warm up the dead tables and there was a very drunk man clinging on to the high surrounding wall of one of the crap tables and shouting exhortations to the dice and something else had changed the dealer at the centre blackjack table nearest the bar was tiffany case so that was her job at the tiara and then bond saw that all the blackjack dealers were pretty women and that they were all dressed in the same smart western outfit in grey and blackshort grey skirt with a wide black metalstudded belt grey blouse with a black handkerchief round the neck a grey sombrero hanging down the back by a black cord black halfwellingtons over fleshcoloured nylons bond looked at his watch again and moved slowly into the room so tiffany was going to falsedeal him to win five thousand dollars and of course they had chosen the moment when she had just come on duty and the first show of the bigname revue was still running in the platinum room he would be alone with her at the table no witnesses in case she muffed a deal from the bottom of the pack at exactly bond strolled easily up to the table and sat down facing her good evening hi she gave him a thin correct smile whats the maximum a grand as bond slapped the ten ldollar notes down across the betting line the pitboss strolled over and stood beside tiffany case he barely glanced at bond mebbe the guy would like a new deck miss tiffany he said he handed her a fresh pack the girl stripped the cover off it and handed him the used cards the pitboss stood back a few paces and appeared to lose interest the girl snapped the pack with a fluid motion of the hands broke it and put the two halves flat on the table and executed what appeared to be a faultless scarne shuffle but bond saw that the two halves did not quite marry and that when she lifted the pack off the table and carried out an innocent reshuffle she would be getting the two halves of the pack back into their original order she repeated the manoeuvre again and put the pack down in front of bond in an invitation to cut bond cut the cards and watched with approval as she carried out the difficult singlehanded annulment one of the hardest gambits in cardsharping so the new deck was fixed and the only result of all this fair play routine was to get all the cards back into the order in which they were arranged when they left the wrappers but it was brilliant manipulation and bond was full of admiration for the assurance of the girls hands he looked up into her grey eyes was there a hint of complicity in them a hint of amusement at the odd game they were playing across the narrow green board she dealt him two cards and then gave two to herself suddenly bond realized that he would have to be careful he must play the exactly conventional game or he might upset the whole sequence in which the cards had been prepared printed across the table were the words the dealer must draw on sixteen and stand on seventeen they would presumably have given him foolproof winning cards but just in case there was another player or a kibitzer they would have to make his winning seem a natural run of luck and not for instance just deal him twentyone each time and seventeens to the girl he glanced at his two cards a knave and a ten he looked up at the girl and shook his head she turned up sixteen and drew a card busting herself with a king she had a rack beside her which contained only silver dollars and counters for twenty but the pitboss was quickly at her side with a dollar plaque she took it and tossed it over to bond he put it over the line and pocketed his notes she flipped out two more cards to him and two to herself bond had seventeen and again shook his head she had twelve and drew a three and then a ninetwentyfour and bust again again the pitboss stepped up with a plaque bond slipped it into his pocket and left his original stake this time he had nineteen and she turned up a ten and seven on which by the rule she had to stand another plaque went into bonds pocket the wide doors at the far end of the room had opened and a stream of people were milling into the gambling room from the dinner revue soon they would be round the tables this was his last play after this he must get up from the table and leave her she was looking at him impatiently he picked up the two cards that she had given him twenty and she also turned up two tens bond smiled at the refinement she quickly dealt him two more cards just as three more players came up to the table and hitched themselves up on the stools he had nineteen and she had sixteen and that was that the pitboss didnt even bother to hand the girl the fourth plaque but tossed it across the table to bond with an expression on his face that was very like a sneer jeesus said one of the new players as bond pocketed the plaque and stood up bond looked across the table at the girl thank you he said you deal beautifully ill say said the player who had spoken tiffany case looked hard at bond youre welcome she said she held his eyes for a fraction of a second and then looked down at her cards shuffled them thoroughly and handed them to one of the new players for a cut bond turned his back on the table and moved off round the room thinking of her and occasionally glancing across at the straight imperious little figure in the exciting western uniform others obviously found her as attractive as bond did for soon there were eight men sitting at her table and others standing watching her bond felt a pang of jealousy he walked over to the bar and ordered himself a bourbon and branchwater to celebrate the five thousand dollars in his pocket the barman produced a corked bottle of water and put it beside bonds old grandad where does this come from asked bond remembering what felix leiter had said over by boulder dam said the barman seriously comes in by truck every day dont worry he added its the real stuff bond threw a silver dollar on the bar im sure it is he said with equal seriousness keep the change he stood with his back to the bar and the glass in his hand deciding his next move so now he had been paid off and shady tree had told him on no account to go back to the tables bond finished his drink and walked straight across the room to the nearest roulette table there was only a sprinkling of gamblers at it playing small whats the maximum here he said to the stickman an elderly balding individual with dead eyes who was just picking the ivory ball out of the wheel five grand said the man indifferently bond took the four plaques and the ten dollar notes out of his pocket and put them beside the croupier on red the croupier sat up straighter in his chair and squinted sideways at bond he tossed the four plaques one by one down on to the red catching them there with his stick he counted out bonds notes pushed them through a slot in the table took a fifth plaque from the rack of counters beside him and tossed this down to join the others bond saw his knee go up under the table the pitboss heard the buzzer and strolled over to the table just as the croupier spun the wheel bond took out a cigarette and lit it his hand was steady he felt a wonderful sense of freedom at having at last taken the initiative from these people he knew he was going to win he hardly glanced at the wheel as it slowed down and the little ivory ball rattled into its slot thirtysix red high and even the stickman raked in a few losing counters and silver dollars and tossed some money down the table to the winners then he took a thin plaque as big as a prayerbook out of his rack and put it softly down beside bond black said bond the man threw a single plaque for five thousand dollars down on to black and raked in bonds stake from the red there was a buzz of conversation round the table and several more people drifted up and stood watching bond felt the curious eyes on him but he only looked across the table into the eyes of the pitboss they were as hostile as an adders and yet somehow scared bond smiled blandly at him as the wheel whirred and there was the whizz of the little ball as it set off on its journey seventeen black low and odd said the stickman there was a sigh from the crowd and hungry eyes watched the big plaque being slipped out of the rack and placed in front of bond once more thought bond but not this turn ill stay away he said to the croupier the man glanced up at bond and then reached out with his rake and pulled in bonds stake and handed it to him and then there was another man inside the pit standing be side the pitboss and he was looking at bond with bright hard eyes like camera lenses and the fat cigar exactly in the centre of his red lips was pointing straight at bond like a gun the big square body in the midnightblue tuxedo was quite motionless and a sort of tense quietness exuded from it it was a tiger watching the tethered donkey and yet sensing danger the face was ivory pale but there was a likeness to the brother in london in the very straight angry black brows and the short cliff of wiry hair cut en brosse and in the ruthless jut of the jaw the wheel whirred again and the two pairs of eyes bent to watch it it fell into one of the two green slots in the wheel and bonds heart lifted at the escape he had had double zero said the stickman raking in all the money on the table now for the last throw thought bondand then out of here with twenty thousand dollars of the spang money he looked across at his employer the two camera lenses and the cigar were still trained on him but the pale face was expressionless red he handed a dollar plaque to the croupier and watched it slither down the table would the last coup be asking too much of the wheel no decided bond with certitude it would not five red low and odd said the croupier obediently ill take the stake said bond and thanks for the ride come again said the stickman unemotionally bond put his hand over the four fat plaques in his coat pocket and shouldered his way out of the crowd behind him and walked straight across the long room to the cashiers desk three bills of five thousand and five of ones he said to the man with the green eyeshade behind the bars the man took bonds four plaques and counted out the bills and bond put them in his pocket and walked over to the reception desk air mail envelope please he said he moved to a writingdesk beside the wall and sat down and put the three big bills in the envelope and wrote on the front personal the managing director universal export regents park london nw england then he bought stamps at the desk and slipped the envelope down the slot marked us mail and hoped that there in the most sacrosanct repository in america it would be safe bond glanced at his watch it said five minutes to midnight he surveyed the big room for the last time noted that a new dealer had taken over at tiffany cases table and that there was no sign of mr spang and then he walked out through the glass door into the hot stuffy night and over the lawns to the turquoise building and let himself into his room and locked the door behind him night falls in the passion pit how dya make out it was the next evening and ernie cureos cab was rolling slowly along the strip towards downtown las vegas bond had got tired of waiting for something to happen and he had called up the pinkerton man and suggested they get together for a talk not bad said bond took some money off them at roulette but i dont suppose thatll worry our friend they tell me hes got plenty to spare ernie cureo snorted ill say he said that guys so loaded with the stuff he dont need to wear spectacles when hes out driving has the windshields of his cadillacs ground to his eyedoctors prescription bond laughed whats he spend it on besides that he asked hes daft said the driver hes crazy about the old west bought himself a whole ghost town way out on highway hes shored the place upwooden sidewalks a fancy saloon clapboard hotel where he rooms the boys even the old railroad station way back in or thereabouts this dumpspectreville its called seeing how its right alongside the spectre rangewas a rarin silver camp for around three years they dug millions out of those mountains and a spur line took the stuff into rhyolite mebbe fifty miles away thats another famous ghost town tourist centre now got a house made out of whisky bottles used to be the railhead where the stuff got shipped to the coast well spang bought himself one of the old locos one of the old highland lights if yever heard of the engine and one of the first pullman state coaches and he keeps them there in the station at spectreville and weekends he takes his pals for a run into rhyolite and back drives the train himself champagne and caviar orchestra girlsthe works must be something but i never seen it ya cant get near the place yessir the driver let down the side window and spat emphatically into the road thats how mister spang spends his money daft like i said so that explained it thought bond that was why he had heard nothing from mr spang or his friends all through the day friday and they would all be out at the bosss place playing trains while he had swum and slept and hung about the tiara all day waiting for something to happen it was true that he had caught an occasional eye shifting away from his and there had always been a servant of some sort or one of the uniformed sheriffs hanging about in his neighbourhood rather elaborately doing nothing in particular but otherwise bond might have been just any one of the hotel guests he had caught a single glimpse of the big man and the circumstances had given him a perverse pleasure at about ten oclock in the morning after a swim and breakfast bond had decided to get a haircut at the barbers shop there were still very few people about and the only other customer in the shop was a large figure in a purple terrycloth bathwrap whose face as the man lay tilted back in the chair was hidden beneath hot towels his right hand dangling down over the arm of the chair was being attended to by a pretty manicurist she had a pink and white dolls face and a short mop of buttercoloured hair and she squatted beside him on a low stool with a bowl full of instruments balanced on the tips of her knees bond gazing into the mirror in front of his own chair had watched with interest as the head barber delicately lifted up first one corner of the hot towels and then the other and with infinite precaution snipped the hair out of the customers ears with small thin scissors before he replaced the edge of the towel over the second ear he bent down and said deferentially into it and the nostrils sir there was an affirmative grunt from behind the hot towels and the barber proceeded to open a window through the towels in the neighbourhood of the mans nose then he again went cautiously to work with the thin scissors after this ceremony there was dead silence in the small whitetiled room except for the soft clacking of the scissors round bonds head and the occasional ting as the manicurist dropped an instrument into her enamel bowl and then there was a soft creaking as the head barber carefully wound the handle of the customers chair so that it came upright hows that sir said bonds barber holding a handminor behind his head it was as bond was inspecting the back of his head that it happened perhaps with the changing elevation of the chair the girls hand slipped but there was suddenly a muffled roar and the man in the purple dressinggown sprang out of his chair tore the towels off his face and plunged a finger into his mouth then he took it out and bent quickly down and slapped the girl hard across the cheek so that she was knocked off her stool and the enamel bowl of instruments went flying across the room the man straightened himself and turned a furious face on the barber fire that bitch he snarled he put the hurt finger back in his mouth and his slippers crunched amongst the scattered instruments as he strode blindly out of the door and disappeared yes sir mr spang said the barber in a stunned voice he started to bawlout the sobbing girl bond turned his head and said quietly stop that he got up from his chair and unwrapped the towel from round his neck the barber gave him a surprised glance then he said quickly yes sir mister and bent to help the girl gather up her instruments while bond paid for his haircut he heard the kneeling girl say plaintively it werent my fault mister lucian he was nervous today his hands were trembling honest they were aint never seen him like that before tension sort of and bond had had a moment of pleasure at the thought of mr spangs tension ernie cureos voice broke sharply in on his thoughts we got ourselves a tail mister he said out of the corner of his mouth two of em fore an aft dont look back see that black chewy sedan in front with the two guys they got two driving mirrors and they been watching us and keeping step for quite a whiles back of us theres a little red sexship old sports model jag with a rumble seat two more guys with golf clubs in the back but it just happens i know them guys detroit purple mob coupla lavender boys you know pansies golf aint their game the only irons they can handle are in their pockets just swivel yeyes round as if you was admiring the scenery watch their gunhands while i try em out ready bond did as he was told the driver put his foot on the accelerator and simultaneously turned off the ignition switch the exhaust let go like an millimetre and bond saw the two right hands dive into the two brightlycoloured sports jackets bond casually turned his head back youre right he said he paused better let me out ernie i dont want to get you into trouble shucks said the driver disgustedly they cant do nuthen to me ya pay for any damage to the cab and ill try and shake em okay bond took a dollar bill out of his notecase and leant over and stuffed it into the pocket of the drivers shirt theres a grand to go on with he said and thanks ernie lets see what you can do bond slipped his beretta out of the holster and cradled it in his hand this he thought to himself was just what he had been waiting for okay feller said the driver cheerfully i been looking for a chance to take a poke at the gang i dont like being leant on and they been leaning on me and some of my friends for too long hold tight lets go it was a straight stretch of road with not much traffic about the distant tops of the mountains were yellow in the setting sun and the street was beginning to get blue with the fifteen minutes of dusk when you cant make up your mind whether to switch on your lights they were riding easily along at forty with the lowslung jaguar right on their tail and the black sedan a block ahead of them suddenly so that bond pitched forward ernie cureo put his brakes full on and dryskidded to a stop with a scream of his tyres there was a shattering splinter of metal and glass as the jaguar hit their fenders the cab lurched forward against its brakes and then the driver jammed it into gear and with a horrible tearing of iron freed himself from the smashed radiator of the car behind and accelerated away down the road thats ed them proper said ernie cureo with satisfaction how they making out bust radiator grill said bond watching out of the rear window both front wings flattened fender hanging off windshield starred maybe broken he lost the car in the dusk and turned round theyre out on the road trying to pull the front wings off the tyres they may be able to go before long but it was a good start got any more like that not so easy now grunted the driver wars been declared watch it better get down the chevvys pulled up at the side of the road they may try some shootin here we go bond felt the car surge forward ernie cureo was half lying along the front seat driving with one hand and with his eyes watching the road ahead from just above the dash there was a clang and two sharp cracks as they flashed past the chevrolet a handful of safety glass showered round bond ernie cureo swore and the car gave a swerve and then got back on its course bond knelt on the back seat and knocked out the glass of the rear window with the butt of his gun the chevrolet was coming after them its eyes blazing hold it said cureo with an odd muffled voice coin to do a sharp turn and stop under cover of the next block give ya a clear shot as they come round after us bond braced himself as the tyres screamed and the car lurched on two wheels and then righted itself and stopped then he was out of the door and crouching with his gun up the lights of the chevrolet tore into the side road and there was a squeal of tortured rubber as it made the turn on the wrong side now thought bond before he can straighten up cracka pause crack crack crack four bullets at twenty yards dead on the target the chevrolet didnt straighten up it went over the kerb on the other side of the road hit a tree broadside bounced off it and smashed into a lamp standard and turned completely round and slowly toppled over on its side as bond watched it waiting for the echoes of the smashing metal to stop ringing in his ears flames started to bleed slowly from the chromium mouth of the car someone was scrabbling at a window trying to get out at any moment the flames would find the vacuum pump and run the whole length of the chassis to the tank and then it would be too late for the man inside bond had started across the road when there was a groan from the front seat of the cab and he turned round to see ernie cureo slip from under the wheel to the floor bond forgot the burning car as he tore open the door of the cab and leant over the driver there was blood everywhere and the whole of the drivers left arm was soaked in it bond somehow hauled him into a sitting position on the seat and the drivers eyes opened oh brother he said through clenched teeth get me out of here mister and drive like hell next thing that jagll be after us then get me to a medic okay ernie said bond slipping behind the wheel ill take care of it he rammed the car into gear and moved fast off down the road and away from the blazing pyre and the frightened people who had materialized out of the dusk and were standing watching the flames their hands up to their mouths keep goin muttered ernie cureo thisll get you near the boulder dam road see anything in the mirror theres a lowslung car with a spotlight coming after us fast said bond could be the jag about two blocks away now he stamped on the accelerator and the cab hissed through the deserted side street keep goin said ernie cureo we gotta hide up some place and let them lose us tell ya what theres a passion pit just where this comes out on drivein movie here we come slow sharp right see those lights get in there quick right straight over the sand and between those cars off lights easy stop the cab came to rest in the back row of half a dozen ranks of cars lined up to face the concrete screen that soared up into the sky and on which a huge man was just saying something to a huge girl bond turned and looked back down the lanes of metal standards like parking meters from which speakers could be connected wthi your car to pick up the sound as he watched one or two cars drove in and ranged themselves in the rear rank nothing low enough for a jaguar but it was dark now and difficult to see and he stayed slewed round in his seat his eyes on the entrance an attendant came up a pretty girl dressed as a pageboy with a tray slung round her neck thatll be a dollar she said glancing into the car to see there was not a third customer on the floor of the cab she had pickups coiled over her right arm and she took one off plugged it into the nearest standard and hung the small speaker through the window on bonds side the huge man and woman on the screen started talking heatedly cococola cigarettes candy asked the girl taking the note bond handed her no thanks said bond youre welcome said the girl and sauntered off towards the other late arrivals mister for chrissake willya switch off that crap pleaded ernie cureo through his teeth and keep watching well give em a whiles more then get me to a doc dig out the slug his voice was weak and now that the girl had gone he was halflying with his head against the door wont be long ernie try and stick it bond fiddled with the speaker found the switch and silenced the wrangling voices the huge man on the screen looked as if he was going to hit the woman and her mouth gaped in a noiseless scream bond turned and strained his eyes across the dark expanse behind them still nothing he glanced at the neighbouring cars two faces glued together a shapeless huddle on a back seat two prim rapt elderly faces staring upwards the glint of light on an upturned bottle and then a wave of musky aftershave lotion came up to his nose and a dark figure rose up from the ground and a gun was in his face and a voice on the other side of the car beside ernie cureo whispered softly okay fellers take it easy bond looked into the suety face beside him the eyes were smiling and cold the wet lips parted and whispered out limey or your pals cold turkey my friend has a silencer you and were goin for a ride bond turned his head and saw the black sausage of metal against the back of ernie cureos neck he made up his mind okay ernie he said better one than two ill go with them ill soon be back to get you to the doc take care of yourself funny guy said suetface he opened the door keeping his gun trained on bonds face sorry friend said ernie cureo in a tired voice i guess but then there was a sharp thud as the gun hit him behind the ear and he slumped forward and was silent bond gritted his teethi and his muscles lumped under his coat he wondered if he could reach the beretta he glanced from one gun to the other measuring adding up odds the four eyes above the two guns were greedy longing for an excuse to kill him the two mouths were smiling wanting him to try something he felt his blood cooling he gave it another minute and then with his hands in sight he stepped slowly out of the car with murder tucked away in the back of his mind go ahead to the gate said suetface softly look natural i got you covered his gun had disappeared but his hand was in his pocket the other man joined them and his right hand was at the waistband of his trousers he ranged himself on bonds other side the three men walked swiftly towards the entrance and the moon rising over the mountains straddled their long shadows in front of them across the white sandy floor spectreville the red jaguar was outside the entrance up against the wall of the enclosure bond let them take his gun and climbed in beside the driver f no funny tricks if you want to keep your head on straight said suetface climbing into the rumble seat beside the golf clubs theres a gun on you nice little car you once had said bond the shattered windshield had been lowered flat and a piece of chrome from the radiator stuck up like a pennant between the two wingless front tyres where are we going in the remains youll see said the driver a bony man with a cruel mouth and sideburns he swung the car out on to the road and accelerated back towards the town and they were soon in amongst the jungle of neon and then through it and going fast down a twolane highway that ribboned away across the moonlit desert towards the mountains there was a big sign which said and bond remembered what ernie cureo had told him and knew that he was on his way to spectreville he hunched down in his seat to protect his eyes from the dust and flies and thought about the immediate future and how to revenge his friend so these men and the other two in the chevrolet had been sent to bring him to mr spang why had four men been necessary surely they were a rather heavyweight answer to bonds defiance of his orders in the casino the car lapped up the deadstraight road with the needle of the speedometer wavering around eighty the telegraph poles shifted by with the click of a metronome bond suddenly felt that he didnt know quite enough of the answers was he completely exposed as an enemy of the spangled mob he could argue himself out of the game of roulette on the grounds that he hadnt understood his orders and if he had been a bit troublesome when the four men came for him he could at least pretend that he had thought it was a tail from a rival mob if you wanted me why didnt you just call me in my room bond could hear himself saying in an injured tone of voice at least he had shown that he was tough enough for any job mr spang might offer him and in any case bond reassured himself he was just about to achieve his main objectiveto get to the end of the pipeline and somehow link seraffimo spang with his brother in london bond crouched his eyes on the luminous dials in front of him and concentrated on the interview ahead and on wondering how much useful evidence about the pipeline he could possibly extract from it later he thought about ernie cureo and the revenge he owed him it was not in his makeup to worry about how he himself was going to get away once he had achieved these two objectives his own safety gave him no concern he still had no respect for these people only contempt and dislike bond was still rehearsing imaginary conversations with mr spang when after two hours driving he felt the speed of the car coming down he lifted his head above the dashboard they were coasting up to a section of high wire fence with a gate in it and a big notice lit up by their single spotlight it said spectreville city limits do not enter dangerous dogs the car drew up below the notice and beside an iron post embedded in concrete on the post there was a bellpush and a small iron grill and written in red ring and state your business without leaving the wheel sideburns reached out and pressed the button there was a pause and then a metallic voice said yes frasso and mcgonigle said the driver loudly okay said the voice there was a sharp click the high wire gate slowly opened they drove through and over an iron strip in the narrow dirt road beyond bond looked back over his shoulder and saw the gate close behind them he also noticed with pleasure that the face of presumably mcgonigle was plastered with dust and the blood of dead flies the dirt road continued for about a mile across the brutal stony surface of the desert in which an occasional clump of gesticulating cactus was the only vegetation then there was a glow ahead and they rounded a spur of mountain and went down a hill and into a brightly lit straggling assembly of about twenty buildings beyond the moon glinted on a single railway track which lanced off straight as a die towards the distant horizon they drew up among the grey clapboard houses and shops marked drugs barber farmers bank and wells fargo under a hissing gaslight outside a twostorey building which said in faded gold pink garter saloon and underneath beers and wines from behind the traditional sawnoff swingdoors yellow light streamed out on to the street and on to the sleek black and silver of a stutz bearcat roadster at the kerb there was the sweet nasal twang of a honkeytonk piano playing i wonder whos kissing her now slightly flat the music reminded bond of sawdust floors nursed drinks and girls legs in the widest mesh stockings the whole scene was like something out of an exceptionally wellmounted western out limey said the driver the three men climbed stiffly out of the car and on to the raised wooden sidewalk bond bent to massage a leg that had gone to sleep watching the feet of the two men come on sissy said mcgonigle giving him a nudge with his loosely held gun bond slowly straightened himself measuring inches he limped heavily as he followed the man to the door of the saloon he paused as the swing doors flapped back into his face he felt the prod of frassos gun from behind now bond straightened himself and leapt through the stillswinging door mcgonigles back was just in front of him and beyond there was a brightly lit empty barroom in which an automatic piano was playing to itself bonds hands shot out and caught the man above the elbows he lifted him off his feet and swung him round and into the swing doors and into frasso who was halfway through them the whole clapboard house trembled as the two bodies met and frasso fell back through the doors and crashed on to the sidewalk mcgonigle catapulted back and twisted to face bond there was a rising gun in his hand bonds left caught him on the shoulder at the same time his open right hand slapped down hard on the gun mcgonigle went back on his heels against the door jamb the gun clattered to the floor the snout or frassps revolver appeared through the swing doors it weaved quickly round towards bond like an aiming snake as its blueandyellow tongue licked out bond his blood singing with the battle dived for the ground and for the gun at mcgonigles feet he got his hand on it and fired two quick shots upwards from the floor before mcgonigle stamped on his firing hand and landed on top of him as bond went down he caught a glimpse of frassos gun arced up between the swing doors pumping bullets into the ceiling and this time the crash of the body on the planking outside sounded final then mcgonigles hands were at him and bond was kneeling on the ground with his head down trying to protect his eyes the gun was still on the floor within reach of the first free hand for seconds they fought silently like animals and then bond got to one knee and gave a great heave of his shoulders and lashed upwards at the glimpse of a face and the weight came off him and he rose to a crouch as he did so mcgonigles knee came up like a piston under bonds chin and knocked him to his feet with a snap of the teeth that shook his skull bond had no time to clear his head before the gangster gave a thick grunt and came for him head downwards with both arms flailing bond twisted to protect his stomach and the gangsters head hit him in the ribs and the two fists crashed into his body bonds breath whistled through his teeth with the pain but he kept focus on mcgonigles head below him and with a twist of the body that put all his shoulder behind his hand he whipped in a hard left and as the gangsters head came up he lashed out with his right to the chin the impact of the two blows straightened mcgonigle and rocked him back on his feet bond was on him like a panther crowding him and raining in blows to the body until the gangster began to sag bond grabbed at one weaving wrist and dived for an ankle and yanked it away from the floor then he put out all his strength made almost a full turn to gather momentum and slung the body sideways into the room there was a first twanging cra h as the flying figure hit the upright pianola and then with an explosion of metallic discords and breaking wood the dying instrument toppled over and with mcgonigle spreadeagled across it thundered to the floor amidst the diminishing crescendo of echoes bond stood in the centre of the room his legs braced with the last effort and the breath rasping in his throat slowly he lifted one bruised hand and ran it through his dripping hair cut it was a girls voice and it came from the direction of the bar bond shook himself and turned slowly round four people had come into the saloon they were standing in line with their backs to the mahoganyandbrass bar behind which ranks of gleaming bottles rose to the ceiling bond had no idea how long they had been there a step in front of the other three stood the leading citizen of spectreville resplendent motionless dominant mr spang was dressed in full western costume down to the long silver spurs on his polished back boots the costume and the broad leather chaps that covered his legs were in black picked out and embellished with silver the big quiet hands rested on the ivory butts of two longbarrelled revolvers which protruded from a holster down each thigh and the broad black belt from which they hung was ribbed with ammunition mr spang should have looked ridiculous but he didnt his big head was thrust slightly forward and his eyes were cold fierce slits on mr spangs right with her hands on her hips was tiffany case in a western dress of white and gold she looked like something out of annie get your gun she stood and watched bond her eyes were shining her full red lips were slightly parted and she was panting as if she had been kissed the other half of the quartette was the two men in black hoods from saratoga each of them held a police positive trained on bonds heaving stomach bond slowly took out a handkerchief and wiped his face with it he was feeling lightheaded and the scene in the brilliantly lit saloon with its brass fittings and its homely advertisements for longvanished beers and whiskies was suddenly macabre mr spang broke the silence bring him over the hard jaws that operated the sharp thin lips separated and cut off each word as cleanly as a meatslice and tell someone to call detroit and tell the boys theyre suffering from delusions of adequacy up there and tell em to send down two more and tell em they got to be better than the last lot and tell someone else to clean up this mess kay there was a faint jingle of spurs on the wooden floor as mr spang left the room with a last look at bond a look that held some message that was more than the obvious warning the girl followed him the two men came up to bond and the big one said you heard bond walked slowly after the girl and the two men lined up behind him there was a door behind the bar bond pushed through it and found himself in a station waitingroom with benches and oldfashioned notices about trains and warning you not to spit on the floor right said one of the men and bond turned through a sawnoff swingdoor and on to a plank station platform and then bond stopped in his tracks and hardly noticed a sharp prod in the ribs from a gun barrel it was probably the most beautiful train in the world the engine was one of the old locomotives of the highland light class of around which bond had heard called the handsomest steam locomotives ever built its polished brass handrails and the fluted sanddome and heavy warning bell above the long gleaming barrel of the boiler glittered under the hissing gaslights of the station a wisp of steam came from the towering balloon smokestack of the old woodburner the great sweeping cowcatcher was topped by three massive brass lightsa bulging pilot beam at the base of the smokestack and two storm lanterns below above the two tall driving wheels in fine early victorian gold capitals was written the cannonball and the name was repeated along the side of the blackandgold painted tender piled with birch logs behind the tall square drivers cabin coupled to the tender was a maroon coloured state pullman its arched windows above the narrow mahogany panels were picked out in cream an oval plaque amidships said the sierra belle above the windows and below the slightly jutting barrel roof tonopah and tidewater rr was written in cream capitals on dark blue guess you never seen nuthen like that limey said one of the guards proudly now git goin his voice was muffled by the black silk hood bond walked slowly across and stepped up on to the brassrailed observation platform with the shining brakemans wheel in the centre for the first time in his life he saw the point of being a millionaire and suddenly and also for the first time he thought that there might be more to this man spang than he had reckoned with the interior of the pullman glittered with victorian luxury the light from small crystal chandeliers in the roof shone back from polished mahogany walls and winked off silver fittings and cutglass vases and lampstands the carpets and swagged curtains were winered and the domed ceiling broken at intervals by ovalframed paintings of garlanded cherubs and wreathed flowers against a background of sky and clouds was cream as were the slats of the drawn venetian blinds first came a small diningroom with the remains of a supper for twoa basket of fruit and an open bottle of champagne in a silver bucketand then a narrow corridor from which three doors led bond assumed to the bedrooms and lavatory bond was still thinking about this arrangement as with the guards at his heels he pushed open the door into the state room at the far end of the state room with his back to a small open fireplace flanked by bookshelves gleaming richly with gold tooled leather bindings stood mr spang in a red leather armchair near a small writingdesk half way down the car tiffany case sat bolt upright bond didnt care for the way she was holding her cigarette it was nervous and artificial it looked frightened bond took a few steps down the car to a comfortable chair he turned it round to face them both and sat down and crossed one knee over the other he took out his cigarette case and lit a cigarette and swallowed a deep lungful of smoke and let the smoke come out between his teeth with a long relaxed hiss mr spang had an unlighted cigar jutting from the exact centre of his mouth he took it out stay here wint kidd get along and do what i said the strong teeth bit the words off like inches of celery now you his eyes glittered angrily at bond who are you and whats going on i shall need a drink if were going to talk said bond mr spang eyed him coldly get him a drink wint bond half turned his head bourbon and branchwater he said half and half there was an angry grunt and bond heard the woodwork creak as the heavy man walked back down the pullman bond didnt much like mr spangs question he went back over his story it still looked all right he sat and smoked and looked at mr spang weighing him up the drink came and the guard thrust it into his hand so that some of it slopped on to the carpet thank you wint said bond he took a deep swallow it was strong and good he took another then he put the glass down on the floor beside him he looked up again into the tense hard face i just dont like being leant on he said easily i did my job and got paid if i chose to gamble with the money that was my affair i could have lost and then a lot of your men started breathing down my neck and i got impatient if you wanted to talk to me why didnt you just call me on the telephone putting that tail on was unfriendly and when they got rude and started shooting i thought it was time to do some leaning of my own the blackandwhite face against the coloured books didnt yield you dont get the message feller mr spang said softly mebbe i better bring you up to date gotta coded signal yesterday from london his hand went to the breast pocket of his black western shirt and he slowly pulled out a piece of paper holding bonds eyes with his bond knew the piece of paper was bad news really bad news just as surely as you do when you read the word deeply at the beginning of a telegram this is from a good friend in london said mr spang he slowly released bonds eyes and looked down at the piece of paper it says reliably informed peter franks held by police on unspecified charge endeavour at all costs hold substitute carrier ascertain if operations endangered eliminate him and report there was silence in the car mr spangs eyes rose from the paper and glittered redly down on bond well mister whosis this looks like a good year for something horrible to happen to you bond knew he was for it and part of his mind slowly digested the knowledge wondering how it was going to be done but at the same time another part told him that he had discovered what he wanted to know what he had come to america to find out the two spangs did represent the beginning and the end of the diamond pipeline at this moment he had completed the job he had set out to do he knew the answers now somehow he must get the answers back to m bond reached down for his drink the ice rattled hollowly as he took the last deep swallow and put the glass down he looked candidly up at mr spang i took the job from peter franks he didnt like the look of it and i needed the money dont give me that crap said mr spang flatly youre a cop or a private eye of some sort and im going to find out who you are and who you work for and what you knowwhat you were doing in the acme baths alongside that crooked jock why you carry a gun and where you learnt to handle it how come youre tied in with pinkertons in the shape of that phoney cabdriver things like that you look like an eye and you behave like one and he turned with sudden anger on tiffany case how you fell for him you silly bitch i just cant figure the hell you cant flared tiffany case i get handed the guy by abc and he acts okay you think maybe i should have told abc to try again not me brother i know my place in this outfit and dont think you can push me around and for all you know this guy may be telling the truth her angry eyes swept over bond and he caught the glint of fear fear for him behind them well were going to find out said mr spang and go on finding out until the guy croaks and if he thinks he can take it hes got another think coming he looked over bonds head at the guard wint get kidd and come back with the boots the boots bond sat silent gathering his strength and his courage it would be a waste of time to argue with mr spang or to try to escape fifty miles out in the desert he had got out of worse jams so long as they didnt intend to kill him yet so long as he gave nothing away there was ernie cureo and there was felix leiter there might just possibly be tiffany case he looked across at her her head was bent she was looking carefully at her fingernails bond heard the two guards come up behind him take him out on the platform said mr spang bond saw the corner of his tongue come out and slightly touch the thin lips brooklyn stomping eighty percenter kay okay boss it was the voice belonging to wint it sounded greedy the two hooded men came up and sat down side by side on a dark red chaise longue that ran down the car opposite bond they put football boots down on the thick carpet beside them and started to unlace their shoes flames coming out of the top the black frogmans suit fitted tightly it hurt everywhere why the hell hadnt strangways made certain the admiralty got his measurements right and it was very dark under the sea and the currents were strong pulling him against the coral he would have to swim hard against them but now something had got him by the arm what the hell james for chrissake james she took her mouth away from his ear this time she pinched the naked bloodstained arm as hard as she could and at last bonds eyes opened between their puffed lids and he looked up at her from the wooden floor and gave a shuddering sigh she tugged at him terrified that he would slip away from her again he seemed to understand and he rolled over and struggled on to hands and knees his head hanging down towards the ground like a wounded animal can you walk wait the thick whisper coming through the cracked lips sounded strange to him perhaps she hadnt understood wait he said again and his mind started exploring his body to see what was left of it he could feel his feet and his hands he could move his head from side to side he could see the bars of moonlight on the floor he had been able to hear her it ought to be all right but he just didnt want to move his willpower had gone he just wanted to sleep or even to die anything to lessen the pain that was in him and all over him stabbing hammering grinding himand to kill the memory of the four boots thudding into him and the grunts coming from the two hooded figures directly he thought of the two men and of mr spang the will to live came into bond in a flood and he said okay and then again okay so that she would be sure to understand were in the waiting room whispered the girl we must get to the end of the station left outside the door do you hear me james she reached out and brushed the damp sticky hair away from his forehead have to crawl said bond follow you the girl got to her feet and pushed open the door bond gritted his teeth and crawled out on to the moonlit platform and when he saw the dark patch on the ground rage and revenge gave him strength and he got clumsily to his feet shaking his head to keep the redblack waves from drowning him and with tiffany cases arm round him he limped along the wooden boards to where they sloped down towards the ground beside the gleaming rails and there in the singleline siding was a railroad handcar bond stopped and gazed at it petrol he said vaguely tiffany case gestured towards a row of cans against the station wall just filled her up she whispered back its what they use for inspecting the line and i can work it and i shifted the points hurry get aboard she giggled breathlessly next stop rhyolite my god youre a girl whispered bond but therell be a hell of a noise when we start that thing wait got an idea got some matches half his pain had fallen away from him the breath came fast through his teeth as he turned away from her and focused on the silent tinderdry buildings she was wearing slacks and a shirt she dug into the pocket of the slacks and handed him her lighter whats the idea she said we oughta be moving but bond lurched over to the row of petrol tins and started opening them and hurling the contents over the wooden walls and platform when he had emptied half a dozen cans he went back to her get her going he bent agonizingly down and picked up a crumpled newspaper from beside the rails there was the angry whine of the selfstarter and then the little twostroke engine caught and started hammering busily bond flicked the lighter the piece of paper flared and he flung it away from him amongst the petrol cans the whoosh of flame almost caught him as he threw himself backwards on to the little platform of the car but then the girl let in the clutch and the handcar started down the line there was a rattle and a sickening lurch at the points and then they were out on the main line and the speedometer was trembling at thirty and the girls hair was flowing back like a golden banner towards him bond turned and looked back at the great bloom of fame they had left behind them he could almost hear the dry boards crackling and the shouts of the sleepers as they dashed from their rooms if only it would get wint and kidd and catch the paint on the pullman and fire the wood in the tender of the cannonball and finish off the gangsters box of toys but he and the girl had their own problems what time was it bond gulped down the cool night air and tried to get his mind to work again the moon was low four oclock bond hunched his way painfully up the platform to the two bucket seats and somehow scrambled over and got down beside the girl he put an arm round her shoulders and she turned and smiled into his eyes she raised her voice above the noise of the engine and the hammer of the iron wheels on the rails that was quite an exit like something out of an old buster keaton film how dyou feel she surveyed the battered face you look terrible nothing broken said bond suppose thats whats meant by an eighty percenter he grinned painfully its better being kicked than being shot the girls face cringed i just had to sit there and pretend that i didnt care spang stayed and listened and watched me then they checked up on the ropes and slung you into the waiting room and everyone went happily to bed i waited an hour in my room and then i got busy the worst part was trying to wake you up bond tightened his arm round her shoulders ill tell you what i think of you when it doesnt hurt so much but what about you tiffany youll be in a jam if they catch up with us and who are those two men in the hoods wint and kidd what are they going to do about all this i wouldnt mind seeing a little more of those two the girl glanced sideways at the grim curl of the bruised lips never seen them without those hoods on she said truthfully theyre supposed to be from detroit strictly bad news they do the strongarm work and special undercover jobs theyll all be after us now but dont you worry about me she looked up at him again and her eyes were shining and happy first thing is to get this crate to rhyolite then well have to find a car somewhere and get over the state border into california ive got plenty of money then well get you to a doctor and buy you a bath and a shirt and think again i got your gun one of the help brought it over when theyd finished picking up the pieces of those two guys you wrassled with in the pink garter i collected it after spang had gone to bed she unbuttoned her shirt and dug into the waistband of her slacks bond took the beretta feeling the warmth of her on the metal he flicked out the magazine three rounds left and one in the breach he replaced the magazine put the gun on safe and tucked it into the top of his trousers for the first time he realized that his coat was gone one of his shirt sleeves hung in tatters he tore it off and threw it away he felt for the cigarette case in his righthand hip pocket it was gone but in the lefthand pocket there was still his passport and notecase he pulled them out by the light of the moon he could see that they were cracked arid dented he felt for his money in the notecase it was still there he put the things back in his pocket for a while they drove on with only the purr of the little engine and the clicketyclick of the wheels to break the looming silence of the night for as far as they could see the thin silver line of the rails spun on towards the horizon with only an occasional break marked by a points lever where a rusty branch line curved off into the dark mass of the spectre mountains on their right to their left there was nothing except the endless floor of the desert on which the hint of dawn was beginning to edge the writhing cactus clumps with blue and two miles away the gunmetal shimmer of the moon on highway the handcar sang happily on down the rails there were no controls to bother with except a brake lever and a kind of joystick with a twistgrip accelerator which the girl held fully open with the speedometer steady at thirty and the miles and the minutes clicked by and every now and then bond turned painfully in his seat and inspected the blossoming red glow in the sky behind them they had been going nearly an hour when a thin humming undertone in the air or on the rails made bond stiffen again he looked back over his shoulder was there a tiny glowworm glimmer between them and the false red dawn of the burning ghost town bonds scalp tingled dyou see anything back there she turned her head then without replying she slowed the engine down so that they were coasting quietly they both listened yes it was in the rails a soft quivering not more than a distant sigh its the cannonball said tiffany flatly she gave a sharp twist to the accelerator and the handcar sped on again what can she do asked bond maybe sixty how far to rhyolite around thirty bond worked on the figures for a moment in silence its going to be a near thing cant tell how far away he is can you get anything more out of this not a scrap she said grimly even if my name was casey jones instead of case well be all right said bond you keep her rolling maybe hell blow up or something oh sure she said or maybe the springll run down and hes left the key of his engine at home in his pants pocket for fifteen minutes they sped along in silence and now bond could clearly see the great pilotlight of the engine cutting through the night not more than five miles away and an angry fountain above it from the woodsparks flaming out of the great dome of the smokestack the rails were trembling beneath them and what had been a distant sigh was a low threatening murmur perhaps hell run out of wood thought bond on an impulse he said casually to the girl i suppose were all right for gas oh sure said tiffany put in a whole can theres no indicator but these thingsll run for ever on a gallon of gas almost before the words were out of her mouth and as if to comment on them the little engine gave a deprecating cough put putput then it ran merrily on christ said tiffany dyou hear that bond said nothing he felt the palms of his hands go wet and again put putput tiffany case gingerly nursed the accelerator oh dear little engine she said plaintively beautiful clever little engine please be kind putput putput hiss put hiss and suddenly they were freewheeling along in silence twentyfive said the speedometer twenty fifteen ten five a last savage twist at the accelerator and a kick from tiffany case at the enginehousing and they had stopped said bond once he got painfully out on to the side of the track and limped to the petrol tank at the rear pulling his bloodstained handkerchief out of his trouser pocket he unscrewed the filler cap and lowered the handkerchief down so that it must reach the bottom of the tank he pulled it out and felt it and sniffed it dry as a bone thats that he said to the girl now just lets think hard he looked all round no cover to the left and two miles at least to the road on the right the mountains perhaps a quarter of a mile away they might get there and hide up but for how long it looked the best chance the ground beneath his feet was shaking he looked down the line at the glaring implacable eye how far two miles would spang see the handcar in time would he be able to stop might he be derailed but then bond remembered the great jutting cowcatcher that would sweep the light car out of the way like a bale of straw come on tiffany he called weve got to take to the hills where was she he limped round the car she was running back down the track in front she came up panting theres a branch line just ahead she gasped if we can push the thing there and you can work the old points he might miss us my god said bond slowly then with awe in his voice theres something better than that give me a hand and he bent down and gritted his teeth against the pain and started pushing once started the car moved easily and they only had to follow behind it and keep it rolling they came to the points and bond went on pushing until they were twenty yards past what the hell panted tiffany come on said bond half stumbling half running back to where the rusty switch stuck up beside the rails were going to put the cannoriball on to the branch line oh boy said tiffany case reverently and then they were both at the switch and bonds bruised muscles were cracking as he heaved slowly the rusty metal shifted in the bed where it had lain unmoved for fifty years and millimetre by millimetre the rails showed a crack and then a widening gap as bond strained and jerked at the lever and then it was done and bond knelt on the ground with his head down fighting the dizziness that threatened to drown him but then there was a glare of light on the ground and tiffany tugged at him and he was on his feet again and stumbling back to the car and the whole air was full of thunder and the doleful clanging of the warning bell as the great flaming iron beast came roaring towards them get down and dont move shouted bond above the noise and he thrust her to the ground behind the flimsy shelter of the handcar then he limped quickly to the side of the track and drew his gun and stood sideways on with his pistol arm up like a duellist and squinted back up the track into the great onrushing eye below the volcano of swirling fire and smoke god what a monster could it possibly take the curve wouldnt it just hurtle on into them and smash them to pulp on it came phut something whipped into the ground beside him and there was a pinpoint flash from the cabin boinggg there was another flash and the bullet hit the rail and whined off into the night crack crack crack now he could hear the gun above the rear of the engine something sang sharply in his ear bond held his fire only four bullets and he knew when they would go and then twenty yards away the flying engine thundered into the curve and took the siding with a lurch that sent logs hurtling towards bond off the top of the tender there was a shrill scream oј metal as the flanges on the sixfeettall driving wheels ground into the bend a swift impression of smoke and flame and pounding machinery and then a glimpse into the cabin and of the blackandsilver figure of spang spreadeagled clinging to the side of the cabin with one hand and with the other hand outflung to the long iron handle of the throttle lever bonds gun shouted its four words there was a lightning impression of a white face jerked up towards the sky and then the great blackandgold engine was past and hurtling towards the shadowy wall of the spectre mountains the beam of its pilotlight scything at the darkness ahead and its automatic warningbell clanging sadly on dingdong dingdong dingdong bond slowly tucked the beretta into his trousers and stood looking after the coffin of mr spang and the trail of smoke drifted over his head and for a moment put out the moon tiffany case came running to him and they stood side by side and watched the flaming banner from the tall smokestack and listened to the mountains throw back the echo of the charging locomotive the girl clutched his arm as the engine gave a sudden swerve and vanished behind a spur of rock and now there was only a faraway drumming in the mountains and a red glow that flickered off the crags as the cannonball tore on down the cutting into the belly of the rock and suddenly there was a great tongue of fire and a terrible iron crash as if a battleship had run on a reef and then a muffled clanging that seemed to come from under their feet and finally a deep distant boom from the bowels of the earth and a barrage of miscellaneous echoes and then with the noise gone a steady singing silence bond heaved a deep sigh as if he was just waking up so that was the end of one of the spangs of one of the brutal theatrical overblown deadend adults who made up the spangled mob he had been a stagegangster surrounded with stage properties but that didnt alter the fact that he had intended to kill bond lets get away from here tiffany case said urgently ive had enough of this bond felt the pain creeping back into his body as his tension relaxed yes he said shortly he was glad to turn his back on the memory of the upturned white face in the beautiful black charging engine he felt lightheaded he wondered if he would make it well have to get to the road itll be hard going come on it took them an hour and a half to cover the two miles and by the time he collapsed in the dirt beside the cement highway bond was delirious it was the girl who had got him there but for her he would never have kept a straight course he would have stumbled about amongst the cactus and rock and mica until his strength was exhausted and the broiling sun came to finish the job and now she was cradling his head against her and talking softly to him and wiping the sweat off his face with the corner of her shirt and every now and then she paused to look up and down the deadstraight concrete road whose horizons were already shimmering in the heat waves of early morning an hour later she jumped to her feet and tucked in her shirt and went and stood in the middle of the road a low black car was coming out of the dancing haze which hid the distant valley of las vegas it rolled to a stop just in front of her and a hawklike face under an untidy mop of strawcoloured hair stuck itself out of the window keen grey eyes briefly looked her over they glanced at the prostrate figure of the man in the dust beside the road and came back to her then in a friendly texan drawl the driver said felix leiter mam at your service and what may i do for you on this beautiful morning nothing propinks like propinquity and when i get into town i call my friend ernie cureo james knows him and his wife is having hysterics and ernies in the hospital so i go right along and he tells me the score and i figure that james may need some reinforcements so i jump on my coalblack mare and gallop through the night and when i get near to spectreville i see the light in the sky mr spangs having himself a barbecue i figure and the gate in the fence is open so i decide to join the feast well believe me or believe me not theres not a soul in the place except a guy with a busted leg and multiple contusions whos crawling down the road trying to get away and he looks to me mighty like a young hood called frasso from detroit ernie cureo tells me was one of the guys that took james the fellows in no state to deny this and i more or less get the picture and i figure that rhyolites my next stop so i tell the kid hell soon be having plenty of company from the fire department and i take him to the gate and leave him there and then after a while theres a girl standing in the middle of the desert looking as if shes been fired out of a cannon and here we all are and now you tell so its not all part of a dream and i am lying in the back of the studillac and this is tiffanys lap under my head and that is felix and we are going hell for leather down the road to safety a doctor a bath some food and drink and an endless amount of sleep bond moved and he felt tiffanys hand in his hair to tell it was all real and just like he hoped and he lay still again and said nothing and held each moment to him and listened to their voices and the zip of the tyres on the road at the end of tiffanys story felix leiter gave a reverent whistle jeese mam he said the two of you sure seem to have busted a hole in the spangled mob what in hells going to happen now there are plenty of other hornets in the nest and just sittin around buzzin isnt goin to be their way theyll want some action check said tiffany spang was a member of the syndicate at vegas and these guys stick pretty much together then theres shady tree and those two torpedoes wint and kidd whoever they may be the sooner we cross the stateline the better then what were doin all right so far said felix leiter be at beatty in ten minutes then well get on to and be over the line in half an hour then theres a long ride through death valley and over the mountains down to olancha where we hit no we could stop there and get james to a doc and do some eating and cleaning up then just stay on until we get to la itll be a hell of a drive but we should make la by lunchtime then we can relax a bit and think again my guess is that we oughta get you and james out of the country pretty quick the boysll try and fix all kinds of phoney raps on you both and once youre located i wouldnt give a nickel for either of you best chance would be to get you both on a plane to new york tonight and off to england tomorrow james can take it from there i guess that makes sense said the girl but who is this bond guy anyway whats his racket is he an eye you better ask him yourself mam bond heard leiter say carefully but i wouldnt let that worry you over much hell take care of you bond smiled to himself and in the long silence that followed he dropped off into an uneasy sleep which lasted until they were half way across california and had pulled up outside a white wicket gate that said otis fairplay md and then a mass of surgical tape and streaked with mercurochrome washed and shaved and with a huge breakfast inside him he was back in the car and back in the world and tiffany case had withdrawn into her old ironical and uncompromising manner and bond was making himself useful by watching for speed cops as leiter kept the car in the eighties down the endless dazzling road towards the distant cloudline that hid the high sierras then they were rolling easily along sunset boulevard between the palm trees and the emerald lawns the duststreaked studillac looking incongruous among the glistening corvettes and jaguars and finally towards evening they were sitting in the dark cool bar of the beverley hills hotel and there were new suitcases in the lobby and brand new hollywood clothes and even bonds battlescarred face didnt mean they hadnt all just finished work at the studios there was a telephone on the table beside their martinis felix leiter finished talking to new york for the fourth time since their arrival well thats fixed he said putting back the receiver my pals at the office have got you on the elizabeth been delayed by a strike at the docks sails tomorrow night at eight theyll meet you in the morning at la guardia with the tickets and youll go on board any time in the afternoon they picked up the rest of your things at the astor james one small case and your famous golf clubs and washingtons obliged with a passport for tiffany therell be a man from the state department at the airport youll both have some forms to sign got one of my old pals at the cia to work it the middays have made a big splash with the storyghost town goes west and so onbut they dont seem to have found our friend spang yet and your names dont figure my boys say theres no call out for you with the cops but one of our undercover men says the gangs are looking for you and your descriptions been circulated ten grand attached so its as well youre skipping quick better go aboard separately cover up as much as you can and go down to your cabins and stay there all hells going to bust loose when they get to the bottom of that old mine thatll make leastwise three corpses to nothing and they dont like that kind of score pinkertons seem to have quite a machine said bond with admiration but ill be glad when were both out of here i used to think your gangsters were just a bunch of italian greaseballs who filled themselves up with pizza pie and beer all the week and on saturdays knocked off a garage or a drug store so as to pay their way at the races but theyve certainly got plenty of violence on the payroll tiffany case laughed derisively you ought to get your head examined she said flatly if we make the lizzie all in one piece itll be a miracle thats how good they are thanks to captain hook here weve got a chance but its not more than that greaseballs felix leiter chuckled come on lovebirds he said looking at his watch we ought to get going ive got to get back to vegas tonight and start looking for the skeleton of our old dumb friend shy smile and youve got your plane to catch you can go on fighting at twenty thousand feet get a better perspective from there may even decide to make up and be friends you know how they say he beckoned to the waiter nothing propinks like propinquity leiter drove them out to the airport and dropped them there bond felt a lump in his throat when the lanky figure limped off to his car after being warmly embraced by tiffany case you got yourself a good pal there said the girl as they watched leiter slam the door and heard the deep boom of the exhaust as he accelerated away on his long drive back into the desert yes said bond felix is all right there was the glint of moonlight on the steel hook as leiter waved a last goodbye and then there was the dust settling on the road and the iron voice of the loudspeakers saying transworld airlines flight now loading at gate no for chicago and new york all aboard please and they pushed their way through the glass doors and took the first steps of their long journey half way across the world to london the new superg constellation roared over the darkened continent and bond lay in his comfortable bunk waiting for sleep to carry away his aching body and thinking of tiffany asleep in the bunk below and of where he stood with his assignment he thought of the lovely face cradled on the open hand below him innocent and defenceless in sleep the scorn gone from the level grey eyes and the ironical droop from the corners of the passionate mouth and bond knew that he was very near to being x in love with her and what about her how strong was this masculine protest that had been born on that night in san francisco when the men had broken into her room and taken her would the child and the woman ever come out from behind the barricade she had started to build that night against all the men in the world would she ever come out of the shell that had hardened with each year of solitude and withdrawal bond remembered moments in the last twentyfour hours when he had known the answer moments when a warm passionate girl had looked out happily from behind the mask of the toughie from the gangs the smuggler the shill the blackjack dealer and had said take me by the hand open the door and we will walk away together into the sunshine dont worry i will keep step with you i have always been in step with the thought of you but you didnt come and i have spent my life listening to a different drummer yes he thought it will be all right that side of it but was he prepared for the consequences once he had taken her by the hand it would be for ever he would be in the role of the healer the analyst to whom the patient had transferred her love and trust on her way out of the illness there would be no cruelty equal to dropping her hand once he had taken it in his was he ready for all that that meant in his life and his career bond stirred in his bunk and put the problem away it was too early for that he was going too fast wait and see one thing at a time and he obstinately shelved the issue and shifted his thoughts to m and to the job which still had to be finished before he could spend time worrying about his private life well part of the snake had been smashed was it the head or the tail difficult to say but bond was inclined to think that jack spang and the mysterious abc were the real operators of the smuggling racket and that seraffimo had only handled the receiving end seraffimo could be replaced tiffany could be discarded shady tree whom she could implicate in the diamond smuggling would have to be got under cover until the storm if bond was indeed a storm signal had blown over but there was nothing to implicate jack spang or the house of diamonds and the only clue to abc was the london telephone number which bond reminded himself to extract from the girl as soon as possible that and the machinery of contacts connected with it would be changed directly the full facts of tiffanys defection and bonds escape had been communicated to london presumably by shady tree so all this reflected bond made jack spang his next target and through him abc then there only remained the beginning of the pipeline in africa and that could only be reached through abc bonds immediate concern he concluded before letting sleep take him was to report the whole situation to m as soon as possible after boarding the queen elizabeth and let london take over vallances men would get working there wouldnt be much for bond to do even when he got back a lot of reports to write the same old routine at the office and in the evenings there would be tiffany in the spare room of his flat off the kings road he would have to send a cable to may to get things fixed lets seeflowers bath essence from floris air the sheets just ten hours after leaving los angeles they roared over la guardia and turned out at sea for the long run in it was eight oclock on sunday morning and there were few people about at the airport but an official stopped them as they were walking in off the tarmac and led them to a side entrance where there were two young men waiting one from pinkertons and one from the state department while they chatted about the flights their luggage was brought round and they were taken to a side door and out to where a smart maroon pontiac was waiting its engine purring and the blinds in the rear pulled down and then there were some empty hours in the apartment belonging to the pinkerton man until at around four in the afternoon but with a quarter of an hour between them they were climbing up the covered gangway into the great safe black british belly of the queen elizabeth and were at last in their cabins on m deck with their doors locked against the world but as first tiffany case and then james bond went into the mouth of the gangway a dockhand from anastasias longshoremans union had walked swiftly to a phone booth in the customs shed and three hours later two american businessmen were dropped at the dockside by a black sedan and were just in time to get through immigration and customs and up the gangway before the loudspeakers began calling for all visitors to leave the ship please and one of the businessmen was youngish with a pretty face and a glimpse of prematurely white hair under the stetson with the waterproof cover and the name on the briefcase he was carrying was b kitteridge and the other was a big fattish man with a nervous glare in the small eyes behind the bifocals and he was sweating profusely and constantly wiping his face round with a big handkerchief and the name on the label of his grip was w winter and below the name in red ink was written my blood group is f love and sauce bearnaise punctually at eight the great reverberating efflatus of the queen elizabeths siren made the glass tremble in the skyscrapers and the tugs fussed the big ship out into midstream and nosed her round and at a cautious five knots she moved slowly downriver on the slack tide there would be a pause to drop the pilot at the ambrose light and then the quadruple screws would whip the sea into cream and the elizabeth would give a shudder of release and lance off on the long flat arc up from the jth to the oth parallel and the dot on it that was southampton sitting in his cabin listening to the quiet creak of the woodwork and watching his pencil on the dressingtable roll slowly between his hair brush and the edge of his passport bond remembered the days when her course had been different when she had zigzagged deep into the south atlantic as she played her game of hideandseek with the uboat wolfpacks en route for the flames of europe it was still an adventure but now the queen in her cocoon of protective radio impulsesher radar her loran her echosoundermoved with the precautions of an oriental potentate among his bodyguards and outriders and so far as bond was concerned boredom and indigestion would be the only hazards of the voyage he picked up the telephone and asked for miss case when she heard his voice she gave a theatrical groan the sailor hates the sea she said im feeling sick already and were still in the river just as well said bond stay in your cabin and live on dramamine and champagne ill be no good for two or three days im going to get the doctor and the masseur from the turkish bath and try and stick the bits together again and anyway it wont do any harm to stay out of sight for most of the voyage its just conceivable they picked us up in new york well if you promise to call me up every day said tiffany and promise to take me to this veranda grill place as soon as i feel i can swallow a little caviar okay bond laughed if you absolutely insist he said and now listen in exchange i want you to try and remember anything you can about abc and the london end of this business that telephone number and anything else ill tell you what its all about and why im interested as soon as i can but in the meantime youve just got to trust me is it a deal oh sure said the girl indifferently as if all that side of her life had lost its importance and for ten minutes bond questioned her minutely but except for small details fruitlessly about the abc routine then he put down the receiver and rang for the steward and ordered some dinner and sat down to write the long report which he would have to transpose into code and send off that night the metal mike took the ship quietly on into the darkness and the small township of three thousand five hundred souls settled down to the five days of its life in which there would be all the happenings natural to any other sizeable communityburglaries fights seductions drunkenness cheating perhaps a birth or two the chance of a suicide and in a hundred crossings perhaps even a murder as the iron town loped easily along the broad atlantic swell and the soft night wind thrummed and moaned in the masthead the radio aerials were already transmitting the morse of the duty operator to the listening ear of portishead and what the duty operator was sending at exactly ten pm eastern standard time was a cable addressed abc care house of diamonds hatton garden london which said parties located stop if matter requires drastic solution essential you state price payable in dollars the signature was winter an hour later while the queen elizabeths operator was sighing at the thought of having to transmit five hundred fiveletter groups addressed the managing director universal export regents park london portishead radio was sending a short cable addressed winter first class passenger queen elizabeth which said desire tidy speedy conclusion of case repeat case stop will pay twenty grand stop will personally handle other subject on arrival london confirm abc and the operator looked up winter in the passenger list and put the message in an envelope and sent it down to a cabin on a deck the deck below bond and the girl where two men were playing ginrummy in their shirtsleeves and as the steward left the cabin he heard the fat man say cryptically to the man with white hair whaddya know booful its twenty grand for a rub these days boyohboy it was not until the third day out that bond and tiffany made a date to meet for cocktails in the observation lounge and later to have dinner in the veranda grill at midday the weather was dead calm and after lunch in his cabin bond had got a peremptory message in a round girlish hand on a sheet of the ships writing paper it said fix a rendezme today fail not and bonds hand had gone at once to the telephone they were thirsty for each others company after the three days separation but tiffanys defences were up when she joined him at the obscure corner table he had chosen in the gleaming semicircular cocktail bar in the bows what kind of a tables this she inquired sarcastically you ashamed of me or something here i put on the best those hollywood pansies can dream up and you hide me away like i was miss rheingold want to have myself some fun on this old paddleboat and you put me in a corner as if i was catching thats about it said bond all you want to do is put the other mens temperatures up what dyou expect a girl to do on the queen elizabeth fish bond laughed he signalled to the waiter and ordered vodka dry martinis with lemon peel i could give you one alternative dear diary said the girl having wonderful time with handsome englishman trouble is hes after my family jewels what do i do yours truly puzzled then suddenly she leant over and put her hand on his listen you bond person she said im as happy as a cricket i love being here i love being with you and i love this nice dark table where no one can see me holding your hand dont mind my talk i just cant get over being so happy dont mind my silly jokes will you she was wearing a heavy cream shantung silk shirt and a charcoal skirt in a cottonandwool mixture the neutral colours showed off her cafйaulait sunburn the small square carder watch with the black strap was her only jewellery and the short fingernails on the small brown hand that lay over his were unpainted the reflected sunlight from outside shone on the pale gold heavy falling swerve of her hair in the depths of the chatoyant grey eyes and on the glint of white teeth between the luxurious lips dial were half open with her question no said bond no i wont mind tiffany everything about yous fine she looked into his eyes and was satisfied the drinks came and she withdrew her hand and observed him quizzically over the rim of her glass now tell me a few things she said first of all what do you do and who are you working for at the beginning in the hotel i thought you were a crook but somehow as soon as you had gone out the door i knew you werent guess i should have warned abc and wed have avoided a lot of fuss but i just didnt come on james start giving i work for the government said bond they want to stop this diamond smuggling sort of secret agent just a civil servant okay so what are you going to do with me when we get to london lock me up yes in the spare room of my flat thats better shall i become a subject of the queen like you id rather like to be a subject person i expect we could fix that are you married she paused or anything no i occasionally have affairs so youre one of those oldfashioned men who like sleeping with women why havent you ever married i expect because i think i can handle life better on my own most marriages dont add two people together they subtract one from the other tiffany case thought this over maybe theres something in that she said finally but it depends what you want to add up to something human or something inhuman you cant be complete by yourself what about you the girl hadnt wanted the question maybe i just settled for the inhuman she said shortly and who in hell do you think i should have married shady tree there must have been lots of others well there werent she said angrily maybe you think i shouldnt have mixed with these people well i guess i just got off on the wrong step the flare of anger died and she looked at him defensively it does happen to people james it really does and sometimes its really not their fault james bond put out his hand and held hers tightly i know tiffany he said felix told me a bit about things thats why i havent asked any questions just dont think about it its here and today now not yesterday he changed the subject now you give me some facts for instance why are you called tiffany and whats it like being a dealer at the tiara how the hell did you come to be so good it was brilliant the way you handled those cards if you can do that you can do anything thanks pal said the girl ironically like what playing the boats and the reason i got called tiffany is because when i was born dear father case was so sore i wasnt a boy he gave my mother a thousand bucks and a powder case from tiffanys and walked out joined the marines in the end he got killed at iwo jima so my mother just called me tiffany case and set about earning a living for us both started with a string of callgirls and then got more ambitious maybe that doesnt sound so good to you she looked at him half defensively and half pleadingly doesnt worry me said bond dryly you werent one of the girls she shrugged her shoulders then the place got busted by the gangs she paused and drank the rest of her martini and i lit out on my own the usual jobs a girl takes then i found my way to reno theyve got a school of dealing there and i signed on and worked like hell at it took the full course majored in craps roulette and blackjack you can earn good money dealing two hundred a week the men like to have girls dealing and it gives the women confidence they think youll be kind to them sisters under the skin kind of the men dealers frighten them but dont get the idea its fun it reads better than it lives she paused and smiled up at him now its your turn again she said buy me another drink and then tell me what sort of a woman you think would add to you bond gave his order to the steward he lit a cigarette and turned back to her somebody who can make sauce bйarnaise as well as love he said holy mackerel just any old dumb hag who can cook and lie on her back oh no shes got to have all the usual things that all women have bond examined her gold hair grey eyes a sinful mouth perfect figure and of course shes got to make lots of funny jokes and know how to dress and play cards and so forth the usual things and youd marry this person if you found her not necessarily said bond matter of fact im almost married already to a man name begins with m id have to divorce him before i tried marrying a woman and im not sure id want that shed get me handing round canapйs in an lshaped drawingroom and thered be all those ghastly yes you didno i didnt rows that seem to go with marriage it wouldnt last id get claustrophobia and run out on her get myself sent to japan or somewhere what about children like to have some said bond shortly but only when i retire not fair on the children otherwise my jobs not all that secure he looked into his drink and swallowed it down and what about you tiffany he said to change the subject i guess every girl would like to come home and find a hat on the hall table said tiffany moodily trouble is ive never found the right sort of thing growing under the hat maybe i havent looked hard enough or in the right places you know how it is when you get in a groove you get so that youre quite glad not to look over the edges in that way ive had it good with the spangs always knew where the next meal was coming from put some money by but a girl cant have friends in that company you either put up a notice saying no entry or youre apt to pick up a bad case of round heels but i guess im fed up with being on my own you know what the chorines say on broadway its a lonesome wash without a mans shirt in it bond laughed well youre out of the groove now he said he looked at her quizzically but what about mister seraffimo those two bedrooms on the pullman and the champagne supper laid for two before he could finish her eyes blazed briefly and she stood up from the table and walked straight out of the bar bond cursed himself he put some money down on the bill and hurried after her he caught up with her half way down the promenade deck now listen tiffany he began she turned brusquely round and faced him how mean can you be she said and angry tears glistened on her eyelashes why do you have to spoil everything with an abrasive remark like that oh james forlornly she turned to the windows searching for a handkerchief in her bag she dabbed her eyes you just dont understand bond put an arm round her and held her to him my darling he knew that nothing but the great step of physical love would cure these misunderstandings but that words and time still had to be wasted i didnt mean to hurt you i just wanted to know for certain that was a bad night on the train and that suppertable hurt me much more than what happened later i had to ask you she looked up at him doubtfully you mean that she said searching his face you mean you liked me already dont be a goose said bond impatiently dont you know anything about anything she turned away from him and looked out of the window at the endless blue sea and at the handful of dipping gulls that were keeping company with their wonderfully prodigal ship after a while she said you ever read alice in wonderland years ago said bond surprised why theres a line there i often think of she said it says oh mouse do you know the way out of this pool of tears i am very tired of swimming about here oh mouse remember well i thought you were going to tell me the way out instead of that you ducked me in the pool thats why i got upset she glanced up at him but i guess you didnt mean to hurt bond looked quietly at her mouth and then kissed her hard on the lips she didnt respond but broke away and her eyes were laughing again she linked her arm high up in his and turned towards the open doors that led to the lift take me down she said i must go and rewrite my face and anyway i want to spend a long time dressing the business for sale she paused and then put her mouth close up to his ear in case it interests you james bond she said softly ive never what youd callslept with a man in my life she tugged at his arm and now come on she said brusquely and anyway its time you went and had a hot domestic i suppose thats part of the subjectlanguage youll be wanting me to pick up you subjectpeople surely do write up the craziest things in your bathrooms bond took her to her cabin and then went on to his and had a hot salt bath followed by a cold domestic shower then he lay on his bed and smiled to himself over some of the things she had said and thought of her lying in her bath looking at the forest of bathtaps and thinking how crazy the english were there was a knock on the door and his steward came in with a small tray which he placed on the table what the hells that said bond just come up from the chef sir said the steward and went out and closed the cabin door bond slipped off the bed and went over and examined the contents of the tray he smiled to himself there was a quarter bottle of bellinger a chafing dish containing four small slivers of steak on toast canapйs and a small bowl of sauce beside this was a pencilled note which said this sauce bйarnaise has been created by miss t case without my assistance signed the chef bond filled a glass with champagne and spread a lot of the bйarnaise on a piece of the steak and munched it carefully then he went to the telephone tiffany he heard the low delighted laugh at the other end well you can certainly make wonderful sauce bйarnaise he put the receiver back on its cradle the job comes second it is an intoxicating moment in a loveaffair when for the first time in a public place in a restaurant or a theatre the man puts his hand down and lays it on the thigh of the girl and when she slips her hand over his and presses the mans hand against her the two gestures say everything that can be said all is agreed all the pacts are signed and there is a long minute of silence during which the blood sings it was eleven oclock and there wasonly a scattering of people left in the corners of the veranda grill there was a soft sighing from the moonlit sea outside as the great liner scythed the black meadow of the atlantic and in the stern only the slightest lope in her stride indicated a long soft swell the slow twelveaminute heartbeat of a sleeping ocean to the two people sitting close together behind the pinkshaded light the waiter came with the bill and their hands separated but now there was all the time in the world and no need for reassurance from words or contact and the girl laughed happily up into bonds face as the waiter drew out the table and they walked towards the door they got into the lift for the promenade deck and now what james said tiffany id like some more coffee and a stinger made with white crиme de menthe while we listen to the auction pool ive heard so much about it and we might make a fortune all right said bond anything you say he held her arm close to him as they sauntered through the big lounge where bingo was still being played and through the waiting ballroom where the musicians were trying out a few chords but dont make me buy a number its a pure gamble and five per cent goes to charity nearly as bad as las vegas odds but its fun if theres a good auctioneer and they tell me theres plenty of money on board this trip the smokingroom was almost empty and they chose a small table away from the platform where the chief steward was laying out the auctioneers paraphernalia the box for the numbered slips the hammer the carafe of water in the theatre this is whats known as dressing a thin house said tiffany as they sat down amidst the forest of empty chairs and tables but as bond gave his order to the steward the doors leading to the cinema opened and soon there were nearly a hundred people in the smoking room the auctioneer a paunchy jovial midlands businessman with a red carnation in the buttonhole of his dinner jacket rapped on his table for silence and announced that the captains estimate of the next days run lay between and miles that any distance shorter than was the low field and anything longer than the high field and now ladies and gentlemen lets see if we cant break the record for this trip which stands at the impressive figure of ј in the pool a steward offered the box of folded numbers to the richestlooking woman in the room and then handed up the piece of paper she had drawn to the auctioneer well ladies and gentlemen here we have an exceptionally good number to start with right in the top range and since i see a lot of new faces here tonight i think we can all agree that the sea is exceptionally calm ladies and gentlemen what am i bid for may i say ј will anybody bid me ј for this lucky number was it you said sir well weve got to start somewhere any increase thank you madam and over there steward and from my friend mr rothblatt thank you charlie any increase on ј for no thank you madam and now were all back where we started any increase on ј nobody tempted high number calm sea ј will anybody say going at ј going once going twice and the raised hammer fell with a bang well thank heavens hes a good auctioneer said bond that was a good number and cheap if this weather goes on and nobody falls overboard the high fieldll cost a packet this evening everyone will expect us to do more than miles in this weather what do you mean by a packet asked tiffany two hundred pounds perhaps more i expect the ordinary numbers will sell for around a hundred the first numbers always cheaper than the others people havent warmed up the only smart thing you can do at this game is buy the first number any of them can win but the first costs less as bond finished speaking the next number was knocked down for ј to a pretty excited girl who was obviously being staked by her companion a greyhaired freshcornplexioned man who looked a caricature of an esquire sugardaddy go on buy me a number james said tiffany you really dont treat a girl right look at the way that nice man treats his girl hes past the age of consent said bond he must be sixty up to forty girls cost nothing after that you have to pay money or tell a story of the two its the story that hurts most he smiled into her eyes anyway im not forty yet dont be conceited said the girl she looked at his mouth they say that older men make much the best lovers and yet youre not naturally a tightwad i bet its because gamblings illegal in subjectships or something its all right outside the mile limit said bond but even so the cunard have been damn careful not to involve the company in it listen to this he picked up an orange card that lay on their table auction sweepstake on ships daily run he read in view of inquiries it is considered desirable to restate the companys position in connection with the above it is not the companys wish that the smoke room steward or other members of the ships personnel should play an active part in organizing sweepstakes on the daily run bond looked up you see he said playing it pretty close to the chest and then they go on the company suggests that the passengers should elect a committee from amongst themselves to formulate and control the details the smoke room steward may if requested and if his duties permit render such assistance as the committee require for auctioning of numbers pretty cagey commented bond its the committee that holds the baby if theres any trouble and listen to this this is where the trouble comes in he read on the company draws special attention to the provisions of the united kingdom finance regulations as affecting the negotiability of sterling cheques and the limitation on the importation of sterling banknotes into the united kingdom bond put down the card and so forth he said he smiled at tiffany case so i buy you the number thats just being auctioned and you win two thousand pounds thatll be a pile of dollars and pound notes and cheques the only way of spending all that sterling even suppose that those cheques are all good which is doubtful would be by smuggling it through under your suspender belt and there wed be back in the same old racket but now with me on the side of the devil the girl was not impressed there used to be a guy in the gangs called abadaba she said he was a crooked egghead who knew all the answers worked out the track odds fixed the percentage on the numbers racket did all the brain work they called him the wizard of odds got rubbed out quite by mistake in the dutch schultz killing she added parenthetically i guess youre just another abadaba the way you talk yourself out of having to spend some money on a girl oh well she shrugged her shoulders resignedly will you stake your girl to another stinger bond beckoned to the steward when he had gone she leant over so that her hair brushed his ear and said softly i dont really want it you have it i want to stay sober as sunday tonight she sat up straight and now whats going on around here she said impatiently i want to see some action here it comes said bond the auctioneer raised his voice and there was a hush in the room and now ladies and gentlemen he said impressively we come to the ooodollar question who is going to bid me ј for the choice of high or low field we all know what that meansthe option to choose the high field which i seem to feel may be the popular choice this evening in view of the wonderful weather outside so who will open the bidding with ј for the choice of high or low field thank you sir and no and thank you madam hundred and fifty said a mans voice not far from their table a hundred and sixty this time it was a woman monotonously the mans voice called the eighty said someone two hundred pounds something made bond turn round and look at the man who had spoken it was a biggish man his face had the glistening pasty appearance of a spatout bullseye small cold dark eyes were looking towards the auctioneers platform through motionless bifocals all the mans neck seemed to be at the back of his head sweat matted the curly black algae of his hair and now he took off his glasses and picked up a napkin and wiped the sweat off with a circular motion that started with the left side of the face and swirled round to the back of his head where his right hand took over and completed the circuit as far as the dripping nose two hundred and ten said someone the big mans chin wobbled and he opened his tightbuttoned mouth and said two hundred and twenty in a level american voice what was there about this man that struck a chord in bonds memory he watched the big face running his minds eye over the filing system of his brain pulling out drawer after drawer hunting for the clue the face the voice england america bond gave up and turned his attention to the other man at the table again the same urgent sense of recognition the curiously delicate young features under the slickedback white hair the soft brown eyes under the long lashes the general effect of prettiness spoiled by the fleshy nose over the wide thin mouth now open in a square empty smile like the grin of a letterbox two hundred and fifty said the big man mechanically bond turned to tiffany ever see those two before he said and she noticed the line of worry between his eyes nope she said definitely never did look like something from brooklyn to me or a couple of cloakandsuiters from the garment district why do they mean anything to you bond gave them another glance no he said doubtfully no i dont think so there was a burst of clapping in the room and the auctioneer beamed and rapped on the table ladies and gentlemen he said triumphantly this is really splendid three hundred pounds i am bid by the charming lady in the beautiful pink evening dress and now sir he turnedtowards the fat mans table may i say ј three hundred and fifty said the fat man four hundred squealed the pink woman five hundred the voice was toneless indifferent the pink girl chattered angrily at her escort the man suddenly looked bored he caught the auctioneers eye and shook his head any increase on ј said the auctioneer he now knew that he had squeezed all he would get out of the room going once going twice bang sold to the gentleman over there and i really think he deserves a clap he clapped his hands and the crowd dutifully followed suit although they would have preferred the pink girl to win the fat man lifted himself a few inches off his chair and then sat down again there was no acknowledgment of the applause in his glistening face and he kept his eyes fixed on the auctioneer and now we must go through the formality of asking this gentleman which field he prefers sir do you choose the high field or the low field the auctioneers voice was ironical the question was a waste of time low field there was a moment of dead silence in the crowded smoking room it was quickly followed by a buzz of comment there had been no question it was obvious that the man would take the high field the weather was perfect the queen must be doing at least thirty knots did he know something had he bribed someone on the bridge was a storm coming up was a bearing running hot the auctioneer rapped for silence i beg your pardon sir he said but did you say the low field yes the auctioneer rapped again in that case ladies and gentlemen we will now proceed to auction the high field madam he turned with a bow towards the girl in pink would you care to open the bidding bond turned to tiffany that was a queer business he said extraordinary thing to do seas as calm as glass he shrugged his shoulders the only answer is that they know something the matter was of no interest anyway someones told them something he turned and looked carelessly at the two men and then let his eyes swing past and away from them they seem to be quite interested in us tiffany glanced past his shoulder theyre not looking at us now she said i figure theyre just a couple of dopes the whitehaired guys looking stupid and the fat mans sucking his thumb theyre screwy doubt if they know what theyve bought they just got their signals crossed sucking his thumb said bond he ran his hand distractedly through his hair a vague memory nagging at him perhaps if she had left him to follow the train of thought he would have remembered instead she put her hand over his and leant towards him so that her hair brushed against his face forget it james she said and dont think so hard about those stupid men her eyes were suddenly ardent and demanding ive had enough of this place take me somewhere else without saying anything more they got up and left the table and walked out of the noisy room to the staircase as they went down the stairs to the deck below bonds arm went round the girls waist and her head fell against his shoulder they came to the door of tiffanys cabin but she pulled him away and on down the long softly creaking corridor i want it to be in your house james she said bond said nothing until he had kicked the door of his cabin shut behind them and they had twisted round and stood locked together in the middle of the wonderfully private wonderfully anonymous little room and then he just said softly my darling and put one hand in her hair so that he could hold her mouth where he wanted it and after a while his other hand went to the zip fastener at the back of her dress and without moving away from him she stepped out of her dress and panted between their kisses i want it all james everything youve ever done to a girl now quickly and bond bent down and put an arm round her thighs and picked her up and laid her gently on the floor death is so permanent the last thing bond remembered before the telephone rang was tiffany bending over him in bed and kissing him and saying you shouldnt sleep on the heartside my treasure its bad for the heart it might stop beating turn over and obediently he had turned and as the door clicked he was at once asleep again with her voice and the sigh of the atlantic and the soft roll of the ship holding him in their arms and then the angry bell rang in the dark cabin and went on ringing and bond cursed and reached for it and a voice said sorry to disturb you sir this is the wireless operator theres a cipher signal just come in for you and its got an en clair prefix of most immediate shall i call it out to you or send it down send it down would you said bond and thanks now what the hell all the beauty and heat and excitement of passionate love were pushed roughly away as he turned on the lights slipped out of bed and shaking his head to clear it took the two steps into the shower for a full minute he let the water hit him and then he rubbed himself down and picked up his trousers and shirt from the floor and climbed into them there was a knock on the door and he took the cable and sat down at the desk and lit a cigarette and set grimly to work and as the groups gradually dissolved into words his eyes grew narrower and the skin slowly crawled on his body the cable was from the chief of staff it said firstly clandestine search of saves office revealed signal from qe addressed abc signed winter advising of your and cases presence aboard requesting instructions stop reply addressed winter signed abc orders elimination of case

guinea stop we strongly suspect member of sierra internationals dental surgery staff who being watched stop fourthly raf canberra awaits you boscombe down for immediate onward flight tomorrow night to sierra leone signed cos bond sat for a moment frozen to his chair suddenly there flashed unwanted into his mind that most sinister line in all poetry they reckon ill who leave me out when me they fly i am the wings so somebody from the spangled mob was on board and travelling with them who where his hand snatched at the telephone miss case please he could hear the telephone beside her bed click and then give its first ring the second the third just one more he crashed the receiver back on to its cradle and ran out of his room and up the corridor to her cabin nothing empty the bed unslept in the lights burning but her evening bag lay on the carpet by the door and its contents were scattered around it she had come in the man had been behind the door perhaps a cosh had fallen and then what the portholes were closed he looked into the bathroom nothing bond stood in the middle of the cabin and his mind was as cold as ice what would he bond have done before he killed her he would have questioned her found out what she knew what she had told who this man bond was got her to his cabin where he could work on her undisturbed if somebody met him carrying her there it would only have needed a wink and a shake of the head bit too much champagne tonight no thanks i can manage but which cabin how long had he got bond looked at his watch as he ran back down the silent corridor three oclock she must have left him some time after two should he call the bridge give the alarm a ghastly vista of explanation suspicions delays my dear sir that hardly seems possible attempts to calm him of course sir well do our best the polite eyes of the sergeantatarms who would be thinking in terms of drunkenness and crossing in loveeven of someone trying to delay the ship so as to win the low field in the ships auction the low field man overboard the ship delayed bond slammed the door of his cabin and dived for the passenger list of course winter here he was aqc the deck below and then suddenly bonds mind clicked like a comptometer winter wint and kidd the two torpedoes the men in the hoods back to the passenger list kitteridge in a too the whitehaired man and the fat man in the boac plane from london my blood group is f the secret escort for tiffany and leiters description hes called windy because he hates travelling one day that wart on his thumb will catch him out the red wart on the first joint holding back the hammer of the gun over tingaling bell and tiffany saying theyre screwy the fat mans sucking his thumb and the two men in the smoking room cashing in on the death that had been arranged the woman overboard the alarm given anonymously in case the stern watch missed her the ship stopped turning searching and three thousand pounds extra to the killers wint and kidd the torpedoes from detroit the whole reel of jumbled pictures whirred through bonds mind in a flash of revelation and even while he was scanning them he was opening his small attachй case and extracting the squat silencer from its hidden pocket automatically as he took the beretta from amongst his shirts at the back of a drawer checked the magazine and screwed the silencer into the muzzle he was weighing the odds and planning his moves he hunted for the ships plan that had come with his ticket spread it out while he pulled on his socks a directly below him was there any chance of shooting the lock off the door and getting both of them before they got him practically none and they would have bolted the door as well as locked it or take some of the staff with him if he could persuade them of the danger to tiffany during the palaver and excuse me sirs they would get her out of the porthole and be innocently reading books or playing cards and whats all the fuss about bond shoved the gun into his waistband and wrenched one of his two portholes wide open he thrust his shoulders through relieved to find that there was at least an inch to spare he craned down two dimly lit circles directly below him how far about eight feet the night was still dead calm no wind and he was on the dark side of the ship would he be spotted from the flying bridge would one of their portholes be open bond dropped back into his cabin and tore the sheets off his bed the blood knot that would be safest but he would have to rip the sheets in half to get enough length if he won he would have to get some sheets from aqg and leave their steward to puzzle out the loss if he lost nothing would matter bond put all his strength on the rope should hold as he tied one end round the hinge of the porthole he glanced at his watch only twelve minutes had been wasted since he had read the cable had it been too long he set his teeth and threw the rope out down the side of the ship and climbed out head foremost dont think dont look down dont look up never mind the knots slowly firmly hand over hand the night wind tugged softly at him and swayed him against the black iron rivets and from far down below sounded the deep boom and woosh of the sea from somewhere above came the ropey twang of the wind of their speed in the rigging and far above that the stars would be swinging slowly round the twin masts would the blasted the beloved sheets hold would vertigo get him could his arms stand the weight dont think about it dont think of the huge ship the hungry sea the great quadruple screws waiting to slice into his body you are a boy climbing down an apple tree its so easy and so safe there in the orchard with the grass to fall on bond shut his mind and watched his hands and felt the roughness of the paint against his knuckles and his feet were as sensitive as antennae as they groped below him for the first contact with the porthole there the toes of his right foot had touched the protruding rim he must stop he must be patient and let his foot explore furtherthe wideopen porthole held by its big brass latch the feel of cloth against his sock the curtains closed now he could go on it was nearly over and then two more handholds and his face was level and he could get a hand to the metal rim of the frame and take some of the weight off the taut white rope and give one arm a blessed rest and then the other shifting the burden from the cracking muscles and gathering himself for the slow heave up and through and then the final dive with one hand clutching for his gun he listened gazing at the circle of slowly swaying curtain trying to forget that he was clinging like a fly half way down the side of the queen elizabeth trying not to listen to the sea far below him trying to still his own heavy breath and the hammering of his heart there was a mumble inside the little room a few words in a masculine voice and then a girls voice crying no there was a moments silence and then a slap it was as loud as a pistol shot and it jerked bonds body up and through the porthole as if he had been wrenched inwards by a rope even as he somehow dived cleanly through the threefoot circle he was wondering what he would hit and his left arm protected his head as his right went to his gun crash on to a suitcase under the porthole a ragged somersault that took him half across the room and he was on his feet and backing crouched low towards the portholes and the knuckles were white with tension on his gun hand and there was a thin white line round his clenched lips through the slitted lids the icegrey eyes flickered from side to side the blunt black gun stood at dead centre between the two men all right said bond coming slowly to his full height it was a statement of fact he had the control and the mouth of his gun had said he should have it who sent for you said the fat man youre not in the act there were hidden reserves in the voice no panic not even enough surprise come to make a fourth at gin he was sitting in buttoned shirt sleeves sidewayson to the dressingtable and the small eyes glittered in the moist face in front of him with her back to bond tiffany case sat on an upholstered stool she was naked except for brief fleshcoloured pants and her knees were gripped between the big mans thighs her face with red marks across its paleness was turned towards bond her eyes were wild like a trapped animals and her mouth was open with disbelief the whitehaired man had been lying relaxed on one of the beds now he was up on one elbow and his other hand was at his shirt halfway up to the gun in the black holster at his armpit he looked incuriously at bond and his mouth was square with the empty letterbox smile from the middle of his smile a wooden toothpick protruded from between closed teeth like the tongue of a snake bonds gun held the neutral space between the two men when he spoke his voice was low and taut tiffany he said slowly and distinctly get down on your knees edge away from that man keep your head down get into the middle of the room he didnt watch her and his eyes continued to flicker between the man on the chair and the man on the bed now she was clear of the two targets im there james the voice thrilled with hope and excitement get up and walk straight into the bathroom shut the door get into the bath and lie down his eyes slid towards her to see that he was being obeyed she had stood up and was facing him his eyes registered the red splay of a whole hand on the white skin of her body then she had obeyed him and there was the click of the bathroom door shutting now she was safe from the bullets and she would not witness what had to be done there was five yards between the two men and bond reflected that if they could draw fast enough they had him bracketed with men like these even in the split second of his killing one of them the other would have drawn and fired while his own gun was silent its threat was infinite but with his first bullet for a flash the threat would be lifted from the other man fortyeight sixtyfive eightysix the variation on the american football signal one of fifty other combinations which they must have practised together a thousand times spat out of the fat mans mouth simultaneously he hurled himself on the floor and his hand flashed to his waistband in a swirl of motion the man on the bed swung his legs sideways and away from bond so that his body was now only a narrow headon target the hand at his chest flickered up thud bonds gun gave a single muffled grunt a blue keyhole opened just beneath the peak of the white hair boom answered the dead mans pistol fired by the last twitch of his finger and the bullet buried itself into the bed beneath his corpse the fat man on the floor let out a scream he was looking up into the single empty black eye that didnt care about him one way or the other but was only interested in which square centimetre of his envelope it would open first and the fat mans gun had only achieved the elevation of bonds knees and was pointing futilely between bonds braced legs at the whitepainted ironwork behind him drop it there was a small noise as the gun fell to the carpet get up the fat man scrambled to his feet and stood looking into bonds eyes as a tubercular looks into his handkerchief with fearful expectancy sit down was there a flash of relief in the surrendered eyes bond stayed tense as a stalking cat the fat man turned slowly he stretched his hands above his head although bond had not told him to do so he took the two steps back to his chair and slowly turned round as if to sit down he stood facing bond and quite naturally he let his hands fall down to his sides and the two hands relaxed swung naturally back the right hand more than the left and then suddenly at the top of the backswing the right arm tautened and flashed forward and the throwingknife bloomed from the tips of the fingers like a white flame thud the quiet bullet and the quiet knife crossed in midair and the eyes of the two men flinched simultaneously as the weapons struck but the flinch in the eyes of the fat man turned into an upward roll of the eyeballs as he fell backwards clawing at his heart while bonds eyes only looked incuriously down at the spreading stain on his shirt and at the flat handle of the knife hanging loosely from its folds there was a crash as the chair splintered under the fat man and a rasping noise and then a drumming on the floor bond looked once and then turned away towards the open porthole for a while he stood with his back to the room staring at the softly swaying curtains he gulped down the air and listened to the beautiful seasounds from the world outside dial still belonged to him and to tiffany but not to the two others very slowly his body and his strung nerves relaxed after a time he pulled the knife out of his shirt he didnt look at it but reached up and drew the curtain aside and threw the knife far out into the blackness then still looking out into the quiet night he put up the safe of the beretta and with a hand that suddenly seemed as heavy as lead slowly thrust the gun back into the waistband of his trousers almost reluctantly he turned back and faced the shambles of the cabin he looked it over thoughtfully and with an unconscious gesture he wiped his hands down his flanks then he carefully picked his way across the floor to the bathroom and said its me tiffany in a tired flat voice and opened the door she hadnt heard his voice she was lying face downwards in the empty bath with her hands over her ears and when he had halflifted her out and had taken her into his arms she still couldnt believe it but clung to him and then slowly explored his face and his chest with her hands to make sure it was true he flinched as her hand touched his cut rib and she broke away from him and looked at his face and then at the blood on her fingers and then at his scarlet shirt oh god youre hurt she said flatly and her nightmares were forgotten as she took off his shirt and washed the gashed rib with soap and water and bound it with strips of towel cut with one of the dead mens razor blades she still asked no questions when bond collected her clothes from the floor of the cabin and gave them to her and told her not to come out until he was ready and to clean up everything and wipe every object she had touched to kill the fingerprints she just stood and looked at him with her eyes shining and when bond kissed her on the lips she still said nothing bond gave her a reassuring smile and walked out and shut the door of the bathroom behind him and went about his business doing everything with great deliberation and pausing before each move so as to examine its effect on the eyes and minds of the detectives who would come on board at southampton first he tied an ashtray in his bloodstained shirt to weight it and went to the porthole and threw the shirt as far out as he could the mens tuxedos were hanging behind the door he took the handkerchiefs out of the breast pockets and wrapped them round his hands and searched through the cupboards and the chest of drawers until he found the whitehaired mans evening shirts he put one on and stood for a moment in the centre of the cabin thinking then he gritted his teeth and heaved the fat man into a sitting position took off the fat mans shirt and went to the porthole and took out his beretta held it against the small hole over the heart of the shirt and fired another bullet through the hole now there was a smoke smudge round the hole to look like suicide he dressed the corpse again in its shirt wiped his beretta thoroughly pressed the ringers of the dead mans right hand all over it and finally fitted the gun into his hand with the index finger on the trigger after another pause in the middle of the room he took kidds tuxedo down from its hook and dressed the corpse of kidd in it then he dragged the man across the floor to the porthole and sweating with the effort heaved him up into the porthole and pushed him through he wiped the porthole for prints and paused again getting his breath and surveying the small stage and then he went over to the card table that stood with the litter of an unfinished game against the wall and upset it on the floor so that the cards scattered on the carpet as an afterthought he went again to the fat mans body extracted the wad of notes from his hippocket and strewed them amongst the cards surely the picture would stand up there would be the mystery of the bullet fired into the bed by the dying kidd but that would have been part of the struggle there were three shots gone from the beretta and three cartridges on the floor two of the bullets could have been in the body of kidd which was now in the atlantic there were the two sheets he would have to steal off the second bed their loss would be unexplained perhaps wint had wrapped kidds body in them as a shroud before he pushed kidd out of the porthole that would fit in with wints remorse and suicide following the gunfight over the cards at all events reflected bond it would stand up until the police arrived at the dock and by that time he and tiffany would be off the ship and away and the only trace of them in the cabin would be bonds beretta and that like all other guns belonging to the secret service had no numbers he sighed and shrugged his shoulders and now to take the sheets and get tiffany back to his cabin without being seen cut down the rope dangling from his porthole throw it out into the sea with the spare magazines for the beretta and the empty holster and then at last an age of sleep with her dear body dovetailed against his and his arms round her forever forever as he walked slowly across the cabin to the bathroom bond met the blank eyes of the body on the floor and the eyes of the man whose blood group had been f spoke to him and said mister nothing is forever only death is permanent nothing is forever except what you did to me the pipeline closes there was now no scorpion living in the roots of the great thorn bush which stood at the junction of the three african states the smuggler from the mines had nothing to occupy his mind except an endless column of driver ants flowing along between the low walls which the soldiers had built on both sides of the threeinch highway it was hot and sticky and the man hiding in the thorn bush was impatient and ill at ease this was the last time he would make the rendezvous that was definite they would have to find someone else of course he would be fair with them he would warn them he was quitting and tell them the reasonthe new dental assistant who had joined the staff and who didnt seem to know quite enough about dentistry the man was certainly a spythe careful eyes the little ginger moustache the pope the clean fingernails had one of the boys been caught had one of them turned queens evidence the smuggler shifted his position where the hell was the plane he picked up a handful of dirt and threw it into the middle of the flowing column of ants they hesitated and spilled over the walls of their road as the hurrying rear ranks crowded into them then the soldiers started frantically digging and carrying and in a few minutes the highway was clear the man took off his shoe and slapped it down hard across the moving column there was another brief moment of confusion then the ants set upon the dead bodies and devoured them and the road was open again and the black river flowed on the man swore briefly in afrikaans and pulled on his shoe black bastards he would show them crouching and holding up an arm against the thorns he stamped along the column of ants and out into the moonlight that would give them something to think about then he forgot the hatred he had for all black things and cocked his head towards the north thank heavens he moved round the bush to get the torches and the packet of diamonds out of the tool boxes a mile away in the low bush the big iron ear of the sounddetector had already stopped searching and the operator who had been softly calling the range to the group of three men beside the army truck now said thirty miles speed onetwenty height nine hundred bond glanced at his watch looks as if midnight at full moon is the rendezvous he said and hell be about ten minutes late looks like it sir said the officer from the freetown garrison force who was standing next to him he turned to the third man corporal make sure theres no metal showing through the camouflage net this moonll pick up anything the truck was standing under cover of the low bush on a dirt track that ran across the plain in the direction of the village of telebadou in french guiana that night they had started off from the hills as soon as the locator had picked up the sound of the dentists motor cycle on the parallel track they had driven without lights and they had stopped as soon as the motor cycle had stopped and there was no longer protection from the noise of its engine they had put a camouflage net over the truck and over the locator and over the bulge of the bofors mounted beside it then they had waited not knowing what to expect at the dentists rendezvousanother motor cycle a rider on a horse a jeep an aeroplane now they could hear the distant clatter in the sky bond gave a short laugh helicopter he said nothing else makes that racket get ready to take the net down when he lands we may have to give him a warning shot is the loudhailer switched on yes sir said the corporal at the locator and hes coming in quick you should be able to see him in a minute see those lights just come on sir must be the landing ground bond glanced at the four thin shafts of light and then he looked up again into the great african sky so here came the last of them the last of the gang and yet the first the man hed taken a look at in hatton garden the first of the spangled mob the gang that had rated so high in washington the only one except the harmless rather likeable shady tree bond had not yet had to killor he thought of the pink garter saloon and the two men from detroit almost kill not that he had wanted to kill these people the job m had given him had only been to find out about them but one by one they had tried to kill him and his friends violence had been their first resort not their last violence and cruelty were their only weapons the two men in the chevrolet in las vegas who had shot at him and hit ernie cureo the two men in the jaguar who had bludgeoned ernie and had been the first to draw guns when it came to the fight seraffimo spang who had started to torture him to death and had then tried to shoot them or smash them down on the railway track wint and kidd who had given tingaling bell the treatment and then bond and then tiffany case and of the seven he had killed fivenot because he liked it but because somebody had had to and he had had luck and three good friends felix and ernie and tiffany and the bad men had died and now here came the last of the bad men the man who had ordered his death and tiffanys the man who according to m had built up the traffic in diamonds organized the pipeline and run it ruthlessly and efficiently through the years on the telephone to boscombe down m had been brief and his voice had had an edge to it he had reached bond on the air ministry line a few minutes before the canberra was due to take off for freetown bond had taken the call in the station commanders office with the scream of the canberra testing her jets in the background glad you got back all right thank you sir whats this in the evening papers about a double killing in the queen elizabeth there was more than suspicion in ms voice they were the two killers from the gang sir travelling as winter and kitteridge my steward told me they were supposed to have had a row over cards do you think your steward was right it sounds possible sir there was a pause do the police think so i havent seen any of them sir ill talk to vallance yes sir said bond he knew that this was ms way of saying that if bond had killed the men m would make sure that neither bond nor the service was mentioned at the inquest anyway said m they were small people this man jack spang or rufus saye or abc or whatever he calls himself i want you to get him as far as i can make out hes going back down the pipeline sealing it off probably killing as he goes the end of the line is this dentist try and get them both ive had working alongside the dentist for the last week or so and freetown think theyve got the local picture clear enough but i want to close this case and get you back on your proper job this has been a messy business never liked it from the first more luck than good management that weve got as far as we have yes sir said bond what about this case girl said m ive talked to vallance he doesnt want to prosecute unless you feel strongly about it was ms voice a shade too indifferent bond tried to prevent his answer being too breezy shes been a great help sir he said easily he hoped perhaps we could decide when ive put in my final report where is she now the black receiver was getting slippery in bonds hand shes on her way to london in a daimler hire sir im putting her up in my flat in the spare room that is very good housekeeper shell look after her until i get back im sure shell be all right sir bond took out a handkerchief and wiped the sweat off his face im sure said m there was no irony in his voice all right then well best of luck there was a pause look after yourself and the voice at the other end was suddenly gruff dont think im not pleased with the way things have gone so far exceeded your brief of course but you seem to have stood up to these people very well goodbye james goodbye sir bond looked up into the spangled sky and thought of m and of tiffany and hoped that this would really be the end and that it would be quick and easy and that he would soon be home the smuggler from the mines stood and waited holding the fourth torch in his hand there it was coming right across the moon hell of a noise as usual that was another risk hed be glad to get away from down it came and now it was hovering twenty feet above his head the hand came out and flashed a and the man on the ground winked back the b and the c then the rotor blades flattened and softly the great iron insect sank to the ground the dust settled the diamond smuggler took his hand away from his eyes and watched the pilot climb down his small ladder to the ground he was wearing a flying helmet and goggles unusual and he looked taller than the german the mans spine tingled who was this he walked slowly to meet him got the stuff two cold eyes under straight black brows looked sharply out from behind the goggles they were hidden as the mans head moved and the moon caught the glass now there were just two round blazing white circles in the middle of the shiny black leather helmet yes said the man from the mines nervously but wheres the german he wont be coming again the two white circles stared blindly at the smuggler i am abc i am closing down the pipeline it was an american voice hard and flat and final oh automatically the smugglers hand went inside his shirt he took out the moist packet and held it out as if it was some kind of a peace offering like the scorpion a month earlier he sensed the raised stone above him give me a hand with the gas it was the voice of an overseer giving an order to a coolie but the smuggler stepped quickly forward to obey they worked in silence then it was finished and they were on the ground again the smuggler had been thinking desperately he summoned up the voice of an equal partner the voice of someone who knew the score and had an equal control he peered into the patch of indigo blackness where the pilot stood with his hand on the ladder ive been thinking things over and im afraid and then the voice stopped and the lips drew back from the teeth in the open mouth and the mouth began to make a noise between a snarl and a scream the gun in the pilots hand stammered three times the smuggler said oh in an obsequious voice he pitched backwards into the dust and gave one heave and lay still dont move the clanging voice came over the plain with the screeching echo of the amplifier youre covered there was the sound of an engine starting up the pilot didnt wait to wonder about the voice he leapt for the ladder the door of the cockpit slammed and there was the whirr of the selfstarter the engine roared and the rotor blades swung and slowly gathered speed until they were two whirlpools of silver then there was a jerk and the helicopter was in the air and climbing vertically straight up into the sky down among the low bush the truck stopped with a jerk and bond leapt for the iron saddle of the bofors up corporal he snapped to the man at the elevation lever he bent his eyes to the gridsight as the muzzle rose towards the moon he reached to pull the firing selector lever off safe and put it on single fire and left ten ill keep feeding you tracer the officer beside bond had two racks of five yellowpainted shells in his hands bonds feet settled into the trigger pedals and now he had the helicopter in the centre of the grid steady he said quietly boompa the spangled tracer swung lazily up into the sky just below the speed of sound low and left the corporal delicately twisted the two levers boompa the tracer curved away high over the rising machine bond reached forward and pulled the selector lever to auto fire the movement of his hand was reluctant now it would be certain death he was going to have to do it again boompaboompaboompaboompaboompa the red fire sprayed across the sky still the helicopter went on rising towards the moon and now it was turning away to the north boompaboompa there was a flash of yellow light near the tail rotor and the distant bang of an explosion got him said the officer he picked up a pair of nightglasses tail rotors gone he said and then excitedly gosh it looks as if the whole cabins going round with the main rotor pilot must be getting hell any more said bond holding the whirring machine in his sights no sir said the officer like to get him alive if we can but it looks as if yes hes out of control now coming down in great swoops must be something wrong with the main rotor blades there he goes bond raised his head from the grid sight and shaded his eyes against the blazing moon yes there he was only about a thousand feet up now the engine roaring and the great blades whirring uselessly as the tangle of metal pitched and yawed down the sky in long drunken staggers jack spang the man who had ordered bonds death who had ordered tiffanys death the man bond had only once seen for a few minutes in an overheated room in covent garden mr rufus b saye of the house of diamonds vicepresident for europe the man who played golf at sunningdale and visited paris once a month model citizen m had called him mr spang of the spangled mob who had just killed a manthe final one of how many others bond could imagine the scene in the narrow cockpit the big man holding on with one hand and wrenching at the controls with the other as he watched the needle of the altimeter dip down through the hundreds and there would be the red glare of terror in the eyes and the hundred thousand pound pocketful of diamonds would be just so much deadweight and the gun which had been a strong right arm since boyhood would be no comfort hes coming right back to the bush shouted the corporal above the clatter in the sky hes a goner now said the captain half to himself they watched the last bucketing lurches and then they held their breath as the aircraft seesawing wildly gave a final tip to its nose and as if the bush had been its enemy made an angry dive through a twentyyard curve and hurled itself and the threshing rotors into the stack of thorns before the echoes of the crash had died there came a hollow boom out of the heart of the bush followed by a jagged ball of flame that grew and billowed up into the air so that the moon was dimmed and the whole plain was bathed in an orange glare the captain was the first to speak ouch he said with feeling he slowly lowered his nightglasses and turned to bond well sir he said resignedly thats just about that fraid its going to be morning before we can get anywhere near that lot and then its going to be hours more before we can start raking about in it and this is going to bring the french frontier guards along at the gallop luckily were on pretty good terms with them but the governors going to have a fine time arguing the toss with dakar the officer saw a vista of paperwork stretching ahead the prospect made him tireder than he already was he was matteroffact he had had enough for one day mind if we get a bit of shuteye sir go ahead said bond he looked at his watch better get under the truck sunll be coming up in about four hours not feeling tired myself ill keep an eye out in case the fire looks like spreading the officer gave a curious glance at this quiet enigmatic man who had suddenly arrived in the protectorate amidst a flurry of absolute priority signals if ever a man needed sleep but all this was nothing to do with freetown london stuff thanks sir he said and jumped down from the truck bond slowly took his feet off the triggerpedals and sat back in the iron saddle automatically with his eyes still on the leaping flames his hands felt in the pockets of the faded khaki bushshirt borrowed from the garrison co for his lighter and cigarettes and he took out a cigarette and lit it and put the things back in his pockets so this was the end of the diamond pipeline and the last page on the file he took a deep lungful of smoke and let it out between his teeth in a long quiet sigh six corpses to love game and set bond put up a hand and wiped it across his dripping forehead he pushed back the damp lock of hair above the right eyebrow and the red blaze lit up the hard lean face and flickered in the tired eyes so this great red full stop marked the end of the spangled mob and the end of their fabulous traffic in diamonds but not the end of the diamonds that were baking at the heart of the fire they would survive and move off again across the world discoloured perhaps but indestructible as permanent as death and bond suddenly remembered the eyes of the corpse which had once had a blood group f they had been wrong death is forever but so are diamonds bond dropped down off the truck and started walking slowly towards the leaping fire he smiled grimly to himself all this business about death and diamonds was too solemn for bond it was just the end of another adventure another adventure for which a wry phrase of tiffany case might be the epitaph he could see the passionate ironical mouth saying the words it reads better than it lives
