the wonderful ice cream suit the wonderful ice cream suit ray bradbury it was summer twilight in the city and out front of the quietclicking pool hall three young mexicanamerican men breathed the warm air and looked around at the world sometimes they talked and sometimes they said nothing at all but watched the cars glide by like black panthers on the hot asphalt or saw trolleys loom up like thunderstorms scatter lightning and rumble away into silence hey sighed martinez at last he was the youngest the most sweetly sad of the three its a swell night huh swell as he observed the world it moved very close and then drifted away and then came close again people brushing by were suddenly across the street buildings five miles away suddenly leaned over him but most of the time everything people cars and buildings stayed way out on the edge of the world and could not be touched on this quiet warm summer evening martinezs face was cold nights like this you wish lots of things wishing said the second man villanazul a man who shouted books out loud in his room but spoke only in whispers on the street wishing is the useless pastime of the unemployed unemployed cried vamenos the unshaven listen to him we got no jobs no money so said martinez we got no friends true villanazul gazed off toward the green plaza where the palm trees swayed in the soft night wind do you know what i wish i wish to go into that plaza and speak among the businessmen who gather there nights to talk big talk but dressed as i am poor as i am who would listen so martinez we have each other the friendship of the poor is real friendship we but now a handsome young mexican with a fine thin mustache strolled by and on each of his careless arms hung a laughing woman madre mнa martinez slapped his own brow how does that one rate two friends its his nice new white summer suit vamenos chewed a black thumbnail he looks sharp martinez leaned out to watch the three people moving away and then at the tenement across the street in one fourthfloor window of which far above a beautiful girl leaned out her dark hair faintly stirred by the wind she had been there forever which was to say for six weeks he had nodded he had raised a hand he had smiled he had blinked rapidly he had even bowed to her on the street in the hall when visiting friends in the park downtown even now he put his hand up from his waist and moved his fingers but all the lovely girl did was let the summer wind stir her dark hair he did not exist he was nothing madre mнa he looked away and down the street where the man walked his two friends around a corner oh if just i had one suit one i wouldnt need money if i looked okay i hesitate to suggest said villanazul that you see gуmez but hes been talking some crazy talk for a month now about clothes i keep on saying ill be in on it to make him go away that gуmez friend said a quiet voice gуmez everyone turned to stare smiling strangely gуmez pulled forth an endless thin yellow ribbon which fluttered and swirled on the summer air gуmez said martinez what you doing with that tape measure gуmez beamed measuring peoples skeletons skeletons hold on gуmez squinted at martinez caramba where you been all my life lets try you martinez saw his arm seized and taped his leg measured his chest encircled hold still cried gуmez arm perfect leg chest perfecto now quick the height there yes five foot five youre in shake pumping martinezs hand he stopped suddenly wait you got ten bucks i have vamenos waved some grimy bills gуmez measure me all i got left in the world is nine dollars and ninetytwo cents martinez searched his pockets thats enough for a new suit why why because you got the right skeleton thats why seтor gуmez i dont hardly know you know me youre going to live with me come on gуmez vanished into the poolroom martinez escorted by the polite villanazul pushed by an eager vamenos found himself inside dominguez said gуmez dominguez at a wall telephone winked at them a womans voice squeaked on the receiver manulo said gуmez manulo a wine bottle tilted bubbling to his mouth turned gуmez pointed at martinez at last we found our fifth volunteer dominguez said i got a date dont bother me and stopped the receiver slipped from his fingers his little black telephone book full of fine names and numbers went quickly back into his pocket gуmez you yes yes your money now бndale the womans voice sizzled on the dangling phone dominguez glanced at it uneasily manulo considered the empty wine bottle in his hand and the liquorstore sign across the street then very reluctantly both men laid ten dollars each on the green velvet pool table villanazul amazed did likewise as did gуmez nudging martinez martinez counted out his wrinkled bills and change gуmez flourished the money like a royal flush fifty bucks the suit costs sixty all we need is ten bucks wait said martinez gуmez are we talking about one suit uno uno gуmez raised a finger one wonderful white ice cream summer suit white white as the august moon but who will own this one suit me said manulo me said dominguez me said villanazul me cried gуmez and you martinez men lets show him line up villanazul manulo dominguez and gуmez rushed to plant their backs against the poolroom wall martinez you too the other end line up now vamenos lay that billiard cue across our heads sure gуmez sure martinez in line felt the cue tap his head and leaned out to see what was happening ah he gasped the cue lay flat on all their heads with no rise or fall as vamenos slid it along grinning were all the same height said martinez the same everyone laughed gуmez ran down the line rustling the yellow tape measure here and there on the men so they laughed even more wildly sure he said it took a month four weeks mind you to find four guys the same size and shape as me a month of running around measuring sometimes i found guys with fivefootfive skeletons sure but all the meat on their bones was too much or not enough sometimes their bones were too long in the legs or too short in arms boy all the bones i tell you but now five of us same shoulders chests waists arms and as for weight men manulo dominguez villanazul gуmez and at last martinez stepped onto the scales which flipped inkstamped cards at them as vamenos still smiling wildly fed pennies heart pounding martinez read the cards one hundred thirtyfive pounds one thirtysix one thirtythree one thityfour one thirtyseven a miracle no said villanazul simply gуmez they all smiled upon that genius who now circled them with his arms are we not fine he wondered all the same size all the same dream the suit so each of us will look beautiful at least one night each week eh i havent looked beautiful in years said martinez the girls run away they will run no more they will freeze said gуmez when they see you in the cool white summer ice cream suit gуmez said villanazul just let me ask one thing of course compadre when we get this nice new white ice cream summer suit some night youre not going to put it on and walk down to the greyhound bus in it and go live in el paso for a year in it are you villanazul villanazul how can you say that my eye sees and my tongue moves said villanazul how about the everybody wins punchboard lotteries you ran and you kept running when nobody won how about the united chili con carne and frijole company you were going to organize and all that ever happened was the rent ran out on a twobyfour office the errors of a child now grown said gуmez enough in this hot weather someone may buy the special suit that is made just for us that stands waiting in the window of shumways sunshine suits we have fifty dollars now we need just one more skeleton martinez saw the men peer around the pool hall he looked where they looked he felt his eyes hurry past vamenos then come reluctantly back to examine his dirty shirt his huge nicotined fingers me vamenos burst out at last my skeleton measure it its great sure my hands are big and my arms from digging ditches but just then martinez heard passing on the sidewalk outside that same terrible man with his two girls all laughing together he saw anguish move like the shadow of a summer cloud on the faces of the other men in this poolroom slowly vamenos stepped onto the scales and dropped his penny eyes closed he breathed a prayer madre mнa please the machinery whirred the card fell out vamenos opened his eyes look one thirtyfive pounds another niiracle the men stared at his right hand and the card at his left hand and a soiled tendollar bill gуmez swayed sweating he licked his lips then his hand shot out seized the money the clothing store the suit vamos yelling everyone ran from the poofroom the womans voice was still squeaking on the abandoned telephone martinez left behind reached out and hung the voice up in the silence he shook his head santos what a dream six men he said one suit what will come of this madness debauchery murder but i go with god gуmez wait for me martinez was young he ran fast mr shumway of shumways sunshine suits paused while adjusting a tie rack aware of some subtle atmospheric change outside his establishinent leo he whispered to his assistant look outside one man gуmez strolled by looking in two men manulo and dominguez hurried by staring in three men villanazul martinez and vamenos jostling shoulders did the same leo mr shumway swallowed call the police suddenly six men filled the doorway martinez crushed among them his stomach slightly upset his face feeling feverish smiled so wildly at leo that leo let go the telephone hey breathed martinez eyes wide theres a great suit over there no manulo touched a lapel this one there is only one suit in all the world said gуmez coldly mr shumway the ice cream white size thirtyfour was in your window just an hour ago its gone you didnt sell it mr shumway exhaled no no in the dressing room its still on the dummy martinez did not know if he moved and moved the crowd or if the crowd moved and moved him suddenly they were all in motion mr shumway running tried to keep ahead of them this way gents now which of you all for one one for all martinez heard himself say and laughed well all try it on all mr shumway clutched at the booth curtain as if his shop were a steamship that had suddenly tilted in a great swell he stared thats it thought martinez look at our smiles now look at the skeletons behind our smiles measure here there up down yes do you see mr shumway saw he nodded he shrugged all he jerked the curtain there buy it and ill throw in the dummy free martinez peered quietly into the booth his motion drawing the others to peer too the suit was there and it was white martinez could not breathe he did not want to he did not need to he was afraid his breath would melt the suit it was enough just looking but at last he took a great trembling breath and exhaled whispering ay ay caramba it puts out my eyes murmured gуmez mr shumway martinez heard leo hissing aint it dangerous precedent to sell it i mean what if everybody bought one suit for six people leo said mr shumway you ever hear one single fiftyninedollar suit make so many people happy at the same time before angels wings murmured martinez the wings of white angels martinez felt mr shumway peering over his shoulder into the booth the pale glow filled his eyes you know something leo he said in awe thats a suit gуmez shouting whistling ran up to the thirdfloor landing and turned to wave to the others who staggered laughed stopped and had to sit down on the steps below tonight cried gуmez tonight you move in with me eh save rent as well as clothes eh sure martinez you got the suit have i martinez lifted the white giftwrapped box high from us to us ayhah vamenos you got the dummy here vamenos chewing an old cigar scattering sparks slipped the dummy falling toppled turned over twice and banged down the stairs vamenos dumb clumsy they seized the dummy from him stricken vamenos looked about as if hed lost something manulo snapped his fingers hey vamenos we got to celebrate go borrow some wine vamenos plunged downstairs in a whirl of sparks the others moved into the room with the suit leaving martinez in the hall to study gуmezs face gуmez you look sick i am said gуmez for what have i done he nodded to the shadows in the room working about the dummy i pick dominguez a devil with the women all right i pick manulo who drinks yes but who sings as sweet as a girl eh okay villanazul reads books you you wash behind your ears but then what do i do can i wait no i got to buy that suit so the last guy i pick is a clumsy slob who has the right to wear my suit he stopped confused who gets to wear our suit one night a week fall down in it or not come in out of the rain in it why why why did i do it gуmez whispered villanazul from the room the suit is ready come see if it looks as good using your light bulb gуmez and martinez entered and there on the dummy in the center of the room was the phosphorescent the miraculously whitefired ghost with the incredible lapels the precise stitching the neat buttonholes standing with the white illumination of the suit upon his cheeks martinez suddenly felt he was in church white white it was white as the whitest vanilla ice cream as the bottled milk in tenement halls at dawn white as a winter cloud all alone in the moonlit sky late at night seeing it here in the warm summernight room made their breath almost show on the air shutting his eyes he could see it printed on his lids he knew what color his dreams would be this night white murmured villanazul white as the snow on that mountain near our town in mexico which is called the sleeping woman say that again said gуmez villanazul proud yet humble was glad to repeat his tribute white as the snow on the mountain called im back shocked the men whirled to see vamenos in the door wine bottles in each hand a party here now tell us who wears the suit first tonight me its too late said gуmez late its only ninefifteen late said everyone bristling late gуmez edged away from these men who glared from him to the suit to the open window outside and below it was after all thought martinez a fine saturday night in a summer month and through the calm warm darkness the women drifted like flowers on a quiet stream the men made a mournful sound gуmez a suggestion villanazul licked his pencil and drew a chart on a pad you wear the suit from ninethirty to ten manulo till tenthirty dominguez till eleven mysell till eleventhirty martinez till midnight and why me last demanded vamenos scowling martinez thought quickly and smiled after midnight is the best time friend hey said vamenos thats right i never thought of that okay gуmez sighed all right a half hour each but from now on remember we each wear the suit just one night a week sundays we draw straws for who wears the suit the extra night me laughed vamenos im lucky gуmez held onto martinez tight gуmez urged martinez you first dress gуmez could not tear his eyes from that disreputable varnenos at last impulsively he yanked his shirt off over his head ayyeah he howled ayyeee whisper rustle the clean shirt ah how clean the new clothes feel thought martinez holding the coat ready how clean they sound how clean they smell whisper the pants the tie rustle the suspenders whisper now martinez let loose the coat which fell in place on flexing shoulders ole gуmez turned like a matador in his wonderous suitoflights ole gуmez ole gуmez bowed and went out the door martinez fixed his eyes to his watch at ten sharp he heard someone wandering about in the hall as if they had forgotten where to go martinez pulled the door open and looked out gуmez was there heading for nowhere he looks sick thought martinez no stunned shook up surprised many things gуmez this is the place gуmez turned around and found his way through the door oh friends friends he said friends what an experience this suit this suit tell us gуmez said martinez i cant how can i say it he gazed at the heavens arms spread palms up tell us gуmez i have no words no words you must see yourself yes you must se and here he lapsed into silence shaking his head until at last he remembered they all stood watching him whos next manulo manulo stripped to his shorts leapt forward ready all laughed shouted whistled manulo ready went out the door he was gone twentynine minutes and thirty seconds he came back holding to doorknobs touching the wall feeling his own elbows putting the flat of his hand to his face oh let me tell you he said compadres i went to the bar eh to have a drink but no i did not go in the bar do you hear i did not drink for as i walked i began to laugh and sing why why i listened to myself and asked this because the suit made me feel better than wine ever did the suit made me drunk drunk so i went to the guadalajara refriterнa instead and played the guitar and sang four songs very high the suit ah the suit dominguez next to be dressed moved out through the world came back from the world the black telephone book thought martinez he had it in his hands when he left now he returns hands empty what what on the street said dominguez seeing it all again eyes wide on the street i walked a woman cried dominguez is that you another said dominguez no quetzalcoatl the great white god come from the east do you hear and suddenly i didnt want to go with six women or eight no one i thought one and to this one who knows what i would say be mine or marry me cararnba this suit is dangerous but i did not care i live i live gуmez did it happen this way with you gуmez still dazed by the events of the evening shook his head no no talk its too much later villanazul villanazul moved shyly forward villanazul went shyly out villanazul came shyly home picture it he said not looking at them looking at the floor talking to the floor the green plaza a group of elderly businessmen gathered under the stars and they are talking nodding talking now one of them whispers all turn to stare they move aside they make a channel through which a whitehot light burns its way as through ice at the center of the great light is this person i take a deep breath my stomach is jelly my voice is very small but it grows louder and what do i say i say friends do you know carlyles sartor resartus in that book we find his philosophy of suits and at last it was time for martinez to let the suit float him out to haunt the darkness four times he walked around the block four times he paused beneath the tenement porches looking up at the window where the light was lit a shadow moved the beautiful girl was there not there away and gone and on the fifth time there she was on the porch above driven out by the summer heat taking the cooler air she glanced down she made a gesture at first be thought she was waving to him he felt like a white explosion that had riveted her attention but she was not waving her hand gestured and the next moment a pair of darkframed glasses sat upon her nose she gazed at him ah ah he thought so thats it so even the blind may see this suit he smiled up at her he did not have to wave and at last she smiled back she did not have to wave either then because he did not know what else to do and he could not get rid of this smile that had fastened itself to his cheeks he hurried almost ran around the corner feeling her stare after him when he looked back she had taken off her glasses and gazed now with the look of the nearsighted at what at most must be a moving blob of light in the great darkness here then for good measure he went around the block again through a city so suddenly beautiful he wanted to yell then laugh then yell again returning he drifted oblivious eyes half closed and seeing him in the door the others saw not martinez but themselves come home in that moment they sensed that something had happened to them all youre late cried vamenos but stopped the spell could not be broken somebody tell me said martinez who am i he moved in a slow circle through the room yes he thought yes its the suit yes it had to do with the suit and them all together in that store on this fine saturday night and then here laughing and feeling more drunk without drinking as manulo said himself as the night ran and each slipped on the pants and held toppling to the others and balanced let the feeling get bigger and warmer and finer as each man departed and the next took his place in the suit until now here stood martinez all splendid and white as one who gives orders and the world grows quiet and moves aside martinez we borrowed three mirrors while you were gone look the mirrors set up as in the store angled to reflect three martinezes and the echoes and memories of those who had occupied this suit with him and known the bright world inside this thread and cloth now in the shimmering mirror martinez saw the enormity of this thing they were living together and his eyes grew wet the others blinked martinez touched the mirrors they shifted he saw a thousand a million whitearmored martinezes march off into eternity reflected rereflected forever indomitable and unending he held the white coat out on the air in a trance the others did not at first recognize the dirty hand that reached to take the coat then vamenos pig you didnt wash cried gуmez or even shave while you waited compadres the bath the bath said everyone no vamenos flailed the night air im dead they hustled him yelling out and down the hall now here stood vamenos unbelievable in white suit beard shaved hair combed nails scrubbed his friends scowled darkly at him for was it not true thought martinez that when vamenos passed by avalanches itched on mountaintops if he walked under windows people spat dumped garbage or worse tonight now this night he would stroll beneath ten thousand wideopened windows near balconies past alleys suddenly the world absolutely sizzled with flies and here was vamenos a freshfrosted cake you sure look keen in that suit vamenos said manulo sadly thanks vamenos twitched trying to make his skeleton comfortable where all their skeletons had so recently been in a small voice vamenos said can i go now villanazul said gуmez copy down these rules villanazul licked his pencil first said gуmez dont fall down in that suit vamenos i wont dont lean against buildings in that suit no buildings dont walk under trees with birds in them in that suit dont smoke dont drink please said vamenos can i sit down in this suit when in doubt take the pants off fold them over a chair wish me luck said vamenos go with god vamenos he went out he shut the door there was a ripping sound vamenos cried martinez he whipped the door open vamenos stood with two halves of a handkerchief torn in his hands laughing rrrip look at your faces rrrip he tore the cloth again oh oh your faces your faces ha roaring vamenos slammed the door leaving them stunned and alone gуmez put both hands on top of his head and turned away stone me kill me i have sold our souls to a demon villanazul dug in his pockets took out a silver coin and studied it for a long while here is my last fifty cents who else will help me buy back vamenos share of the suit its no use manulo showed them ten cents we got only enough to buy the lapels and the buttonholes gуmez at the open window suddenly leaned out and yelled vamenos no below on the street vamenos shocked blew out a match and threw away an old cigar butt he had found somewhere he made a strange gesture to all the men in the window above then waved airily and sauntered on somehow the five men could not move away from the window they were crushed together there i bet he eats a hamburger in that suit mused villanazul im thinking of the mustard dont cried gуmez no no manulo was suddenly at the door i need a drink bad manulo theres wine here that bottle on the floor manulo went out and shut the door a moment later villanazul stretched with great exaggeration and strolled about the room i think ill walk down to the plaza friends he was not gone a minute when dominguez waving his black book at the others winked and turned the doorknob dominguez said gуmez yes if you see vamenos by accident said gуmez warn him away from mickey murrillos red rooster cafй they got fights not only on tv but out front of the tv too he wouldnt go into murrillos said domlnguez that suit means too much to vamenos he wonldnt do anything to hurt it hed shoot his mother first said martinez sure he would martinez and gуmez alone listened to dominguezs footsteps hurry away down the stairs they circled the undressed window dummy for a long while biting his lips gуmez stood at the window looking out he touched his shirt pocket twice pulled his hand away and then at last pulled something from the pocket without looking at it he handed it to martinez martinez take this what is it martinez looked at the piece of folded pink paper with print on it with names and numbers his eyes widened a ticket on the bus to el paso three weeks from now gуmez nodded he couldnt look at martinez he stared out into the summer night turn it in get the money he said buy us a nice white panama hat and a pale blue tie to go with the white ice cream suit martinez do that gуmez shut up boy is it hot in here i need air gуmez i am touched gуmez but the door stood open gуmez was gone mickey murrillos red rooster cafй and cocktail lounge was squashed between two big brick buildings and being narrow had to be deep outside serpents of red and sulphurgreen neon fizzed and snapped inside dim shapes loomed and swam away to lose themselves in a swarming night sea martinez on tiptoe peeked through a flaked place on the redpainted front window he felt a presence on his left heard breathing on his right he glanced in both directions manulo villanazul i decided i wasnt thirsty said manulo so i took a walk i was just on my way to the plaza said villanazul and decided to go the long way around as if by agreement the three men shut up now and turned together to peer on tiptoe through various flaked spots on the window a moment later all three felt a new very warm presence behind them and heard still faster breathing is our white suit in there asked gуmezs voice gуmez said everybody surprised hi yes cried dominguez having just arrived to find his own peephole theres the suit and praise god vamenos is still in it i cant see gуmez squinted shielding his eyes whats he doing martinez peered yes there way back in the shadows was a big chunk of snow and the idiot smile of vamenos winking above it wreathed in smoke hes smoking said martinez hes drinking said dominguez hes eating a taco reported villanazul a juicy taco added manulo no said gуmez no no no ruby escuadrillos with him let me see that gуmez pushed martinez aside yes there was ruby two hundred pounds of glittering sequins and tight black satin on the hoof her scarlet fingernails clutching vamenos shoulder her cowlike face floured with powder greasy with lipstick hung over him that hippo said dominguez shes crushing the shoulder pads look shes going to sit on his lap no no not with all that powder and lipstick said gуmez manulo inside grab that drink villanazul the cigar the taco dominguez date ruby escuadrillo get her away бndale men the three vanished leaving gуmez and martinez to stare gasping through the peephole manulo hes got the drink hes drinking it ay theres villanazul hes got the cigar hes eating the taco hey dominguez hes got ruby what a brave one a shadow bulked through murrillos front door traveling fast gуmez martinez clutched gуmezs arm that was ruby escuadrillos boy friend toro ruiz if he finds her with vamenos the ice cream suit will be covered with blood covered with blood dont make me nervous said gуmez quickly both ran inside they reached vamenos just as toro ruiz grabbed about two feet of the lapels of that wonderful ice cream suit let go of vamenos said martinez let go that suit corrected gуmez toro ruiz tapdancing vamenos leered at these intruders villanazul stepped up shyly villanazul smiled dont hit him hit me toro ruiz hit villanazul smack on the nose villananul holding his nose tears stinging his eyes wandered off gуmez grabbed one of toro ruizs arms martinez the other drop him let go cabrуn coyote vaca toro ruiz twisted the ice cream suit material until all six men screamed in mortal agony grunting sweating toro ruiz dislodged as many as climbed on he was winding up to hit vamenos when villanazul wandered back eyes streaming dont hit him hit me as toro ruiz hit villanazul on the nose a chair crashed on toros head ai said gуmez toro ruiz swayed blinking debating whether to fall he began to drag vamenos with him let go cried gуmez let go one by one with great care toro ruizs bananalike fingers let loose of the suit a moment later he was ruins at their feet compadres this way they ran vamenos outside and set him down where he freed himself of their hands with injured dignity okay okay my time aint up i still got two minutes and lets see ten seconds what said everybody vamenos said gуmez you let a guadalajara cow climb on you you pick fights you smoke you drink you eat tacos and now you have the nerve to say your time aint up i got two minutes and one second left hey vamenos you sure look sharp distantly a womans voice called from across the street vamenos smiled and buttoned the coat its ramona alvarez ramona wait vamenos stepped off the curb vamenos pleaded gуmez what can you do in one minute and he checked his watch forty seconds watch hey ramona vamenos loped vamenos look out vamenos surprised whirled saw a car heard the shriek of brakes no said all five men on the sidewalk martinez heard the impact and flinched his head moved up it looks like white laundry he thought flying through the air his head came down now he heard himself and each of the men make a different sound some swallowed too much air some let it out some choked some groaned some cried aloud for justice some covered their faces martinez felt his own fist pounding his heart in agony he couid not move his feet i dont want to live said gуmez quietly kill me someone then shuffling martinez looked down and told his feet to walk stagger follow one after the other he collided with other men now they were trying to run they ran at last and somehow crossed a street like a deep river through which they could only wade to look down at vamenos vamenos said martinez youre alive strewn on his back mouth open eyes squeezed tight tight vamenos motioned his head back and forth back and forth moaning tell me tell me oh tell me tell me tell you what vamenos vamenos clenched his fists ground his teeth the suit what have i done to the suit the suit the suit the men crouched lower vamenos its why its okay you lie said vamenos its torn it must be it must be its torn all around underneath no martinez knelt and touched here and there vamenos all around underneath even its okay vamenos opened his eyes to let the tears run free at last a miracle he sobbed praise the saints he quieted at last the car hit and run gуmez suddenly remembered and gared at the empty street its good he didnt stop wed have everyone listened distantly a siren walled someone phoned for an ambulance quick said vamenos eyes rolling set me up take off our coat vamenos shut up idiots cried vamenos the coat thats it now the pants the pants quick quick peуnes those doctors you seen movies they rip the pants with razors to get them off they dont care theyre maniacs ah god quick quick

maniacs with the razors right leg on left leg there the zipper cows zip my zipper babbled vamenos the siren died madre mнa yes just in time they arrive vamenos lay back down and shut his eyes gracias martinez turned nonchalantly buckling on the white pants as the interns brushed past broken leg said one intern as they moved vamenos onto a stretcher compadres said vamenos dont be mad with me gуmez snorted whos mad in the ambulance head tilted back looking out at them upside down vamenos faltered compadres when when i come from the hospital am i still in the bunch you wont kick me out look ill give up smoking keep away from murrillos swear off women vamenos said martinez gently dont pronsise nothing vamenos upside down eyes brimming wet martinez there all white now against the stars oh martinez you sure look great in that suit compadres dont he look beautiful villanazul climbed in beside vamenos the door slammed the four remaining men watched the ambulance drive away then surrounded by his friends inside the white suit martinez was carefully escorted back to the curb in the tenement martinez got out the cleaning fluid and the others stood around telling him how to clean the suit and later how not to have the iron too hot and how to work the lapels and the crease and all when the suit was cleaned and pressed so it looked like a fresh gardenia just opened they fitted it to the dummy two oclock murmured villanazul i hope vamenos sleeps well when i left him at the hospital he looked good manulo cleared his throat nobody else is going out with that suit tonight huh the others glared at him manulo flushed i mean its late were tired maybe no one will use the suit for fortyeight hours huh give it a rest sure well where do we sleep the night being still hot and the room unbearable they carried the suit on its dummy out and down the hall they brought with them also some pillows and blankets they climbed the stairs toward the roof of the tenement there thought martinez is the cooler wind and sleep on the way they passed a dozen doors that stood open people still perspiring and awake playing cards drinking pop fanning themselves with movie magazines i wonder thought martinez i wonder if yes on the fourth floor a certain door stood open the beautiful girl looked up as the men passed she wore glasses and when she saw martinez she snatched them off and hid them under her book the others went on not knowing they had lost martinez who seemed stuck fast in the open door for a long moment he could say nothing then he said josй martinez and she said celia obregуn and then both said nothing he heard the men moving up on the tenement roof he moved to follow she said quickly i saw you tonight he came back the suit he said the suit she said and paused but not the suit eh he said she lifted the book to show the glasses lying in her lap she touched the glasses i do not see well you would think i would wear my glasses but no i walk around for years now hiding them seeing nothing but tonight even without the glasses i see a great whiteness passes below in the dark so white and i put on my glasses quickly the suit as i said said martinez the suit for a little moment yes but there is another whiteness above the suit another your teeth oh such white teeth and so many martinez put his hand over his mouth so happy mr martinez she said i have not often seen such a happy face and such a smile ah he said not able to look at her his face flushing now so you see she said quietly the suit caught my eye yes the whiteness filled the night below but the teeth were much whiter now i have forgotten the suit martinez flushed again she too was overcome with what she had said she put her glasses on her nose and then took them off nervously and hid them again she looked at her hands and at the door above his head may i he said at last may you may i call for you he asked when next the suit is mine to wear why must you wait for the suit she said i thought you do not need the suit she said but if it were just the suit she said anyone would be fine in it but no i watched i saw many men in that suit all different this night so again i say you do not need to wait for the suit madre mнa madre mнa he cried happily and then quieter i will need the suit for a little while a month six months a year i am uncertain i am fearful of many things i am
