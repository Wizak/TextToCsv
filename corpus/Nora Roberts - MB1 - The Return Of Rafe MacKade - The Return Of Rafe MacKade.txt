 prologue the mackade brothers were looking for trouble they usually were in the small town of antietam maryland it wasnt always easy to find but then looking was half the fun when they piled into jareds secondhand chevy theyd squabbled over who would take the wheel it was jareds car and he was the eldest but that didnt carry much weight with his three brothers rafe had wanted to drive hed had a need for speed a thirst to zip along those dark winding roads with his foot hard on the gas and his foul and reckless mood chasing behind him he thought perhaps he could outdistance it or perhaps meet it headon if he met it bloodied it conquered it he knew he would just keep driving until he was somewhere else anywhere else they had buried their mother two weeks ago perhaps because his dangerous mood showed so clearly in rafes jade eyes and in the cold set of his mouth hed been outvoted in the end devin had taken the wheel with jared riding shotgun rafe brooded in the back seat with his youngest brother shane beside him they were a rough and dangerous group the mackade boys all of them tall and rangy as wild stallions with fists ready and often too eager to find a target their eyes mackade eyes all varying shades of green could carve a man into pieces at ten paces when the dark mood was on them a wise man stayed back eleven or more they settled on pool and beer though shane complained as he was still shy of twentyone and wouldnt be served in duffs tavern still the dim smokechoked bar suited them the slam and crack of the balls had just enough of a violent edge the gaze of the scrawnyshouldered duff dempsey was just uneasy enough the wariness in the eyes of the other customers gossiping over their beers was just flattering enough nobody doubted the mackade boys were out for trouble in the end they found what they were looking for while a cigarette dangled from the corner of his mouth rafe squinted against the smoke and eyed his shot he hadnt bothered to shave in a couple of days and the rough stubble mirrored his mood with a solid smack a followthrough smooth as silk he banked the cue ball kissed it off the seven and made his pocket good thing youre lucky at something at the bar joe dolin tipped back his beer he was as usual after sundown mostly drunk and mean with it hed once been the star of the high school football team had competed with the mackades for the favors of pretty young girls now at barely twentyone his face had begun to bloat and his body to sag the black eye hed given his young wife before leaving the house hadnt really satisfied him rafe chalked his cue and barely spared joe a glance going to take more than hustling pool mackade to keep that farm going now that your mamas gone dangling his bottle from two fingers joe grinned heard youre going to have to start selling off for back taxes heard wrong coolly rafe circled the table to calculate his next shot oh i heard right you mackadesve always been fools and liars before shane could leap forward rafe shot out his cue to block the way hes talking to me he said quietly he held his brothers gaze another moment before he turned isnt that right joe youre talking to me im talking to any of you as he lifted his beer again joes gaze skimmed over the four of them at twenty shane was tough from farm work but still more boy than man then devin whose cool thoughtful gaze revealed little over jared who was leaning negligently against the juke box waiting for the next move he looked back at rafe there was temper hot and ready recklessness worn like a second skin but youll do always figured you for the biggest loser of the lot rafe that so rafe crushed out his cigarette lifted his own beer he drank as they completed the ritual before battle and customers shifted in their chairs to watch howre things going at the factory joe least i get a paycheck joe shot back i got money in my pocket aint nobody going to take my house from over me not as long as your wife keeps putting in twelvehour shifts working tables to pay the rent shut your mouth about my wife i earn the money in my house i dont need no woman paying my way like your mama had to do for your old man went through her inheritance like it was water then up and died on her yeah he died on her anger and guilt and grief welled up inside him but he never laid a hand on her she never had to come into town hiding behind scarves and dark glasses and saying how she took a fall only thing your mother ever fell over joe was your fathers fist joe slammed his beer onto the bar shattering the glass thats a lie im going to ram that lie down your throat try it hes drunk rafe jared murmured those lethal green eyes sliced toward his brother so so there isnt much point in breaking his face when hes drunk jared moved a shoulder hes not worth it but rafe didnt need a point he just needed action he lifted his cue studied it then laid it across the table you want to take me on joe dont you start in here though he knew it was already too late duff jerked a thumb toward the wall phone you make any trouble in here im calling the sheriff and the lot of you can cool off in jail keep your damn hand off the phone rafe warned him his eyes were hard enough to have the bartender backing off outside he said simply you and me curling his fists joe stared at the mackades i aint having your brothers jumping in on me while i whip your butt i dont need any help with you to prove it the moment they cleared the door rafe pivoted to avoid joes swing rammed his fist into joes face and felt the first satisfying spill of blood he couldnt even have said why he was fighting joe meant less to him than the dust in the street but it felt good even when joe got past his guard and connected it felt good fists and blood were the only clear solution when he felt the satisfying crack of knuckles against bone he could forget everything else devin winced then tucked his hands philosophically in his pockets when blood spurted from his brothers mouth i give it five minutes hell rafell take him down in three grinning shane watched the grunting opponents wrestle to the ground ten bucks youre on come on rafe shane shouted whip his sorry butt it took three minutes plus thirty nasty seconds with rafe straddling joe and methodically pumping a fist into his face since joes eyes had rolled up white and his arms were limp at his sides jared stepped forward to drag his brother away hes finished to decide the matter jared rammed rafe up against the brick wall of the bar hes finished he repeated let it go the vicious rage drained slowly fading from rafes eyes uncurling his fists emptying him let go jare im not going to hit him again rafe looked to where joe lay moaning halfunconscious over his battered body devin counted out bills for shane i should have factored in how drunk he was devin commented if hed been sober it wouldve taken rafe the five rafe would never waste five full minutes on a punk like that jared shook his head the arm that was restraining rafe slipped companionably around rafes shoulders want another beer no he glanced toward the window of the bar where most of the patrons had gathered to watch absently he swiped blood from his face somebody better pick him up and haul him home he called out lets get out of here when he settled in the car again the aches and bruises began to make themselves known with half an ear he listened to shanes enthusiastic playbyplay of the bout and used devins bandanna to mop more blood from his mouth he was going nowhere he thought doing nothing being nothing the only difference between him and joe dolin was that joe was a drunk on top of it he hated the damn farm the damn town the damn trap he could feel himself sinking into with every day that passed jared had his books and studies devin his odd and ponderous thoughts shane the land that seemed to delight him he had nothing on the edge of town where the land began to climb and the trees to thicken he saw a house the old barlow place dark deserted and haunted so it was said it stood alone unwanted with a reputation that caused most of the townspeople to ignore it or eye it warily just as they did rafe mackade pullover hell rafe you going to be sick not concerned so much as apprehensive shane gripped his own door handle no pull over damn it jared the minute the car stopped rafe was out and climbing the rocky slope brambles thick with thorns and summer growth tore at his jeans he didnt need to look behind or hear the curses and mutters to know that his brothers were following him he stood looking up at three stories of local stone mined he supposed from the quarry a few miles out of town some of the windows were broken and boarded and the double porches sagged like an old womans back what had once been a lawn was overgrown with wild blackberries thistles and witchgrass a dead oak rose from it gnarled and leafless but as the moon wheeled overhead and the breeze sang chants through the trees and tall grass there was something compelling about the place the way it stood two hundred years after its foundation had been laid the way it continued to stand against time weather and neglect and most of all he thought the way it stood against the distrust and gossip of the town it overlooked going to look for ghosts rafe shane stood beside him eyes gleaming against the dark maybe remember when we spent the night there on a dare absently devin plucked a blade of grass rolled it between bis fingers ten years ago i guess it was jared snuck upstairs and started creaking doors shane wet his pants hell i did hell you didnt this incited the predictable shoving match which the older brothers ignored when are you leaving jared said quietly hed known it saw it now in the way rafe looked at the house into it beyond it tonight ive got to get away from here jare do something away from here if i dont im going to be like dolin maybe worse moms gone she doesnt need me anymore hell she never needed anybody got any idea where youre going no south maybe to start he couldnt take his eyes off the house he would have sworn it was watching him judging him waiting ill send money when i can though he felt as though someone were wrenching off one of his limbs jared merely shrugged well get by you have to finish law school mom wanted that rafe glanced behind to where the shoving match had progressed to wrestling in the weeds theyll handle themselves okay once they figure out what they want shane knows what he wants the farm yeah with a thin smile rafe took out a cigarette go figure sell off some of the land if you have to but dont let them take it we have to keep whats ours before its over this towns going to remember the mackades meant something rafes smile widened for the first time in weeks the gnawing ache inside him eased his brothers were sitting on the ground covered with dirt and scratches and laughing like loons he was going to remember them that way he promised himself just that way the mackades holding together on rocky ground no one wanted chapter the bad boy was back the town of antietam was buzzing over it passing fact rumor and innuendo from one to another the way the guests at a boardinghouse passed bowls of steaming stew it was a rich broth spiced with scandal sex and secrets rafe mackade had come back after ten years some said there would be trouble bound to be trouble hung around rafe mackade like a bell around a bulls neck wasnt it rafe mackade whod decked the high school principal one spring morning and gotten himself expelled wasnt it rafe mackade whod wrecked his dead daddys ford pickup before he was old enough to drive and surely it was rafe mackade whod tossed a table and that fool manny johnson through the plateglass window of duffs tavern one hot summer night now hed come back ariding into town in some fancy sports car and parking bold as you please right in front of the sheriffs office of course his brother devin was sheriff now had been for five years last november but thered been a time and most remembered when rafe mackade spent more than a night or two in one of the two cells in the back oh he was as handsome as ever so the women said with those devils good looks the mackades were gifted or cursed with if a female had breath in her body shed look twice maybe even sigh over that long wiry build that looselegged stride that seemed to dare anyone to get in the way then there was that thick black hair those eyes as green and hard as the ones in that little chinese statue in the window of the past times antique store they did nothing to soften that tough sharpjawed face with that little scar along the left eye god knew where hed gotten that but when he smiled when he curved that beautiful mouth up and that little dimple winked at the corner a womans heart was bound to flutter that sentiment came directly from sharilyn fenniman whod taken that smile and his twenty dollars for gas at the gas and go just outside of town before rafe had his car in gear again sharilyn had been burning up the phone wires to announce the return so sharilyn called her mama and mrs metz got right on her horse and told mrs hawbaker down at the general store that rafe maybe plans to stay as she spoke cassandra dolin topped off regans coffee the way snow was spitting out of the january sky and clogging streets and sidewalks there was little business at eds cafe that afternoon slowly cassie straightened her back and tried to ignore the ache in her hip where it had struck the floor after joe knocked her down why shouldnt he smiling regan bishop loitered over her mulligan stew and coffee he was born here wasnt he even after three years as a resident and shopkeeper of antietam regan still didnt understand the towns fascination with comings and goings it appealed to and amused her but she didnt understand it well yeah but hes been gone so long only came back for a day or so at a time once or twice in ten whole years cassie looked out the window where the snow fell thin and constant and wondered where he had gone what he had seen what he had done oh she wondered what there was out there you look tired cassie regan murmured hmm no just daydreaming this keeps up theyre going to call school early i told the kids to come straight here if they did but then thats what theyll do theyre great kids they are when she smiled some of the weariness lifted from her eyes why dont you get a cup have some coffee with me a scan of the cafe showed regan there was a customer in a back booth dozing over his coffee a couple at the counter chatting over the stew special youre not exactly overrun with business seeing cassie hesitate regan pulled out her trump you could fill me in on this rafe character well cassie nibbled on her up ed im going to take a break okay at the call a bony woman with a frizzed ball of red hair stuck her head out of the kitchen sparklingframed glasses rested on her scrawny chest above her bib apron you go ahead honey her low voice rasped from two packs of cigarettes a day her face was carefully painted from red lips to red eyebrows and glowed from the heat of the stove hey there regan youre fifteen minutes over your lunch hour i closed at noon regan told her well aware that her clocklike schedule amused edwina crump people arent looking for antiques in this kind of weather its been a hard winter cassie brought a cup to the table and poured coffee for herself were not even through january and the kids are already getting tired of sledding and making snowmen she sighed careful not to wince when the bruise on her hip ached when she sat she was twentyseven a year younger than regan she felt ancient after three years of friendship regan recognized the signs are things bad cassie keeping her voice low she laid a hand over cassies did he hurt you again im fine but cassie kept her eyes on her cup guilt humiliation fear stung as much as a backhand slap i dont want to talk about joe did you read the pamphlets i got you about spousal abuse the womens shelter in hagerstown i looked at them regan i have two children i have to think of them first but please cassie lifted her gaze i dont want to talk about it all right struggling to hold back the impatience regan squeezed her hand tell me about bad boy mackade rafe cassies face cleared i always had a soft spot for him all of them there wasnt a girl in town who didnt moon a few nights over the mackade brothers i like devin regan sipped at her coffee he seems solid a little mysterious at times but dependable you can count on devin cassie agreed nobody thought any of them would turn out but devin makes a fine sheriff hes fair jared has that fancy law practice in the city and shane well hes rough around the edges but he works that farm like two mules when they were younger and they came barreling into town mothers locked up their daughters and men kept their backs to the wall real upstanding citizens huh they were young and always seemed angry at something rafe most of all the night he left town rafe and joe got into it over something rafe broke joes nose and knocked out a couple of his teeth really regan decided she might like this rafe after all he was always looking for a fight rafe was their father died when they were kids id have been about ten she mused then their mama passed on right before rafe left town shed been sick nearly a year thats how things at the farm got so bad around then most people thought the mackades would have to sell out but they held on well three of them did mmm cassie savored the coffee it was so rare to have a moment just to sit they were barely more than boys jared would have been right about twentythree and rafes just ten months behind him devins about four years older than me and shanes a year behind him sounds like mrs mackade was a busy woman she was wonderful strong she held everything together no matter how bad it got i always admired her sometimes you need to be strong to let things go regan murmured she shook her head shed promised herself she wouldnt push so what do you think hes come back for i dont know they say hes rich now made a pile buying land and houses and selling them again hes supposed to have a company and everything mackade thats what he calls it just mackade my mother always said hed end up dead or in jail but her voice trailed off as she looked through the window oh my she murmured sharilyn was right hmm he looks better than ever curious regan turned her head just as the door jingled open as black sheep went she was forced to admit this one was a prime specimen he shook snow from thick hair the color of coal dust and shrugged off a black leather bomber jacket that wasnt meant for east coast winters regan thought he had a warriors face the little scar the unshaven chin the slightly crooked nose that kept that mouthwatering face from being too pretty his body looked hard as granite and his eyes sharp green were no softer in worn flannel torn jeans and scarred boots he didnt look rich and successful but he sure looked dangerous it amused and pleased rafe to see eds place was so much the same those could be the same stools at the counter that hed warmed his seat on as a child anticipating a sundae or a fountain drink surely those were the same smells grease frying onions the haze from eds constant cigarettes an undertone of pine cleaner he was sure ed would be back in the kitchen flipping burgers or stirring pots and sure as hell that was old man tidas snoring in the back booth while his coffee went cold just as hed always done his eyes cool assessing skimmed over the painfully white counter with its clearplastictopped plates of pies and cakes over the walls with their blackandwhite photos of civil war battles to a booth where two women sat over coffee he saw a stranger an impressive one honey brown hair cut in a smooth chinlength swing that framed a face of soft curves and creamy skin long lashes over dark and coolly curious blue eyes and a sassy little mole right at the corner of a full and unsmiling mouth pictureperfect he thought just like something cut out of a glossy magazine they studied each other assessed each other as a man or woman might assess a particularly attractive trinket in a shop window then his gaze shifted to land on the fragile little blonde with the haunted eyes and the hesitant smile son of a bitch his grin flashed and upped the temperature by twenty degree little cassie connor rafe i heard you were back the sound of her giggle as rafe plucked her from the booth had regans brow lifting it was rare to hear cassie laugh so freely pretty as ever he said and kissed her full on the lips tell me you kicked that idiot out and left the path clear for me she eased back always fearful of wagging tongues ive got two kids now a boy and a girl i heard he tugged the strap of her bib apron and thought with some concern that shed lost too much weight youre still working here yeah eds in the back ill go see her in a minute resting a hand casually on cassies shoulder he looked back at regan whos your pal oh sorry this is regan bishop she owns past times an antique and decorating store a couple doors down regan this is rafe mackade of the mackade brothers she offered a hand words already traveled im sure it has he took her hand held it as his eyes held hers antiques thats a coincidence im in the market are you shed risk her dignity if she tugged her hand from his from the gleam in his eye she was sure he knew it any particular era midtolates everything from soup to nuts ive got a threestory house about twelve hundred square feet to furnish think you can handle it it took a lot of willpower for her to keep her jaw from dropping she did well enough with tourists and townspeople but a commission like this would easily triple her usual income im sure i can you bought a house cassie said interrupting them i thought youd be staying out at the farm for now the house isnt for living in not for me after some remodeling restoring ill be opening it up as a bedandbreakfast i bought the old barlow place stunned cassie bobbled the coffeepot shed fetched the barlow place but its haunted a reckless light glinted in his eyes damn right it is how about a piece of that pie to go with the coffee cassie ive worked up an appetite regan had left but rafe had loitered for an hour entertained when cassies kids burst in out of the snow he watched her fuss over them scold the boy for forgetting to put on his gloves listened to the bigeyed little girl solemnly relate the adventures of the day there was something sad and somehow soothing about watching the girl he remembered settling her two children at a booth with crayons and books a lot had stayed the same over a decade but a lot had changed he was well aware that news of his arrival was even now singing over telephone wires it pleased him he wanted the town to know he was back and not with his tail between his legs as many had predicted he had money in his pocket now and plans for the future the barlow place was the heart of his plans he didnt subscribe to ghosts under most circumstances but the house had certainly haunted him now it belonged to him every old stone and bramble and whatever else it held he was going to rebuild it as he had rebuilt himself one day he would stand at the top window and look down on the town he would prove to everyone even to rafe mackade that he was somebody he tucked a generous tip under his cup careful to keep the amount just shy of one that would embarrass cassie she was too thin he thought and her eyes were too guarded that weary fragility had been thrown into sharp relief when she sat with regan now there was a woman he mused who knew how to handle herself steady eyes stubborn chin soft hands she hadnt so much as blinked when he offered her a shot at furnishing an entire inn oh he imagined her insides had jolted but she hadnt blinked as a man whod earned his keep on the wheel and deal he had to admire her for it time would tell if shed hold up to the challenge and there was no time like the present that antique place two doors down thats right cassie kept one eye on her children as she brewed a fresh pot of coffee on the left i dont think shes open though rafe shrugged into his jacket and grinned oh i bet she is he strolled out hatless jacket open his footsteps muffled by the cushioning snow as hed expected the lights were on inside past times instead of seeking shelter inside he studied her window display and found it clever and effective a sweep of blue brocade like a pool of shimmering water flowed over varying levels a brighteyed porcelain doll sat on a childsize ladderback rocker an artful tumble of antique toys at her feet a snarling jade dragon curled on a pedestal a glossy mahogany jewelry box stood open glittery baubles spilling out of its drawers as though a womans hands had slid through them in search of just the right piece perfume bottles were arranged in pretty sunbursts of color on an enameled shelf put the sparkles up front he thought with a nod and rope the customers in sleigh bells hung on the door tinkled musically when he opened it the air inside was spiced with cinnamon and cloves and apples and he realized after a deep breath of it of regan bishop the subtle and sultry perfume hed noted in the cafe just teased the air he took his time wandering furniture was meticulously arranged for traffic patterns a settee here an occasional table there lamps bowls vases all doing double duty as display and decoration a dining room table was gracefully set with china and glassware candles and flowers as if guests were expected any moment an old victrola stood open beside a cabinet filled with s there were three rooms each as polished and organized as the last nowhere in her inventory did he notice a single speck of dust he paused by a kitchen hutch filled with white stoneware dishes and bluetinted mason jars its a nice piece regan said from behind him we have one like this in the kitchen at the farm he didnt turn hed known she was there my mother kept the everyday dishes in it white ones like these and glasses thick ones that didnt break easy she threw one at me once when i sassed her did she hit you no would have if shed meant to now he turned and flashed that killer grin she had a hell of an arm what are you doing in the middle of nowhere regan bishop selling my wares rafe mackade your wares arent halfbad how much for the dragon in the window you have excellent taste its fivefifty thats steep regan reaching out he slipped open the single gold button of her navy blazer she found the little gesture oddly intimate but refused to comment on it you get what you pay for if youre smart you can get more he tucked his thumbs in the front pockets of his jeans and began to wander again how long have you been in town three years last summer from when she didnt answer he glanced back lifted one of those sexy black brows just making conversation darling i like to get a handle on the people im doing business with we havent done any business yet she tucked her hair behind her ear and smiled darling his laugh erupted quick and charming little ripples of response skidded up her spine he was she was sure the man every mother had ever warned her daughter about as tempting as it was business was business and it always came first i think im going to like you regan he tilted his head you sure are a looker making conversation again an observation with a smile hovering around his mouth he glanced down at her hands she wore rings pretty glittery stones and twists of gold any of those mean anything thats going to get in my way her stomach fluttered her spine stiffened id say that depends on which way youre heading nope he declared youre not married youd have tossed that in my face so satisfied he sat on a red velvet love seat tossed his arm over the curved back want to sit down no thanks did you come in to do business or to talk me into bed i never talk women into bed he smiled at her no she thought hed just have to flash that smile and crook his finger business regan relaxed he crossed his booted feet for now just business all right then ill offer you some hot cider ill take it she moved through a doorway into the back alone rafe brooded for a moment he hadnt meant to be so obvious hadnt realized he was quite so attracted there had been something about the way she stood there in her tailored blazer and tasteful jewelry her eyes so cool and amused her scent just short of hot if hed ever seen a woman who announced a thorny road it was regan bishop though he rarely chose the smooth path he had too much on his plate to take the challenge then she came back in on those long glamorous legs that pretty swing of hair half curtaining her face what the hell he thought he could always make room on his plate thanks he took the steaming enameled mug she offered i figured on hiring a firm out of dc or baltimore maybe taking some time to hunt through some shops myself i can acquire anything a firm in dc or baltimore can and offer a better price she hoped maybe the thing is i like the idea of keeping the business close to home well see what you can do he sipped the cider found it hot and pungent what do you know about the barlow place its falling apart i think its a crime that nothings been done to preserve it this part of the country is usually careful with its historic areas and buildings but the town ignores that place if i had the means id have bought it myself and youd have gotten more than you bargained for the house is solid as rock if it wasnt so well built if d be rubble by now but it needs work he mused and began to picture it all in his head floors to be leveled and sanded and sealed walls to be plastered or taken down windows replaced the roofs a mess he brought himself back shrugged thats just time and money when its ready i want to put it back the way it looked in when the barlows lived there and watched the battle of antietam from their parlor window did they regan asked with a smile id have thought theyd have been cowering in the root cellar not the way i imagine it the rich and privileged watching the show maybe annoyed when cannon fire cracked a window or the screams of the dead and dying woke the baby from its nap youre a cynical one being rich wouldnt mean you wouldnt feel horror if you had to watch men dying on your front lawn the heart of the battle didnt get quite that close anyway thats what i want the right colors trim wallpaper furnishings doodads the works he had an urge for a cigarette and banked it how do you feel about redoing a haunted house interested she eyed him over the rim of her mug besides i dont believe in ghosts you will before its done i spent the night there once as a kid with my brothers creaking doors rattling chains no he didnt smile now except the ones jared arranged to scare the guts out of the rest of us theres a spot on the stairway thatll turn your skin to ice you can smell smoke near the living room hearth and you can feel something looking over your shoulder when you walk down the hallways if its quiet enough and youre listening you can hear sabers clash despite herself she couldnt quite suppress a shudder if youre trying to scare me off the commission you wont just laying out the blueprint ill want you to take a look at the place go through the rooms with me well see what kind of ideas you have tomorrow afternoon suit you about two thatll be fine ill need to take measurements good he set his mug aside rose nice doing business with you again she accepted his hand welcome home youre the first one whos said it enjoying the irony he lifted her hand to his lips watching her then again you dont know any better see you tomorrow and regan he added on his way to the door take the dragon out of the window i want it on the way out of town he pulled his car to the side of the road and stopped ignoring the snow and the icy fingers of the wind he studied the house on the rise of the hill its broken windows and sagging porches revealed nothing just as rafes shadowed eyes revealed nothing ghosts he mused while snow drifted silently around him maybe but he was beginning to realize that the only ghosts he was trying to put to rest were inside him chapter x he beauty of owning your own shop as far as regan was concerned was that you could buy and sell what you chose your hours were your own to make and the atmosphere was your own to create still being the sole proprietor and sole employee of past times didnt mean regan bishop tolerated any slack as her own boss she was tough often intolerant and expected the best from her staff as that staff she worked hard and rarely complained she had exactly what shed always wanted a home and business in a small rural town away from the pressures and headaches of the city where shed lived the first twentyfive years of her life moving to antietam and starting her own business had been part of her fiveyear plan after she graduated from american university she had degrees in history and business management tucked under her belt and by the time she donned cap and gown shed already earned five years experience in antiques working for someone else now she was the boss every inch of the shop and the cozy apartment atop it was hers and the banks the mackade commission was going to go a long way toward making her share a great deal larger the minute rafe left the afternoon before regan had locked up and dashed to the library shed checked out an armload of books to supplement her own research volumes by midnight when her eyes had threatened to cross she had read and taken notes on every detail of life as it applied to the civil war era in maryland she knew every aspect of the battle of antietam from lees march to his retreat across the river from mcclellans waffling to president lincolns visit to a farm outside sharpsburg she knew the number of dead and wounded the bloody progress over hill and through cornfield it was sad and standard information and shed studied it before indeed her fascination with the battle and the quiet area into which it had exploded had influenced her choice of a home but this time shed been able to find bits and pieces on the barlows both fact and speculation the family had lived in the house on the hill for almost a hundred years before that horrible day in september of prosperous landowners and businessmen they had lived like lords their balls and dinners had enticed guests from as far as washington and virginia she knew how they had dressed the frock coats and lace and the hooped skirts silk hats and satin slippers she knew how they had lived with servants pouring wine into crystal goblets their home decorated with hothouse flowers their furniture glowing with bees wax polish now negotiating snowy windy roads under sparkling sunlight she could see exactly the colors and fabrics the furnishings and knickknacks that would have surrounded them chiffoniers of rosewood she mused wedgwood china and horsehair settees the fine chippendale chestonchest for the master the graceful cherrywoodandbeveledglass secretaire for bis lady brocade portieres and rich colonial blue for the walls in the parlor rafe mackade was going to get his moneys worth and oh she hoped his pockets were deep the narrow broken lane leading up to the house was deep in snow no tire tracks or handy plow had marred its pretty pristine and very inconvenientwhite blanket annoyed that rafe hadnt taken care of that detail regan eased her car onto the shoulder armed with her briefcase she began the long trudge up at least shed thought to wear boots she told herself as the snow crept past her ankles shed very nearly worn a suit and heels before she remembered that impressing rafe mackade wasnt on her agenda the gray trousers tailored blazer and black turtleneck were acceptable business wear for an assignment such as this and as she doubted the place was heated the red wool coat would come in handy inside as well as out it was a fabulous and intriguing place she decided as she crested the hill all those flecks of mica in the stone glinting like glass in the sunlight made up for the boarded windows the porches sagged but the building itself rose up tall and proud against the bitter blue sky she liked the way the east wing jutted off at a stern angle the way the trio of chimneys speared from the roof as if waiting to belch smoke she even liked the way the broken shutters hung drunkenly it needed tending she thought with an affection that surprised her someone to love it and accept its character for what it was someone who would appreciate its strengths and understand its weaknesses she shook her head and laughed at herself it sounded as though she were thinking of a man one perhaps like rafe mackade rather than a house she walked closer through the deep powdery drifts rocks and overgrown brush made uneven lumps in the snow like children under blankets waiting to do mischief brambles were sneaky enough to grab at her trousers with sharp wiry fingers but once the lawn had been lush and green and vivid with flowers if rafe had any vision it would be again reminding herself that the landscaping was his problem she puffed her way to the broken front porch he was she thought with a scowl late began looked around stomped her feet for warmth and glanced at her watch the man could hardly expect her to stand out in the cold and the wind and wait ten minutes tops she told herself then she would leave him a note a very firm note on the value of keeping appointments and leave but it wouldnt hurt to take a peek in the window maneuvering carefully she inched her way up the steps avoided broken planks there should be wisteria or morning glories climbing up the side arbor she mused and for a moment she almost believed she could catch the faint sweet scent of spring she caught herself moving to the door closing her hand over the knob before she realized that had been her intention all along surely it was locked she thought even small towns werent immune to vandals but even as she thought it the knob turned freely in her hand it was only sensible to go in out of the wind begin to site the job yet she pulled her hand back with a jerk her breath was coming in gasps shockingly loud on the silent air inside her neat leather gloves her hands were icy and trembling out of breath from the climb she told herself shivering from the wind that was all but the fear was on her like a cat hissing through her blood embarrassed she looked uneasily around there was no one to see her ridiculous reaction only snow and trees she took a deep breath laughed at herself and opened the door it creaked of course that was to be expected the wide main hall gave her such a rush of pleasure she forgot everything else closing the door she leaned back against it and sighed there was dust and mold damp patches on the walls baseboards ruined by gnawing mice spiderwebs draped like filthy gauze she saw rich deep green paint creamy ivory trim the buff and shine of waxed pine floors under her feet a runner blooming with cabbage roses and there she thought a hunt table with a dresden bowl spilling more roses flanked by silver candlesticks a little walnut hall chair with a pierced back a hammered brass umbrella stand a gilded mirror how it had been and could be spun through her mind and she didnt feel the cold that sent her breath ahead of her in clouds as she wandered in the parlor she marveled over the adam fireplace the marble was filthy but undamaged she had twin vases in the shop that would be perfect for the mantel and a needlepoint footstool that was meant for weary feet in front of this very hearth delighted she pulled out her notebook and got to work cobwebs dragged through her hair dirt smudged her cheek dust covered her boots as she measured and plotted she was in heaven her mood was so high that when she heard the footsteps she turned with a smile instead of a complaint its wonderful i can hardly she was talking to thin air frowning she walked out of the parlor and into the hall she started to call out then noted that there were no footprints in the dust but her own imagining things she told herself and shuddered big empty houses made all sorts of noises settling wood wind against the windows rodents she thought with a grimace she wasnt afraid of mice or spiders or creaking boards but when the floor groaned over her head she couldnt muffle the shriek her heart flew straight to her throat and beat like a birds before shed managed to compose herself again she heard the unmistakable sound of a door closing she was across the hall in a dash fumbling for the knob when it hit her rafe mackade oh he thought he was clever she thought furiously sneaking into the house ahead of her creeping through the back she imagined he was up there right now doubled over at the idea of her bolting from the house like some idiotic gothic heroine with a heaving bosom not on your life she thought determinedly and straightened her shoulders she thrust her chin up and marched to the curving stairs youre not funny mackade she called out now if youve finished your pathetic little joke id like to get some work done when the cold spot hit her she was too shocked to move the hand shed gripped on the rail went numb with it her face froze with it there halfway up the graceful sweep of stairs she swayed it was her own whimper that broke her free she was up to the first landing in four effortless strides a draft she told herself cursing her own sobbing breaths just a nasty draft rafe her voice broke infuriating her biting her lip she stared down the long hallway at the closed and secretive doors that lined it rafe she said again and struggled to put irritation in her voice rather than nerves i have a schedule to keep if you dont so can we get on with this the sound of wood scraping wood the violent slam of a door and a womans heartbroken weeping pride forgotten regan flew down the stairs shed nearly reached the bottom when she heard the shot then the door shed rushed to meet groaned slowly open the room whirled once twice then vanished come on darling snap out of it regan turned her head moaned shivered all the way out pal open those big blue eyes for me the voice was so coaxing she did and found herself looking into rafes it wasnt funny a bit dizzy with relief he smiled and stroked her cheek what wasnt hiding upstairs to scare me she blinked to bring the world back into sharp focus and discovered she was cradled on his lap on the window seat in the parlor let me up i dont think so youre still a little shaky on your pins just relax a minute he shifted her expertly so that her head rested in the crook of his arm im fine youre white as a sheet if i had a flask id pour some brandy into you never saw a woman faint as gracefully though you sort of drifted down gave me a chance to catch you before your head knocked against the floor if you expect me to thank you forget it she shoved found him unmovable its your fault thanks its flattering to think the sight of me has a woman dropping at my feet there he traced a finger down her cheek again that brought some color back if this is the way you do business you can take your job and she ground her teeth let me up lets try this lifting her he plopped her down on the seat beside him hands off he added lifting his now why dont you tell me why youre ticked off at me pouting she brushed at her smudged trousers you know very well all i know is i walked in the door and saw you doing a swan dive ive never fainted in my life and she was thoroughly mortified that she had done so now in front of him if you want me to work on this house scaring me into unconsciousness isnt the way to do it he studied her reached into his pocket for the cigarettes hed given up exactly eight days before how did i scare you by walking around upstairs opening and closing doors making those ridiculous noises maybe i should start off by telling you i got held up at the farm i didnt leave until fifteen minutes ago i dont believe you i dont blame you if he wasnt going to smoke he had to move rising he strolled over to the hearth he thought he caught a whiff of smoke as from a fire that had recently died shane was there and so was cy martin hes mayor now i know who cy martin is she said testily you should have known him in high school rafe mused he was a complete ass anyway cy dropped by to see if shane could plow his lane he was still there when i left fifteen minutes ago i borrowed shanes fourwheel to make the hill parked it and came to the door in time to see your eyes roll back in your head he walked back to her stripped off his coat and tucked it over her legs by the way howd you get in i she stared at him swallowed i opened the door it was locked no it wasnt lifting a brow he jingled the keys in his pocket thats interesting youre not lying she said after a moment not this time why dont you tell me what you heard footsteps but there was no one there to warm them she tucked her hands under his coat boards creaking upstairs i started up it was cold bitterly cold and it frightened me so i went to the landing you were scared so you went up instead of out i thought you were up there i was going to yell at you her smile was weak but it was there i was furious that youd managed to make me jump then i looked down the hallway i guess i knew you werent there i heard wood scrape and a door slam hard and someone crying then i bolted he sat beside her again put his arm around her shoulders in a friendly squeeze who wouldnt a shot she remembered i was almost down the stairs when i heard a gunshot it made my ears ring then the door opened and lightsout i shouldnt have been late unexpectedly he leaned over and gave her a quick casual kiss sorry thats hardly the point the thing is some people feel things in this place some dont you struck me as the cool practical type she folded her arms over her chest oh really singleminded he added with a grin it seems you have more imagination than i expected feeling better now im fine sure you dont want to sit on my lap again quite sure thank you with his eyes on hers he brushed a cobweb from her hair want to get out of here absolutely he picked up his coat id like to take you somewhere that isnt necessary i said i was she stood and as he held his ground bumped into his chest fine she managed business darling he tucked her hair behind her ear flicked a finger over the squarecut aquamarine at the lobe for the moment i think we can find someplace a little warmer and more hospitable to hash out the details that was reasonable she decided perfectly sensible all right she picked up her briefcase and walked ahead of him to the door regan yes your face is dirty he laughed at the smoldering look she shot at him then scooped her up in his arms even as she stuttered a protest he carried her over the broken porch got to watch your step he told her setting her on the feet next to a jeep i make a habit of it i bet you do he murmured as he rounded the hood he maneuvered ms way down the lane circled around her car and kept going i thought id follow you she began since i dont think you mean to the ends of the earth lets just take one car ill bring you back from home sweet home darling in the snow with the sun glazing the white fields the mackade farm was currier and ives pretty a stone house with covered porch an arched roof on the red barn weathered outbuildings and a pair of golden dogs barking and yipping and kicking up snow completed the scene one that appealed to regan shed driven past the mackade place countless times when the fields were brown and furrowed from the plow when they were high with hay and corn shed even stopped once or twice when shane was riding his tractor and thought how completely suited he seemed to be to the land she couldnt picture rafe mackade in the same scene you didnt come back to farm i imagine hell no shane loves it devin tolerates it jared looks on it as an ongoing enterprise she tilted her head as he parked the jeep beside his car and you hate it no ties to the land i didnt say that i said i hated farming rafe hopped out of the jeep clucking at the leaping golden retrievers before regan could step down into the footdeep snow hed plucked her up i wish youd stop that im perfectly capable of walking through a little snow city boots pretty enough though he commented as he carried her onto the porch youve got little feet stay out he ordered the dogs smoothly he opened the door elbowed it aside and carried her in hey rafe what you got there grinning rafe shifted regan in his arms and winked at shane got me a female goodlooking one too shane tossed the log he held onto the fire straightened his eyes the color of fog over seawater warmed in appreciation hi there regan shane any coffee hot rafe asked sure shane kicked the log into place with his boot kitchens never closed fine now get lost well that was certainly rude regan blew her hair out of her eyes as rafe carted her down the hall and into the kitchen youre an only child right yes but figured he dropped her into one of the cane chairs at the kitchen table what do you take in your coffee nothingblack what a woman he stripped off his coat tossed it over a peg by the back door where his brothers heavy work jacket already hung from a glassfronted cupboard he chose two glossy white mugs want anything to go with it some hopeful womans always baking shane cookies its that pretty innocent face of his pretty maybe youre all pretty she shrugged out of her coat with a murmur of appreciation for the warmth of the room and ill pass on the cookies he set a steaming mug in front of her out of habit he turned a chair around and straddled it so are you going to pass on the house too biding her time she studied her coffee sampled it and found it superb i have a number of pieces in stock that i think youll find more than suitable when youre ready to furnish i also did some research on the traditional color schemes and fabrics from that era is that a yes or a no regan no im not going to pass she lifted her gaze to his and its going to cost you youre not worried i didnt say that exactly but now i know what to expect i can guarantee i wont be fainting at your feet a second time id just as soon you didnt you scared the life out of me he reached over to play with the fingers of the hand shed laid on the table he liked the delicacy of them and the glint of stones and gold in your research did you dig up anything on the two corporals the two corporals you should have asked old lady metz she loves telling the story what kind of watch is this curious rafe flicked a finger under the twin black elastic bands circa elastic and marcasite what about the corporals it seems these two soldiers got separated from their regiments during the battle the cornfield east of here was thick with smoke black powder exploding some of the troops were engaged in the trees others just lost or dying there some of the battle took place here on your fields she asked some of it the park service has markers up anyway these two one union one confederate got separated they were just boys probably terrified bad luck brought them together in the woods that form the boundary between mackade land and barlow oh thoughtful she dragged her hair back id forgotten the properties border each other its less than a half mile from this house to the barlow place through the trees anyway they came facetoface if either of them had had any sense theyd have run for cover and counted their blessings but they didnt he lifted his mug again they managed to put holes in each other nobody can say who crawled off first the reb made it as far as the barlow house odds are he was halfdead already but he managed to crawl onto the porch one of the servants saw him and being a southern sympathizer pulled him inside or maybe she just saw a kid bleeding to death and did what she thought was right and he died in the house regan murmured wishing she couldnt see it so clearly yeah the servant ran off to get her mistress that was abigail obrian barlow of the carolina obrians abigail had just given orders for the boy to be taken upstairs where she could teat his wounds her husband came out he shot the kid right there on the stairway sadness jolted straight into horror oh my god why no wife of his was going to lay her hands on a reb she herself died two years later in her room story is that she never spoke a word to her husband again not that they had much to say to each other before it was supposed to be one of those arranged marriages rumor was he liked to knock her around in other words regan said tightly he was a prince among men thaf s the story she was delicate and she was miserable and trapped regan murmured thinking of cassie i dont suppose people talked much about abuse back then divorce he shrugged probably not an option in her circumstances anyway shooting that boy right in front of her must have been the straw you know the last cruelty she could take but thats only half of it the half the town knows theres more she let out a sigh and rose i think i need more coffee the yank stumbled off in the opposite direction rafe continued murmuring a thank you when she poured him a second cup my greatgrandfather found him passed out by the smokehouse my greatgrandfather lost his oldest son at bull run hed died wearing confederate gray regan shut her eyes he killed the boy no maybe he thought about it maybe he thought about just leaving him there to bleed to death but he picked him up and brought him into the kitchen he and his wife their daughters doctored him on the table not this one rafe added with a small smile thats reassuring he came around a few times tried to tell them something but he was too weak he lasted the rest of that day and most of the night but he was dead by morning theyd done everything they could yeah but now they had a dead union soldier in their kitchen his blood on their floor everyone who knew them knew that they were staunch southern sympathizers whod already lost one son to the cause and had two more still fighting for it they were afraid so they hid the body when it was dark they buried him with his uniform his weapon and a letter from his mother in his pocket he looked at her then his eyes cool and steady thats why this house is haunted too i thought youd be interested she didnt speak for a moment set her coffee aside your house is haunted the house the woods the fields you get used to it the little noises the little feelings we never talked about it much it was just there maybe youd get a sense of something in the woods at night or in the fields when the morning was misty and too quiet he smiled a little at the curiosity in her eyes even cynics feel something when theyre standing on a battlefield after my mother died even the house seemed restless or maybe it was just me is that why you left i had lots of reasons for leaving and for coming back one or two i told you the first part of the story because i figured you should understand the barlow place since youre going to be involved with it and i told you the rest he reached over and loosened the duo of black buttons on her blazer because im going to be staying at the farm for a while now you can decide if you want me to bring you here or if youd rather i come to your place my inventorys at the shop so im not talking about your inventory he cupped her chin in his hand kept his eyes open and on hers when he kissed her softly at first testing then with a murmur of satisfaction deeper so that her lips parted and warmed he watched her lashes flutter felt her breath sigh out and into his mouth felt the pulse just under her jaw just under his fingers throb the smoky scent of her skin was a seductive contrast to her coolwater taste regan kept her hands gripped tight in her lap it was shocking how much she wanted to use them on him to drag them through his hair to test the muscles under that faded flannel shirt but she didnt her mind might have blurred for just an instant with astonished pleasure even more astonishing greed but she managed to hold on to her focus when he leaned back she kept her hands where they were and gave herself time to level her voice were business associates not playmates we have business he agreed would you have pulled that maneuver if id been a man he stared at her the chuckle started low bloomed into a full laugh while she squirmed at the ridiculous way shed phrased the question i can give you a definite no on that one i figure in that case you probably wouldnt have kissed me back either look lets clear this up ive heard all about the mackade brothers and how theyre irresistible to women its been a curse all our lives she would not smile even if she had to clamp her teeth together the point is im not interested in a quick roll an affair or a relationship which should cover any and all possibilities damned if she wasnt even more alluring when she went prim im going to enjoy changing your mind why dont we start with the quick roll and work our way up from there she rose sharply and pulled her coat on in your dreams youre right about that why dont i take you out to dinner why dont you take me back to my car all right unoffended he got up to pluck his coat from the peg after hed shrugged it on he reached out and flipped her hair out from the collar of hers nights are long and cold this time of year get a book she suggested on her way down the hall sit by the fire is that what you do he shook his head im going to have to add a little excitement to your life i like my life just fine thanks dont pick me the order ended with an oath as he scooped her up mackade she said with a sigh as he carried her to the jeep im beginning to think youre as bad as everyone says count on it chapter it was a good sound the thud of hammers the buzz of saws the whir of drills through it came the jingle of a radio set to country music so that wynonna wailed over the clomp of boots and male voices it was a noise the music of labor that rafe had known all of his life this was different from the clatter of the milking barn the hum of a tractor in the field he preferred it hed chosen it the day he left antietam construction work had probably saved him he had no problem admitting hed been looking to rumble when he roared out of washington county a decade before on his secondhand harley but hed needed to eat so hed needed to work hed strapped on a tool belt and sweated out the worst of the frustration he still remembered when hed stepped back and looked at the first house hed had a part in building it had come to him in a flash that he could make something that mattered and that he could make something of himself so hed saved and hed sweated and hed learned the first place hed bought in central florida was little more than a shack hed choked on drywall dust hammered until his muscles wept with the strain but hed made a profit and used that to buy again to sell again in four years the tiny shoestring company called mackade had earned a reputation for reliable quality work still hed never stopped looking back now standing in the parlor of the barlow place he understood hed come full circle he was going to make something in the town hed been so hellbent to escape from whether he stayed or not after he was done was undecided but he would at least have left his mark hunkered down in front of the fireplace rafe studied the stone hearth hed already gone to work on the chimney and was covered with soot and grime shed draw he thought with satisfaction the first thing he was going to do when the new lining was installed to bring it up to code was build a fire he wanted to watch the flames and warm his hands on them he wanted just the right andirons the right screen he could depend on regan for that with a little smile be picked up bis trowel to mix a bucket of mortar he had a feeling regan could be depended on for most anything with care precision and enjoyment he began to repoint the stone i figured the boss would be sitting at a desk running figures rafe glanced back and lifted a brow jared stood in the center of the room his gleaming black shoes resting on a spattered drop cloth for some reason his black wayfarer shades didnt look out of place with his gray pinstriped threepiece suit that stuffs for lawyers and bookkeepers jared took off the sunglasses and tucked them into the pocket of his suit coat and think what the world would be without them simpler rafe stuck his trowel in the mortar and gave his brother a onceover on your way to a funeral i had business in town thought id drop by and see how things are going he glanced around the room then back toward the hall when something crashed someone cursed so hows it going steady rafe sighed when jared took out a slim cigar blow some of that over here will you i quit ten really long days ago reforming yourself obligingly jared walked over crouched he smoked lazily as he and rafe frowned meaningfully at the stone not too shabby rafe knocked a fist against the rosegrained marble an adam pal jared grunted clamped the cigar between his teeth need a hand around here blandly rafe looked down youre wearing your lawyer shoes i meant over the weekend i can always use another back pleased with the offer rafe picked up the trowel again hows yours as good as yours still working out he gave jareds biceps a testing punch i still say gyms are for sissies jaied blew out a stream of smoke want to go a round bro sure when youre not dressed so pretty to torture himself rafe sucked in secondhand smoke i appreciate you handling the settlement on this place for me you havent got my bill yet grinning jared straightened i thought you were crazy when you called and told me to go after it then i did a walkthrough he turned still grinning and i knew you were crazy you practically stole the place but i figure its got to cost you two times the purchase price to make it livable three times rafe said mildly to make it the way i want it how do you want it the way it was rafe scraped the edge of his trowel over stone leveling his mortar thats always a tough one jared murmured you dont seem to be having a problem with labor i wondered if you would considering the places rep money talks lost a plumbers assistant this morning though wicked amusement sparkled in his eyes they were checking pipes in one of the secondfloor johns this guy claims someone clamped a hand on his shoulder he was still running when he made it to the road dont guess hell be back any other problems nothing i need a lawyer for did you hear the one about the lawyer and the rattlesnake ive heard them all jared said dryly i keep a file with a chuckle rafe wiped his hands on ms jeans you did good jare mom wouldve liked seeing you duded up like that for a moment he said nothing there was only the scrape of trowel on stone its weird staying at the farm mostly just me and shane devin spends half his nights on a cot in the sheriffs office youre in that fancy little town house in the city when i hear shane get up in the morning its still dark the idiots whistling like going out to milk in januarys just a boatload of laughs hes always loved it hes kept that place alive i know he recognized the tone shook his head at it you did your part rafe the money you sent back made a difference eyes shadowed jared stared out the grimy window im thinking of selling the place in hagerstown when rafe said nothing jared moved his shoulders it seemed practical to keep it after the divorce the market was soft and wed only built up a couple years equity barbara didnt want it still sore no the divorce is three years past and god knows it was civilized we just didnt like each other anymore i never liked her jareds lips quirked i know anyway im thinking of selling hanging out at the farm for a while until i find the right place shane would like that so would i i missed you rafe swiped a grimy hand over his grimy chin i didnt realize how much until i got back satisfied with the repointing he scraped his trowel on the edge of the bucket so you want to put in some honest labor on saturday you buy the beer rafe nodded rose lets see your hands city boy jareds response was crude simple and uttered just as regan stepped into the room nice mouth counselor rafe said with an easy smile hello darling im interrupting no the guy from the gutter heres my brother jared i know hes my lawyer hello jared regan jared found an empty can of soda and doused the stub of his cigar hows business picking up thanks to your little brother i have some estimates figures suggestions paint and fabric samples she said to rafe i thought youd like to look them over youve been busy he crouched again flipped over the top of a small cooler want a drink no thanks jare one for the road ive got another appointment jared caught the canned soft drink on the fly then took his sunglasses out of his pocket ill let you two get down to business nice to see you again regan saturday rafe called out as jared left the room seventhirty thats am pal and lose the suit i didnt mean to chase him off regan began you didnt want to sit down where he patted an overturned bucket thats very gracious of you but i cant stay im on my lunch hour the boss isnt going to dock you she certainly will opening her briefcase regan took out two thick folders everythings in here once you have a chance to look through it let me know for lack of anywhere better she set the files across two sawhorses she looked back over her shoulder toward the hall youve certainly jumped right in when you know what you want theres no point in wasting time so how about dinner she looked back narrowed her eyes dinner tonight we can go over your files he tapped a finger against them left a smudge of soot save time oh still frowning she combed her fingers through her hair i suppose hows seven well go to the lamplighter the where the lamplighter the little place off of main at church street she tilted her head as she visualized the town theres a video store at main and church he jammed his hands in his pockets with an oath used to be a restaurant your place used to be a hardware store i guess even small towns have their changes yeah he couldnt have said why it annoyed him like italian yes but the closest italian place is across the river into west virginia we can just meet at eds no italian ill come by about sixthirty needing to gauge his time he pulled a watch from his pocket yeah i can do sixthirty thats a nice one without thinking she crossed over took his wrist gingerly in two fingers to get a better look at the pocket watch hmmamerican watch company mids already appraising she turned the watch over to study the case sterling good condition ill give you seventyfive for it i paid ninety she laughed and shook back her hair then you got a hell of a bargain its worth a hundred and fifty her gaze danced up to his you dont look like the pocketwatch type wear one on your wrist on the job they end up smashed he wanted to touch her she looked so neat and tidy that the idea of mussing her up was enormously appealing damn shame my hands are filthy alerted she released his wrist brushed one hand against the other sos your face but youre still pretty after shifting her briefcase strap more comfortably on her shoulder she stepped back sixthirty then dont forget the files shed changed three times before she caught herself a business dinner regan thought as she dropped down on the padded stool of her vanity was a business dinner her appearance was certainly important but it was secondary she bit her lip and wondered if she should have gone with the little black dress after all no no no annoyed with herself she snatched up her brush simplicity was best the restaurant in west virginia was casual familystyle the purpose was professional the blazer slacks and silk blouse in forest green were right there was no harm in jazzing it up with the moonstone lapel pin but maybe the earrings were wrong she could go with plain gold hoops instead of the more dramatic dangles the hell with it she dropped her brush then tugged on her suede ankle boots she would not fall into the trap of thinking of this as a date she didnt want to date rafe mackade just now with her business showing real promise she didnt want to date anyone a relationship if indeed she decided to cultivate one was three years down the road minimum she would never make the mistake her mother had and depend on someone else for emotional and financial support first she would make certain she was solvent solid and secure and then if and when she chose she would think about sharing her life no one was going to tell her if she could work or not she would never have to cajole an extra few dollars out of a man to buy a new dress maybe it suited her parents to live that way and theyd certainly always seemed happy enough but that wasnt the life regan bishop wanted it was just too damned bad that rafe was so dangerously attractive and she noted when she heard the knock on the door prompt confident again after the quick pep talk she walked out of the bedroom through the small cozily furnished living room and opened the door and oh she thought one last time it was really too bad he flashed that grin at her and those wonderful green eyes swept down then up looking good before she could think to avoid it his mouth brushed hers ill get my coat she began then stopped the door still open to the wind what are those these he jostled the bags he carried these are dinner wheres your kitchen i he was already in kicking the door behind him i thought we were going out no i said we were having italian he took quick stock of the room lady chairs gleaming tables pretty little knickknacks and fresh flowers all female he mused and the portrait of a gloomyfaced cow above the sofa added wit nice place are you telling me youre cooking me dinner its the quickest way without physical contact to get a woman into bed the kitchen through there when shed managed to close her mouth she followed him into the galleystyle kitchen off the dining el doesnt that depend on how well you cook appreciating her response he smiled as he began pulling ingredients out of the bags youll have to tell me got a skillet yes i have a skillet she took a large castiron pan from its cupboard then lips pursed tapped it against her palm you conk me with it youll miss out on my ziti with tomato and basil ziti after running her tongue around her teeth she set the skillet on a burner ill wait until after i eat she got out a second pan for the pasta and handed it to him once hed added water and set it to boil she watched him wash greens for a salad whered you learn to cook we all cook chefs knife my mother didnt believe there was womens work and mens work thanks he added and began chopping with a quick negligent flair that had regan lifting her brows there was just work he continued ziti doesnt sound like farm food she had an italian grandmother can you stand a little closer hmm you smell good i like to smell you ignoring that and the little twist in her stomach she picked up the wine hed brought along why dont i open this why dont you after shed set it on the counter to breathe she scooted behind him to reach the cupboard to get a salad bowl when he asked for music she slipped back into the living room and put count basie on low why she wondered did a man look so sexy with his sleeves rolled up grating carrots into a salad dont open that olive oil she told him i have some extra virgin of course she tapped a longspouted copper pitcher on the counter count basie your own olive oil his eyes met hers laughed want to get married sure ive got time on saturday amused that he didnt have such a quick comeback for that she reached overhead for wineglasses i was planning on working saturday watching her he set the salad aside thats what they all say lord she was one terrific piece of work he moved closer as she poured the wine tell me you like watching baseball on tv on hot summer nights and weve got a deal sorry i hate sports he moved closer still and with a wineglass in either hand she moved back its a good thing i found this flaw now before we had five or six kids and a dog youre a lucky guy heart jittering she backed up again i like this he murmured and traced a finger over the little mole beside her mouth inching closer he ran his finger down to flip open the buttons of her blazer why are you always doing that doing what fooling with my buttons just practicing the grin was quick as lightning and just as bold besides you always look so tidy i cant resist loosening you up her retreat ended with her back between the side of the refrigerator and the wall looks like youve backed yourself into a corner darling he moved in slowly slipping his hands around her waist fitting his mouth to hers he took his time sampling his fingers spread over her rib cage stopping just short of the curve of her breasts she couldnt stop her breath from quickening or her lips from responding his tongue flicked over them between them met hers his taste was dark and rabidly male and streaked straight to her center like an arrow on target the small part of her mind that could still function warned her that he knew exactly how he affected women all women any woman but her body didnt seem to give a damn her blood began to pound her skin to vibrate from the shock of dozens of tiny explosions she was certain she could feel her own bones melt she was exciting to watch his eyes were open as he changed the angle of the kiss deepened it degree by painfully slow degree he found the flutter of her lashes arousing the faint flush desire brought to her cheeks seductive and that helpless hitch of breath that quick shiver when his fingers skimmed lightly over the tips of her breasts utterly thrilling with an effort he stopped himself from taking more god it gets better every time gently he nuzzled his way to her ear lets try it again no it surprised her that what she said and what she wanted were entirely different in defense she pressed a wineglass against his chest he glanced down at the glass then back at her face his eyes werent smiling now werent gently amused there was an edge in them now dark and potentially deadly despite all common sense she found herself drawn to this man who would take and damn all consequences your hands shaking regan im aware of that she spoke carefully knowing that the wrong word the wrong move and what was in his eyes would leap out and devour her and she would let it she would love it that was something she definitely had to think over take the wine rafe its red itll leave a nasty stain on that shirt for one humming moment he said nothing a need he hadnt understood or counted on had him by the throat with rusty little claws she was afraid of him he noted deciding she was smart to be afraid a woman like her didnt have a clue what a man like him was really capable of taking the glass he tapped it against hers making the crystal ring then turned back to the stove she felt as though shed barely avoided a tumble from a cliff and realized she already regretted not taking the plunge i think i should say something i um she took a deep breath then an even deeper gulp of wine im not going to pretend im not attracted to you or that i didnt enjoy that when obviously i am and i did trying to relax he leaned back against the counter studied her over the rim of his glass and and she scooped back her hair and i think complications are complicated she said lamely i dont want that is i dont think she shut her eyes and drank again im stuttering i noticed its a nice boost to the ego your ego doesnt need any boosting she blew out a breath cleared her throat youre very potent i have no doubt sex would be memorable dont smile at me that way sorry but the smile didnt dim it must have been your choice of words memorables good i like it why dont we save time here i get your point you want to mull the idea over make the next move when youre ready she considered then nodded slowly thats close enough okay now heres my point he turned on the burner under the skillet and added oil i really want you regan it hit me right off when i walked into eds and you were sitting there with little cassie looking so pressed and polished she fought to ignore the flutters in her stomach is that why you offered me the job on the barlow place youre too smart to ask a question like that this is sex sex is personal all right she nodded again all right he picked up a plump roma tomato examined it the problem here as i see it is that i dont much care for mulling over things like this no matter how you fancy it up sex is still the animal smell touch taste his eyes were dark again reckless he picked up the knife tested its point take he added but thaf s just me and there are two of us here so you go on ahead with your mulling baffled she stared at him as he chose a clove of garlic im trying to decide if you expect me to thank you for that nope expertly he laid the flat of his knife over the garlic gave one quick pound of his fist to crush it youre just supposed to understand it like im understanding you youre a real nineties man mackade no im not and im going to make you stutter again you can count on that challenged she picked up the wine topped off their glasses well you count on this if and when i decide to make my move youll do some stuttering of your own he scooped the minced garlic into the oil where it sizzled i like your style darling i really like your style chapter sunny skies and a southerly breeze brought in a welcome endofjanuary thaw icicles dripped prettily from eaves and shone with rainbows in front yards and fallow fields snowmen began to lose weight regan spent a pleasant week earmarking stock for the barlow place and hunting up additions to her supply at auction when business was slow she revised and honed her roombyroom decorating scheme for what was going to be the mackade inn at antietam even now as she described the attributes of a walnut credenza to a pair of very interested buyers her mind was on the house though she hadnt realized it yet she was as haunted by it as rafe had been the front bedroom second floor she mused should have the fourposter with canopy the rosebud wallpaper and the satinwood armoire a romantic and traditional bridal suite complete with little bowls of potpourri and vases of fresh flowers and what had been the gathering room on the main level had that wonderful southern exposure of course rafe had to pick the right windows but it would be spectacular in sunny colors with a trio of ficus trees hanging ferns in glazed pots and pretty little conversation groups of boldly floral love seats and wingback chairs it was perfect for a conservatory a place to gaze through the glass into the woods and gardens with forced narcissi and hyacinths brightening midwinter gloom she couldnt wait to get her hands on the place add those tiny perfect details that would make it a home again an inn she reminded herself a business comfortable charming but temporary and it wasnt hers with an effort she shook her head clear and concentrated on the sale at hand you can see the marquetry is highquality she continued keeping her sales pitch moderate and pleasant the bowfront cupboards on the side are the original glass the woman fingered the discreet tag longingly and regans sharp eye caught the hopeful glance she sent her less enthusiastic husband it really is lovely but if s just a little more than we had in mind i understand but in this condition she broke off when the door opened furious with herself for the quick leap then the quick disappointment when it wasnt rafe who came in before she could smile a welcome at cassie she saw the livid bruises on the side of her friends face if youd excuse me for just a moment ill give you time to talk it over an antique bangle jingling on her wrist sensible shoes clacking she moved swiftly through the shop saying nothing she took cassiss arm and led her into the back room sit down come on gently she eased cassie into a chair at the tiny iron table how bad are you hurt its nothing i just shut up grinding back the spurt of temper regan slammed a kettle on the hot plate im sorry im going to make some tea she needed a moment she realized before she could deal with this rationally while the waters boiling ill go finish up with my customers you sit here and relax for a minute shame swimming in her eyes cassie stared down at her hands thanks ten minutes later after ruthlessly hacking the price of the credenza to move the customers along regan hurried back she told herself shed gotten the anger under control she promised herself she would be supportive sympathetic one look at cassie slumped in the chair while the kettle belched steam had her exploding why in the hell do you let him do this to you when are you going to get tired of being that sadistic bastards punching bag does he have to put you in the hospital before you walk away in utter defeat cassie folded her arms on the table then dropped her head on them and wept her own eyes stinging began dropped to her knees beside the chair in the tidy little office with its icecreamparlor chairs and neat rolltop desk she struggled to face the reality of battering cassie im sorry im so sorry cass i shouldnt be yelling at you i shouldnt have come here lifting her head cassie covered her face with her hand and fought to get her breath back i shouldnt have come but i just needed somebody to talk to of course you should have come here this is exactly where you should have come let me see regan murmured easing cassies hand away the bruises ran from temple to jaw in ugly purple one of cassies lovely smoke gray eyes was swollen nearly shut oh cassie what happened can you tell me he joe he hasnt been feeling well this flu thats been going around cassies voice hitched and jittered he missed a lot of work being sick and yesterday they laid him off avoiding regans eyes she fumbled in her bag for a tissue he was upset hes worked there almost twelve years now on and off the bills i just bought a new washing machine on credit and connor wanted these new tennis shoes i knew they were too expensive but stop regan said quietly and laid a hand over cassies please stop blaming yourself i cant bear it when you do i know im making excuses with a long shuddering breath cassie shut her eyes to regan at least she could be honest because regan in the three years they had known each other had always been there he hasnt had the flu hes been drunk almost day and night for a week they didnt lay him off they fired him because he went to work drunk and mouthed off to his supervisor and then he came home and took it out on you rising regan took the kettle off the boil and began to make the tea where are the kids at my mothers i went there last night after he hurt me pretty bad this time unconsciously she touched her hand to her throat beneath the turtleneck there were more bruises where joes hands had held and choked her until she accepted that he would kill her almost wished for it i got the kids out and i went to mama because i needed some place to stay okay thats good ready to move stepbystep now regan brought two china cups to the table thats the best way to start no very carefully cassie wrapped both hands around her cup she expects me to go back today she wont let us stay another night after you told her after she saw you what hed done she expects you to go back a woman belongs with her husband cassie said simply i married him for better or for worse regan had never understood her own mother the easy subservience the catering but while it had infuriated her often it had never appalled her like this thats monstrous cassie its just mama cassie murmured wincing as the tea stung her puffy lip she believes a woman should make a marriage work its her duty to make it work do you believe that that its your responsibility to take this do you believe that means you are supposed to stay for better or worse even if worse means being beaten whenever he has the whim i used to i tried to i took vows regan she took a shuddering breath because to her that had always been the bottom line she had promised maybe i was too young when i married joe maybe i made a mistake but i still took the vows he didnt keep them there were those other women he didnt even care if i knew who they were he was never faithful never kind but i took vows and i wanted to keep them she began to cry again quietly now because she had failed weve been married ten years we have children together i make so many mistakes using my tip money to buy those shoes for connor and letting emma play dressup with my lipstick and we couldnt afford that washing machine i was never any good in bed not like those other women hed go to i knew she broke off when regan only continued to watch her are you hearing yourself this time regan said quietly are you listening to yourself cassie i cant stay with him anymore her voice broke shattering like thin fragile glass hes hitting me in front of the kids he used to wait until they were in bed and that was bad but now he hits me in front of them and he says terrible things things they shouldnt hear its not right it makes them part of it and its not right no cass its not right you need help now i thought about it all night she hesitated then slowly eased down the neck of her sweater at the sight of the raw marks scoring that pale innocent flesh regans face went white and cold oh dear god he tried to strangle you i dont think he meant to at first i was crying and he wanted me to stop but then he did cassie lowered her hand again i could see it in his eyes it wasnt just the drinking or the money or the other women he seems to want he hated me just for being there hell hurt me again if he gets the chance and i have to think about the kids i have to go to devin and file charges thank god i had to come here first to get up my nerve knowing there was no more point in them cassie wiped at the tears its hard being its devin ive known him all my life its not like its a secret hes been out to the house i dont know how many times when the neighbors called in but its hard she sighed being its devin ill go with you cassie closed her eyes that was why she had come here to have someone stand with her no she admitted ashamed all over again to have someone hold her up no i need to do it myself i havent thought about after she said and soothed her raw throat with a sip of tea i cant take the kids back to the house until i know whats going to happen the shelter stubbornly cassie shook her head i know its pride regan but i cant go there i cant take my kids there not yet anyway all right then youll stay here here regan repeated as cassie protested i only have one extra bedroom so you and the kids will have to rough it we cant pile in on you that way you were the first friend i made when i moved here i want to help so let me help i could never ask you that regan ive saved some tip and overtime money enough for a motel for a couple of days you wouldnt want to hurt my feelings that way youre going to stay at my place for the kids regan murmured knowing that nothing would tilt the scales as heavily ill go get them after i see devin she had no pride when it came to her children im awfully grateful regan so am i now whats this tea party during business hours because his eyes were on regan rafe had stepped into the office and tossed his coat over the back of a chair before he saw cassies face regan was stunned to watch charm metamorphize into pure violence in a split second the quick potent grin sharpened into a snarl his eyes fired her first startled thought as that lean body tensed to spring was wolf when his hand shot out cassie flinched and regan leapt to her feet before regan could step between them with some wild idea of protecting cassie rafes fingers stroked gentle as a kiss over the battered face joe it it was an accident cassie stammered his opinion of that was one vicious word he swung around blood in his eye cassie was on her feet and racing after him no rafe please dont do anything desperate she pulled at his arm all but jumped on his back please dont go after him he could have knocked her aside with a shrug it was that knowledge that added bitter fuel to the fire you stay here stay with regan no please cassie began to weep again helplessly as she pulled at him please dont make me any more ashamed than i already am the bastards going to pay this time he bit the words out started to set her aside and looked down the tears did what fists and threats could never have done they stopped him cold cassie undone he wrapped his arms around her and cradled her against his chest dont cry baby come on now its going to be all right from the doorway of the office regan watched him how could there be such tenderness she wondered side by side with such savagery he was holding cassie as though she were a child his head close to hers as he murmured to her regans own throat burned and her own cheeks were wet when he lifted his head and looked at her yes the violence was still there alive and restless in his eyes vital and fierce enough to steal her breath from her throat and make her stomach muscles quiver she swallowed hard before she spoke bring her back in here rafe please every nerve inside him was tensed for battle he craved the hunt the fight the blood but the woman in his arms was trembling and the one who watched him with shocked frightened eyes was quietly pleading come on baby as if she were a fretful child rafe tucked cassie under his arm come on lets go sit down im sorry dont apologize to me it took every ounce of control to lead her back into the office to keep his voice easy on the words dont apologize to anyone shes going to devin because her hands were shaking regan busied them with the tea and cups shes going to file charges thats the right way to handle it thats one way he preferred his own but he eased cassie into a chair brushed her hair way from her damp face have you got a place to stay cassie nodded took the tissues regan handed her were going to stay with regan for a little while just until the kids okay she nodded again im going to get them as soon as i see devin you tell me what you need and ill go by the house and pick it up for you i i dont know i didnt take anything you tell me later why dont i walk you down to the sheriffs office she shuddered out a breath mopped her face no i need to do it by myself i should go now here regan pulled open a drawer in her desk heres a key to the door upstairs you and the kids settle in she put the key in cassies hand closed her fingers over it and lock it cassie i will ill go now it was the hardest thing shed ever done just standing walking to the door i always thought it would get better she said almost to herself i always hoped it would she left with her head bowed and her shoulders hunched do you know where he is rafe murmured no i dont well ill find him as he reached for his coat regan put her hand over his his eyes lifted slowly to hers and burned dont get in my way instinct had her laying her other hand on his cheek her mouth on his the kiss was soft soothing them both what was that for a couple of things she took a deep breath then put both hands on his shoulders for wanting to kick the bastards face in she kissed him again for not doing it because cassie asked you and again and last for showing her that most men real men are kind damn defeated he laid his brow on hers thats a hell of a way to keep me from killing him part of me would like you to im not proud of it as the anger stirred again she turned back to the hot plate part of me would like to watch while you beat him senseless even worse id like a shot at him myself rafe stepped over uncurled the hand shed balled into a fist thoughtfully he lifted it pressed his lips to the palm well well and i figured you for a cream puff i said im not proud of it but she smiled a little its not what she needs now violence is just what she needs to get away from even if its justified ive known her since she was a kid rafe glanced down at the tea regan poured him shook his head at it it smelled like a meadow at springtime and would undoubtedly taste the same she was always little pretty and shy all this sweetness at regans curious look he shook his head again no i never made any moves in that direction sweets never been my type thanks dont mention it he stroked a hand over her hair let his fingers drift into it through it youre taking on a lot letting her and the kids stay with you i can take them out to the farm weve got plenty of room she needs a woman rafe not a bunch of men however wellintentioned devin will find him wont he and take care of it you can count on it satisfied she picked up her own tea then i will and so should you now that the step had been taken she eyed him over her cup you must have come by for a reason i wanted to look at you for a while her bland gaze had his lips curving and i figured to go over some of the wall treatments and the parlor furniture i want to complete that one room give me a feel for the rest thats a nice idea i she broke off at the sound of movement and voices from the shop ive got customers everythings here the paint samples and fabrics itemized lists of furnishings i picked up some samples of my own oh well then she crossed to the desk booted up her computer i have a roombyroom rundown here why dont you go over it several of the pieces ive suggested are here you can take a look at them when youve finished here all right thirty minutes later flush with three sales regan stepped back into the office he looked so big she thought so male sitting at her lovely little chippendale desk she could smell him wood dust soot oil his boots were scarred his shirt was ripped at the shoulder there were traces of plaster or drywall dust in his hair she thought he was the most magnificent animal she had ever seen and she wanted him with a kind of primal mindless lust whoa to steady herself she pressed a hand to her jumpy stomach took three deep breaths well what do you think youre an efficient woman regan without turning he flipped open a file with printouts of her lists it doesnt look like youve missed a trick flattered she walked over to look over his shoulder im sure well need to adjust add a few details after we see one of the rooms completed ive already made some adjustments she straightened again oh really this colors out briskly he tapped the paint chip then located the page onscreen where her colors were listed i ditched this pea green here for whats it called yeah loden the original color is accurate its ugly yes it was but its accurate she insisted i researched very carefully the one youve chosen is entirely too modern for the s maybe but it wont spoil anyones appetite dont get your panties in a twist darling when her breath hissed out at that he chuckled and turned around in the chair listen youre doing a hell of a job here i have to admit i didnt expect this much detail certainly not so fast youve got a real feel for it she didnt care to be placated you hired me to help you reconstruct a particular era and thats what im doing it was your choice to make the house look the way it did in the past and its my choice to make adjustments weve got to make some room here for aesthetics and modern taste ive had a look at your place upstairs regan its a little too much on the female side for me fortunately thats hardly the issue here she told him stiffening all over again and so neat a mand be afraid to put his feet up rafe continued smoothly but youve got taste im just asking you to use it along with research and accuracy it seems to me were talking about your taste if youre going to change the guidelines at least make them clear are you always so rigid or is it just with me she refused to stoop to answering such an insulting question you asked for accuracy i dont care to have rules changed in midstream considering rafe picked up the paint chip that had started the ball rolling one question do you like this color thats not the point simple question do you like it her breath whistled between her teeth of course not its hideous there you go guidelines are if you dont like it it doesnt fly i cant take the responsibility im paying you to take it since that settled the matter as far as he was concerned he turned back to the screen and scanned down the displays you got this whatdoyoucallit in stock right isnt that what this is stands for yes the double chairback settee her heart dropped to her feet shed bought it the week before at auction with his parlor in mind if he rejected it her books were going straight into the red its in the shop she continued keeping her voice coolly professional ive put a hold on it so lets take a look i want to see this firescreen and these tables youre the boss she muttered under her breath and led the way her nerves strained as she stopped by the settee it was a gorgeous piece and it had had a price to match however much she coveted it she would never have made the bid if she hadnt had a customer in the wings now she thought of that customer the scarred boots the ripped shirt the potent aura of man what had she been thinking of she wondered frantically imagining rafe mackade approving of an elegant curvy and decidedly feminine piece such as this ah its walnut she began running a suddenly icy hand over the carved arm around its been reupholstered of course but the material is very much in keeping with the era you can see the doubleshaped backs are centered by a circular upholstered panel the workmanship is firstrate and the seat is surprisingly comfortable he grunted and crouched down to peer under the seat pricey little thing its sixtynine inches wide and well worth the expense okay she blinked okay yeah if i stay on schedule i should have the parlor ready by the weekend i could take delivery on this by monday unless i tell you different he glanced up at her that suit you yes she realized shed lost all feeling below the knees of course cod all right i dont have my checkbook on me thatll be fine lets see the pembroke table the pembroke table she looked dizzily around the shop over here he straightened holding back a grin he wondered if she had any idea that for a few minutes there shed been clear as glass he doubted it whats this distracted she stopped oh thats a display table satinwood and mahogany i like it you like it she repeated itd look good in the parlor wouldnt it yes i had it down as a possibility send it over with the couch thing is this the pembroke here all she could do was nod weakly when he left an hour later she was still nodding rafe headed straight to the sheriffs office hed have to put in a couple of hours overtime on the job but he wasnt leaving town until he knew joe dolin was in a cage when he stepped inside he found devin tilted back in his chair his feet propped on his battered metal desk devins uniform consisted of a cotton shirt faded jeans and boots worn down at the heel his only concession to his position was the star on his chest he was reading a dogeared copy of the grapes of wrath and youre responsible for law and order in this town in his slow deliberate way devin marked his place and set the book aside thats what they tell me always got a cell waiting for you if youve got dolin in one i wouldnt mind you putting me in with him for five minutes or so hes back there with a nod rafe walked to the coffeemaker have any trouble with him devins lips curved in a lazy and wicked smile just enough to make it fun ill have a cup of that how long can you keep him in there thats not up to me devin reached out for the chipped mug rafe offered since he insisted on making the coffee himself it was the mackade brew hot strong and black as night well transfer him to hagerstown devin went on hell get himself a public defender if cassie doesnt back down hell have his day in court rafe sat on the corner of the cluttered desk you think shell back down fighting frustration devin shrugged this is the closest shes ever come to doing anything about things the son of a bitch has been pounding on her for years probably started on her on their wedding night she cant weigh more than a hundred pounds got bones like a bird his usually calm eyes went molten shes got bruises around her throat where he choked her i didnt see that i got pictures after rubbing a hand over his face devin dropped his feet to the floor tussling with joe slapping cuffs on him along with a few bruises in the line of duty hadnt taken the edge off i had to take her statement and pictures for evidence and she sat there looking at me like she was getting beat up all over again god knows how shell handle it if she has to go to court and lay it all out abruptly he pushed away from his desk paced to the window where he could look out on town hed given his word to serve the town protect its citizens not to relieve his own bitter frustrations by pummeling one of them into the ground i gave her the standard lines he continued therapy counseling shelters and i put just enough pressure on when she started to waffle so shed sign the complaint she just sat there crying and i felt like scum rafe studied his coffee frowned you still have a thing for her dev that was high school devin snapped with an effort he uncurled his fist turned back to his brother they might have been twins with barely a year separating them the same bold dark looks rangy build only devins eyes were cooler more like moss than jade and the scars he carried were on his heart sure i care about her he said calm again hell rafe weve known her all our lives ive hated watching what hes been doing to her not being able to stop it every time i got called out to their place every time she had a fresh bruise shed just say it was an accident not this time no not this time i sent my deputy with her to get the kids whatever stuff she needs you know shes going to stay with regan bishop she told me he drained his coffee went back for more well shes taken the first step its probably the hardest since there was nothing more he could do devin sat behind his desk again and put the matter in the corner of his mind speaking of regan bishop word is youve been sniffing around her there a law against it if there is it wouldnt be one you havent broken before devin rose again rooted through the side drawer of his deputys desk he confiscated two candy bars tossed one to rafe shes not your usual type im upgrading my taste bout time devin bit into chocolate serious getting a woman into beds always serious bro mumbling an agreement over candy devin kicked back again so is that all there is i dont know but ive got a feeling itll be a hell of a start he glanced over and grinned as regan came through the door she stopped short as any woman might when faced with two gorgeous men smiling at her im sorry im interrupting no maam all quiet country charm devin unfolded himself and stood its always a pleasure to see you angling his head rafe put a hand on regans shoulder dibs he said in a mild warning excuse me regan stepped back and gaped i beg your pardon but did you just say dibs yeah rafe bit off candy offered her the rest of the bar when she smacked his hand away he only shrugged and ate it himself of all the ridiculous outrageous youre a grown man and youre standing there eating candy and saying dibs as if i were the last icecream bar in the freezer the way i grew up it was real important to stake your claim quick to prove it he cupped her elbows lifted her to her toes and kissed her long and hard gotta go he said releasing her just as arrogantly see you dev yeah too wise to let the laugh loose devin cleared his throat seconds passed and regan continued to stare at the door rafe had slammed at his back you want me to go after him haul him into the back room have you got a rubber hose back there afraid not but i broke his finger once when we were kids i could probably do it again never mind she shook herself shed deal with rafe later personally i came here to see if youd arrested joe dolin so did rafe i should have known he would want some coffee regan no i cant stay i just came to see if you had and to ask since cassie and the children are going to be staying with me if there are any precautions i should take quietly he measured her hed known her casually for three years admired her looks enjoyed a few conversations with her at the cafe or on the street now he saw what had attracted his brother spine good sense compassion he wondered if rafe understood the difference the combination could make in his life why dont you sit down he told her well go over some things chapter on monday morning regan was up early a song on her lips in a few hours the first furnishings would be delivered to the house on the hill with her payment deposited she would dash to an auction in pennsylvania scheduled for that afternoon it would be well worth closing the shop for the day she put the coffee on popped bread into the toaster then turned and nearly jumped out of her slippers oh connor laughing she pressed a hand to her speeding heart you scared me im sorry the boy was thin pale with big eyes the color of shadows his mothers eyes regan thought as she smiled at him its okay i didnt know anyone was up its early even for a school day want some breakfast no thank you she bit back a sigh no eightyearold boy should be so apologetically polite she lifted a brow and took out a box of the cereal shed learned was his favorite with a wink she gave it a shake how about joining me for a bowl he smiled then so sweetly shy it broke her heart i guess if youre having some why dont you get the milk out put it on the table because it hurt to see how carefully how deliberately he performed the simple chore she made her voice bright i heard on the radio were in for some more snow maybe a big one she carried out bowls and spoons set them down when she lifted a hand to brush it over his tousled hair he went very still cursing joe dolin she kept the smile on her face i bet they close school tomorrow i like school he said then bit his lip i always did too brisk and determinedly cheerful she breezed into the kitchen again for her coffee i never minded a day off now and again but i really liked school whats your favorite subject english class i like to write things really what kind of things stories he hunched his shoulders looking down just stupid stuff i bet its not she could only hope she wasnt making a mistake moving into territory best left to the experts but her heart simply moved her hand she cupped it under connors chin and lifted it gently as she sat beside him you should be proud i know your mothers proud of you she told me you won a prize in your english class for a story you wrote she did he was torn between wanting to smile and wanting to let his head drop again but regan had her hand on his face it felt good there warm the tears were in his eyes before he could stop them she cries at night i know baby he was always hitting her i knew it i could hear them but i never did anything to stop it i never did anything to help her youre not to blame letting instinct rule she lifted him onto her lap cuddling him close youre not to blame connor and there was nothing you could have done but now you and your mother and your little sister are safe youre all going to look after each other i hate him shh jolted by how such fierceness could spurt from someone so small so young regan pressed her lips to his hair and rocked in the hallway cassie stepped back torn in a dozen different directions she swayed there a moment a hand over her mouth then she went back into the little spare bedroom to wake her daughter for school regan arrived at the barlow place just ahead of the van and movers shed hired the cheerful noise of construction blasted her the minute she opened the door nothing could have lifted her mood higher the hallway was draped with tarps and drop cloths but the spiderwebs and the mustiness were gone the dust that lay now was fresh and somehow clean she supposed it was a kind of exorcism amused by the thought she studied the stairway as a kind of test she walked toward it started up the cold slapped her like a fist sending her back two steps she stood one hand gripping the rail the other pressed to her stomach as she struggled to get back the breath the icy air had stolen youve got guts rafe murmured from behind her though her eyes were still wide in shock she looked down and met his levelly i wondered if it had just been my imagination how do the laborers go up and down these steps without not everyone feels it id say the ones who do grit their teeth and think about their paycheck he walked up the steps to take her hand how about you id never have believed it if i hadnt experienced it without protest she let him lead her down to the main level it should make for some interesting breakfast conversation among the guests once youre open darling im counting on it give me your coat weve got the heat for this part of the house up and running he slipped her coat off himself its on low but it takes the edge off youre telling me pleased that it seemed warm enough to make shivering unnecessary she flipped back her hair whats going on upstairs a little bit of everything im putting in an extra bath i want you to dig up one of those clawfoot tubs a pedestal sink reproductionsll do if you dont have any luck finding originals give me a few days well she rubbed her hands together not from cold but nerves are you going to show me or do i have to beg im going to show you hed been itching to looking out the window every five minutes to watch for her but now that she was here he was nervous hed slaved for more than a week twelve and fourteenhour days to make that one room that one spot that one step perfect i think the paint turned out rather than reach for her hand he tucked his in his pockets and walked into the parlor ahead of her its a nice contrast with the trim and the floor i think had a little trouble with the windows but i just had to diddle with the framing she didnt speak for a moment she merely stood in the doorway then quietly her boots clicking on the floor she stepped inside it gleamed the tall elegant windows with their graceful arches sent sun streaming over the newly polished floor of lovely old pine the walls were a deep warm blue against creamy carved trim in the most delicate of ivories hed turned the window seat into a charming alcove scrubbed the marble on the fireplace until it shone like glass the molding along the ceiling bloomed with delicately carved florets that had been smothered and choked by the grime of decades it needs furniture drapes and that mirror you picked out for over the mantel he wished she would say something anything i have to replace the pocket doors yet scowling he jammed his hands deeper into his pocket well whats the problem did i miss some vital authentic detail its absolutely wonderful enchanted she ran a finger down the glossy trim of a window absolutely perfect i didnt realize you were this good with a quick laugh she glanced back at him that wasnt meant as an insult it wasnt taken as one i was pretty surprised myself the first time i realized i had a talent for putting something together its more than that its bringing something to life you must be proud he was he realized moved and just a little embarrassed its a job hammer and nails and a good eye she angled her head and he watched the sun beam through the window and glow golden on her hair his mouth watered then went bone dry youre the last man id expect to be modest about anything you must have killed yourself to get so much accomplished in so little time it was mostly cosmetic in here youve done something she murmured and looked around turning a slow graceful circle youve really done something before he could comment she was on her hands and knees running her hands over the floor its like glass she all but crooned over the golden planks oh look at the grain in this wood what did you use how many coats when he didnt answer she tossed her head and sat back on her heels the dazzled smile faded when he only stared at her what is it whats wrong stand up his voice was raw as she rose to her feet he kept his distance he didnt dare touch her now if he did hed simply never be able to stop you look right in here you should see yourself how right you look youre as polished and perfect as this room i want you so much i cant see anything else but you her heart did a long unsteady cartwheel in her chest youre going to make me stutter again rafe she had to make a conscious effort to pump air in and out of her lungs how long are you going to make me wait he demanded were not kids we know what we feel and what we want thats exactly the point were not kids and we should be adult enough to be sensible sensibles for old ladys shoes sex may have to be responsible but it sure as hell doesnt have to be sensible the thought of wicked completely insensible sex with him numbed every nerve ending in her body i dont know how to handle you i dont know how to handle the way you make me feel im usually good at handling things i guess we need to talk about this i guess you need to i just said what i needed to say unbelievably frustrated irrationally angry at his own helpless response to her he turned to the window your trucks here ive got work upstairs put the stuff wherever the hell you want it rafe he stopped her froze her before her hand could reach his arm you wouldnt want to touch me right now his voice was quiet very controlled itd be a mistake you dont like to make them thats not fair what the hell makes you think im fair his eyes slashed her to ribbons ask anybody who knows me your checks on the mantel with her own temper sizzling she stomped into the hall after him mackade he stopped on the steps turned back yeah im not interested in what anyone else thinks or says if i were youd never have gotten within three feet of me she glanced up as an interested laborer poked his head into the stairway beat it she snapped and had rates lips twitching reluctantly i make up my own mind in my own time she continued and turned on her heel to open the front door for the movers you ask anybody when she looked back he was gone like one of his ghosts nearly blew it rafe thought later he wasnt entirely sure why hed reacted that way anger and demands werent his usual style with women maybe that he mused as he troweled drywall compound on a seam was the problem women had always come easily he liked them always had the way they looked thought smelled spoke soft warm fragrant they were one of the more interesting aspects of life frowning he slapped on more compound smoothed it women were important he enjoyed cultivating them the companionship they offered and the sex he acknowledged with a thin smile he enjoyed that too hell he was human houses were important he reflected coating another seam of drywall repairing them was satisfying using your own hands and sweat to turn them into something that lasted and the money that came from the end result was satisfying too a man had to eat but thered never been a single house that was specifically important as this one had come to be and thered never been a single woman who was specifically important as regan had now become and he calculated that she would slice him into dog meat if she knew he was comparing her to stone and wood he doubted she would understand that it was the first time in his life hed ever focused on something and someone so entirely the house had haunted him for a lifetime he hadnt set eyes on her a month before yet they were both in his blood he hadnt been exaggerating when he told her that he couldnt see anything but her she was haunting him just as the restless ghosts haunted these rooms and hallways seeing her there that morning had turned him on his head set his hormones raging and hed fumbled he supposed he could make up ground but this was the first time he could remember being tackled by emotion emotion doubleteamed with desire and he wasnt at all sure of his moves back off mackade he told himself and scooped more compound out of the bucket she wants room give her room it wasnt as though he didnt have time or as though she were some sort of lifealtering encounter maybe she was unique maybe she was more intriguing than hed counted on but she was still just a woman he heard the weeping felt the stir of chilled air with barely a hesitation he leveled his seam yeah yeah i hear you he muttered you might as well get used to company cause im not going anywhere a door slammed it amused him now these endless little dramas footsteps and creaks whispers and weeping it was almost as though he were part of it all a caretaker he decided making the house livable for those who could never leave he thought it was too bad none of the permanent residents ever made an appearance it would be quite an experience to see as well as hear an involuntary shudder worked up his back as if fingers had trailed along his spine and feel he thought footsteps echoed down the hall outside as he moved to the next sheet of drywall to his surprise and curiosity they stopped just outside the door he watched the knob turn just as the work lamp behind him went out plunging the room into darkness hed have suffered torments from hell before admitting that his heart skipped several beats to cover the lapse he muttered oaths under his breath rubbed his suddenly damp palms on his spattered jeans from memory he fumbled his way toward the door it swung open fast and caught him full in the face he wasnt muttering oaths now but spewing them stars were revolving in front of his eyes and with disgust he felt blood trickle from his nose he heard the hoarse scream saw the ghostly figure in the shadows of the hall and didnt hesitate pain and fury had him shooting forward like a bullet ghost or not anything that gave him a bloody nose was going to pay it took him several furious seconds to realize he had warm flesh wriggling in his arms and little more to recognize the scent she was haunting him all right he thought bitterly what the hell are you doing rafe her voice squeaked out in the dark she threw up her arms one flailing hand catching him sharply on the chin before she managed the wholehearted embrace oh my god you scared me to death i thought i dont know i heard i came up oh its you whats left of me swearing he set her firmly aside there was enough light from the lamp hooked at the top of the stairs for him to see her pale face and hugeeyes what are you doing here i picked up some things at auction and thought id put them youre bleeding no kidding scowling at her he swiped a hand under his nose i dont think you broke it again quite i she rubbed a hand over her heart to make sure it hadnt exploded from her chest did i hit you with the door im sorry here she dug in the pocket of her jacket and found a tissue im really sorry she repeated and began to dab at the blood herself i was just helpless she tried to disguise a laugh as a hiccup i didnt realize she gave up wrapped her arms around her aching stomach and slid to the floor its a real laugh riot im sorry i cant stop i thought i dont know what i thought i heard them or it or whatever i just had to come up and see well if i could see then you came barreling out youre lucky i didnt punch you he said with relish i know i know his eyes narrowed as he watched her fold with mirth i still could oh help me up still chuckling she wiped at her eyes lets get some ice on that nose i can take care of it myself but he took hold of her wrist and hauled her none too gently to her feet did i scare you she tried to keep her voice meek and apologetic as she followed him to the stairs get real but you heard you heard it didnt you she braced held her breath as they passed through the cold spot sure i heard it goes on every night a couple times during the day and it doesnt bother you it boosted his ego to be able to flick a disdainful glance over his shoulder why should it bother me its their house too i suppose she looked around the kitchen it was all but bare and still grimy there was a small dented refrigerator a stove that was down to two working burners and an old door propped on sawhorses that served as a table rafe went directly to the pitted castiron sink and ran cold water do you have a clean rag in lieu of an answer he bent over and scooped icy water onto his face adopting a shamed pose regan folded her hands im really terribly sorry rafe does it hurt yes he snatched up a frayed towel and dried his face without another word he strode to the refrigerator and pulled out a beer if s stopped bleeding he twisted off the top tossed it aside then downed a third of the bottle regan decided that under the circumstances she could try again i didnt see your car thats why i didnt think anyone was here devin dropped me off he decided that under the circumstances he could give her a break ive been putting in some extra time at night camping out here were supposed to get hit with a snowstorm tonight so it didnt make any sense to have the car i can walk into town if i need to oh well that explains it want a beer no thanks i dont drink beer fresh out of champagne well then i really should be getting back actually its already starting to snow feeling awkward now she pushed at her hair ah there were these candlesticks and a really wonderful set of fire irons i bought today i just wanted to bring them by see how they looked he lifted the beer again watching her so how do they look i dont know i set everything down in the hall when i came in and heard the ah evening performance you decided to go ghost hunting instead of decorating looks that way well why dont i set them up now before i take off taking the beer along he went with her i guess youve cooled off since this morning not exactly she spared him a brief look as she headed to the main hall though giving you a bloody nose even inadvertently was satisfying you acted like a jerk his eyes narrowed as she picked up the box shed left in the hall and sailed into the parlor i was giving it to you straight some women appreciate honesty some women like jerks she set the box on a drum table shed had the movers place at the window i dont i like simplicity manners tact which of course youre completely without then she turned and smiled but i think under the circumstances a truce is in order who broke your nose before jared when we were kids and fighting in the hayloft he got lucky hmm she supposed she would never understand why brotherly affection meant bloody noses to the mackades so this is where youre camping out she gestured toward the sleeping bag tossed in front of the fire if s the warmest room in the house right now and the cleanest what circumstances equal a truce dont set that bottle down without a coaster heaving a sigh she walked over took one from the silverplated basket and offered it you cant treat antiques like furniture he finished but he used the coaster what circumstances regan our ongoing business relationship for one because her fingers were tense again she busied them by unbuttoning her coat as she walked back to the window were both trying to accomplish the same thing with this house so it doesnt make sense to be at odds these are nice arent they she took the fire irons from the box stroked a finger over the curved handle of the coal shovel they could use some polish it ought to work better than the crowbar ive been using tucking his thumbs in his pockets he watched her carry the irons to the fire set them carefully and individually in their stand on the stone hearth whatever you used its a nice fire torn between courage and doubt she stared at the flames im still looking for the right screen this one doesnt really suit it would be better in one of the rooms upstairs i imagine youll have them all working the fireplaces eventually hed only known her for a few weeks he realized how could he be so sure she was arguing with herself with the firelight flickering over her her back so straight that sweep of hair curtaining half her face she looked relaxed confident perfectly at ease maybe it was the way she had her fingers linked together or the way she wasnt looking at him but he was certain some small inner war was being waged why are you here regan i told you dragging her fingers apart she went back to the box i have some other stuff from the auction in my car but youre not ready for it but these with care she unwrapped heavy crystal candlesticks i could see them in here right on this table youll want flowers for this vase even in the winter she fussed with the arrangement placing the candlesticks just so on one side of the doulton vase shed already sold him tulips would be lovely when you can get them she continued carefully unwrapping the two white tapers shed brought along but mums would do and roses of course she put a smile on her face again and turned there what do you think saying nothing he took a box of wooden matches from the mantel and walked over to light the tapers and watched her over the delicate twin flames they work i meant the whole effect the room it was a good excuse to move away from him wandering the space running a finger along the curved back of the settee its perfect i didnt expect any less from you im not perfect the words burst out of her unexpected on both sides you make me nervous when you say so i was always expected to be perfect and im just not im not carefully arranged like this room with every piece in place no matter how much i want to be im a mess she dragged nervous fingers through her hair and i wasnt before i wasnt no stay over there she backed up quickly when he stepped forward just stay over there frustrated she waved her hands to ward him off then paced you scared me this morning you made me angry but more you scared me it wasnt easy for rafe to keep his hands to himself how because no ones ever wanted me the way you do i know you do she stopped rubbing her hands over her arms you look at me as though you already know how its going to be with us and i have no control over it i figured i was giving you control laying it out for you no no she repeated flinging up her arms i dont have any control over the way im feeling you have to know that you know exactly the way you affect people were not talking about people you know exactly the way you affect we she almost shouted it before she fisted her hands and fought for composure you know i want you why wouldnt i its just as you said were adults who know what we want and the more i backpedal the more stupid i feel his eyes were shadowed in the shifting light youre going to stand there and say these things to me and expect me to do nothing about it i expect to be able to make a sane and rational decision i dont expect my glands to overwhelm my brain she blew out a breath then i look at you and i want to rip your clothes off he had to laugh it was the safest way to defuse the bomb ticking inside of him dont expect me to stop you when he stepped forward she jumped back like a spring just the beer he muttered lifting the bottle i need it he took a long deep gulp but it didnt do much to put out the fire so what have we got here regan two unattached healthy adults who want pretty much the same thing from each other who barely know each other she added whove barely scratched the surface of any sort of relationship who should have more sense than to jump into sex as if it was a swimming pool i never bother testing the water i do an inch at a time ordering herself to be calm she linked her hands again its important to me to know exactly what im getting into exactly where im going no detours no when i plan something i stick to it that works for me she was calmer now she told herself rational now i had a lot of time to think driving to pennsylvania and back we need to slow down take a look at the whole picture if she was calm why couldnt she stop fiddling with her blazer twisting her rings its like this house she continued quickly youve finished one room and its beautiful its wonderful but you didnt start this project without a complete plan in mind for the rest of it i think intimacy should certainly be as carefully thought out as the renovating of a house makes sense good she drew in a breath released it so well take a few steps back get a clearer view of things her hand was still unsteady when she reached for her coat thats the sensible the responsible route to take yeah he set down his beer regan she gripped her coat like a lifeline yes stay her fingers went numb her breath came out in a long shuddering sigh i thought youd never ask with a jittery laugh she threw herself into his arms chapter this is crazy already breathless she curled her fingers into his hair to drag his mouth to hers everything in her strained into the kiss the heat of it the danger the promise i wasnt going to do this thats okay he dragged his lips from hers to race over her face ill do it id thought it all through when her knees trembled she gave a quick helpless laugh i had everything i just said made perfect sense this is just chemistry its just superficial attraction yeah in one fluid movement he yanked her blazer down her shoulders locking her arms trapping her body to his her gasp of alarm stirred his blood the huge wary eyes tightened his loins stop thinking a smile curved his lips as he tugged the bunched material pressing her against him he watched her eyes glaze heard the ragged moan when his mouth fed on hers then his lips rushed down over the line of her throat it was as smooth as scented as hed imagined it so he feasted her hands clutched at his hips her head falling back to offer him whatever he chose to take all the while the heat coursed through her painfully forcing her breath out in harsh ragged moans with a jerk he freed her arms before she could reach out his hands his wide clever hands streaked under her sweater to mold to possess flesh and lace curves and shudders he found everything he wanted and wanted more his mouth continued its relentless assault while his fingers tortured her skin and her skin tortured him with a flick of his wrist he unsnapped her trousers then skimmed the tips of his fingers along her quivering belly under the edge of more lace she moved against him pressed urgently against him her teeth scraping along his neck in greedy bites he could take her now fast and hot where they stood the speed would release this terrible pressure that burned inside him but he wanted more he dragged the sweater over her head tossed it aside and filled his palms with her breasts the lace covering was smooth delicate and the flesh beneath already flushed and warm with desire ruthlessly controlling the pounding need to rush rafe watched her face the flicker of light and shadow over it while he rubbed his workroughened thumbs over the points of her breasts ive imagined you like this i know his lips curved again and his eyes were focused keenly on hers when he nudged a slim strap down her shoulder i dont think youve imagined what ive thought of doing to you i dont think you could so im going to show you his eyes stayed on hers watching measuring as he skimmed a finger along the valley between her breasts up over the curve then back to flick open the center clasp so he saw that lovely sky blue gaze darken with the storm he set off inside her and he felt it quake in both of them her breath caught in her throat when he jerked her off her feet and set his hungry mouth to work shocked she arched back her hands fumbling in his hair over his shoulders tugging desperately at his shirt his teeth nipped into her just short of savage just short of pain his tongue tormented and aroused needs too violent to bear wild frantic she clawed at him even as she felt herself failing she tore and ripped at his shirt she was on her back on the thin cushion of the sleeping bag and bucking desperately beneath him finally she tugged his shirt away cursing when she found yet another layer separating them she wanted flesh craved it with a mindless hunger the moment hed dragged the thin undershirt aside she sank her teeth into his shoulder touch me her words were raw and urgent i want your hands on me they were everywhere at once her world became primitive dangerously exciting pumped full to bursting with unspeakable sensations each rough impatient caress sent fresh shocks erupting until her body was nothing but sweaty flesh over sparking nerves beside her the fire shot hissing embers against the screen inside her flames leapt and burned she could see him through the haze that blurred her vision the dark hair the fierce eyes the muscles that glistened with sweat in the dance of light her moan of protest when his mouth left hers turned to one of giddy pleasure as his lips streaked down over throat over breasts and torso he levered back and blind with need she reared up her arms circling possessively her lips searching for each new taste his oath was brief and vicious boots he managed fighting to pry hers off while his blood screamed she was draped around him that wonderful body sliding over his her hands those incredible elegant hands boots thudded where he heaved them aside then quick as a snake turned to take her she was tangled around him all long silky limbs he wanted her naked and writhing beneath him he wanted to hear her scream his name and watch the jolts and shocks of pleasure glaze her eyes breath ragged he dragged the slacks down her hips in one reckless swipe he tore the lace to shreds even as her gasp echoed off the walls he shoved her back and used his mouth the climax slammed into her a bareknuckled punch that knocked her senseless reeling from it she sobbed out his name and shuddering shuddering hungered for more he gave her more and took more each time she thought he would end it must end it he found some new way to batter her senses there was only him the taste the feel the smell of him they rolled over the floor in a wild glorious combat her nails digging ruthlessly into his back his mouth searing hers nearly blinded by need he gripped her hands fingers vised he thought his own breathing must tear his lungs apart her face was all he could see as he drove himself into her twin groans mixed a log shattered thunderously in the grate they trembled watching each other as they savored that timeless instant of mating muscles straining he lowered his head covered her mouth when the kiss was at its deepest when her flavor filled him as intimately as he was filling her they began to move together it was the cold that finally roused regan though it seemed impossible she thought she must have fallen asleep as she struggled to orient herself she discovered her back was against the cold hard wood of the floor pressed firmly against it by the weight of rafes body she looked around dazedly somehow or other theyd gotten themselves several feet from the fire you awake now rafes voice was thick a little sleepy i guess she tried a deep breath was relieved to find she could accomplish it i cant really tell he shifted his head skimmed his lips over the curve of her breast her exhausted body quivered in response i guess i can tell after all she said youre cold he shifted hauled her up and put her back on the sleeping bag wished for her that was a feather bed better yeah not quite sure of her moves she tugged a corner of the bag up to her chin shed never been so exposed so completely naked body and soul before anyone i must have dozed off just a couple minutes he grinned at her he felt as though hed climbed a mountain and could climb ten more ill put another log on naked and easy he rose to go to the woodbox the scratches scoring his shoulders had regans mouth falling open shed done that shed actually good god i ah should go cassiell be worried rafe set the screen back in place without a word he reached into the duffel bag beside the woodbox and took out a cellular phone call her i didnt realize you had a phone its a tool on a job like this he handed it to her then sat down beside her call her he repeated and stay she was sure there were reasons why she should go but she dialed her own number watching rafe as the phone rang cassie its regan yes everythings fine snow baffled for a moment she pushed her hair away from her face oh yes its really coming down thats why im calling i got urn involved and i think she trailed off as rafe tugged the corner of the bag out of her hand as his fingers trailed down the curve of her breast what she swallowed then bit back a moan his mouth had replaced his fingers she slid bonelessly to her back pennsylvania she mummied no im not in pennsylvania rafe took the phone from her limp fingers shes with me shes staying with me no kidding shell call you tomorrow right he clicked the phone off set it aside cassie says weve got over a foot out there the streets are a mess and you should stay put oh she closed her eyes lifted her arms thats very sensible the candles had guttered out and the fire had burned to embers when she awoke the house was so still so quiet she could hear her own heartbeat the room was filled with shadows and darkness but it was oddly peaceful perhaps the ghosts slept she mused or perhaps she felt at ease with them because rafe slept beside her she turned her head and studied his face in the dying firelight asleep or not she mused there was no innocentlittleboy look about him all that power and the potential for violence were still there carved into his face she knew he could be gentle caring shed seen that in the way he was with cassie but as a lover he was demanding relentless and rough and for the first time in her life shed been the same now with the quiet like a blanket over her she found it hard to believe she had done what shed done had allowed him wanted him to do what he had done her body ached from bruises and she wondered if in the full light of day she would wince at the memory of how shed come by them of how shed ached and trembled and hungered under those big hard hands even more of how shed used her own of how she realized with a jolt she wanted to use them now taking a shallow breath she eased out from under rafes possessive arm she moved as quietly as she could settled on slipping on his flannel shirt for covering buttoning it as she went she padded toward the kitchen a cold drink of water she told herself a few moments to evaluate the situation at the sink she filled a glass as her eyes adjusted she watched the drift of snow falling outside the window she didnt regret that she mused would be foolish fate had placed an extraordinary lover in her path the kind of man few women ever knew she could and would be content with the physical thrill of it she could and would prevent it and him from complicating her life they were both adults as he had said they both knew what they wanted when the house was finished he would probably grow restless and move on meanwhile they would enjoy each other and when it was over it would end with mutual understanding and she hoped affection it would probably be wise to discuss those expectations or the lack of them before things went any further but she found herself torn at the very idea of voicing them from the doorway rafe studied her the way she stood leaning a little on the counter her eyes on the window her face reflected in it his shirt skimmed her thighs worn flannel against creamy skin it struck him hard that hed never in his life seen anything more beautiful he had the words to tell her he was good with them but he found there were none this time none good enough to show how much she mattered so he chose easy ones casual ones and ignored the ache just looking at her had spreading around his heart i like your dress darling she jolted nearly bobbled the glass before she turned hed tugged on jeans but hadnt bothered to fasten them grinning he leaned against the unframed doorway it was handy she said matching his tone that old shirts never had it so good restless i was thirsty but she set the glass down without taking so much as a sip i guess the quiet woke me its odd dont you think how quiet it is the snow always makes it quiet no i mean the house it seems different settled even dead soldiers and unhappy women have to sleep sometime he crossed the room to pick up the glass and drink himself its almost dawn he murmured my brothers and i spent the night here once when we were kids i guess i told you that already jared rattling chains and all of you telling ghost stories and smoking stolen cigarettes you got it i came into this room then too it was just about this time of day but it was late summer everything was so green and the woods were so dense and thick they made you wonder what was in them there was a mist over the ground like a river it was beautiful and i thought he broke off shrugged no she laid a hand on his arm tell me i thought i could hear the drums slowly the sounds of camps breaking to prepare for battle i could smell the fear the excitement the dread i thought i could hear the house waking around me the whispers and creaks i was petrified paralyzed if i could have moved id have hauled my butt out of here the guys wouldve rubbed my nose in it for years but id have run like a rabbit if my legs had moved you were just a boy youve never been a boy so you dont know that made it ten times worse id gotten through the night even gotten a kick out of it and here it was morning dawn breaking and i stood here with my teeth chattering when it passed i just stood looking out this window and i thought no damn house is going to get the better of me nothings going to get the better of me ill own this house before im finished he smiled then set the glass down i dont know how many times i came back here alone after that waiting for something to happen wishing it would just so i could stand up to it i crept through every room of this place at one time or another i heard things saw things felt things the night i left town i promised myself id come back now you have it she said quietly yeah faintly embarrassed he looked down at her i never told anyone that then neither will i she lifted a hand touched his cheek whatever your reasons youre doing something important this house has been neglected too long were you frightened staying here through the night no not of the house his brow lifted of me yes im frightened of you the humor faded from his eyes i was rough with you he said carefully i dont mean that she turned away out of habit she set a kettle on the stove flicked on the burner ive never been the way i was last night with anyone so out of control so needy im a little surprised when i think back and well she let out a shaky breath searched out a filter for the drip cone surprised or sorry not sorry rafe making the effort she turned back and met his eyes no not sorry at all uneasy because i know now exactly what you can do to me i knew making love with you would be exciting i didnt know it would be so shattering nothing about you is tidy or predictable the way i like things to be i want you now that should be predictable my heart jumps she managed literally when you say things like that but i do need things to be tidy opening the can of coffee she deliberately measured out scoops i imagine your men will be coming along in an hour or so this probably isnt the best time to talk this out nobodys coming today theres better than two feet of snow out there on top of what we already had oh her hand faltered spilling ground coffee on the stove were snowbound for a while darling you can talk all you want well after clearing her throat she faced him again i just think its best if we both understood things what things things she bit the word off furious at herself for hesitating things that we didnt quite finish outlining last night that what were having is a mutual satisfying and physical affair no strings no entanglements no complications yes relieved she nodded exactly surprised to find himself annoyed with her coolheaded description one that should have mirrored his own wishes he scratched his head thats tidy enough but if that means youre planning on seeing somebody else itll get messy when i break him in half oh of all the ridiculous and cut off his stop that she blew out a heated breath i have no intention of seeing someone else while were involved but if i smarter to stop there he said quietly lets just say we have a mutually satisfying and exclusive physical relationship that suit you calmer she turned back to pour boiling water through the filter yes i can agree to that youre a piece of work regan you want the contract in triplicate i only want to make sure we expect the same things she concentrated hard on covering the grounds with water on being sure not to pour too much water or too little we havent taken time to really get to know each other now were lovers i dont want you to think im looking for any more than that and if im looking for more her fingers whitened on the handle of the kettle are you he looked away from her toward the window and the softly falling snow no she closed her eyes telling herself it was relief she felt at his answer only relief well then theres no problem no everythings dandy his voice was as cool and detached as hers you dont want romance saves me the trouble you dont want promises i dont have to lie we want each other in bed he reached for two mugs that keeps it simple i want you in bed pleased with her casual tone she took the mugs from him but if i didnt like who you are we wouldnt have gotten there ive wanted other men in a deceptively calm gesture he flicked her hair behind her ear now youre trying to make me mad the fact that he couldnt see how difficult it was for her to be so open to keep things simple made it easier oddly enough this kind of openness seemed completely natural with him im trying to give you a complement i wouldnt have come here last night hoping youd be here if i hadnt cared about you you came to drop off candlesticks youre an idiot amused at both of them she poured coffee she hadnt realized sexual frankness could be fun you didnt really buy that did you intrigued he took the mug she offered yeah i did she sipped smiled sucker maybe i dont like sneaky aggressive women yes you do in fact youre hoping ill seduce you right now think so i know so but i want my coffee first he watched her take another delicate sip maybe i want my shirt back you didnt ask if you could borrow it fine with one hand she undid the buttons take it he nipped the coffee from her hand set both mugs aside her smug smile had him scooping her off her feet she was laughing and assaulting his ear as he carried her back down the hall the front door swung open letting in cold and blowing snow and a figure crusted with white shane dragged off his cap and shook himself like a dog hey casually he kicked the door closed your cars buried to the wheel wells regan oh with a fumbling hand she clutched the shirt together and tried to mirror his easy tone we got a lot of snow over two feet unabashed he grinned at his brother figured youd need someone to plow you out does it look like i want you to rescue me disgusted rafe strode into the parlor and dumped regan on the settee stay right there rafe futilely she tried to tug the hem of the shirt down over her legs for heavens sake right there he repeated and headed back into the hall that coffee i smell shane asked conversationally i could use some give me one reason why i shouldnt break your neck shane took off his gloves blew on his chilled fingers cause i rode over here in a blizzard to save yours he leaned forward but couldnt quite see into the parlor shes sure got legs where do you want to die just an observation his grin only widened the mackade dimple flashing hey who knew i figured you were stuck here without transportation alone then when i saw her car i thought maybe she needed a lift into town again he inched forward hopeful maybe i should ask her one more step and they wont find your body till spring if i win can i keep her when rafe snarled shane erupted with laughter dont hit me im frozen ill break muttering threats rafe grabbed shane by the collar and dragged him down the hall eyes front mackade in the kitchen he found a thermos filled it with coffee now beat it im going but shane drank straight from the thermos the winds a bitch grateful for the heat he drank again look i didnt mean to horn in on your little love nest he began then stopped lowered the thermos when he read quick fury in rafes eyes hey are you serious about her mind your own damn business shane whistled out a breath screwed the top on the thermos youve always been my business regans a real lady i mean that so so nothing embarrassed now shane shifted position i like her always have i thought about realizing hed taken a wrong turn he pulled out his gloves again and whistled a cheerful tune thought about what cautious shane ran his tongue around his teeth he really wanted to keep all of them just what you think i thought hell look at her a mans bound to think agile he evaded rafes lunging arm think is all i did im not going to fight you over thinking in a gesture of peace he threw up his hands what im saying is its great you hit the jackpot temper vanished rafe reached for the pot again were sleeping together thats all you gotta start somewhere shes different shane he hadnt been able to admit it to himself but it came easily brother to brother i havent sorted it out but shes different she matters a lot everybodys got to take the big fall sometime shane slapped a hand on rafes bare shoulder even you i didnt say anything about falling rafe muttered he knew the implications of that falling in love being in love you didnt have to look ill plow the lane just in case you got any food around here yeah theres enough ill take off then its supposed to let up by midmorning i have animals to tend to so if you need something try devin first i might be out thanks shane he turned eyeing his brother if you so much as glance in that parlor on your way out ill have to kill you i already got a good look at her legs whistling cheerfully shane ambled down the hall see you regan it cost him but he kept his eyes averted on his way to the door the minute she heard it slam regan pressed her face on her updrawn knees stepping into the parlor rafe winced at her defensive posture her trembling shoulders look darling im sorry i should have locked the damn door gently he patted her shoulder and sat down beside her shane doesnt mean to be an idiot he was born that way he doesnt mean any harm dont be upset she made a strangled sound and when she lifted her face it was wet with tears her laughter bubbled out like wine can you imagine what we looked like the three of us in that hall she pressed her hand over her mouth and rocked the two of us halfnaked shane looking like the abominable snowman you think thats funny no i think its hysterical weak with laughter she collapsed against him the mackade brothers oh god what have i gotten myself into delighted with her he hauled her into his lap give me back my shirt darling and ill show you chapter cozy in the sleeping bag regan dozed by the fire it sizzled logs crackling and brushed heat over her face and her outflung arm she sighed cruising with the dream shifting toward her lover her dreams were nearly as erotic as the reality of the past hours vivid enough to have her stirring and yearning when she reached out and found herself alone she sighed again in disappointment the fire was lively so she knew rafe had built it up once more before he left her the room was quiet enough that she could hear the ticking of the mantel clock marking time evidence of the nights activities was all around her in the hastily strewn clothes littering the floor the torn bits of lace and the jumbled boots and the evidence was within her as she stretched feeling the warm glow of desire she wished he was there so that he could stoke it as he had stoked the fire still it was a wonderful shock to realize she could lay claim to such a bottomless well of passion it had never been so before she reflected sitting up to exercise her stiff and sore muscles physical relationships had always been far down on her list of priorities she wondered if after her recent behavior rafe would be surprised to know that before him she had considered herself hesitant even a little shy when it came to intimacy with a yawn she reached for her sweater and pulled it over her head knowing him she decided hed just be smug it was a pity she couldnt blame her celibacy of the past few years for her wildfire response to him it felt as though her libido had been nothing more than dry timber set to the torch the moment he put his hands on her but using abstinence as the major reason for her response would be far from honest whatever her life had been before hed changed it just by stepping into her path it was certain she would never look at cozy nights by a fire in the same way again it was doubtful she would look at anything in quite the same way again she mused now that she knew what she was capable of with the right mate just how she wondered did a woman go back to a quiet settled life once shed had a taste of rafe mackade that was something she was going to have to deal with one cautious day at a time at the moment the only thing she wanted was to find him in her stocking feet she began to wander the house he could be anywhere and the challenge of hunting him down finding him busy with some chore one she was determined to distract him from amused her the chill of the bare floors seeped through and had her rubbing her hands together for a little warmth but curiosity far overweighed a little discomfort shed been through the firstfloor rooms only twice before first on her initial viewing to take notes and measurements the second time to recheck them but there were no workmen now no sounds of voices or hammering she slipped into the room beyond the parlor dreaming a bit this would be the library glossy shelves filled with books deepcushioned chairs inviting a guest to curl up to read a library table would stand there she mused a sheraton if she could find one with a decanter of brandy a vase of seasonal flowers an old pewter inkwell library steps of course she continued visualizing seeing it all perfectly almost to the grain of wood and the widebacked chairs near the crackling fire would need cozy footstools she wanted a reading stand in the far corner one with a cabriole base shed set a big old bible with giltedged pages open on it abigail obrian married to charles richard barlow april catherine anne barlow born june charles richard barlow junior born november robert michael barlow born february abigail barlow died september regan shivered swayed she came back to herself slowly her arms wrapped tight to ward off the sudden bitter cold her heart pounding as the vision faded from in front of her eyes how had she known that she wondered running a shaky hand over her face where had those names and dates come from shed read them somewhere she assured herself but shuddered again all the research shed done of course shed read them very slowly she backed out of the room and stood in the hall to catch her breath of course shed known the barlows of that time had had three children shed looked it up the dates must have been there as well shed retained them for some reason that was all not for anything would she have admitted that she had thought just for a moment that shed actually seen the thick white page of a bible opened and the names and dates written there in a carefully formal hand she walked to the stairs and climbed them hed left the door open this time when she reached the landing she heard the scrape of his trowel against the wall letting out a relieved breath she crossed the hall and was warm again just looking at him need a hand he glanced back saw her standing there in her classic sweater and pleated trousers not in that outfit i just wanted to get this coat finished and i thought you needed some sleep she contented herself with leaning against the doorway to watch him why is it that manual labor is so attractive on some men some women like to see guys sweat apparently i do thoughtfully she studied his technique the slide of the trowel the flick of the wrist you know youre better at this than the guy who did my place over the shop very tidy i hate drywall work then why are you doing it i like when its finished and im faster than the team i hired how did you learn we were always having to fix something out at the farm he twisted his neck cracking out kinks when i left i did a lot of handyman stuff then started your own company i dont like working for somebody else neither do i she hesitated waiting while he scraped off his tools where did you go when you left south he stooped to bang the top back on the bucket of compound picked up some jobs here and there figured out i was better at swinging a hammer than running a plow out of habit he reached into his shirt pocket found it empty swore quit smoking he muttered good for you its driving me nuts to keep himself busy he walked over to check a seam hed finished the night before you went to florida she said prompting him yeah thats where i ended up lots of construction work in florida i started buying housesdumps fixing them up turning them over did pretty well so i came back he turned to her thats about it i wasnt prying she began i didnt say you were there just isnt much to it regan i had a rep when i left here spent my last night in town in a bar fight with joe dolin i wondered if there was history there she murmured not much of one he slipped off the bandanna hed twisted at his forehead to keep the hair out of his eyes stuffed it in his pocket we just hated each others guts id say your taste in enemies is excellent restless again he moved his shoulders if it hadnt been him it would have been somebody else i was in the mood that night his grin flashed but there wasnt much humor in it hell i was usually in the mood to cause trouble nobody ever figured id amount to anything not even me if he was trying to tell her something she wasnt sure she quite understood it it looks as though they were wrong even you people are going to talk about us hed thought about it as he watched her sleep finding himself restless and edgy and needing to move youre going to walk into eds or kingstons market and conversations going to take a hitch and when you walk out again people are going to start talking about what that nice bishop woman is doing with that troublemaker rafe mackade ive been here three years rafe i know how it works he needed something to do with his hands so he picked up sandpaper and attacked the first dry seam i dont imagine youve given them much to gossip about up to now he worked as if the devil were looking over his shoulder she thought it seemed he did everything with that controlled urgency just under the surface i was pretty hot news when i opened the shop whats this flatlander doing taking over old leroys place selling antiques instead of screws and pipe fittings she smiled a little that got me a lot of browsers and a good many browsers became customers she angled her head watching him something like this should pick business up dramatically for a few weeks i want you to understand what youre getting into its a little late for that because she sensed he needed some prodding she obliged maybe youre worried about your reputation right dust flew as he sanded i was thinking of running for mayor no your badboy rep mackade must be getting soft hanging around that nice bishop woman next thing you know hell be buying flowers instead of a sixpack bet shell whip him into shape curious he tossed the sandpaper aside tucked his thumbs in his front pockets and turned to look at her is that what youre going to try to do regan whip me into shape is that what youre worried about mackade that i could it wasnt a comfortable thought legions have tried he walked over skimmed a dusty finger down her cheek itd be easier for me to corrupt you darling i could have you playing nineball at duffs tavern in no time i could have you quoting shelley shelley who with a chuckle she rose on her toes to give him a friendly kiss percy bysshe shelley better watch yourself the idea of that was so ridiculous his tensed shoulders relaxed darling the day i start spouting poetrys the day shanes prize hog sprouts wings and flies down main street she smiled again kissed him again you dont want to make it a bet come on id like to take a look at the work in progress he snatched her hand what kind of bet she laughed tugged him into the hall rafe im joking give me a tour just hold on mackades never back down from a dare im daring you to quote shelley she sighed shook her head okay i dare you no thats not how it works considering he lifted her hand nibbled on her fingers the flicker of arousal in her eyes inspired him i say i can have you so crazy about me within a month that youll wiggle into a leather miniskirt a red one walk into the tavern for beer and nineball arousal turned quickly into amusement what odd fantasies you have mackade can you actually see me in some tarty little skirt playing pool the smile turned wicked oh yeah i can see that just fine make sure you wear those really high heels too the skinny ones i never wear leather without stilettos anything less would be tacky and no bra her laughed puffed out really into this arent you im getting there youll do it too he cupped a hand on her hip to nudge her closer because youll be crazy about me its obvious one of us has already lost our mind okay not one to refuse a challenge she put a hand on his chest pushed him back i say within that same period of time ill have you on your knees clutching a bouquet of ah lilacs lilacs yes im very fond of lilacs youll quote shelley like a champ whats the winner get satisfaction he had to smile that ought to be enough deal they shook hands on it am i going to get that tour now sure he draped an arm around her shoulder and entertained himself with the vision of those very fine legs beneath a tight red skirt we went with your idea of a kind of bridal suite he led the way down the hall opened a sixpaneled door just about ready for trim work in here rafe delighted she stepped inside the delicate floral wallpaper was nearly all hung the coffered ceiling gleamed with fresh paint french doors were in place and would one day open onto the wide porch overlook gardens in riotous bloom the floor was covered with drop cloths but she could imagine it glossy and accented with a lovely faded tapestry rug she stepped around buckets and ladders already arranging furniture in her head its going to be beautiful she murmured its coming along he lifted a tarp from the fireplace the mantel was shot i couldnt fix it found a good piece of yellow pine though the woodworkers using the original as a guide that rosecolored trim is going to be wonderful in here she looked through an adjoining doorway and this is the bath mmm he studied the room over her shoulder it was goodsized and the plumbers had roughed it in used to be a dressing room she reached for his hand gripped it can you smell it roses absently he rubbed his cheek over her hair it always smells like roses in here one of the paper hangers accused his partner of wearing perfume this was her room wasnt it abigails she died in here probably hey he tipped up her face watched uncomfortably as a tear trailed down her cheek dont its so sad she must have been terribly unhappy knowing the man shed married the father of her children was capable of such coldblooded cruelty how did he treat her rafe did he love her or did he only own her theres no way to know dont cry awkward he brushed the tear away it makes me feel like i have six thumbs i mean it for lack of something better to do he patted her head theres no use crying over something that happened more than a hundred years ago but shes still here wrapping her arms around him regan snuggled into his chest i feel so sorry for her for all of them youre not going to do yourself or me any good if you get tangled up every time you come in here i know she sighed comforted by the way his heart beat strong and steady against her its odd how you get used to it a little bit at a time rafe when i was downstairs alone what uneasy he tilted her face toward his again if s nothing what he repeated giving her chin a little shake well i walked into the library what was the library she went on torn between the need to tell him and embarrassment what will be the library and i rafe i could see it his eyes were sharp narrowed totally concentrated see what the room not the stained floors and the new wiring youve put in the room books on the wall flowers on the table drapes at the windows i could really see it she repeated her own brow creasing not the way i do in my head when im planning things out not exactly like that i was thinking to myself sort of projecting i suppose i imagined this well i thought i was imagining a bible stand with an old family bible opened on it and i could read the page almost touch it marriage and births and death she took time to catch her breath youre not saying anything because im listening to you i know it sounds crazy not in this house it doesnt it was so real so sad the way the scent of roses in this room is real and sad then it was so cold bitter like a window had been filing open to the weather she moved her shoulders laid her head on his chest again thats all thats a lot for one day wanting to soothe he stroked his hand over her hair i can give devin a call have him come get you no i dont want to leave it shook me for a moment but its just as i said before you get to accept it i can handle it i shouldnt have left you alone dont be silly i dont need to be guarded against grieving ghosts but he wanted to guard her he wished she had called for him it surprised mm just how much he wished she had needed him enough to call out for him next time you want to go in the library let me know ill go with you the house is already changing she said quietly youve done that by caring for it i like feeling ive had a part in that too you have he pressed his lips to her hair when people live in it make love in it laugh in it itll change again the house needs people she shifted lifted her mouth to his make love with me he cupped her face in his hands deepened the kiss when he picked her up carried her from the room the scent of roses followed she looped her arms around him pressed her lips to his throat already her blood was heating already her pulse was pounding its like a drug she murmured i know he stopped at the top of the stairs found her mouth again ive never been like this before swamped with emotions she turned her face into his shoulder neither had he he thought as he carried her down neither noticed that the air had remained warm and calm he laid her in front of the fire levering himself up on his elbow he traced the shape of her face with a fingertip something kindled inside her simmered with desire and flamed around her heart rafe ssh to quiet her he brushed his lips over her brow she didnt know what she would have said was grateful hed stopped her the wanting was more than enough she could be relieved that neither of them needed words she should have been relieved her mouth was ready for his and it warmed beautifully under the pressure of lips and tongue though desire remained poised and trembling everything in her seemed to soften here was tenderness so sweet so unexpected her sigh whispered out like a secret he felt the change in her in himself marveled at it why had they always been in such a hurry he wondered why had he hesitated to savor and he savored when there was so much here he loved the flavor of her that quietly seductive taste that clung to her skin the feel of her soft curves long lines the smell of her hair her clothes her shoulders so he savored it now all of it with long slow kisses that clouded his mind and made him forget there was anything beyond this room for either of them his hands were careful this time as he drew her sweater off slipped the trousers down her hips rather than touch rather than take he kissed her again drawing out the simple meeting of lips until her body went limp let me with a dreamy murmur she shifted until they were both kneeling already clouded her eyes stayed on his while she unbuttoned his shirt trapped in the silky mood she slipped it away and with her hands resting lightly on his shoulders swayed to him they held each other moving only for quiet sipping tastes soft gentle caresses she smiled when his lips brushed her shoulder sighed when hers tasted his throat when they were naked he drew her down so that she lay over him so that her hair fell to curtain them both she could have floated on this whisperthin cloud of sensations endlessly with the winter sun slanting cold light through the windows the fire crackling his body strong and hard beneath hers the feel of his hands on her stroking soothing even as they aroused was like a gift she felt the wonder of it in every pore in every nerve with every pulse there was no clash and fury now no desperation no vicious drive to mate now she was aware of everything the dust motes spinning in the sunbeam that rayed over the floor the sedate hiss of flame on wood the scent of roses and man she could count his heartbeats quicker stronger as her lips trailed over his chest the bunching and quivering of a muscle beneath her hand the sound of her own thickening breath with a sigh that caught in her throat she wrapped around him as he rolled her to her back time spun out stretched quivered the clock on the mantel ticked the seconds away and the minutes but that was another world here there were only needs lazily satisfied and hearts quietly lost for pleasure his as well as hers he eased her gently to the edge and over his name was only a murmur on her lips as she arched tensed softened to silk she opened for him drawing him close with a velvety moan as he slipped into her overwhelmed by her by the simplicity of it he burrowed his face in her hair the tenderness shattered them both they didnt speak of it when they parted in the morning both of them were determinedly casual but they thought of it and they worried rafe watched her drive off as the sun struggled over the mountains to the east when she was gone when there was no one to see he rubbed the heel of his hand over his heart there was an ache there that he couldnt quite will away he had a very bad feeling that she was the cause of it and that somehow in a matter of hours hed gotten in over his head god he missed her already he swore at himself for that then swore again for reaching like a trained dog for the cigarettes that werent there both were just habits he assured himself if he wanted he could just go buy a pack of cigarettes and smoke his brains out just as he could snatch her back anytime sex was a powerful bond it wasnt surprising it had caught him as well it didnt have to be any more than that theyd tidied that up hadnt they a man was entitled to be a little shaky after thirtyodd hours of sex and solitude with a gorgeous woman he didnt want anything more neither did she it was a relief and a pleasure to find a lover who wanted no more and no less than he did himself a woman who didnt expect him to play games make promises neither expected to be kept say words that were only words after all scowling he grabbed a shovel and began to deal with the snow that piled the walk the sun was strengthening and he worked fast so that even with the bite of the northern wind he sweated satisfactorily under his coat shed probably head straight for the shower he mused tossing heavy snow off the path wash that pretty doecolored hair of hers he wondered what it looked like wet shed dig some of those neat classy clothes out of her closet nope he thought correcting himself regan would never dig shed select quiet colors simple lines one of those professionalwomans jackets with a pin on the lapel shed fix her face nothing too obvious just hints of blush along the cheekbones a touch of color above those ridiculously long lashes then lipstick not red not pink a kind of rose that accented those full lips and that sassy little mole beside them halfway down the walk he stopped leaned against the shovel and wondered if he was losing her mind he was actually thinking about her makeup what the hell did he care what paint she slapped on before she went down to open the shop shed put on the kettle for tea or have cider simmering so that the place smelled of apples and spices then shed go through the day without giving him a thought snow flew as he attacked it well he had plenty to do himself and no time to brood about her hed reached the end of the walk and the end of his patience when devin rattled up the lane in the sheriffs cruiser what the hell do you want rafe shouted havent you got somebody to arrest funny how a little blizzard quiets things down leaning on the open car door devin watched his brother with amusement saw regans car was gone figured it was safe to drop by ive got men due any minute i dont have time to chat in that case ill take my doughnuts and go rafe swiped a hand over his chilled face what kind apple and brown sugar some things were sacred and an apple doughnut on a cold morning topped the list well are you going to stand there all morning with that idiot grin on your face give me a damn doughnut obligingly devin took the bag out of the car and sauntered over had three fender benders in town yesterday from people not smart enough to stay put antietams a wild town all right have to shoot anybody not lately devin took out a doughnut for himself before passing the bag to rafe broke up a fistfight though down at the tavern nope at the market millie yeader and mrs metz were going at it over the last pack of toilet paper rafes lips twitched people get a little nervous over necessities when a big snow hits tell me about it miz metz conked millie with a bunch of bananas took a lot of diplomacy to keep millie from filing charges assault with tropical fruit couldve done hard time for that calm again rafe licked apple from bis thumb did you come by to give me the latest trials and tribulations of antietam thats just a bonus devin polished off his doughnut reached for a cigarette his grin was wide and unsympathetic when rafe groaned he lit it inhaled lavishly i hear food tastes better when you quit nothings better rafe shot back but some of us have real willpower blow it over here you bastard secondhand smokes the real killer devin told him and blew a stream in rafes direction you look a little out of sorts rafe trouble in paradise rafe gave some thought to beating his brother to death with the snow shovel and stealing all his cigarettes reminding himself it was all a matter of selfcontrol he leaned on the shovel instead how long did it take shane to open his big mouth lets see considering devin smoked and studied the landscape the way the roads were yesterday id say it took him oh about seven minutes to get from here to my office he flicked ash aside lets say seven minutes and ten seconds now youre here to offer your sage advice hey it was pretty sage to talk those two snarling women into splitting the sixpack of pink toilet paper but no with a selfdeprecating smile he took a last drag then flicked the cigarette away rafe watched it wistfully as it hissed in the snow im not exactly the expert on romance in the mackade family devins grin was crooked and didnt last long i thought you might like the latest on joe dolin hes locked up for now i got word hes copping to seconddegree assault if he listens to his lawyer hell agree to alcohol counseling hell get a fine suspended sentence with probation and a stern warning not to hit his wife again what the hell kind of deal is that prisons ass crowded domestic disputes dont usually equal tough sentencing he says yeah i did it im sorry i lost my temper i was drunk i lost my job my selfesteem is really low the judge says get yourself into counseling my boy and sin no more rafe studied his brothers face beneath the calm he caught the twitches of fury and frustration youre just going to let it go at that i dont sentence devin struggled to bite back on his sense of anger and impotence theres nothing i can do except talk cassie into letting me issue a restraining order and make sure he doesnt get near her or the kids meanwhile theyre bunked down at regans that puts her in the middle i dont like it any better than you do ive got the law to work around i dont devins gaze was cool and level no you dont but you start something with dolin and its going to come down in his favor hell make a mistake rafe all it takes is one and ill have him caged again until i do i dont know where things stand between you and regan but if you were staying there itd hold a lot more weight with me than some useless restraining order you want me to ask regan to let me move in with her and cassie and the kids the idea was surprisingly appealing waking up beside her sharing that first cup of coffee you going to deputize me dev not on your life too bad well ill run it by regan and let you know chapter absolutely not regan planted her feet folded her arms over her chest you are not sleeping in my bed with two little children in the next room this isnt about sex rafe said patiently thats just a bonus im telling you this is an official request from the sheriff who just happens to be your brother no she turned away to set glassware back on the shelf shed been dusting it would make cassie uncomfortable and set a poor example for the children and if they werent there he found the question leaping to the tip of his tongue like a frog he was barely in time to prevent himself from letting it jump out its cassie and the kids who are the issue he insisted you think dolins just going to leave them alone because cassie signs some paper telling him to i have no idea what hell do but hell have to get past me first the thought of it just the thought of it had his blood icing over now you listen she jerked his hand from her shoulder and whirled back no you listen the man is a bully and a drunk im not afraid of drunken bullies i offered cassie my home and shes welcome to stay there as long as she wants i have a good solid lock on the door which ill use i know the number for the sheriffs office which ill use as well if its necessary theres no lock on that door rafe jerked a thumb toward the front of the shop whats to stop him from walking in here during business hours and harassing you or worse i am right he wondered if shaking her would rattle her brains back into place putting dolin on the receiving end of that stubborn chin of yours isnt going to stop him in case you havent figured it out he likes hurting women ill take a moment to remind you that for the past three years ive been here and you havent ive seen exactly what hes done to cassie and you figure because youre not married to him youre safe he did shake her you cant be that stupid im not stupid she shot back im competent i dont need or want you for a bodyguard his eyes changed going from full heat to slow burn on her shoulders his hands tensed then lifted away i guess thats the bottom line isnt it you dont need or want my help ego she thought with a muffled sigh there was no monster so fierce or so vulnerable as a mans ego the sheriffs office is five minutes away if i need to call out troops hoping to calm them both regan put her hands on his shoulders rafe i appreciate your concern really i do but i can take care of myself and cassie too if it comes to that i bet you can i worked a shop in dc for years one memorable evening i was robbed at gunpoint i know how to be sensible how not to take chances and how to defend myself i appreciate the fact that youre worried but im not cassie he cant frighten or intimidate me regan wait let me finish cassie is so fragile right now and the children are too quiet im not sure how they would handle having a man around the kids dont know you he jammed his hands in his pockets im not going to kick them around they dont know that little emma sits at cassies feet with her doll and barely says a word and the boy god rafe he breaks my heart they need time to feel safe again youre too big youre too strong youre too male stubbornly he ignored the fact that shed hurt him that he could be hurt and concentrated on the situation at hand youre being pigheaded im doing what seems right to me thats the only way i know how to handle things believe me ive thought this through weighed the options having you move in just isnt one of them invite me to dinner he said abruptly you want to come to dinner ask me to dinner so i can get to know the kids so theyll get used to me being around now whos pigheaded but she sighed it was a reasonable compromise all right seventhirty and youre out by ten can we neck on the couch after the kids go to bed maybe now go away arent you going to kiss me goodbye she huffed out a breath then kissed him primly on the cheek business hours she said then laughed when he grabbed her rafe were right in front of the window i the rest was lost as he crushed his mouth to hers might as well give them something to talk about and give her something to think about he told himself she was damn well going to do a lot of thinking about rafe mackade he nipped her lip let her go then sauntered out the door a block away cassie sat in devins office twisting her hands together she knew it should be easier because it was devin someone shed known all her life but it only made the shame worse im sorry we got busy and i couldnt take my break until now thats all right cassie it had become habit to keep his voice quiet when he spoke to her as a man might speak to a wounded bird ive got the paperwork filled out for you you just have to sign it hes not going to go to jail a fist squeezed his heart at the emptiness in her tone no is it because i let him hit me no he wished he could reach out to soothe those nervous hands but the desk was between them an official barrier he admitted that he hurt you but the court took other things into consideration his drinking problem his loss of a longtime job hell have to go into counseling report to his probation officer stay out of trouble it could be good for him she looked up then just as quickly down again the counseling if he stops drinking maybe everything would be all right yeah and he could run a popsicle stand in hell devin thought in the meantime you need to protect yourself thats what the restraining orders for she lifted her gaze again and this time her eyes held his that paper is going to keep him from coming back devin grabbed a cigarette out of his pack then tossed it down when he spoke his voice was cool and official this bars him from coming near you he cant come into the diner when youre working there he cant approach you on the street or come to regans house as long as youre staying there if he breaks any one of the regulations set down here hell void his parole and serve the eighteen months he knows about this hes been notified she moistened her lips he couldnt come near her the idea whirled around in her head if he couldnt come near her he couldnt hit her i only have to sign it yes you only have to sign it devin rose then came around the desk to offer her a pen when she made no move to take it he bit back an oath cassie what do you want can you just tell me what you want she shook her head took the pen she signed her name quickly as though it hurt i know ive put you through a lot of trouble devin its my job he said shortly youre a good sheriff when he glanced back obviously surprised she tried to smile you are quiet and competent and good with people everyone knows they can count on you my mother always said you and your brothers would end up behind bars she flushed and stared down at the floor im sorry that was stupid no it wasnt i used to think the same myself he smiled then because just for a moment shed sounded like the girl he remembered you know cass thats about the longest little speech ive heard out of you in close to ten years im always putting my foot in my mouth dont do that hed taken her chin to lift her head before he realized he meant to before she flinched like a startled doe moving with care he dropped his hand eased a hip on the corner of the desk how are the kids theyre all right better getting along all right at regans shes wonderful i forget im imposing because she makes everything so normal she and rafe she broke off her color rising again youve got better things to do than listen to me gossip no i dont hed have done anything to keep her talking to keep her there what do you think about them regan and rafe i she looked happy when she came home this morning he looked miserable when i dropped by the house this morning her smile was slow and shy thats a good sign rafe always needed a woman who could make him unhappy it was always too easy for him for all of you was it thoughtful he picked up his cigarette again ran it through his fingers i remember you turned me down oh fumbling she rose that was a hundred years ago not quite twelve you were sweet sixteen i was going with joe as she tugged on her coat she wondered if shed really ever been sixteen i cant even remember who we were then or what we were looking for thanks devin for taking care of this thats what im here for to take care of things at the door she paused but didnt look back it was easier to speak if she didnt have to look into those cool pitying eyes you asked me what i wanted devin i just want to feel safe she said it so quietly he barely heard thats really all in a coat that was too thin to fight off the biting wind she walked back to the cafe rafe arrived ten minutes early for dinner and squirmed on regans doorstep like a nervous suitor he had a bottle of wine in one hand and a bakery box of cookies designed to win the kids over in the other he wished hed remembered before his brainstorm that he knew nothing about people under the age of sixteen as a test he turned the knob it was somewhat satisfying to find it locked tight he knocked sharply stepped back it was regan who opened it as far as the thick security chain allowed okay so far youre passing but you should have asked who it was first i looked out the window she shut the door in his face then after a rattle of chain opened it i had the feeling thered be a quiz smiling she studied the offerings no lilacs no chance he would have kissed her if he hadnt noticed the solemn gray eyes watching him from the cushions of the sofa looks like youve got a mouse in the house regan jerked then smiled when she saw emma shes quiet as one but prettier emma this is mr mackade you met him at eds remember regan held out a hand eyeing him warily emma slipped from the couch she was five rafe knew and tiny as a fairy princess with her mothers pale hair and smoky eyes i knew your mama when she was your age he told her emma darted behind regans legs and peered up at him knowing it was a shameless bribe he shook the bakery box want a cookie honey that earned him the faintest of smiles but regan took the box out of his hands not before dinner spoilsport but dinner smells good cassies chicken and dumplings i had to practically tie her down to keep her from taking the kids and eating at the diner we compromised and had her cook dinner come on emma well take the cookies in the kitchen with one hand clutching regans slacks emma darted looks over her shoulder she thought he was big but his eyes werent mean shed already learned how to read eyes and he looked a lot like the sheriff who sometimes picked her up and gave her lemon drops but emma watched her mother carefully to gauge her reaction to the man cassie looked up from the stove and smiled hi rafe he moved to her lightly kissed her bruised cheek hows it going fine everythings fine she laid a hand on the shoulder of the boy beside her connor you remember mr mackade nice to see you again connor rafe offered a hand the little boy with the pale hair and the dusky blue eyes shook hands hesitantly youd be what in third fourth grade third yes sir rafe lifted a brow and passed the bottle of wine to regan that would make him about eight rafe figured and the kid spoke as quietly as an old priest miz witt still teaching there yes sir we used to call her miz dimwit when the boys eyes widened rafe plucked a carrot from beside the salad bowl bet you still do yes sir connor mumbled slanting a look at his mother sometimes screwing up the courage hed worked on building ever since hed been told rafe mackade was coming connor drew in his breath you bought the barlow place thats right its haunted rafe bit off some carrot and grinned you bet i know all about the battle and everything connor said in one quick burst it was the bloodiest day of the civil war and nobody really won because he broke off embarrassed this he thought miserably was why some of the kids called him nerdhead in school because nobody went for the final push rafe finished for him maybe youd like to come by the house sometime take a look i could use somebody who knows all about the battle ive got a book with pictures yeah rafe took the wine regan offered him lets see it was simple enough to draw the boy out as long as they were discussing mcclellans flawed strategy or the battle of burnside bridge rafe saw a bright needy boy too bookish to fit neatly with his contemporaries too shy to showcase his own brain the girl a miniature of her mother never strayed far from cassie or regan ate her dinner in small neat bites and watched him like a baby hawk ed would be better off having you in the kitchen than waiting tables rafe commented after hed polished off a second helping her business would double in a month off guard cassie blinked at him no one had complimented her cooking in too many years to count im glad you liked it i could put some of the leftovers in a dish for you youd just have to heat them up ill take them when cassie rose and began to clear regan held up a hand no you dont you cooked i clear but that was the deal and since rafe ate enough for two growing boys he can help the dolins looked on awed as rafe cheerfully stacked plates the men they knew would have belched loosened their belts and plopped down in front of the tv with a sixpack daddy says girls and sissies do dishes emma announced in a surprisingly clear voice emma paling cassie stared at rafe and waited for the retribution he considered making a comment about her fathers brains but decided against it my mama always said a meal has to be earned he said it lightly and winked at her and if i do the dishes with regan ill probably be able to kiss her why because she tastes almost as good as your mamas chicken and dumplings satisfied with that emma nibbled solemnly on her cookie ill just give emma her bath then flustered cassie shooed her children along i have to turn in early i have the breakfast shift in the morning thanks for dinner cassie you handled that very well regan murmured thats probably the first time in years theyve sat at the dinner table with a man and had a civilized conversation dolins not only a swine hes a fool rafe set stacked plates on the kitchen counter sweet woman like that beautiful kids any man would be lucky to have them a home of your own rafe mused a woman who loved you kids racing out to meet you at the end of the day family meals around a table noise in the kitchen funny hed never thought that was something hed wanted or needed you made an impression regan went on as she filled the sink with hot soapy water a good one i cant think of anything better for all of them than seeing a strong intelligent man behaving in a strong intelligent way she glanced back and her smile faltered at the look in his eye she was used to the way he stated at her or she nearly was but this was different deeper what is it hmm he caught himself realized he felt like a man who had nearly skidded hard and landed on very thin ice nothing its nothing good god hed actually been thinking about marriage and kids and picket fences the boy connor hes awfully bright isnt he straight as regan said as proudly as if he were her own hes bright sensitive and sweet which made him a perfect target for joe the man bullied the poor kid mercilessly he hit him the question was mild but the fire was already burning no i dont think so cassies fiercely protective of her children but emotional abuse doesnt leave bruises she shrugged well theyre out of it now she handed him a plate to dry did your father do dishes only on thanksgiving rafe polished off the plate set it aside buck mackade was a mans man buck impressed regan pursed her lips sounds formidable he was tough had eyes that could drill holes in you if you messed up devin got his eyes i got his hands bemused rafe stared down at his palms flexed his fingers it was a hell of a surprise to me when i looked down one day and saw my fathers hands on the end of my arms she couldnt have said why it touched her so to see him smiling down at his hands a dishcloth tossed over his shoulder you were close to him not close enough not for long enough when did you lose him i was fifteen tractor rolled on him it took him a week to die she plunged her hands into the water again struggled with tears is that why you hate the farm yeah i guess it is odd hed never realized it was that simple that direct the farm had taken his father so he had to hate the farm he loved it every rocky acre the way shane does what did jared get from him the mouth jare can horsetrade just like the old man and make you think you got the best end of the deal then im relieved hes my lawyer she offered another plate my father never did a dish in his life im sure my mother would be horrified if he tried the kitchen is a womans domain she said dryly they agree on that completely she brings him his first cup of coffee every morning before he goes to the hospital hes a surgeon hard feelings i used to have them she admitted she made herself into exactly the woman he wanted her to be if she was ever anything else wanted to be anything else anything more it doesnt show shes dr bishops wife and thats all he began to see just why she was so set on marking her own boundaries taking her own stands maybe thats all she wants to be apparently it just infuriated me to see the way she catered to him the way he patted her on the head he actually gives her an allowance and calls her the little woman it still made her grit her teeth she loved living in dc but a few years ago when he decided that he wanted to relocate to arizona she packed up without a murmur regan sighed but theyre blissfully happy i baffle them as much as they baffle me because you dont have a rich husband a big house and a membership at the country club exactly surprised and amused she glanced at him have you met them i think i just did and in doing so caught a fresh new glimpse of her so darling why dont you have a rich husband a big house and a membership at the country club because i like independence my own space and my golf game is dreadful she shook back her hair actually my mother had high hopes for me when she met jared the bowl he was drying clattered when he set it down run through that again they came to visit right after settlement he took us out to dinner jared rafe said carefully took you out to dinner mmmhmm a couple of times my mother really liked the idea that i was seeing a lawyer nextbest thing to a doctor in her mind seeing as in dating you dated jared we went out a few times it was right after his divorce she held out another bowl lifting a brow when he made no move to take it is there a problem you dated my brother i believe we just established that she decided it was a better idea to bite the inside of her lip than to let it curve didnt he mention it no i think id like your definition of date you mean did i sleep with him struggling to keep her face composed she tilted her head are you going to go beat him up big guy can i come watch obviously she didnt know how close she was to having her pretty face dumped in dishwater its a simple question youve got a muscle twitching in your jaw rafe it looks good on you no she said and then she did laugh of course i didnt sleep with him enjoying herself she shoved the bowl into his hands i did kiss him goodnight a couple of times im now in the position to state unequivocally that at least fifty percent of the mackade brothers are champion kissers think twice before you try for a hundred percent or even seventyfive he set the bowl aside picked up his wine why didnt you sleep with him really rafe she rolled her eyes in the first place he didnt ask me and in the second i didnt ask him we were more comfortable being friends satisfied maybe ill beat him up anyway on principle after setting his wine aside he took her by the shoulders turned her to face him even as she grinned at him he pressed her back into the sink hard possessive his mouth covered hers the little purr that sounded in her throat enticed him to draw the kiss out soften it until all points of pleasure narrowed and centered just there when her head fell back in surrender her hands slid limply down his arms he eased back thats so you remember which mackade youre with now she had to remind herself to breathe what was your name again he grinned then closed his teeth over her sensitized bottom lip tell you what why dont we skip necking on the couch and go try out the back seat of my car thats quite an offer it was fascinating to feel her own head spin i think ill take you up on it rafe let himself into the barlow house at midnight hed recognized the car at the top of the lane and he wasnt surprised to find jared in the parlor brooding over a beer foreclosing already lawyer mackade instead of rising to the bait jared stared down at his beer i put my house on the market today didnt feel like staying there rafe grunted sat down on his sleeping bag to pull off his boots he knew the dark moods often had them himself either hed manage to shake jared out of it or theyd both ride through it never liked that house no personality just like your exwife it was so cold and so true jared had to laugh decent investment though ill make a profit rafe shook his head at the beer jared held out they dont taste the same without a smoke besides i gotta be up in six and a half hours i was going to come look for you he added oh why to beat the hell out of you with a yawn rafe lay back itll have to wait till tomorrow im too relaxed okay any particular reason you kissed my woman rafe figured he had just about enough energy to strip off his pants i did jaied tossed his legs up over the settee a slow smile curved his lips oh yeah oh yeah he said again with more feeling its all coming back to me whend she get to be your woman rafe heaved his jeans aside started on his shirt thats what comes from living in the city youre out of the loop bro shes mine now does she know that i know with his eyes dosed he dragged the sleeping bag over him im thinking about keeping her jared choked on his beer you mean like a wife i mean like keeping her rafe repeated no way was he going to try to get his tongue around a word like wife keeping things the way they are now this was interesting jared mused and even more fun than brooding and how are things now things are good rafe could smell her on the quilted material of the sleeping bag im still going to have to break your face its the principle understood jared stretched out settled back then again i never did pay you back for talking sharilyn bester now fenniman into riding out to the quarry with you to skinnydip i was just easing her broken heart after youd dumped her yeah but its the principle considering rafe scratched his face you got a point but sharilyn pretty as she is is no regan bishop i never got to see regan naked thats why youre still breathing rafe shifted folded his arms under his head maybe well call it even i can sleep easy now rafes lips twitched at the dry tone im sorry about your house jared if you are im not sorry about it really it just brought a lot of things back i screwed up as much as barbara did rafe it would have been easier if wed yelled at each other threw things he took a last swig and set the empty bottle on the floor theres nothing more demoralizing than a civilized divorce between two people who couldnt care less about each other its got to be better than getting your heart broken i dont know i kind of wish id had the chance they were both silent as the sound of weeping drifted down the stairs ask her rafe suggested id bet shed tell you youre better off maybe you should start thinking exorcism jake said smiling at the idea as his eyes drooped and he settled himself for sleep no i like having them around ive had plenty of time to be alone chapter it was rare for rafe to dream he preferred his fantasies during waking hours so that his consciousness could appreciate them but he dreamed that night as the fire burned low and the moon rose over drifts of snow if you could call it a dream he was running terror and smoke at his heels his eyes were burning from fatigue and from the horror hed already seen men blown apart before they could scream from the shock and agony the ground exploding hacked by mortar fire drenched with blood the smell of death was in his nostrils and he knew hed never be free of it oh and he longed for the scent of magnolias and roses for the lush green hills and rich brown fields of his home if he had had tears left he would have wept them for the quiet gurgling of the river that wound through his familys plantation the bright laughter of his sisters the crooning songs of the field hands he was afraid mortally afraid that everything hed known and treasured was already gone his most desperate wish was to get back to see it again he wanted to see his father again to tell him his son had tried to be a man the battle raged everywhere in the fields through the corn in his heart so many of his comrades lay dead on these godforsaken rocky hills of maryland hed lost his way he hadnt been able to see through the choking smoke or hear through the thunder of guns and the horrible shrieks of men suddenly he was running running as a coward runs for any hole to crawl in mixed with the horror now was a shame just as terrible hed forgotten his duty and lost his honor now somehow he must find them both again the woods were thick carpeted with the dying leaves that fell brilliant in golds and russets from the trees he had never been so far north seen such color or smelled the poignant decay of autumn he was only seventeen a movement ahead had him fumbling his rifle onto his shoulder the blue uniform was all he could see and he fired too quickly and poorly the answering shot had fire singeing his arm driven by pain and terror he gave a wild rebel yell and charged he wished he hadnt seen the eyes the eyes of the enemy as wide and terrorglazed and young as his own their bayonets crashed point to point he smelled the blood and the stinking scent of fear he felt the steel of his blade slice into flesh and his stomach roiled he felt the rip of his own and cried out in agony he fought blindly bitterly recklessly until there was nothing inside him but the battle and when they both lay in their own blood he wondered why he was crawling delirious with pain he needed to get home for supper he thought had to get home there was the house he could see it now he dragged himself over rocks and dying summer flowers leaving his blood staining the grass hands were lifting him soft voices he saw her standing over him an angel her hair like a halo her eyes warm her voice filled with the music of the south he yearned for her face was so beautiful so gentle so sad she stroked his head held his hand walking beside him as others carried him up curving steps im going home he told her i have to go home youll be all right she promised youll go home as soon as youre well again she looked away from him up and her lovely face went pale as a ghosts no hes hurt hes just a boy charles you cant he saw the man saw the gun heard the words ill have no confederate scum in my house no wife of mine will put her hands on a rebel rafe jolted awake with the sound of a gunshot ringing in his ears he sat where he was while it echoed away until all that was left was his brothers quiet breathing chilled he rose added logs to the fire then he sat watching the flames and waiting for dawn regan slept like a baby with the kids off to school and cassie taking the early shift at the diner she indulged herself with a second cup of coffee she still prized her privacy but shed discovered she liked having the company it was nice having the children pad around the house in the morning having emma offer one of her solemn kisses or connor one of his rare smiles she liked beating cassie to the kitchen so that she could fix breakfast and smooth down pale sleeptousled hair motherhood had never been one of her ambitions but she was beginning to wonder if she wouldnt be good at it she picked up a crayon emma had left on the table she smelled it and smiled it was funny she thought how quickly a house could smell like children crayons and white paste hot chocolate and soggy cereal and it was funny how quickly shed come to look forward to finding them there after work absently she tucked the crayon in her pocket work was exactly where she had to go out of habit she rinsed her coffee cup in the sink set it on the drain after a last glance around she opened the door in the kitchen and headed down the stairs to open the shop for the day shed barely turned the open sign around unlocked the door and moved behind the counter to unlock the till when joe dolin walked in the quick spurt of alarm came first then she soothed it by reminding herself that he was here and cassie wasnt hed put on weight even in the three years shed known him there was muscle there still but it was cushioned by too many sixpacks she imagined hed been an attractive man once before his square face had bloated and his moody brown eyes had sunken behind bags he had a chipped front tooth she didnt know was courtesy of a younger rafes fist and a nose that had been broken by rafe and several others with disgust she remembered that he had tried once or twice to touch her had watched her more than once or twice with greedy eyes and a knowing smile regan hadnt even told cassie that and never would she braced herself for the altercation but he shut the door quietly took off his billed cap and held it humbly in his hands like a peasant before the queen regan im sorry to bother you the penitent sound of his voice and bowed head almost softened her but she remembered the bruises on cassies neck what do you want joe i heard cassies staying with you just cassie she noted nothing about his children thats right i guess you know about the trouble yes i know you beat her and you were arrested i was awful drunk the court may find that an excuse i dont his eyes narrowed and flashed but he kept his head down i feel terrible about it done nothing but worry about her for days now theyve fixed it so i cant even go near her to tell her so i come to ask you a favor he lifted his head then and his eyes were moist cassie sets a lot of store by you i set a lot of store by her regan said evenly she would not let the sight of a mans tears blur her judgment yeah well i was hoping youd talk to her for me see that she gives me another chance i cant ask her myself long as theres that damn restraining order but shell listen to you youre giving me credit for influence over cassie i dont have joe no shell listen to you he insisted shes always running off at the mouth about how smart you are you tell her to come on home and shell do it very slowly regan placed her palms on the countertop if shed listened to me she would have left you years ago his unshaven jaw tightened now you look a mans got a right to beat his wife she snapped not in my book he doesnt and not in the laws no i wont tell her to come back to you joe and if thaf s all you came in for youll have to leave his lips peeled back showing clenched teeth his eyes hardened like marbles still all highandmighty you think youre better than me no i dont i know im better than you get out of my shop or ill have sheriff mackade throw you in jail for harassment a woman belongs to her husband he crashed his fist on the counter hard enough to have a crack splitting through the glass you tell her to get her skinny butt home if she knows whats good for her and whats good for you fear trembled in regans throat and was swallowed hard as if it were a talisman she closed a hand around the crayon in her pocket is that a threat she asked coolly i dont believe your parole officer would approve shall i call him and ask bitch youre nothing but a frigid driedup bitch who cant get herself a real man he wanted to hit her to feel his fist pound into that icequeen face you get between me and my wife and both of youll find out what its like when i finish with her ill come after you well see if youre so high and mighty when im finished he jammed his hat back on his head spun to the door you tell her what i said you tell her im waiting shed better have that bastard mackade tear up those papers and be home by suppertime the instant the door slammed behind him regan slumped against the counter her hands were shaking and she hated it hated being afraid hated being vulnerable she grabbed the phone had nearly followed through on her first instinct to call rafe when she stopped herself that was wrong she thought carefully replacing the receiver for so many reasons it was wrong wouldnt his first reaction be to hunt joe down to fight hed probably get hurt and certainly more fighting wasnt going to solve anything she straightened and drew a few calming breaths where was her pride her sense of control she had always handled herself and any situation that came her way her feelings for rafe shouldnt couldnt change that intrinsic part of her she wouldnt allow it so she would do what was right what was practical and what was necessary regan picked up the phone and dialed the sheriffs office he was almost pitiful at first the tea sloshed in her cup with a grimace regan set it down again i guess he spooked me more than id thought shake all you want devin told her and frowned at the crack in her counter it could have been worse he thought grimly a lot worse i have to say i didnt think he was fool enough to pull a stunt like this i dont think hed been drinking regan cleared her throat at least he wasnt drunk he got steadily more angry steadily more abusive she reached for her tea again i dont have any witnesses it was just him and me you file charges ill go after him her lips trembled upward it sounds like youre looking forward to it you dont know the half of it ill file charges cassie i had one of my deputies go to the diner as soon as you called hell hang out there and get paid for drinking coffee and flirting with ed ive got another one driving by the school the kids her blood ran cold you dont think hed go after the kids no i dont think he gives two damns about them youre right she tried to feel relieved he never said a word about them only cassie it was as if his children didnt exist well ill lock up and go with you now if thats all right the sooner the better odds are hes at home knocking back a bottle and waiting for her once the complaint was official began detoured to the market she had a feeling both she and cassie were going to need a lift that evening comfort food was in order spaghetti and meatballs she decided and doublefudge brownies while she waited for her purchases to be bagged she tried not to chuckle at the darting looks and whispers the gossip brigade she thought was in full march mrs metz all two hundred and twenty pounds of her waddled over why regan bishop i thought that was you hello mrs metz here regan thought was the brigades head scout do you think were going to get hit with snow again ice storm she said with a shake of her head heard on the radio into february now and dont look like this winters ever going to end surprised to see you in here this time of day business is slow regan counted out bills for the groceries everybodys hibernating know what you mean still you got yourself some business over to the old barlow place dont you yes indeed willing to play regan set the bag on her hip its really coming along too itll be a showplace when its finished never thought to see the day anybodyd bother fixing her up never thought to see rafe mackade come riding back into town neither her curious eyes brightened guess he did pretty well for himself down south apparently you cant tell about those mackade boys they fool you every time you know that rafe crashed his daddys ford pickup on marble quarry road before he so much as had a license that was right after buck died as i recall he was wild as wild can be that rafe chasing girls picking fights flying around on the back roads on that noisy motorcycle of his time was when you found trouble there was always a mackade boy in the middle of it times change i suppose not that much they dont her chins wagged as she chuckled i seen him around town hes still got that look in his eye little bird told me he had that eye on you well your little birds right and ive got mine right back on him mrs metz laughed so hard she had to put down her box of hohos to hold her belly with a boy like that youd better keep it there hed be harder to keep down than spit on a hot griddle he was a bad one regan bad boys turn into dangerous men i know regan winked thaf s why i like him you come in and browse real soon mrs metz ill do that chuckling to herself she emptied her cart stop gawking boy she snapped at the skinny clerk who was still watching regans retreat and ring me up here you aint never going to be dangerous enough to reel in that kind of woman amused by the encounter regan strolled down the sidewalk it was a good town she thought lifting a hand in response to a greeting from across the street the sidewalks were uneven heaved up by tree roots and frost the library was only open three days a week and the post office was closed for a full hour every afternoon but despite that or perhaps because of it it was a good town she didnt think rafe realized hed been welcomed home no fatted calf she mused crossing at the corner and turning down main that wasnt their style the prodigal son just slipped back into the towns rhythm with neither a hitch nor fanfare when he left again his departure would be just as unheralded a few comments over the counter at the post office some speculation at the diner then the town would move along as easy as ever she hoped she would shifting her bag she circled around the side of the shop enjoy the moment she reminded herself dont project into the future those were the rules shed stated them herself all she had to do was follow them and if she found an excuse to slip by his house later steal an hour with him so much the better bolstered by the idea she took her keys from her pocket she jingled them as she climbed the stairs with her groceries if shed been paying attention if she hadnt been thinking about rafe perhaps she would have noticed sooner but her hand was already reaching for the door when she saw that it wasnt on its hinges but was propped there her mind stayed blank for an instant too long even as she spun around to run joe hauled the door aside the crash dragged a shriek from her it was choked off to a gurgle when his arm jerked around her neck wondered which one of youd come first this is good his breath panted out sour with whiskey and excitement been wanting to get my hands on you for a long time he pressed his mouth to her ear excited by the way she tried to curl away from him im going to show you what a real mans all about going to get you out of those prim and proper clothes and show you real good he panted as his free hand came around to squeeze hard on her breast her skin crawled and for one hideous moment the fear was so bright it blinded her eyes and her reason im going to get me some of what i hear that bastard rafe mackades been getting then im going to fix your face so nobody thinks its so pretty anymore as he started to drag her over the broken door and inside the horror of what he would do flashed through her she swung back groceries flew smashing into the little alley below her heels skidded back over the door cassie gets here im going to give her the same but first im going to enjoy taking you down a few pegs with his free hand he yanked her hair darkly pleased when she whimpered then she remembered the keys that were still gripped in her frozen fist with prayers screaming in her head she flung her hand back hacking with the point shed pushed between her clenched fingers he howled like a wild dog and the vicious grip released dragging in air she flew down the steps certain he would be on her again in an instant at the bottom she stumbled went down hard on her hands and knees prepared to scream she looked back and saw him crumpled on the landing holding a hand to his face while blood dripped through his fingers like a woman in a trance she rose to her feet put one foot slowly in front of the other until she reached the diner the buzzing in her ears warned her to take deep careful breaths she stepped inside closed the door behind her unaware that her coat was hanging by one sleeve and the knees of her slacks were torn and bloody cassie dropped the tray she was holding shattering dishes regan my god i think you should call devin regan said testing each word as she spoke it joes on the landing of my apartment i think i hurt him when the room revolved she braced a hand on the back of a booth i have to sit down now go call devin ed snapped and rushed over to ease regan into a booth head down in a quick movement she had regans head between her knees long deep breaths thats a girl eyes sharp she scanned the room where a half a dozen customers sat staring well what are you waiting for one of you big strong men get on over there and hold that son of a bitch for the sheriff you horace get up off your lard butt and get this girl a glass of water eds rasped orders had everyone moving at once satisfied she eased regan up again got a little color back she declared and sat back on her haunches she took a cigarette from the pack in her apron pocket lit it with a wooden match after one long drag she smiled hope to hell you hurt him bad honey real bad sitting in devins office with the coffee shane had poured for her warming her hands regan was sure she was over the worst of it everything had happened too fast for anything but pure emotion but the rabbity fear had passed now and she could think beside her cassie sat saying nothing shane paced like a boxer revving up for a match at his desk devin coolly filled out a report im sorry to ask you to go through it again regan he began the clearer your statement the easier itll be to close it all up thats all right im fine now really absently she picked at her torn slacks the knees beneath still burned as much she thought from eds liberal application of antiseptic as from their abrupt meeting with asphalt id like to get it over with i can she broke off when the door burst open for an instant she saw nothing but rafes face pale hard as rock lit with eyes green enough sharp enough to murder in one vicious slice the rabbit pulse pounded it her throat before she could get to her feet he was on her dragging her up crushing her in an embrace that bruised ribs youre all right are you hurt his voice was raw brittle as broken glass he couldnt think thered been nothing inside him but bright terror from the moment he got word of the attack his body was ice enveloping hers as he buried his face in her hair perhaps that was why she began to tremble helplessly im okay really im but her voice shuddered off if she could have burrowed inside him she would have did he hurt you with a hand he was fighting to steady he stroked her hair eased her face back so that he could see for himself did he touch you she could only shake her head and press her face against his shoulder with his arms tight as possessive as they were protective he stared at devin over regans head his eyes fired like torches where is he hes in custody rafes gaze whipped toward the cells in the back hes not here rafe though his voice was calm devin was braced for the attack youre not going to be able to get to him you think you can stop me from behind where hed stood since hed followed rafe in jared laid a hand on his brothers shoulder why dont you sit down with a snarl humming in his throat rafe jerked the restraining hand aside back off this is the laws problem now devin told him rising slowly the hell with the law and you with it i want to know where he is you find him rafe ill hold your coat primed for action shane smiled thinly if you had a coat always hated the son of a bitch shut up jared muttered glancing down at the silent cassie you can stick your lawyer talk shane told him fists already bunched im with rafe on this i dont need you or anybody else with me dont get in my way devin im in your way now sit down or ill throw your ass in a cell he moved so fast regan had time only to squeak while rafe lunged over the desk and had devin by the shirtfront shed never considered herself sheltered but the things they shouted at each other the echo of the sentiments from the two mackades behind her had her already shocked system shuddering there was no doubt in her mind that blood would flow any moment stop it she said but the order was shaky and weak under the vicious words hurling through the room i said stop it she repeated hugging herself something crashed behind her and shot her pulse to critical stop it this minute she bellowed the surprising power in her voice halted rafes fist and put a stop to the shoving match behind her four hardeyed men stared at her like statues frozen in battle youre acting like children worse than children what good is it going to do anyone for the four of you to punch each other out its just typical she said more disgusted now than frightened just the sort of typical behavior id expect from a bunch of boneheaded baboons real heros with a sniff she grabbed her coat well im certainly not going to stand here and watch the four of you beat one another to a pulp sit down regan when she continued toward the door rafe swore and went after her sit down he repeated holding back his rage and turning her gently god look at your hands shaken all over again he gathered them carefully in his pressed his lips to the abraded palms it was a gesture that had the remaining mackades shifting in embarrassment what do you expect me to do the rest of the anger drained and left him helpless what do you expect me to feel i dont know she no longer knew exactly what she was feeling herself not with those eyes so concentrated on her face i just want to get this over with rafe please let me tell devin what he needs to know so i can get this over with fine he let her go stepped back do what you have to do she walked back to her chair accepted the fresh mug jared offered devin questioned she answered rafe listened then he left without a word she tried not to be hurt by it tried to understand it devin can you tell me what to expect now my deputy will call in once theyre finished with joe at the hospital hell be transferred he broke parole and the restraining order so hell serve his full time on the earlier charges it was a small satisfaction devin thought with a quick look at cassie she hadnt moved or spoken in thirty minutes now hell face additional charges devin went on breaking and entering assault attempted rape well toss in the property damage there may be a trial and youd have to testify im prepared for that under the circumstances his lawyer may advise him to deal and plead guilty at devins questioning glance jared nodded thats what id do yeah well it was hard not to hate the system devin mused when it got personal either way hes going away for a good while i figure three to five he wont be bothering you again either of you well then regan drew in a deep breath its done cassie and i can go home now sure ill be in touch i cant go home with you for the first time since shed come into the office cassie tried her voice it was small and rusty of course you can how can i she stated at the lovely smoke gray slacks regan wore at the nasty tears in the soft material how could you even want me after what hes done to you what hes done regan said quietly not you cassie youre not responsible of course i am it cost cassie to lift her head to look into regans eyes i know what he might have done to you if you hadnt been strong enough to stop him done to you to get to me regan youre the best friend ive ever had then let me keep being your friend i want that and i know youve already forgiven me cassie theres nothing to forgive dont take this on regan murmured covering cassies hands with hers i have to because i have to start figuring out how to forgive myself now im going to start by taking my kids home and finding a way to make the kind of me for them they deserve i need to start taking care of myself and them i need to do that in a few more days regan protested no now she closed her eyes steadied herself then opened them and looked at jared can you help me jared of course i can whatever you need honey there are plenty of programs no she pressed her lips together hard it was time she told herself long past time that she took a stand i want to file for divorce today i need you to tell me what to do all right he took her hand to help her up then slipped an arm gently around her shoulders why dont you come with me now well take care of everything bout time shane muttered the minute the door closed behind them he shrugged at the blazing look devin aimed at him hey we all know she should have ditched that bastard years ago you wont get any argument there regan rose surprised she wasnt as steady as shed believed but that was hard for her its going to be hard for her to follow through she wouldnt have done it if he hadnt hurt somebody else devin mumbled thats the kind of thing it would take for her then im glad he did and im glad i hurt him right back regan took a deep breath then asked the question that had been hovering in a corner of her mind his eye devin i can let you know when i find out if you want me to i think i have to know she held out a hand for his not to shake but to hold youve been wonderful i know rafe was upset but he was wrong in the things he said to you you did everything you could you did everything right if id done everything right it wouldnt have happened you know better than that she squeezed then winced as her hand throbbed im going home take a bottle of aspirin and crawl into bed for a few hours please call when you hear anything i will shane ahead of you like always he already had regans coat and he helped her into it ill drive you home and fix that door for you thanks with a smile she kissed his cheek baboons or not the mackade brothers arent halfbad baby he put an arm around her waist to lead her out were all bad later dev when hed helped her into his truck he paused rafell come around he just needs to go punch something thats the answer hey it works he slammed her door then circled the truck to climb behind the wheel youd have gone with him after joe wed have all gone with him shane glanced in the rearview then whipped the truck into a quick and illegal uturn dev and jared would have spouted off for a while about law and order wed have shoved each other around then wed have gone with him with some regret he shook his head it wouldve been fun fun she could almost laugh as she let her head sink back on the seat nobody messes with a mackade woman oh really and is that my status at this point he caught the tone and then with a wary glance the martial look in her eyes i just meant seeing as you and rafe that is the way hes even a mackade knew the value of retreat i aint touching this one he pulled up at the base of her stairs and looked up to study the door looks like somebody beat me to it what she was still simmering ill check it but it looks from here like its already been fixed he got out of the truck climbed the stairs yep few nicks and scratches but its back on its hinges as a precaution he tried the lock gave it a good shove solid rafe probably took care of it i see it did nothing to appease her ill have to be sure to thank him wont i yeah shane retreated again backing down the stairs are you going to be all right want me to get you anything or hang around no no im fine just fine it wasnt pleasant to take out her keys but she did it turned the lock i appreciate the ride no problem as he hurried back to his truck shane decided rafe had a problem a big one it gave him a reason to smile all the way through town chapter it felt good to beat on something even if it was only a nail to prevent himself beating on something or someone else rafe had closed himself in in the eastwing bedroom the look in his eye had warned any and all of his men to keep their distance if they wanted to keep their teeth the sounds of construction bumped against the walls a sound just violent enough to suit his black mood rafe ignored the nail gun at his disposal and beat in nails with hammer and muscle every new stud that he secured with nails and a swing of his arm was joe dolins face when the door opened behind him rafe bared his teeth without looking around get the hell out stay out or youre fired go ahead and fire me regan slammed the door at her back then i can say what i have to say to you without damaging our professional relationship he looked over his shoulder now briefly shed changed he noted not just the slacks but everything shirt blazer jewelry from her hair to her shoes she was neat as a pin but he remembered exactly how shed looked frazzled pale with blood on her clothes you dont want to be here right now he set another nail shot it home you couldnt be more accurate on that mackade but im here shed had to shower first had to scrub herself everywhere and throw out every stitch shed been wearing when joe touched her but she was steady again and ready to deal with rafe mackade i want to know what the hell is wrong with you if he told her she was liable to laugh in his face and that he was dead sure would push him over that final edge im busy regan weathers cost me a full day dont hand me that look at me when im talking to you damn it when he didnt just kept battering nails into wood she fisted her hands on her hips why did you leave devins office that way just leave i had things to do to illustrate her opinion of that she kicked at a toolbox i suppose im to thank you now for fixing my door ill bill you why are you mad at me she demanded i didnt do anything to her breath sucked in as the hammer sailed across the room and crashed into a newly framed wall no you didnt do a damn thing you just got yourself tossed around bruised bloodied up and damn near raped why the hell should that bother me someone had to be calm she told herself obviously the way his eyes were glowing it was going to have to be her i know youre upset about what happened yeah im upset he picked up the toolbox heaved it because it made more sense than throwing her around metal and steel crashed and scattered like small bombs im just a little upset now get out i wont instead she angled her chin go ahead big guy throw something else when youve got it out of your system well have a civilized conversation youd better get it through that thick head that theres nothing civilized about me oh thats coming through loud and clear she tossed back whats next you want to take a shot at me that should prove youre a bigger man than joedolin his eyes went black for an instant a heartbeat she thought she saw hurt mixed with the rage and it shamed her im sorry fumbling she lifted her hands you didnt deserve that i didnt mean that now there was only rage viciously controlled you usually say what you mean he held up a hand before she could speak again you want to have a conversation fine well have a damn conversation he strode to the door simmering when she flinched yanking it open he bellowed to every corner of the rambling house out everybody out now he slammed the door again satisfied by the scramble of feet and the clatter of tools theres no need for the work to stop she began im sure this will only take a few minutes sometimes it just cant be your way i dont know what you mean no i dont guess you do disgusted he hauled open the door again somebody give me a damn cigarette he shouted but as there was no one brave enough to approach he ended up slamming the door again regan watched quietly fascinated while he paced and swore his shirt was shoved up to the elbows a tool belt was slung at his hips like a holster hed wrapped a bandanna around his forehead to catch the sweat he looked she thought like a bandit who would just as soon kill as steal and it was certainly ridiculous to be aroused i could make coffee she began then let out a breath at the razoredged look he shot her maybe not rafe just shut up her back jammed straight as a poker i dont care to be spoken to that way get used to it ive held back long enough with you held back her eyes went wide if he hadnt looked like a maniac she might have laughed youve been holding back id like to see what you consider cutting loose youre about to he gnawed off the words like stringy meat from a bone youre ticked off that i left well now youre going to be treated to what would have happened if id stayed dont you touch me her arms shot up hands fisted like those of a boxer ready to spar dont you dare eyes simmering he closed a hand over her fist and used his leverage to push her back to the door same goes darling i gave you a chance to walk you didnt take it dont call me darling in that tone of voice the way his lips peeled back she wouldnt have been surprised to see fangs god youre a piece of work he tossed her hand down and walked away because it was safer for both of them you want to know why i left thats the big burning question isnt it thats what had you coming over here coming to me yes but you didnt come to me this morning when he threatened you you didnt come to me when he hurt you and that rafe thought however it devastated him was that i had to tell devin she began yeah you had to tell devin bitterly calm now he turned back you know what i heard in that nice and detailed statement you made regan dolin came into your place this morning just like i thought he would and i handled it she countered just like i told you i would sure youre great at handling things he threatened you he scared you yes all right he scared me and she was scared now too she realized of where this was leading thats why i called devin but not me you went down to devins office filed your charges yes of course i wanted joe arrested nice and tidy then you went grocery shopping i she linked her hands together pulled them apart i thought i knew cassie was going to be upset and i wanted i just thought if i fixed a meal it would make us both feel better and in all that time going to devins to the market walking there and back you never stopped to call me it never even occurred to you did it i was she opened her mouth closed it again all right yes it was my first reaction but i calmed down and decided against it you calmed down yes i realized it was my problem and my responsibility to handle it her simple honesty sliced through him like a blade he could almost see himself split in half one part rage one part misery and after he had you after he had his hands on you and hurt you tried to he couldnt say it if he did hed fall to pieces you didnt think to call me then either i only heard it from shane because he was in with devin when the call came through and he figured id be interested somehow she realized she had hurt him shed never meant to hadnt known he could be hurt rafe i wasnt thinking at all she started forward stopped knowing it would do no good to go farther i was numb by the time i could really think again i was in devins office it all happened so fast she said hurriedly desperate now to make him see to understand and part of the time it seemed as if i wasnt really there at all you were handling it i had to it wouldnt have done any good to fall apart youre real good at keeping yourself together he walked over picked up the hammer all by yourself i have to be i expect myself to be because you dont want to be like your mother he finished for her it sounded so callous and so foolish all right yes thats partially true its important for me to be a certain way but that really doesnt apply to this if i didnt call you it was only because you didnt need me his eyes were level and no longer hot he had very little heat left inside him you dont need me a new kind of panic was twisting through her thats not true oh the sex is great he smiled then coolly humorlessly thats a need we handle together real well its my problem that i let it get personal i wont make the mistake again its not about sex sure it is he plucked a nail out of his pouch set it in place its been about sex right from the getgo thats all weve got its plenty he rammed the nail home you know where to find me when youve got the itch the blood drained from her cheeks and froze around her heart thats a horrible thing to say your rules darling why complicate a good thing right i dont want things to be this way between us rafe well now i do take it or leave it he rammed another nail into wood she wasnt going to get the chance to hurt him again he told himself no woman hurt him like this she opened her mouth primed to tell him shed leave it leave him and couldnt tears burned in her eyes in her throat could there have been a worse possible time she wondered for her to realize she was in love with him is that the way you really feel i try to say what i mean too unwilling to humiliate herself she swallowed the tears and all this is because youre angry about what happened about how i dealt with it lets just say it made everything clear you dont want to clutter up your life right no i hell neither do i call it ego ive got one i didnt like you running to my brother instead of me like you said ive got it out of my system we can just go back to the way things were the way things are she hadnt realized how much she could prefer that lethal temper over this calculated disinterest im not sure thats possible i cant give you an answer right at the moment you mull it over regan you do that real well too would you rather she pressed a hand to her lips waited until she could steady her voice if youd rather suspend our business relationship i can give you the names of some other dealers in the area no reason for that im already behind when he turned to her all he saw was that her eyes were dry her face was composed i can take shipment on this room in about a week if youve got a problem with storage thatll be fine ill make the arrangements she turned and reached blindly for the doorknob terrified shed crumble she walked away quickly she didnt start to run until she was outside with the wind slapping her wet cheeks when he heard the door close below rafe sat down on the floor at the sound of weeping shimmering in the air he rubbed his hands hard over his face i know just how you feel he muttered it was the first time in his checkered career that anyone had managed to break his heart his only solace was that hed make damn sure it was the last the predicted ice storm raged through glazing the snow turning the streets to glass it was days before the temperature inched up enough to soften it each night the thermometer would plunge again hardening and slickening every coated surface it didnt mean a damn thing to rafe the lousy weather gave him an excuse to stay just where he was work twenty out of every twentyfour hours with every nail he hammered every wall he sanded the house became more his when he couldnt sleep even after exhausting himself he wandered the house with the other ghosts he was too busy to think about regan or so he tried to convince himself whenever he did whenever she snuck through his wellfortified defenses he just worked harder longer you look a little ragged pal devin lit a cigarette and watched rafe hammer freshly painted baseboard into place remember that book dorian gray the way its starting to look youre the picture in the closet and this house is old dorian pick up a hammer or beat it instead devin crouched ran a fingertip over the wide carved trim sure is pretty as a picture whatd you call this color rose dust he framed the words like a dare yep sure is pretty devin used an empty coffee can as an ashtray if youre into pink rafe spared him a look you trying to start something nope just making conversation they transferred joe from the hospital today rafes eyes iced over before he turned away none of my business he didnt lose his eye devin went on easily be wearing a patch for a while though they cant tell yet if therell be permanent damage she should have aimed between his legs yeah too bad about that well i thought youd want to know he pleaded guilty to the b and e the assault on advice of counsel they dumped the attempted rape charges to get the guilty plea and avoid trial but hes not going to pass go rafe didnt want to care how long my guess is three solid before you say its not enough im going to the sentencing tomorrow myself and adding weight when hes up for parole in a year or so ill go back and add more i said its none of my business rafe toed in the last piece of baseboard hows cassie holding up okay i guess jareds pushing through the divorce with the spousal abuse and adultery it wont take the usual year joes not in much of a position to contest it the quicker its done the quicker she and the kids can get on with things thoughtfully he tapped his cigarette out in the can arent you going to ask how regans holding up no well ill tell you ignoring rafes snarl devin folded his legs and sat she doesnt look like shes been getting a lot of sleep if you ask me i didnt ed says she hasnt been coming in for lunch so i guess her appetites off too i could figure that experience with joe shook her up enough to interfere with her sleeping and eating but i got a hunch its something else shell handle it shes good at taking care of herself good thing too odds are if joe had managed to drag her inside that day somebody wouldve seen the door quick enough heard the ruckus still he couldve done a lot of damage in a short time dont you think i know that rafe shot out do you think i dont know what he could have done to her yeah i think you know it i think its eating at you and im sorry are you ready to listen to me no but there wasnt any heat behind the denial so devin prepared to say his piece witnesses in the diner said they thought she was drunk at first when she came in the way she was walking shed have passed out if ed hadnt gotten her down first i dont need to hear this yeah devin murmured watching rafes knuckles whiten on the hilt of the hammer you do when i got to her rafe she was in shock are you getting this her pupils were as narrow as the point of one of those nails i was set to have her taken into emergency but she pulled herself together i watched her do it it was impressive so shes tough the image projecting into his mind scraped him raw tell me something i dont know okay i dont figure you were in any shape to see the way she looked at you when you walked into my office shed pulled herself together because she had to because thats the way shes made i guess then you walked in a man could go his whole life without having a woman look at him the way she looked at you she doesnt need me thats bull you may be stupid but you should know that i know i was stupid enough to let her matter to let what she thought of me what she wanted from me matter im not doing it again he rose hooked his hammer in his tool belt i dont need her either with a sigh devin unfolded himself and stood youre crosseyed in love with her no im not i got soft on her for a while then i got over it devin pursed his lips there was one quick potentially painful way to handle this youre sure i just said so didnt i good devin smiled that clears the way when i thought you had a thing for her i didnt want to muscle in since you dont ill go see if i can stimulate her appetite he was expecting the punch and took the fist on the jaw philosophically it was always satisfying to make a point he lifted a hand wiggled his jaw mildly relieved it wasnt broken yeah i can see how you got over it i ought to hit you again rafe said between his teeth it was infuriating humiliating to know how neatly hed been conned i wouldnt that one was free cautious devin moved his jaw again damn rafe youve still got a nice right jab almost amused rafe flexed his aching fingers youve still got a face like a rock you son of a bitch i love you too cheered devin draped an arm over his brothers shoulders feel better now no then he paused maybe you want to go find her and straighten this mess out im not crawling after some woman rafe mumbled you will devin thought sooner or later well then i got the night off want to get drunk and disorderly yeah they walked into the hall started down the steps why dont i meet you at the tavern ten oclock suits me ill see if i can round up shane and jared just like old times when duff sees us coming itll scare the rafe broke off felt his heart skip regan stood straightbacked and cooleyed at the base of the stairs ive got your delivery shed worked very hard on being able to speak without inflection your message said youd be ready for it by three just his stomach quivered infuriating him you can have it hauled up all right hello devin hello regan im just on my way out see you tonight rafe yeah rafe kept his eyes on regans as he came down the last few steps have any trouble on the roads no theyre mostly clear now she wondered that he couldnt see her heart bleeding i was able to get that feather mattress you wanted for the fourposter ill be happy to set it up so you can be sure you want to go with it appreciate it ill get out of your way ive got nothing he realized he had nothing work he said finally give a yell when youre ready ill have your check she wanted to say something anything but he was already walking away squaring her shoulders she went back to the door to instruct the movers it was nearly five when she finished arranging things exactly as she wanted them she hadnt noticed the quiet that drifted in to replace the steady bang and buzz of labor but as the light changed she switched on the rosepatterned globe lamp by the buttonbacked chair shed angled toward the fireplace there was no mantel there yet no flames crackling faintly the scent of paint stirred in the air but she thought the room was waiting to be lived in and the scent of roses hung like tears in the air a weddingring quilt she mused running her hand over one of the posts of the bed a few pillows edged with lace to match the canopy that would drape overhead a cedar chest a hope chest at the foot of the bed filled with sweetsmelling linens and net bags of lavender sachet yes she thought those would be just the right touches to finish it off perhaps some irish lace at the windows a silverbacked brush for the vanity it would be beautiful it would be perfect she wished to god shed never seen the room the house or rafe mackade he stood in the doorway saying nothing watching her move through the room as graceful as any ghost then her back stiffened she turned and faced him seconds passed though it could have been eons for both of them i was just finishing up she managed to say so i see he stayed where he was tore his gaze from hers and scanned the room it looks terrific i have some tintypes and antique silver frames i think theyd add a nice touch to the mantel when its in place great the strain of manners was tearing at her stomach i noticed youve made a lot of progress on the next bedroom its coming along ive got a couple more ready for drywall you work fast yeah thats what they always say he pulled a check out of his pocket stepped forward payment on delivery thank you very deliberately she opened the purse shed set on a table slipped the check inside and damned him to hell ill be going then she said briskly she turned back and bumped solidly into him excuse me she took a step around he shifted blocked her made her heart pound like a drum youre in my way thats right and since he was he took a good long look you look lousy thank you so much youve got shadows under your eyes so much for cosmetics she thought in disgust its been a long day im tired how come you havent been eating over at eds she wondered why shed ever thought she liked small towns despite what you and the antietam grapevine might think what i do on my lunch hour is my business dolins locked up hes not going to bother you again im not afraid of joe dolin she tossed back her hair proud of her own bravado im thinking about buying a gun think again she hadnt really thought of it the first time but it grated to have him dictate to her thats right youre the only one who can defend himself or anyone else back off mackade im finished here when he grabbed her arm she swung out without thinking her hand cracked against his cheek before she could stop it appalled she stumbled back now look what youve made me do enraged and close to tears she tossed down her purse i cant believe you goaded me into that ive never struck anyone in my life you did a pretty good job on your debut watching her he ran his tongue over the inside of his stinging cheek you want to put your shoulder into it next time not much of a crack if you swing from the wrist there wont be a next time unlike you i dont have to hit people to make a point she took a steadying breath i apologize if you head for the door again im going to get in your way again and were going to start this all over all right she left her purse where it lay obviously theres something you want to say if you keep aiming that chin at me youre going to make me mad im being civilized asking how you are civilized is how you like it isnt it im fine she bit the words off and how are you good enough you want some coffee a beer no thank you so much who the hell was this man she thought making uselessly polite conversation while her insides tangled into dozens of frayed knots i dont want coffee or beer what do you want regan now she recognized him it took only that sharp impatient tone to bring him back and to make her yearn i want you to leave me alone he said nothing at all just stepped out of her way once more she picked up her purse once more she set it down again thats not true the hell with her pride with sense even with her heart it couldnt be any more battered than it already was youd never have made it to the door he said quietly you probably knew that i dont know anything except im tired of fighting with you im not fighting im waiting she nodded sure she understood if it was all he was willing to give her now she would accept that and she would make it enough she stepped out of her shoes unbuttoned her blazer what are you doing answering your ultimatum of last week she tossed the blazer on the chair and unbuttoned her blouse you said take it or leave it im taking it chapter it was a curve he hadnt been expecting by the time he could speak she was wearing nothing but two scraps of black silk and all the blood had drained out of his head just like that it was always just like that wasnt it rafe chemistry pure and simple hed want her she promised herself by god when she was done with him hed never stop wanting her keeping her eyes locked on his she walked slowly toward him take it or leave it mackade she put her hands on his shirt and stunned them both by ripping it open and sending buttons flying because im about to take you her mouth was fire on his burning flashing shooting dozens of wild blazes into him rocked to the core he gripped her hips fingers digging through silk to flesh put your hands on me she sank her teeth into his shoulder i want your hands on me hers were dragging at his jeans closing around him wait but the bombs erupting inside him drowned out everything but pulsing grappling need with only his wounded heart as a pitiful weapon he was defenseless against the spear thrust of desire against her he kicked himself free of clothes lifted her off the floor he was deep inside her before they fell onto the bed it was all sweat and speed and blind sex the hard slap of flesh against flesh the raspy gasps of labored breathing teeth and nails and tangled tongues drove them both over the sumptuous mattress rolling and riding it was a battle both had already surrendered to hot and hard and hurried fast and frenzied and frantic they pounded together wanting more accepting less the scent of roses choked the air with strong sad perfume she straddled him bowed back as his hands streaked over her she wanted him to take her to that tenuous edge between pleasure and pain there she would be alive as she hadnt been since hed turned from her she had to know that here at least here he was as helpless as she as unable to resist as pathetically needy she could feel that need riot through him taste it each time he dragged her mouth back to his with a ravenous hunger while her heart screamed at him to love her just a little her quivering body greedily devoured fueling itself with whatever scraps he would give no room for pride no time for tenderness when she sank toward him limp as water he rolled her ruthlessly onto her back and drove her on he couldnt breathe didnt think just battered himself into her he had to fill her to empty her to claim her in the only way he knew she would accept with a jerk of his head he tossed the hair out of his eyes it was vital that he see her every flicker of shock and pleasure on her face every tremble of her lips love for her swamped him all but destroyed him look at me he grated the words out you look at me her eyes opened but remained blind with passion he felt her body quake under ms saw those eyes glaze as her head fell back he was powerless to stop himself from following her recklessly over the edge but he cursed her then himself as he fell it didnt seem possible to have been so completely aroused and to feel so utterly empty hed never understood how vitally entwined the heart and the body were until now and now staring at the ceiling with regan silent beside him he understood it would never be possible to separate his again not with her and he wanted only her shed taken something from him that hed struggled for years to build his selfrespect how odd that he hadnt realized that either until this moment he wasnt sure he could forgive either of them for it she desperately wanted him to reach out to her to fold her to him as he had in the past it was miserable to be left like this so cold so alone even as she was still quivering from him yet how could she reach out for him when she was the one who had taken the step made the stand and agreed to take him on his own terms his own terms she thought closing her eyes against the lovely rosy glow of the lamp bad rafe mackade had returned she thought bitterly and taken it all well we managed to have sex in a bed for a change she sat up kept her back to him she could control her voice but was certain her face would show him that she was shattered its always firsts with us isnt it mackade yeah he wanted to stroke that back but it was so stiff and straight well have to try it with sheets sometime why not her hands trembled as she slid off the bed reached down for her underwear we could even throw in a couple of pillows and a pretense of affection just for a change of pace his eyes sharpened narrowed as she snapped her bra into place hurt and fury bubbled together in a messy stew rising he snatched his jeans jammed his legs in them i dont like pretenses much oh thats right she grabbed her shirt silk whipped through the air and onto her back everythings upfront with you no frills no spills what the hells wrong with you you got what you wanted you dont know diddly about what i want terrified she might weep she jerked on her slacks apparently neither do i youre the one who took off your clothes darling his voice was entirely too smooth youre the one putting them right back on so you can move right along and youre the one who rolled off me the minute you were done as if your twenty bucks was up rushing now she jammed her feet into her shoes she might have had a chance if shed been looking at him a slim one but he moved fast and she was six inches off the ground his hands like a vise on her his eyes drilling holes in hers before she drew a second breath dont say that ive never treated you that way ive never thought that way youre right oddly enough it was the lash of his temper that calmed her stopped her she hoped from being a perfect fool im sorry rafe that was unfair and untrue very slowly he set her back on her feet he realized his fingers were digging hard enough into her flesh to meet bone and dropped his hands maybe i moved too fast but you caught me off guard no yes she felt very calm she thought as she turned to pick up her blazer very calm and very very fragile if he touched her again she would crack like flawed glass i initiated things and i agreed to your terms my terms are clear she said finishing for him and acceptable i suppose the problem is that were both volatile personalities under the right circumstances any circumstances as far as youre concerned and as for me the past few days have been difficult that doesnt mean i should take it out on you do you have to be reasonable regan no but im going to be though her lips curved brightly she couldnt move the smile into her eyes i dont know what were fighting about when weve found the perfect solution a simple physical relationship its perfect because the rest of our common ground is narrow to nonexistent so ill apologize again for picking a fight im just a little tired and out of sorts she made herself rise on her toes and kiss him lightly if youd like to come by tomorrow after work ill make it up to you yeah maybe why the hell couldnt he read her eyes he could always read her eyes if he looked hard enough ill take you home no really she had to will herself not to run to the door and escape instead she picked up her purse ive got my car she added and i really am tired i could use an early night he just wanted to hold her to fold her into his arms and keep her there whatever you say im supposed to meet my brothers at the tavern in a few hours anyway good then well try for tomorrow she made it to the door without stumbling he didnt offer a goodbye and neither did she her coat was a bright red slash over the newel post or she might have walked outside without it she put in on buttoned it carefully outside she got into her car turned the key in the ignition she concentrated on backing down the lane as if her life depended on it she took the turn toward town drove a half mile then she pulled over to the side of the road carefully put the car in gear turned the engine off and cried like a baby twenty minutes later exhausted she let her head fall back against the seat it was freezing but she didnt have the energy to turn the car on again and pump up the heater she was a competent woman regan thought everyone said so she was bright wellorganized moderately successful and levelheaded so why if she was indeed all of those fine admirable things had she managed to mess up her life so miserably rafe mackade was responsible of course she hadnt had a full days easy running since hed swaggered back into town he was messy arrogant angry oh so angry and charming she thought with a sigh with all those unexpected sweet spots mixed with the rough she should never have fallen for him she certainly shouldnt have deluded herself that she could have an affair with him and stay objective he hadnt been completely objective either she remembered hed had feelings tangling him up too before shed ruined it if she had been just a little more of what he needed if she hadnt been so dead set on doing it all her way he might have stayed tangled until hed fallen in love oh that was wrong she thought and banged her fist against the steering wheel that was her mothers kind of thinking make everything pretty everything perfect for the man stroke his ego cater to his whims play the game and win the prize well she wouldnt she was appalled shed even considered it she would not squash her own needs her own personality her own ego to lure a man into love but hadnt she just done that she shuddered but not from the cold hadnt she just done that up in that bedroom at a loss she braced her elbows on the wheel her head in her hands she wasnt sure of anything any longer except that she loved him she loved him and in her stubborn stance against luring him into love with her she had blocked perhaps even rejected his feelings and humiliated herself in the bargain that regan concluded made her an idiot so what if she had to make some changes in herself hadnt he in his way done the same hed been hurt she remembered she had hurt him infuriated him yet he had gone off to pound nails instead of picking a fight it was she who was the coward who had been unwilling to trust refusing to bend hed never tried to run her life or her thoughts or tried to change her no hed given her room hed given her affection and hed given her the kind of passion a woman dreamed of but shed held back anyway foolishly in a kneejerk response rooted in her upbringing why hadnt she thought of his needs his pride wasnt it time she did so she could be flexible couldnt she compromise wasnt capitulation it couldnt be too late to show him she was willing she wouldnt let it be too late to the thought that came into her mind was so simple and so ridiculous she knew it had to be right without giving herself a moment to think it through she revved up the car and hit the gas in minutes she was on cassies doorstep banging regan with emma on her hip cassie dragged a hand through her tousled hair i was just youve been crying alarm sprinted through her joe no no im sorry i didnt mean to scare you i need help what is it in a flash cassie had closed the door and locked it whats wrong whats nineball what baffled cassie set emma down gave her a little pat on the bottom to send her along whats nineball yes and where am i going to find a red leather miniskirt at this hour cassie thought for a moment brushing a hand over the wet spot on her sweater that was courtesy of emmas bath if thats what you want well have to call ed suck it in sweetie i am valiantly regan gritted her teeth and held her breath as ed tugged at the zipper of a skirt the size of a place mat trouble is youve got a figure ive got bones mouth clamped tight in determination ed hauled and tugged then with a wheeze of triumph sat back on cassies bed shes on but i wouldnt make any sudden moves i dont think i can make any moves testing regan took a step the skirt already dangerously high snuck up another fraction you got a little height on me too ed announced and pulled out a cigarette her eyes sparkled with amusement as she let her rhinestone glasses fall to her chest if it was much shorter on you devin would have to arrest you i cant see though she rose on her toes and turned carefully cassies mirror offered nothing but a view from the waist up you dont have to honey take my word he will i got the kids settled cassie said as she walked in she stopped short her mouth forming a shocked circle oh my its a hot little number ed agreed when shed worn it last time at the legion dance eyes had popped loose the way regan was filling it out ed imagined theyd not only pop but go flying across the room try those shoes with it now she ordered i stuffed some tissue in the toes to bring em down to size regan braced a hand on cassies dresser stepped gingerly into the fourinch spikes ill get a nosebleed in these honey youll cause nosebleeds ed gave a raspy laugh now lets try some war paint happily she upended her enormous purse onto the bed im not sure i can go through with this its a crazy idea dont go chicken on me now ed riffled her hand through a departmentstore array of cosmetics you want that man dont you yes but then sit down here on the bed and let me buff you up this here reds a killer she murmured fondly as she unscrewed a lipstick i cant sit regan stated after a single attempt id damage an internal organ then stand after making her choices ed rose and went to work now you said nineball right yeah in her fortytwo years fortyfive if god was listening shed never seen a woman less likely to chalk a stick than regan bishop ever play pool honey billiards regan uttered a silent prayer as ed advanced with eyeliner with my father several times hell honey billiards aint nothing why nineballs the secondbest thing you can do on a pool table she cackled when cassie flushed scarlet now listen up while i explain how it works balls smacked and clattered when rafe shot his cue the five ball thumped satisfactorily into the corner pocket luck jared said and lazily chalked his cue rafe only snorted six off the nine and in the side he made his shot lined up the next never could beat rafe at nineball more interested in the little redhead at the bar than the game shane leaned on the juke she was all alone and looked as cuddly as a new down pillow seen her around before dev devin glanced up over holloways niece from up on mountain view shes got a boyfriend the size of a semi wholl break you in half if you breathe on her it was all the challenge shane needed he sauntered over leaned on the bar and turned on the charm devin gave a resigned smile if the boyfriend came in devin would have to use his badge and that would blow bis night my game rafe held out his hand for the ten dollars jared owed him youre up dev i need a beer jareds buying rafe grinned at his older brother right bro i bought last round you lost the last game so be a gracious winner his tab jared told the bartender and held up three fingers hey what about me jared flicked a glance at shane the redhead was clutching his arm like a fastgrowing vine youre driving kid flip for it obligingly jared took a coin from bis pocket call it heads he flipped the coin caught it neatly tails youre driving with a philosophical shrug shane turned back to the redhead does he have to bit on everything in a skirt rafe muttered while devin racked the balls yep somebody had to take up where you left off devin stepped back chose his cue and since youre spoken for nobody said i was spoken for rafe gave the curvy redhead a long look felt nothing more than a lowlevel tug of basic appreciation and thought of regan just thought of her and his heart shattered weve got an understanding he bit the words off but still tasted bitterness nothing serious hes hooked jared grinned and lifted his beer and his heart looks so pretty right there on his sleeve no way he was going to take the bait rafe thought it was bad enough having your heart broken without having your family watch you fumble with the pieces you want to eat this cue rafe executed his break smugly pleased when two balls rolled into pockets she came into the house today devin said conversationally and that hook in his mouth dragged him right down the stairs like a trout on a fly i think there were stars in his eyes too devin met rafes steely look equably yep im sure of it pretty soon hes going to start shaving regular and wearing clean shirts jared shook his head as if in mourning then well know weve lost him then itll be antique shows and ballets devin heaved a heavy sigh poetry readings because that hit entirely too close to home rafe jerked the cue and missed his shot he wasnt going to think of her damn it he wasnt going to give regan or the hole in his gut a single thought keep it up and ill take both of you on well im shaking after lining up his shot devin leaned over the table he made his ball cleanly as he circled the table he sniffed at rafe that cologne loverboy im not wearing any damn rafe hissed out a breath youre just jealous cause youre sleeping alone on some cot outside a cell every night you got me there enjoying himself jared plugged coins into the jukebox what time do you have to be home rafe we wouldnt want you getting conked with a rolling pin for missing curfew how long have you been a practicing ass it was some small satisfaction to note that duff was shooting them uneasy glances a man didnt like to lose his touch whats the fine for breaking up a couple of chairs nostalgia swam sweetly along with the beer in devins bloodstream unless he counted breaking his brothers up and you could hardly count that he hadnt been in a decent fight in years cant let you do it he said with mildly drunk regret i carry a badge take it off rafe grinned and lets beat hell out of shane for old times sake jared tapped his fingers on the juke in time to the music he eyed their youngest brother who was definitely making progress with the redhead that alone was reason enough to punch him a few times ive got enough on me to post bond jared told them and a little extra to bribe the sheriff if we have to devin sighed straightened from the table with brotherly affection he studied the unsuspecting shane hell hes going to get his butt whipped before the nights over anyway if he keeps playing with that girl we might as well do it first well be more humane jared agreed the bartender watched them move together recognized with despair the look in each eye not in here come on now devin youre the law just doing my brotherly duty whats the idea scenting trouble shane danced back from the bar he scanned his brothers shifted as they moved to flank him three against one his mouth curved in a wide reckless grin as other customers moved to safety come on then he crouched braced then made the mistake of glancing over as the door opened his mouth had already fallen open in surprise when rafe caught him low and sent them both crashing into a table you make it too easy laughing rafe turned and caught him in a cheerful headlock then he went numb right down to his toes the skirt barely made it past the legal limit it wasnt tight it went beyond tight as it squeezed possessively over curvy hips in an eyepopping fireengine red the legs went on and on rafes dazzled gape followed them down to the razorsharp skyscraper heels in that same bold color when he managed to lift his gaze he saw that the skinny black top was as snug as the skirt and dipped down low over firm unfettered breasts it took him a full ten seconds to get to her face her mouth was red and wet and curved beside it the little mole was a bold exclamation of sex her hair was tousled and her eyes were shadowed and heavy she looked like a woman whod just climbed out of bed and was willing to climb right back in holy hell it was shanes strained muttering that jolted him out of shock is that regan in there she is hot rafe didnt have the strength to put much behind the punch when he gained his feet and moved to the door his head was still buzzing as if hed been the one to take the blow what are you doing she moved a shoulder causing the excuse for a blouse to follow her stretch i thought id play a little nineball there was something stuck in his throat nineball yeah she sauntered over to the bar leaned an elbow on it going to buy me a beer mackade chapter if he kept staring at her she was going to lose it regan thought she was already so nervous that if her clothes hadnt been girdled on shed have jumped out of them because shed wanted to make an entrance shed left her coat in the car only the heat of possible humiliation kept her teeth from chattering her feet were killing her when rafe didnt answer she scanned the room and tried not to swallow audibly at the stares gathering courage she flashed a smile at the bartender even the wearyeyed duff was goggling at her ill have what hes having when she had the beer in her hand she turned back no one had moved a muscle it was either run or play it out regan told herself taking a quick swallow of beer she hated beer are you going to rack them mackade or am i ill rack them jared interjected helpfully his hands were still a little sweaty but hed gotten over the worst of the shock rafes face was almost as much of a pleasure to watch as the sway of regans hips as she sauntered over to study the arsenal of cues rafe heard the clatter of balls and blinked you said you wanted an early night changed my mind her voice was breathy from necessity rather than design the leather and spandex were cutting off her air supply i had all this energy all of a sudden she walked slowly to the table resisting the urge to tug at the hem of the skirt who wants to play half a dozen men moved with scraping chairs and clattering boots rafes snarl was the low vicious sound of a wild dog guarding his bone half a dozen men decided they werent in the mood for pool after all this is a joke right regan took the cue devin offered smiled and stroked her fingertips from the tip down the shaft someone moaned i felt like some action thats all with her confidence building she passed the bottle of beer to jared this at least she thought she knew how to do planting her feet bending one knee for balance she leaned over the table leather strained rafes elbow plowed into shanes gut keep looking where youre looking and youll be blind for a week jeez rafe shane tucked his hands in his pockets and prepared to watch the show wheres a guy supposed to look she broke cleanly even managed to sink a ball with the rules of the game ed had drilled into her flipping through her head she circled the table she had to stop smile as devin was still rooted in her path youre blocking the table sheriff oh yeah right sorry when she draped herself over the felt this time bis eyes met jareds they grinned at each other like two kids over a shiny new bike she managed to sink one more that made her cocky enough to try a complicated shot that required a little english her hips wiggled as she set her position from behind her jared stuck a hand under his shirt and mimed a thumping heart you think what youre thinking again and ill rip your lungs out rafe muttered as the ball missed the pocket by a good six inches regan pouted with that redslicked mouth oops she straightened batted thickly mascaraed eyes at rafe your turn she put her weight on one foot and ran a hand down his shirtfront want me to chalk your cue the room exploded with whoops and whistles some brave soul made a suggestion that had rafes lips peeling back in a growl that does it he grabbed her cue tossed it at devin then clamped a hand over hers to drag her toward the door but we havent finished the game she protested forced to scramble on the skinny heels to keep up with him he yanked his jacket from the hook by the door and bundled it around her put this on before i have to kill somebody she was still struggling with it when he shoved her through the door devin let out a long appreciative sigh hes a dead man yeah shane rubbed a hand over his stomach did you ever notice her in rafes stead jared rapped him with a cue i have my car regan began while rafe towed her along he dragged open the door of his own get in now i could follow you now all right it wasnt a simple operation to get into his car snug red leather rode higher as she tried for graceful and dignified as she lowered herself into the seat rafe ground his teeth audibly where are we going im taking you home he slammed her door stormed around the hood then slammed his own hard enough to rock the car and if youre smart you wont talk to me she was smart when his brakes squealed at the base of her steps she stayed where she was there was no possible way she could maneuver herself out of the tiny sports car without help he gave it to her though no one would have called the hard yank a gentlemanly gesture keys he snapped then snatched them out of her hand and unlocked the door himself miffed she strode in ahead of him i assume youre coming in so she was rapped back against the door his mouth hotly devouring hers the heels put them headtohead heat to heat with a pressure that fried his already overheated brain both his mouth and his hands were hard possessive he could only think of branding her his his breath was ragged when he jerked back hed be damned if shed work him this way again make him a victim of his own needs he tugged his jacket off her shoulders tossed it aside get out of those clothes something in her sank with her lashes lowered she reached around for the zipper of the skirt no i didnt mean god if she peeled herself out of that leather in front of him he was lost it was the confusion in her eyes that had him leveling his voice i meant id appreciate it if you changed into something else please i thought you i know what you thought he was dying here just change so i can talk to you all right he knew it was a mistake to watch her walk toward the bedroom but he was only human inside regan stepped out of the anklebreaking shoes stripped off the red leather it was good to breathe again she wanted to be amused at both of them but she felt so incredibly stupid shed made a spectacle of herself thrown aside every scrap of dignity for nothing no she thought as she fastened on pleated trousers for him shed done it for him and he didnt even have the sense to appreciate it when she came back in face washed her hair brushed back into place an ivory sweater tucked neatly into the waistband of black slacks he was pacing i want to know what you were thinking of he said without preamble just what you were thinking of walking into a bar dressed like that it was your idea she tossed back but he was too busy clenching his jaw and muttering to himself to listen five more minutes in there and wed have had a riot id have started it myself ive seen you naked and im not sure i knew you were built like that now everybody in towns going to know you said you wanted i dont give a damn what they say about me but nobodys going to talk behind their hands about you where the hell did you get that skirt he exploded tarts r us well really yeah really and leaning over the pool table that way so everyone was looking at your her eyes narrowed to slits watch it mackade now im going to have to go bash all of my brothers brains in for what they were thinking you like bashing their brains in she retorted thats beside the point ill give you a point she picked up her favorite milton vase and tossed it to the floor rather than smashing satisfactorily it bounced and rolled on the dainty floral rug but the gesture shut him up i humiliated myself for you it nearly took a crowbar to get me into that ridiculous skirt and i think i bruised my intestines ill probably never get all this makeup out of my pores my arches are screaming and i have not an ounce of dignity left i hope youre satisfied shut up this time you just shut up you wanted me to be that way so i tried i was willing to be what you wanted and now all you can do is stand there and criticize and worry about gossip well go to hell she plopped down in a chair because her feet were cramping painfully he waited until he was sure shed run down watched her sniffle and rub her bare feet you did that for me no i did it because i like teetering on fourinch heels and going around halfnaked in the middle of winter i live for it she said nastily you did it to get to me the bout of temper had drained her she sat back closed her eyes i did it because im crazy about you just like you said id be now go away and leave me alone youll have to wait till tomorrow to beat your chest and drag me off by the hair im too tired he studied her a moment then walked to the door and shut it quietly behind him she didnt bother to get up or even to move she didnt feel like crying if shed been ridiculous she would weather it shed given him everything now and there was no taking it back why should she bother shed never stop loving him she heard the door open again and kept her eyes closed i really am tired rafe cant you gloat tomorrow something fell into her lap regan blinked her eyes open and stared at the bouquet of lilacs theyre not real he told her you cant get them in february ive had them in the trunk of my car for a few days so theyre cold theyre lovely slowly she ran her fingers over the chilly silk blooms a few days she murmured and looked up again yeah so he scowled jammed his hands in his pockets shifted man he thought facing a noose would be easier than what he was about to do it certainly couldnt burn his throat any less he got down on his knees what are you doing just keep quiet he warned her and if you laugh you pay mortified he swore under his breath dragged a hand through his hair and bit the bullet when i arose and saw the dawn i sighed for thee rafe dont interrupt me miserably embarrassed he glared at her now i have to start over but you dont have to regan she drew in a breath wondered if there was another woman in the world who had ever had shelley quoted to her with eyes that threatened murder sorry you were saying he shifted his weight okay when i arose and saw the dawn i sighed for thee when the light rode high and the dew was gone and oh hell he raked his fingers through his hair and tried to concentrate i got it and noon lay heavy on flower and tree and the weary day turned to her rest lingering like an unloved guest i sighed for thee his breath came out on a huff of tremendous relief thats all ive got it took me more than a week to memorize it if you mention this to anyone i wouldnt dream of it incredibly moved she laid a hand on his cheek that was very sweet of you it kind of fits the way i feel about you and now that it was over thank god it hadnt been as bad as hed feared i think about you regan all day every day so if you want poetry no with a quick shake of her head she reached out and laid her cheek on his shoulder no i dont need poetry rafe i havent bothered to give you much romance and he knew now by the way her eyes had gone soft and dreamy that he should have now its fake flowers and somebody elses words she had to cry now but they were lovely tears soothing ones i love the flowers and i loved the words but i dont need them i dont want you to change for me rafe theres nothing about you id want to change i said id take you as you are and i mean it i like you the way you are regan all neat and tidy not that i didnt appreciate the way you filled out that leather im sure i could borrow it from ed again ed he rolled his eyes and chuckled weakly no wonder it fit you like skin then he felt the warm drops on his neck oh dont do that baby please dont im not really crying im just touched that youd memorize shelley for me that youd care enough she gave him a hard squeeze before leaning back i guess we both won the bet or lost it depending on your viewpoint she dried off her cheeks with the back of her hand of course you didnt lose yours in public if you think you can talk me into giving that little recital down at the tavern you really are crazy id never get out alive she drew in a deep breath i think we should both stick with who and what we are i do like who and what you are rafe and i need you more than you think i needed you when joe came into the shop and frightened me i just didnt want you to know it i was afraid to let you know how much i count on you he picked up her hand kissed it and felt dozens of wounds heal you didnt have to be i figured that out for myself i like figuring things out for myself tell me about it he smiled and no longer felt foolish being on his knees i like the way you figure things out for yourself the way you handle yourself regan even when it ticks me off i like your style i like yours too she leaned forward and kissed him lightly im going to get something to put these in he reached behind him and picked up the vase shed thrown how about this thatll be fine she took it from him and rose to arrange the silk bouquet on the table i cant believe i actually threw it its been an eventful evening so far she glanced back smiled it certainly has would you like to stay and see what happens next there we are on the same wavelength again you know regan i think weve got more common ground than either one of us realized you shoot decent pool i like antiques he stood moving restlessly picked up a china cat in suddenly nerveless fingers then set it down again so you want to get married she tucked a sprig of lilacs into place hmm you asked me that before as i remember and never took me up on it because i wont watch baseball i mean it she twirled to face him and her limp hand knocked against the table excuse me look we havent known each other very long he stepped toward her stopped cold she was staring at him as though hed lost his mind he was certain he had but weve got something going here i know we said it was just going to be sex and weve just finished deciding we really like each other rafei cant if youd just let me fumble through this his tone went from quiet to testy in an instant i know how you are with having to weigh your options and think things through but the least you can do is look at this from my perspective for one damn minute its not just sex for me and it never was im in love with you she stared into those sharp angry eyes heard the treasured phrase delivered in a furious snarl and felt her heart swell like a rose blooming in her chest youre in love with me she repeated it had always been easy to say the words when it didnt count when they were just words and not these tiny razoredged little pellets in his throat im in love with you he said again it probably happened five minutes after i met you maybe five minutes before i dont know its never happened to me before me either she murmured he didnt hear her didnt hear anything but the roaring in his head no ones ever needed me ive never wanted anyone to need me it gets in the way but i want that from you i have to ask that from you he paused fought to steady himself i dont like asking i know you dont have to she walked to him framed his face in her hands rafe you dont have to ask if youd give me a chance he gripped her wrists i could make it work we could make it work come on regan take a risk live dangerously yes his grip on her wrists went lax yes what why do we have such a hard time hearing each other she asked listen up she ordered and kissed him firmly yes ill marry you just like that youre not going to think about it nope good great a little dazed he stepped back we could ah ttake care of it take care of it tomorrow the license whatever you want a ring or something yes i do rafe youre stuttering no im not he stepped back when she stepped forward i just didnt expect you to take the jump so quick if youre trying to change your mind forget it was it the skirt his eyes went blank and baffled what skirt no answer could have pleased her more i think you should tell me you love me again before he could evade her she wrapped her arms around his neck linked her fingers i think you should get used to saying it i do love you and you were in love with me that first night when we were alone in the house on the hill i guess i was i didnt know didnt have a clue i wonder if the house did i remember how quiet it got that nighthow settled it all seemed would you like to go back there tonight yes he rested his brow on hers i would theres something i should tell you first rafe something i think we should clear up between us regan if youre going to slap down more rules and parameters i think i should tell you she said interrupting him that as attracted as i was to you as aroused as i was by you i could have slept with you without loving you i know he refused to be hurt by it its okay i could have done that because youre the most incredibly attractive man ive ever met all the way through but theres no way i would have squeezed myself into that ridiculous outfit tonight unless id been wildly stupidly and completely in love with you her eyes shimmered and smiled is that okay say it again he took her face in his hands look at me straighton and say it again i love you im so very much in love with you rafe theres nothing i want more than to go on loving you and needing you for the rest of my life the thrill of it sprinted through him then settled warm and easy you could get used to saying it too im a very quick study i love you she murmured against his mouth then poured the words into the kiss its going to get complicated he gathered her close and held her just held her lifes going to be messy i hope so eyes closed she pressed her cheek against his oh i hope so why was i so scared she whispered why was i so afraid to let you know probably for the same reason i was he tilted her head back it happened so fast and it matters so much and it always will it always will she agreed later when they were curled together in the deep feather bed she laid her hand on his heart and smiled im awfully glad you came back to town mackade welcome home the house was quiet around them and slept as they slept
