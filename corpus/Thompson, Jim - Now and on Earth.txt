now and on earth by jim thompson copyright big jim thompson an appreciation if you put me under the gun i could probably name twenty great novelists of the hardboiled detective school within half an hour it would be my list granted purists might not like the inclusion of such writers as ed mcbain and john d macdonald but it would also include those of whom even the purists would approve dashiell hammett raymond chandler ross macdonald robert parker and so on if you put me under the gun and asked me to name those american novelists who i believe have written great novels of the criminal mind my list would be much shorter and half the people on it only wrote one theodore dreiser frank norris elliot chaze the three who wrote more than one are shane stevens james m cain and big jim thompson was thompson physically big you got me he was from texas or oklahoma or somewhere like that so i imagine him as big but authors are a lot of times like the fat disc jockey with the thin voice the ones who write the most virile prose are the ones who when you finally see their photos turn out to be pasty pudgy types who look like insurance adjustors never mind hell always be big jim to me because he wrote big although that needs a bit of explanation the settings of his novels were never big the characters were rarely big the crimes themselves were never the grandscale jobs readers have some to expect from fellows like frederick forsythe with his jackal or jack higgins with his nazis out to get winston churchill big jims criminals like james cains or shane stevenss were usually caught in a web of cheap bucks and cheap fucks but thompsons books were daringly breathtakingly big in scope and risk and point of attack edmund wilson once condemned james cains the postman always rings twice as nothing more important than a junglebeat in a lunchroom it wasnt that he was wrong it was just that it was a comment from a guy who had never spent much time in the lunchrooms of america nevertheless lunchrooms did and do exist small towns such as the one so devastatingly depicted in thompsons pop did and do exist smalltime hoods and desperate people on the run did and do exist they may not dine at the waldorf but the intellectual businessmen and menopausal women who do are not all of the world wilson once took nelson algren to task for his cloacal approach to literature as though shit did not exist but as those of us who are regular would willingly attest it does and not all of it is in the toilets and sewers sometimes it overflows into the streets the lunchrooms and the human mind big jim thompson was and is big in my own mind because he wasnt afraid of the jungle in the lunchroom wasnt afraid of the shit that sometimes backs up in the sewers underlying more ordinary social consciousness and interaction no one likes it when the doctor puts on his rubber glove asks him to bend over and then goes prospecting but someone has to look for those irregularities that may signal tumors and cancers tumors and cancers that may exist in the bowel of society as well as that of the individual dreiser knew it melville knew it b traven knew it dostoyevsky knew it thompson also knew the truth the literature of a healthy society needs proctologists as well as brain surgeons know what i admire the most the guy was over the top the guy was absolutely over the top big jim didnt know the meaning of the word stop there are three brave lets inherent in the foregoing he let himself see everything then he let himself write it down then he let himself publish it his novels are terrifying cameos of smalltown hurt hypocrisy and desperation they are urgent in their ugliness triumphant in their tawdriness he wrote goddam good stories but goddam good stories are not literature who knows that better than i do what makes thompsons books literature is his unflinching flatly lighted examination of the alienated mind the psyche wired up like a nitro bomb of people living like diseased cells in the bowel of american society thompson was not always great but at his best he was the best there was because he wouldnt stop the reader is captured by thompsons feverish tales carried on by the understanding that he will go on until the end however ugly mean or horrible that end may be someone has to examine the stool samples of society someone has to describe those tumors from which more cultured people shy away jim thompson was one of the few hes dead and he doesnt backlist well but not everyone has forgotten thank god they never do the great ones seem to always find their springs and channels and i think that is why you are here now my friend buckle your seatbelt and grab your gasmask you are going into the darkness without me without eudora welty without john updike or truman capote or edmund wilson you are going there with a genuine maniac of the human underside you may be revolted you may turn away gasping with a sickened sort of laughter but big jim thompson will not stop and my guess is this neither will you stephen king bangor maine september i got off at threethirty but it took me almost an hour to walk home the factory is a mile off pacific boulevard and we live a mile up the hill from pacific or up the mountain i should say how they ever managed to pour concrete on those hill streets is beyond me you can tie your shoelaces going up them without stooping jo was across the street playing with the ministers little girl watching for me too i guess she came streaking across to my side cornyellow curls bobbing around her roseandwhite face she hugged me around the knees and kissed my hand something i dont like her to do but cant stop she asked me how i liked my new job and how much pay i was getting and when payday was all in one breath i told her not to talk so loud out in public that i wasnt getting as much as i had with the foundation and that payday was friday i thought can i get a new hat then i guess so if its all right with mother jo frowned mother wont let me have it i know she wont she took mack and shannon downtown to buy em some new shoes but she wont get me no hat no hat any hat i mean whered she get the money to go shopping with didnt she pay the rent i guess not jo said oh goddam i said now what the hell will we do well what are you gaping for go on and play get away from me get out of my sight go on go on i reached out to shake her but i caught myself and hugged her instead i cannot stand anyone who is unkind to children children dogs or old people i dont know what is getting the matter with me that i would shake jo i dont know dont pay any attention to me baby i said you know i didnt mean anything jos smile came back youre just tired thats all she said you go in and lie down and youll feel better i said i would and she kissed my hand again and scurried back across the street jo is nine my oldest child i was tired and i hurt the lung id had collapsed during the winter seemed to be filled with molasses and my piles were torturing me i hollered when i got inside the door but no one answered so i supposed mom was gone too i went in the bathroom and washed and tried to do something about my piles and washed again no good i went at it again and i washed some more and then i remembered that id already done the same thing about six times so i stopped the refrigerator did have some icecubes in it nothing but icecubes and some old celery and a few grapefruit and a stick of butter but that was something mom has a hard time getting the trays out and when she does she usually leaves them out roberta never puts any water in the trays shell take them out remove all the cubes and put them back without a drop of water jo and i are about the only ones in the house who always fill the trays and put them back where they belong if it wasnt for us wed never have any ice god listen to me rave and about icecubes i dont know whats getting into me while i was standing there drinking and scratching and wondering about things in general mom came in from the bedroom shed been asleep and she was still barefooted mom has varicose veins shes always had them as far back as i can remember or thats not true either her legs were never real good but she didnt have those veins until i was nine years old i remember how she got them it was about a week after frankie my younger sister was born pop was down in texas trying to complete an oil well we were existing in a shack deep down on oklahoma citys west main street a tough part of town in those days i guess it still is margaret thats my older sister and i were sort of living off the neighbors and mom wasnt eating much so that left only frankie to take care of but she couldnt eat handouts and mom couldnt nurse her and we only had fifty cents in the house well margaret and i went down to the drugstore after a jar of malted milk and on the way back a group of the neighborhood hoodlums chased us and margaret dropped the bottle it was all wrapped up in that tough brown paper and we didnt know it was broken until mom unwrapped it no she didnt scold or spank us to the best of my recollection we never received a real spanking she just sat there among the pillows and something terrible happened to her face and then she placed one starved hand over her eyes and her shoulders trembled and she cried i think an artist must have been peeking in the window that night for years later i saw a painting of mom a painting of a woman in a torn gown tangled black hair and thin hand concealing her face but not hiding oh jesus no not hiding but pointing at wretchedness and pain and hopelessness that were unspeakable it was called despair but the artist should have stayed for the sequel we got some newspapers and spread them out on the bed and dumped the malt out on it and then marge and i and mom began to pick the glass out of it we picked and sorted and strained our eyes for an hour or more and just when we had a few spoonfuls without any glass in it frankie woke up with one of those wild kicking fits which characterized her awakenings she almost bounced us off the bed somehow we held on keeping the glass from being remixed with the milk but it didnt do any good frankie had only been limbering up for the main event her nightdress had gone up with the first kicks and now her diaper slipped down well we threw the papers away and mopped up a little it was so funny we all had to laugh and mom asked us what we thought wed better do now marge who was twelve said shed brought some chalk home from school maybe we could grind that up and put it in hot water and it would take the place of milk mom was afraid it wouldnt i didnt have any ideas frankie was squawling her head off and it was impossible not to sympathize with her mom said well if i write a note to mr johnson will you take it down and marge and i began to whimper and whine the boys would chase us if we went out again and wed just break the next bottle of milk like we had the first besides mr johnson was a mean ol man and wouldnt trust anyone for anything he had big signs up all over the store saying he wouldnt you just go down and see for yourself mom mom said she guessed shed have to we got out her old black serge dress and a shawl and some houseslippers and marge did the best she could with pinning up her hair then we wrapped frankie up in a blanket and started out we took frankie because mom wouldnt leave her alone and she needed me and marge to lean on it was bitterly cold and i thought that was what was making mom shiver but it wasnt not entirely it was just the pain of her legs going to pieces beneath her it was only a block to the drugstore and a block back but as i say her legs werent good to start with and shed just had frankie and she hadnt been eating right for years we got the milk johnson wouldnt have given it to us but there was a whore and her pimp in the place swell customers drinking coke and paregoric and he didnt want to show himself up for what he was he even threw in a small bottle of soothing syrup which no doubt he would have had to throw out in the alley before long anyway it had a little label under the regular one rather part of a label most of it was torn off the remaining letters read opi we got back to the house and went into the kitchen the gas hadnt been cut off yet although i cant figure out why mom put frankie down on the table and sat down herself and marge and i fixed the milk and filled the bottle ill swear to this day that frankie rose up out of her blankets and snatched it from our hands she took a big swig and said gush and gave us a tight selfsatisfied hoover smile then she closed her eyes and got down to business mom said that milk looks so good i believe ill have some you kids ought to drink some too we kids didnt like milk we never liked anything that was good for us probably because we so seldom had the opporfunity to acquire the liking you like icecream sodas dont you said mom i could fix it so itd be sweet and nice youd sleep better if you had something warm on your stomachs well an icecream soda that put the matter in a different light we heated another pan of milk and filled three glasses and mom put a third of the bottle of soothing syrup into each one it was such a little bottle and mom didnt know any better pop said afterwards that she should have and that johnson ought to have been horsewhipped but pop wasnt there that night i remember dimly in the hazefilled passages i fled slowly through a white face that kept rising up before me a white face and long black hair and warning terrorstricken eyes that kept forcing themselves open with the invisible fingers of sheer will and when i saw that face i retreated and was somehow glad once i had wandered deep along a subterranean corridor following an odor a sound a vision i do not know what it was but it was irresistible and i had come to a carved archway and there was a laughing little girl on the other side holding out her hands to me jo jo holding out her hands and trying to grasp mine no i mean it it was jo that was more than fifteen years before jo was born but i knew at once that it was jo and she knew that i was her father i said wheres your mother and jo laughed and tossed her hair and said oh she isnt here come on in and play with me i said all right and stepped toward her and she bent her little face to kiss my hand and then mom appeared between us she struck jo struck her and kept striking her and jo screamed at me for help and i stood motionless and horrified sad yet relieved i stood there until mom had beaten jo to death with her bare fists and then mom motioned for me to precede her back up the passageway and i obeyed i went back up the passage leaving jo dead there in the little room jo has never liked mom there was a large white pavilion with a small circular pool and strong hands kept pushing me toward the pool and i did not want to go into it because it was black and bitter i wondered why mom didnt save me and i cried out to her and a dozen voices shouted back hes coming out of it hes going to be all right mrs dillon i opened my eyes the black coffee rose lazily from the oil cloth and i drank i had been asleep thirty hours seven more than marge mom had shaken off her stupor as soon as frankie began to holler for more milk a few nights later pop came home he came in a taxicab and it was filled with packages he had a new coat for mom she hated it always and wore it about as long a suit for me dresses for marge shoes for all of us toys watches candy rye bread horseradish pigs feet bologna god knows what all marge and i danced around moms bed laughing and eating and unwrapping things while mom lay there trying to smile and pop looked on in happy pride then i noticed the little black grip he was carrying whats in that pop what else you got in that pop i yelled marge joining me pop held the bag up over our heads and giggled and we stopped yelling and jumping for a moment because the giggle startled us pop was such a big man and so dignified even in his amusement i think he was the only man i ever saw who could look dignified with his pants torn and chili on his vest pop always wore good clothes but he was a little careless about their upkeep he unfastened the catch on the bag and turned it upside down and a shower of currency money orders and certified checks floated down to the bed and floor his oil well had come in he had already sold a fraction of his holdings for dollars and here it was the artist should have stayed for that picture too mom with her legs as big and black as stovepipes and dollars on the bed well her legs are still like that and pop is still drilling oil wells very real oil wells to him at least as for me as for me how do you like your new job mom asked did you have to work very hard oh no i said what did you do mostly bookkeeping and typing yeah i said bookkeeping and typing then i lost my temper and told her what i really had done when i finished she said thats nice and i knew she hadnt really heard a word eating out tonight are we i asked what said mom oh well i dont know jimmie i dont know what to do roberta went off to town and didnt leave any money or say what she wanted or anything jo hasnt had a bite to eat all day but a peanut butter sandwich i havent had anything either but of course let me have a dollar i said ill go get something ill pay you back as soon as roberta gets here i could have got something myself mom said but i didnt know what just give me a dollar i said ill go get some potatoes and bread and meat thats what we usually have mom went and got a dollar i will have to have it back jimmie frankie has to get a permanent and some new stockings and we dont have a cent to spare ill pay it back i said i saw it was almost six so i ran all the way to safeways the strongest butchers union in the country is in san diego if you want fresh meat you buy it before six otherwise you buy bacon or lunchmeat which is twothirds cereal and a fourth water or do without i reached the store at six sharp i bought a pound and a half of lunchmeat fortyfive cents some canned beans and potato chips i studied the wine counter a moment but decided id better not buy any even if it was only fifteen cents for a short pint when i reached the corner roberta was just getting off the bus mack was asleep and she was carrying him shannon for one of the few times in her life was behaving herself roberta said hi honey take this lummox will you im worn out i took mack and roberta took the groceries shannon with one of her lightning fast and unpredictable movements leaped up and grabbed me by the elbow carry me daddy she demanded you cant carry mack unless you carry me go on i said go on i cant carry both of you daddys tired shannon said roberta now stop swinging on him or ill blister you why dont you show daddy your new shoes show him how you can dance in them shannon dropped loose pirouetted and was twenty feet down the sidewalk via a shuffleofftobuffalo before i could take a deep breath shannon is four but she is not as large as mack who is eighteen months younger she sleeps an average of seven hours a night eats almost nothing yet has more energy than either of the other children one minute you see shannon the next she is three blocks away she posed for a moment then with her usual unpredictability burst out with my name is samuel hall and i hate you one and all god damn your eyes shannon i said shannon said roberta you get right straight home get one more word out of you and ill blister you till you cant sit down shannon took a notion to mind she wasnt afraid understand i gave up long ago trying to do anything with her and roberta is beaten too but wont admit it shannon is not disturbed by dark closets she does not mind cold showers you cant punish her by depriving her of a meal because shed as soon do without as not you cant spank her because ordinarily you cant catch her and anyway she is always hoping a little that you will try to spank her you are then in the position of an aggressor and she fights best when she has been attacked and there is nothing she loves more than a good fight the last time roberta tried to spank her she roberta not shannon had to go to bed and while she was lying there shannon sneaked into the room and began beating her with a toy broom it was all mom and frankie and i could do to pull her away frankie exercises an occasional control over her by treating her with contempt macks way is to catch her in an unguarded moment and to sit down on her but neither roberta nor i can do much with any method how do you like your new job honey said roberta have a hard day not very i said what did you do most of the day i went around on my hands and knees chipping up plaster roberta stopped what yes theyre building an extension to the plant and a lot of plaster is scattered around the floor i went around with a little thing like a cold chisel and chipped it up but didnt you tell them didnt they know they dont give a damn theyve not got any editorial work down there theyre building airplanes but couldnt they i dont know anything about airplanes roberta started on her mouth set in a tight line youre not going back she said you just go down there in the morning and get whatever youve got coming and tell em they can keep their old job thought of how were going to eat and incidentally pay rent jimmie the kids just had to have shoes i know were hard up but okay okay but how are we going to pay the rent i suppose you told the landlady wed have it at the end of the week well said roberta we will wont we dont you get paid on friday o jesus i said o christ and mary o god damn roberta got red and her nostrils trembled now james dillon dont you dare swear at me im not swearing im praying for forebearance and dont get smart either dammit i said how many times have i asked you not to talk about me getting smart im not six years old well you know what i mean i dont know what you mean i said i dont know half the time what you mean why dont you ever peek inside a dictionary cant you ever read anything besides the catholic prayer book and true story why jes my god honey oh god dont cry out here on the street please dont it seems like every time i open my mouth lately someone starts bawling she pushed on ahead of me into the house letting the screen door slam in my face mom opened it for me now dont say anything i said shell be all right in a minute just dont pay any attention to her im not saying anything said mom what difference would it make if i did cant people open their mouths around here any more please mom oh all right i put mack down on the lounge and went back into the bedroom roberta had taken off her dress and hung it up and was lying on the bed hands over her face i looked down at her and began to tingle i knew how it was going to be and i hated myself for it but i couldnt help it roberta didnt need to do anything to win an argument with me but let me look at her i knew it from the moment i saw her she knew it after a few years i sat down and pulled her head into my lap and she turned so that her breasts pressed against my stomach i wish i thought that mom could understand what roberta means to me why i am like i am with her i wish roberta could understand what mom means to me maybe they do understand maybe thats why things are like they are i said im terribly sorry honey im just awfully tired i guess im tired too said roberta its certainly no fun to drag that mack and shannon around all day im sure it isnt i said i am worn out jimmie no fooling thats too bad dear youve got to get more rest she allowed me to stroke her for a few moments then she sat up brightly and pushed me away and youre tired too she declared youve already said you were now you lie down while i help mom get dinner she pulled an apron over her head and i flopped back on the pillows give mom a dollar i said what for for the groceries i got roberta seemed to see the sack for the first time whatd you get that stuff for weve got two pounds of beans up in the cupboard why didnt mom cook them i dont know i wasnt here they were right there in the cupboard she must have seen them no harm done we can eat them some other time now please go on and do whatever you have to do and give mom that dollar ill think about it said roberta somehow i was on my feet and the veins in my throat were choking me god damn it give mom that dollar mom opened the door did someone call me she asked no mom i said i was just telling roberta about supper about the groceries to give you the dollar i borrowed why i dont need it said mom if youre short why dont you just keep it oh weve got plenty mom said roberta weve got all kinds of money you just wait a minute she began fishing around in her purse fetching out nickels dimes and pennies and spreading them out on the dresser why dont you give her a dollar bill i said now ill have it for mom in just a moment said roberta in a neat voice ill get it all righty here you are mom theres twenty twentyfive forty sixty eightythree ninetythree oh i guess im seven cents short do you mind if i give it to you tomorrow just keep it all until some other time said mom roberta picked up the change you can have it now if you want it mom went out i lay staring at roberta in the mirror she met my eyes for a moment then looked away how much were the groceries seventy cents ive got thirty cents left if thats what youre driving at i suppose youre going to buy something to drink with it i wont disappoint you im going to get a quart of wine you shouldnt jimmie you know what the doctor told you death where is thy sting i said roberta went out too pretty soon mack came toddling back rubbing the sleep from his eyes there isnt an ounce of fat on him but hes practically as broad as he is long hi daddy hi boy whats the good word savea money whatd you do downtown ride an airplane yop saw a bitey too a real honesttogod bitey yop whatd he look like mack grinned look like a bitey then he went out i have bitten on that joke of his a thousand times but it is the only one he knows and i think a sense of humor should be encouraged roberta shut herself up in the bedroom with the kids about nine and mom was busy in the bathroom working on her bunions frankie was still out so i had the front room to myself not that i minded i arranged a couple of chairs one for my feet just like i wanted them then i went around to the liquor store and bought my wine i thought the clerk was rather patronizing but it could have been my imagination winedrinkers arent regarded very highly in california not when they drink the kind of stuff i bought the better california wines are largely exported the cheaper ones sold locally are made of dregs heavily fortified with raw alcohol in los angeles there are places where you can buy stiff drinks of this poison for two cents and a full pint for as little as six and you can count as many as fifty addicts in a single block wineos they are dubbed and their lives are as short fortunately as they are unmerry the jails and hospitals are filled with them always undergoing the cure a nightly average of forty dead are picked up out of flophouses jungles and boxcars so i got home sat down with my feet up and took a big slug it tasted watery but strong i took another slug and i didnt mind the taste i was leaning back against the cushions smoking and wiggling my toes and anticipating the next drink when frankie came in she made straight for the divan and took off her shoes she is the big hearty perfectly composed type the counterpart of pop except for her blonde hair drunk again she inquired conversationally getting want a shot not that stuff ive already had three scotches anyway smatter roberta yes no oh i dont know i said well said frankie i like roberta and im crazy about the kids but i must say youre a fool youre not being good to her she doesnt like things like this any more than you do i took another drink by the way i said when is your husband joining you i guess i asked for that said frankie im sorry i said im just feeling mean that wine wont make you feel any better youll have the grandfather of all hangovers in the morning thats in the morning i said tonight heres looking at you frankie snapped open her purse and pitched me a halfdollar go get yourself a halfpint of whisky it wont tie you up like that wine will i looked at the money i dont like to take this frankie oh go on hurry up and ill have a drink with you i put on my shoes and went out when i came back frankie was holding a letter in her hand and her eyes were red what do you think about pop she asked what about him didnt mom show you this letter she got today i thought she had let me see it i said not now i want to take it back to the bedroom with me you can read it tomorrow look i said whatever it is it wont worry me any more to know about it than not to know about it now that i know theres something wrong please dont argue and if youre going to bawl go hide some place ive been laved in tears ever since i came home youre a dog said frankie wiping her eyes she chuckled did you hear the one about the rattlesnake that didnt have a pit to hiss in shut up a minute i skimmed through the letter it didnt say much they didnt want to keep pop at the place he was in any longer he was he was too much trouble well have to take him away i guess i said bring him out here you mean why not frankie gave me a look all right then i said what do you suggest we cant have mom live with him even if we did have the money for a place in the country and everything what about his own folks theyve got dough they were holding on to it too said frankie at the last writing you know how they are jimmie you write one of em a letter and he reads it dutifully writes a note of his own and sends the two on to another twig on the tree the note incidentally begins exactly five spaces from the top right of one page and ends five spaces from the left bottom of another and of course it doesnt it wouldnt refer to pop at all that would be indelicate long before the sixteenhundredandeightieth dillon is reached our letter is worn out and nothing but theirs remains the result well aunt ednas thirdoldest girl sabetha has her adenoids removed and greatuncle juniper gets a copy of emersons essays thats about the way it would be ive always believed that the dillons originated the chainletter lets have a drink and sleep on it i said just a short one said frankie how do you like your job swell got a good bunch to work with oh swell such enthusiasm lets have all the lurid details well there are six of us altogether counting the foreman or leadman as they call him the stockroom is divided into two departments purchased parts that is parts manufactured outside the plant and manufactured parts but were all inside the same enclosure the two fellows in purchased parts are busken and vail busken is dapper very nervous vail is the sure enigmatic type theyre two of a kind however o oh said frankie i was on my hands and knees all day and naturally i was sweating a lot at some time during the day these clowns in purchased theyve got the stenciling machine in their department taped a neat little chromo upon my buttocks i must have worn it for hours it said wet decals no step frankie laughed until the seams of her dress threatened to split why jimmie thats clever isnt it then theres moon our leadman he came around tonight at quitting time and gave me a few words of comfort he said not to worry if i didnt seem to be doing anything the company expected to lose money on a man for the first month frankie slapped her knees and you getting fifty cents an hour oh its funny i said now for a really brainy fellow we have gross the bookkeeper hes a graduate of the university of louisiana and a former allamerican i asked him if he knew lyle saxon well he asked me what year lyle was on the team so that fixes him in your book frankie didnt laugh this time the remaining member of our sextette i said is named murphy he was laying off today so i didnt meet him frankie picked up her shoes and got up youll never make it down there jimmie not the way you feel dont you really think you can write any more no what are you going to do then get drunk goodnight goodnight i thought about pop now what the hell will we do i thought i thought about roberta about mom about the kids growing up around me growing up amidst this turmoil these hatreds this well why quibble insanity i thought and my stomach tightened into a little ball my guts crawled up around my lung and my vision went black i took a drink and chased it with wine i thought about the time id sold a thousand dollars worth of stories in a month i thought about the day i became a director for the writers project i thought about the fellowship id gotten from the foundation one of the two fellowships available for the whole country i thought about the letters id got from a dozen different publishers the finest thing we have ever read swell stuff dillon keep it coming we are paying you our top rate i said to myself so what were you ever happy did you ever have any peace and i had to answer why no for christs sake youve always been in hell youve just slipped deeper and youre going to keep on because youre your father your father without his endurance theyll have you in a place in another year or two dont you remember how your father went like you exactly like you irritable erratic dull then well you know ha ha youre damned right you know i wonder if they are mean to you in those places i wonder if they put the slug on you when you get to cutting up ha haha ha ha theyll give you a spoon to eat with bud and a wooden bowl and theyll cut your hair off to save on shampoos and after the first month theyll make you wear mittens to bed they cant get you there they got pop there didnt they not they you you and mom and frankie remember how easy it was come on pop well have a bottle of beer and go for a little ride pop didnt suspect hed never think his own family would do a thing like that to him you had to of course you did and theyll have to and you wont know until its too late like pop did remember the startled look on his face as you sidled out the door remember how he knocked upon the panels knocked then pounded clawed remember his hoarse voice following you down the hall the quavering and cadenced tones frankie jimmie mom are you there mom frankie jimmie are you coming back and then he began to cry to cry like jo might or mack or shannon or you mmom im afraid mom take me out of here ttake me out of here mom frankie jimmie jimmie take me out i screamed and sobbed and my head rose to a peak and flopped back in a sickening mush im coming pop i wont leave you im coming and mom was shaking me by the shoulder and the clock on the mantel said fivethirty the whisky flask was empty so was the wine bottle jimmie said mom jimmie i dont know what in the worlds going to become of you i staggered to my feet i do i said how about some coffee we didnt have anything in the house to take with me for lunch and i lost my coffee before id gone a block i coughed and choked and vomited and then i began to cramp and i knew i ought to go to the toilet but i was afraid id be late so i went on it wasnt so bad going down the hill all i had to do was stand still and keep lifting my feet and the sidewalk rolled under them but when i reached pacific boulevard i began to have trouble theyve got sixlane traffic on pacific and every lane was filled with aircraft workers going to the plants most of them were in jallopies because cars are higher than getout on the west coast and you knew their brakes couldnt be too good and they were all traveling fast bumping and crowding into each other to get to the plants ahead of the others it was still early but you have to get there early if you want a parking space within walking distance it wouldve been hard for me to get through that traffic even if id felt well normal and i didnt i wasnt just so sick and tired i wanted to lie down in the gutter and go to sleep the wine was playing tricks on me i couldnt coordinate my impulses with my limbs and muscles id start to step into the traffic but my reactions were so slow that i couldnt move until the opportunity was gone several times i was unable to halt the impulse id started and i walked into moving cars banging my knees against fenders and wheels i couldnt judge distance at all a car that seemed to be a block away would in the same instant have its bumper against my legs its driver shouting what the hell i cant say exactly how i got across i remember falling down and skinning my knees and rolling and there were a lot of horns blowing and then i was on the other side it was a quarter of seven and i had a mile to go i started off at a trot down the dirt road that curved around the bay there was a steady procession of cars passing me moving not a great deal faster than i was and so close that they brushed my clothes but none of them stopped their passengers looked out at me phlegmatically and looked away again and i jogged on and on redfaced nervous tongue hanging out jogged along like a hound dog with a threshing crew i wanted to spit through their windows or grab up a handful of rocks and stone them most of all i wanted to be some place else where it was quiet and there were no people of course i knew why i wasnt asked to ride no car could very well stop in that traffic the cars behind would push it ahead even with the brakes on and the motor off and practically all of them were loaded and they couldnt let me ride on the running board because there is a severely enforced ordinance against that nevertheless i hated them almost as much as i did myself i reached the plant just as the fiveminute whistle was blowing actually youre supposed to be inside standing ready at your station when the fiveminute blows but there were hundreds besides myself who werent i fell into line in front of the gate that held my clock number i was weak but i felt better the sweating had done me good there was a steady snapping of metal and rustling of paper as the gate guards examined each mans lunch one man a new one doubtless had his lunch wrapped in a newspaper the line was held up while the guard untied the strings and unwrapped it when i reached the guard in our line he glanced at my badge and pass then holding the pass in his hand he plucked the badge from my jacket and gave me a shove through the other lines over there chiefs desk i didnt ask why i thought i knew for a moment it was in my mind to run then i thought well if they really want me theyll get me so i stood at the desk until the chief in his military cap and sam browne belt looked up his face was fat and cold his eyes shrewd what number huh number number whats your clock number oh i told him what it was he reached into a drawer and pulled out another badge and a yellow isinglass enclosed card it bore the picture they had taken of me the day before my name age and a detailed physical description this is your permanent badge and number punch it hereafter this is your identification card dont lose lend or forget either one youll need them to get through the gate and while youre inside if you leave them at home itll cost you fifty cents for us to send a messenger after them if you lose them it will be a dollar understand all right good luck i punched in and walked through the crowded yard to the plant entrance relieved thats not the right word maybe ill tell you why some time the stockroom gate was locked as usual i could see moon and busken and vail up in the purchasedparts section talking but evidently they didnt see me gross the bookkeeper was on his stool absorbedly manicuring his fingernails i walked around to the window how about letting me in i said he looked up he is a handsome fellow with his wellshaped head dark eyes and hair but so ruggedly built that he appears awkward he was dressed impeccably in a doeskin jacket and brown whipcord pants crawl through the window he suggested pleasantly enough how about the sign that says not to that dont mean anything i crawl through all the time i scrambled through just as the sevenoclock whistle was blowing and bumped into moon as i swung my feet to the floor i wouldnt do that any more if i were you he said theres a rule against it i looked at gross he was uncovering his typewriter his back turned toward us all right i said what would you like to have me do today get these parts off the floor the first thing what but he had turned away moon is something over six feet tall very dark and so thin that he seems to float rather than walk there was a short squat young man who looked like a mexican moving around in the papercarpeted area which held the nights accumulation of parts as i came up he picked up an armful and headed back toward the racks i picked up another armful and followed him he disposed of his load moving quickly along the shelves and cribs and was going to pass me by on his way to the front i stopped him where do these go i said he glanced at them pulled several pieces from my arms and put them up the others dont go here he said moving away again i moved along with him where do they go then tank flanges to welding straps to subassembly compressionrib brackets to sheetmetal how come they were brought in here oh i dont know those straps used to be ours used to put em on out in final assembly routings wrong on the others we were back at the front now just put em down on the floor he said ill grab a moveboy pretty soon want to stack those ribs theyre all ours he pointed them out to me and indicated the racks in which they belonged i loaded a handtruck wheeled them back to the racks and began to unload it was pretty slow work and not entirely because of my hangover the ribs had a tendency to catch on the paper which had to be put down between layers and shove it out the other side and despite their size they were so light that a push on one would put the entire stack in disarray when noon came i hadnt disposed of more than twothirds of the ribs and i was so nervous that i forgot how weak and hungry i was i went to the toilet and washed and i had a couple of cigarettes in the yard then i came back in and went to work again i guess it was around one oclock when the darkskinned fellow dropped by he seemed to have a few minutes to spare how you doing he inquired and before i could answer say youre not mixing those together are you he fingered along the shelves sliding out one here one there cant you see the difference in those two ones slotted on one side and one on the other and these see the rivet holes are spaced differently on one kind they come in pairs in the other theyre evenly spaced well and why the hell didnt you tell me there was more than one kind i thought but i just thought it any others ive mixed up i said weakly you ought to put part of these in your opposite rack theyre a righthand rib all right but they use one of them in each left wing the same thing goes for the lefthand rib of this type youve got one leftright rib and one rightleft rib in each wing heres where i give up i said and i meant it youll catch on in time he grinned thats all it takes is a little time how am i going to straighten this out well he looked over his shoulder ive got an order to throw out to tailcone but but well ill help you it must have taken him all of thirty minutes to do the job moon came around just as he had finished got that tailcone stuff out yet murphy he said theyre hollering for it i glanced at my darkskinned acquaintance now i might make a mistake on ribs i thought but i know a mexican when i see one at least hes certainly no irishman its my fault if theres any delay i said as he hurried off i mixed these ribs up and murphy was straightening me out howd you happen to mix em up asked moon wheres the travelers on them i dont know i said i dont know what a traveler is he turned and jerked his head for me to follow him at the front counter he stopped and i stopped he reached down to the shelf beneath it opened his lunch pail and took out an apple he bit into it chewed and swallowed and moved over to grosss desk gross said moon chomp chomp did you find any wing travelers kicking around today yeah said gross i picked up three four i guess it was lets see em the travelers were blue cardboard squares covered from top to bottom with print they carry every process that goes into the making of a certain part moon explained they follow the parts right down the processing line and when they get here we put our count on em and give em to gross who enters em in the books yeah those ribs you put up will have to be counted gross can do it after while why i can do it i said it was my mistake gross can do it hes not very busy ill do it said gross moon took a final mouthful of apple pulled a wooden box up to the fence and stepped up on it about fifty feet away a guard was leaning against a pillar his back to us moon took a slow unhurried look around the plant brought his arm back deliberately and hurled the apple core it struck the guard on the framed front of his cap pushing it down over his eyes bounced high into the air and landed in the cockpit of a plane moon stepped down unsmiling now lets get busy he said and sweep this place out gross was directly behind me when i punched out my card and he followed me through the gate got a ride home he asked no i havent i said why dont you walk down here with me to my car i said thanks id appreciate it and we walked along together working our way through the double stream of traffic that was already beginning to flow toward pacific boulevard what do you think of that guy moon he asked did you ever see anybody so screwy in your life i laughed hes got his peculiarities all right hes crazy said gross and i dont care who tells him i said so hes been riding me ever since i went to work here i was rather anxious to divert the conversation to another subject have you been here quite a while ive been in the plant four months i only started in the stockroom three weeks ago i worked down in drophammer the rest of the time you like this work better id like it if moon wasnt so crazy and wouldnt ride me all the time i aint used to that riding he dont like me because personnel put me in there without asking him about it i went over and talked to the personnel man see told him about my education and how i wanted a chance to use it we had a real nice talk hes a nice fellow hes quite a sports fan and when he found out i was allamerican he really got interested a few days after that they fired the bookkeeper they had in the stockroom even moon admits he wasnt any good and gave me the job he stopped and opened the door of an old chevrolet sedan what do you think of murphy he said one foot on the running board how do you mean i said gross snorted did you ever see anyone that looked more like a mexican in your life well no and he calls himself murphy i think they ought to do something about that dont you why i dont know say said gross didnt you just get through saying he was a mexican yes i said i mean well all right then he said he climbed into the car settled himself and looked at me with veiled amusement oh i forgot to tell you this isnt my car it belongs to another guy i dont know just when hell be out and i think hes going to have a load maybe youd better go on thanks i said ill do that any time ive got my own car he called after me ill be glad to give you a ride thanks i said without turning around i knew he was laughing and it embarrassed me it always embarrasses me to see meanness in others even when it is directed at me i wince for them it wasnt until late that night that i thought about what id said and how it would sound repeated to murphy and i was confident that it was going to be repeated it was because it just isnt natural for me to do or say anything without trouble ensuing of course i could protect myself by going to murphy first and explaining that gross had put words in my mouth but then what if gross didnt intend to tell murphy after all id have started something murphy would confront gross with my story and i would be called as a witness if gross admitted it id be a tattletale if he said i was lying well what could i do i dont think im actually afraid of gross ive had my ears batted down so many times that i know theres nothing to be less fearful of than physical pain i am only afraid of him in that he can worry me and i do not know how i can stand much more ive got to pull myself together the next morning right after i had crossed pacific and started down the dirt road a car began to honk behind me to hear a car horn in san diego is an unusual thing i think theres an ordinance against it i looked around it was moon he was driving a late model buick and the front door was swinging open i hopped in when we reached the plant he parked in a reserved space and i thanked him and started to get out wait a minute dillon dilly its only sixthirty we lighted cigarettes and he looked at me appraisingly he is about thirty i think were about the same size dilly i said yes we were wondering what was coming next i dont think moon is screwy as gross puts it i think he simply says and does whatever is on his mind ive got the edge on you for weight though i said i cant put on any weight he said i cant stop sleeping with my wife i laughed every time i think im going to he said she fixes me a big batch of egg sandwiches i told her last night that that was going to have to last a while and this morning she fixed me six egg sandwiches for my lunch youd think shed been living in china instead of me you were in china eighteen months in the interior petty officer the last of my hitch in the navy ever do any clerical work dilly yes its not in my line but ive done it the trouble with keeping records in a place like this he said is that youve got to know parts just being a bookkeeper and a typist and so on isnt enough now gross had four months experience in another plant before he came here so he knows parts pretty well at least he should know them pretty well i certainly dont know much about them i said ill have to show you around a little he said ive been pretty busy before or idve already done it you remind me of it some time today i went into the plant feeling somehow better than i had felt in a long time of course i should know by now that no one is going to do anything for me unless there is a catch to it but i keep right on getting caught with my guard down the boys in purchased parts had received several kegs of bolts and washers and we had got in very few parts so i was delegated to help them put their parts in the bins thus i witnessed another example of the humor of busken and vail all these small parts are magnafluxed that is they are dipped in a bluedye bath partly to prevent corrosion i believe partly to show up any flaws which they may have of course the dye rubs off easily by the time i had worked five minutes my hands were dripping with the stuff well a youth in a white shirt came up to the counter one of the stockchasers vail quickly slipped on a pair of gloves busken darted around behind the racks and went through the gate why if it isnt my old pal jack said vail heartily striding forward with his right hand extended and tugging at the glove thereon where you been keeping yourself jack now none of your jokes said jack extending his hand nonetheless im in a vail immediately shed his gloves and seized the outthrust hand massaging it vigorously how are you jack ol boy ol boy he demanded rubbing in the dye i say ol boy do you think itll rain do you think you sonofabitch snarled jack leggo goddammit i told you i was in a busken stepped up behind him and slapped him on the back clamped two blue palms against the white shirtsleeves giggling why whats the matter with jack he he he inquired he he he did oo get ittle hands dirty yes i did snapped jack this crazy sonofabitch then he saw the havoc that had been done to his shirt why you bastard he yelled look what you done to my shirt god damn you if i vail seized the left hand also held both in a firm grip jacks just tired he informed busken hes been out in the heat too long you come inside jack its twenty degrees cooler inside he leaned back and pulled trying to pull the hapless jack across the counter busken was almost dancing with glee throw me the broom dilly he chortled well give ol jack he he a prostate want a nice massage jackie he he i handed him an ordinary kitchen broom and standing well out of kicking range he drew the worn straws slowly between jacks buttocks jack writhed and shrieked with laughter and rage busken tickled him delicately upon the testicles jack leaped high into the air as busken worked the tormenting broom and i have never seen anyone put more enthusiasm into a task vail tugged so gradually jack began to slide across the counter midway in the process moon came up and stood watching neither amused nor unamused vail turned to him inquiringly want something how long you going to be busy here oh well have him over in a minute better hurry it up its about time for the guard to come around a moment or so later jack was pulled inside he was a wreck he could do nothing but stand and curse and even that not very effectively youd better get on out of here observed moon no ones supposed to be in here but employees of the department damn it screamed jack didnt you see what happened do you think well you go on now moon repeated im supposed to keep you fellows out of here and im going to do it jack went out the gate muttering tucking in his ruined shirt you come with me dilly said moon i want you to do some typing i walked around to grosss desk with him let dilly have your stool gross he said i want him to do some typing gross got to his feet i can do it you go help murphy take those propellers over to service gross reddened i thought i was supposed to be the bookkeeper around here who said you werent well whatre you why are you oh hell he strode off scowling now this is a shortage report youre going to type dilly said moon handing me two handinscribed pieces of paper a firstrelease shortage report the first release is for twentyfive ships the second for fifty and so on as we really get organized and step up production the size of the releases gets bigger then this shortage report i said its intended to show the parts you need to complete twentyfive ships thats it ordinarily youd have to take the shortages from the books but since youre new ive done it look heres your first item a bulkhead bracket number f we use four of those to a ship weve issued forty to final assembly and we have fortythree in stock that gives us a shortage of seventeen twentyfive ships would require a hundred parts and eightythree from a hundred leaves seventeen i get it i said good give me an original and four copies and lets see how fast you can turn them out i scoured my hands on my pants fitted carbon and paper into the typewriter and got to work i was nervous naturally and the typewriter wasnt all it should have been but i knocked out that shortage report composed almost entirely of symbols and figures in less than half an hour and it didnt have a single mistake in it rather proudly i handed it to moon he looked at it looked at me what are these smudges why i guess theyre from the bolts i was handling i said theyre not very bad are they the question was rhetorical as far as i was concerned the pages were practically spotless i cant send anything to the office that looks like this said moon well i said ill wash my hands and do it over let it go but i dont mind i protested if i havent done it right i want the chance to do it over again let it go he repeated ill have gross do it but listen ive got another job for you anyhow i spent the rest of the day making parts boxes probably the most unpleasant job the mind could conceive the boxes are shipped to us in the form of flat cardboard cutouts you take one of these crimp the ends and sides and smear the back flap with glue then you bring the flap over quickly smearing yourself to the elbows weight it with sandbags and stand it on the floor to set when the back flap is firmly attached you shake out the sandbags apply glue to a tough board which fits beneath the front flap and do the same thing all over again the box is then complete except for attaching the handle the screws for the handle of course usually split the wood since you have inserted it with the grain the wrong way and the job has to be done over that glue was like some a guy was supposed to have sold at ranger texas during the boom pop told me about it some old farmer had made it up from a secret recipe and he used to drive around the drilling wells in a horse and buggy peddling it it would stick anything together if a man got his hand cut off he could stick it on with this glue and it would be as good as it ever was if a string of pipe parted a little glue would patch it up the way pop told it and i heard the yarn so many times i used to get up and walk out when hed start on it it was like this one day when the farmer was passing a well the driller pulled the rig in and one of the guywire stakes whizzed through the air and hit the farmers horse slicing it in two the farmer wasnt alarmed of course he knew what the situation called for he simply got out a pot of glue and stuck the horse together again as it happened however he didnt stick the two halves together as they originally were he got two legs pointing one way two another but it worked out all right after that the animal was indefatigable when he became tired of walking on two of his legs the farmer would turn him over and let him walk on the other two well by noon i looked like i was wearing yellow gloves and the stuff wouldnt come off as ive implied i had to eat my sandwiches out of the palms of my hands and the only way i could get a cigarette was to lift it from the package with my lips gross was vastly amused although he sympathized with me orally and reiterated his conviction that moon was crazy when i got home that night roberta took me into the bathroom and soaked and scrubbed me she cried real tears and after supper she was still so sorry for me that we went over to balboa park and sat until we were sure that everyone had gone to bed we came home everything was quiet i went into the kitchen and got a drink of water and i heard her drawing the shades and slipping a chair under the doorknob i waited a minute before i went in i left the kitchen light on roberta knows how she looks and she likes a little light she is the only woman i have ever known who did i went in she had put the pillows from the divan upon the floor and was lying upon them and her slack suit was by her side she looked up at me and smiled and cupped her breasts in her hands and she was more white more beautiful and maddening than i had ever seen her i had seen her that way five thousand times and now i saw her again saw her for the first time and i felt the insane unaccountable hunger for her that i always had always and always will and then i was in heaven and in hell at the same time there was a time when i could drown myself in this ecstasy and blot out what was to follow but now the epigamic urgings travel beyond their periphery kneading painfully against my heart and lungs and brain a cloud surrounds me a black mist and i am smothered and the horrors that are to come crowd close observing and i feel lewd and ashamed there is no beauty in it it is ugly despicable for days i will be tortured haunted feeble inarticulate and yet even during those days even tomorrow morning when i first awake yes even an hour from now i didnt get paid friday about two oclock in the afternoon gross asked me if i wanted to get in the checkpool i asked him what it was check poker he explained each check has a serial number on it and the man with the best serial the best hand according to poker rules wins how much does it cost twobits theres about a hundred in our pool in this stockroom and sheetmetal and subassembly and receiving better come in you might win twentyfive dollars can you wait until i get my check cashed i asked i dont have any change yes we can do that he said he started to walk away hesitated say you only went to work here monday didnt you thats right well hell you wont get any check today they hold back a week on you i couldnt believe him reasonable as it was probably because i needed that money so badly i asked moon about it no you wont get any today he admitted the time is always made up a week late youll get paid for this week next week my face must have shown my feelings whats the matter he said if you absolutely cant make it personnel might advance you five or six dollars they dont like to but they will sometimes i guess i can make it i said it seems kind of hard now but its a good thing in the long run its pretty nice to know that youve always got a weeks pay saved up i hated to go home that night more than usual i mean i knew no one would blame me that is i couldnt pin them down to blaming me but there would just be general hell when i turned the corner at second avenue i saw a car i recognized sitting in front of the house so i slipped across our neighbors yard and went down the driveway until i came to our bedroom i scratched on the screen and roberta came to the window is that the landlady in there yes did you get your check cashed i didnt get any check i you didnt get it jimmie didnt you tell them look i said now stop shouting and listen a minute they hold back a weeks time on everyone theres nothing i could do about it its a company policy the question is but didnt you tell them you had to have it they cant expect you to live on nothing they dont give a damn whether i live or not now the thing to do is go in and tell the old girl whats happened and that well pay her next week oh i cant do that jimmie you put her off once didnt you i said you rented the place from her shes never met me if i go in shell think its a runaround sure enough how are we going to buy groceries lets not worry about that now go in but we dont have anything for supper jimmie i dont know what well do are you going in there and tell her i said no im not said roberta tell her yourself well call mom back then and have her tell her robertas face hardened im not asking mom to do anything shes already taken my head off once today just because i said frankie didnt wash the bathtub out and i wasnt mad at all jimmie i was just as friendly as could be i just remarked that it would make things so much easier on all of us if each one would roberta i said are you going to do what i asked you to or not no sir jimmie i am not thats fine i said see you in the morning maybe jimmie jimmie where do you think youre going whats it to you jimmie you cant goodby i said you cant do this jimmie see if i cant i said grimly and fate accepted the invitation mack jo and shannon came roaring around the corner of the house and threw themselves upon me daddy they shouted daddy daddy daddy did we get paid can we count the money can we have some above the turmoil i heard moms voice starched with amusement i believe mr dillons here now if youll just wait a moment i went in it wasnt as bad as i expected in one way that is the old girl is one of those people who are nuts about writers any kind and shed actually read some of my stuff so instead of being a deadbeat i was an eccentric i was working in aircraft to get material for a book she said so herself as for the money well of course i will have to have it mr dillon but next friday will be perfectly all right i know how it is with you writers youre always forgetting and mislaying and ha ha ha oh yes indeedy i know how you are ha ha ha ha ha ha i sat there smirking nervous as a worm in a fish pond hoping to god that shannon wouldnt take a notion to beat up on her or that mack wouldnt do something in her hat or that jo wouldnt say something scathing finally about six i laughed her out the door it was lucky i got her out when i did at five after six frankie and clarence arrived clarence is portuguese an exfisherman now employed as a carpenter in the shipyard where frankie works they had an unknown quantity of beer inside them and they were carrying a sixtypound tuna i had to work saturday when i was hired i was told that i would work five eighthour days a week but moon says we will probably be working every saturday and perhaps some sundays from now on the government wants planes and wants them now that is all right with me id as soon rather stay at the plant than go home and anything over forty hours a week pays timeandahalf and i must have more money ive said that i wasnt happy when i had money any more than i am now thats only relatively true as i remember pop didnt get along much better with us when he had money than when he was broke although god knows that wasnt our fault but we were a little more chary about jumping down his throat and the same thing applies in my case things werent as bad when i had money roberta had some way of entertaining herself besides keeping me in an uproar i could give mom a lift instead of saying i dont know what to do either when things got too bad i could hide out in a hotel for a day or two or take a trip or well just get up and walk around the block and come back when i got ready no i cant even do that now it sounds ridiculous but i cant ive tried it and theres always trouble of course if i will explain the exact route i am going to take and why i want to go out and when i will be back and allay any suspicions arising from the fact that i want to be alone then i can go if i want to roberta and i have been over and over this matter and it is always the same but jimmie what if i just got up and walked out what would you think do you really want to do things like that too roberta i feel like it sometimes what would you think if i got up and walked out and didnt say where i was going or when i was coming back youd think it was mighty funny wouldnt you i suppose i would dont you see that when i want to know where you are its just because i love you so much you wouldnt like it if i didnt care would you no i get awfully tired sitting around the house all day too jimmie i dont think im asking too much when i want to go walking with you oh of course youre not honey and the children just worship you you know that and they get to be with you so little dont you like to be around them any more oh roberta well well i dont know i think money would help frankie gave us an extra week in advance on her board so what with the tuna we had enough to scrape by on we had an awfully good dinner saturday night baked tuna and whipped potatoes and avocado salad the first good meal weve had since i dont know when id had a good bath and put on my suit of clothes frankied brought home half a pint of gin someone had donated to her and wed all had tom collinses the children were so busy stuffing themselves that they couldnt start anything and well everything was swell i had a weeks work behind me and robertas thigh was pressing against mine and she was laughing at some joke frankie was telling and mom was getting off some wisecracks of her own and it was simply swell i felt so good that tears came into my eyes then jo said will you please transmit the tubers roberta looked at her and stopped smiling now none of your smartness she said if you want something ask for it right jo stopped smiling also i want some potatoes please why dont you ask for them then all right mother said jo please pass the potatoes i passed them i was mad but i wanted to get over it and i thought id better pass it off as a joke jo can take a lot if you give her a joke to chase it with we dont allow foreign languages around here i said absolutely no english she grinned halfheartedly watching roberta out of the corner of her eyes thats right said roberta go ahead and laugh you and your daddy think youre awfully smart dont you leave her alone honey i said lets finish one meal in peace jo didnt mean anything did you jo said mom i meant what i said said jo i know what she meant snapped roberta she can just stay in after dinner and do the dishes thatli take some of the smartness out of her may i go out afterwards asked jo im supposed to practice a play with no you may not go out afterwards youll go to bed im getting tired of you gadding around all hours of the night mama mean to jo mack observed wisely roberta whirled and slapped him and his fat face puckered and he bawled shannons eyes flickered dangerously she will beat the stuffing out of mack herself but it infuriates her to see anyone else touch him she slid under the table roberta knew what was coming and she tried to kick her chair back she even kicked shannon but of course that wouldnt stop her in a split second shannon had buried her teeth in robertas leg roberta let out a scream that they must have heard down on the waterfront she got to her feet or rather foot stumbled and fell backward and shannon slid out from under the table following her and there was blood trickling from the corners of her mouth i grabbed her by the legs and pulled and roberta screamed louder than ever she dropped down on the floor shrieking hysterically and began striking shannon in the face shaking her by the hair clawing and scratching and screaming screaming for us to do something to stop standing around and do ooooooooo jimmie i got shannon by the nose and shut off her wind but she merely held on with her middle teeth and began to breathe out of the corners of her mouth her eyes were wide open unblinking and there was a fiendish animal joy in them i could have choked her loose of course or rather some people could i couldnt jo tried tickling her mom poured ice water on her until the floor was covered an inch deep we all threatened and tried to blister her it was useless it looked as though we were settled there for the night roberta sobbing and pleading shannon jaws set laughing hilariously inside her tiny body it was frankie who got her loose all right shannon she said the next time i bring any boys home just dont expect to be introduced shannon looked at her hesitated and opened her mouth and roberta jerked free she had been bitten badly i know it must have hurt a great deal youve got to spank her jimmie she wailed youve just got to take her in hand dammit i said i cant spank her and i certainly couldnt have by that time shannon had got to the open door and was standing with her back to it why wont you introduce me frankie she said huh think im going to introduce a cannibal like you to anyone whats a cannibal thats what you are someone that eats people shannon threw back her head and her falsetto laugh filled the room jimmie snapped roberta rubbing her leg are you going to punish that child or not i got up and shannon took pity on me she ran by the time i got to the door she had disappeared i went out and looked around the house and called her but there wasnt any answer i went back inside shes gone i said shell be all right said mom shes probably gone over to the drugstore she hasnt been over there yet today whats she doing over there thats three blocks away they give her a nickels worth of stuff every day to leave them alone i turned on roberta you pay them for it dont you you dont let her go around blackmailing people no i dont said roberta i didnt ask em to give her anything give me some money i said what for what for good god roberta whats getting into you how many other places is she pulling this stunt mom and roberta looked at each other out with it i said well i dont believe she has any other place but the grocery store said mom and it was oh my god it was just once jimmie said roberta just this morning she wanted some bacon for breakfast and we didnt have any so she went down to the store and got a halfpound oh god damn i said well im going after her if ive got to bring in the money and buy the groceries and do every other damned thing around here keep your shirt on said frankie but frankie i said the child isnt five years old yet whatll she be like when ill go get her said frankie ive got to get a neckclip anyway she can sit in the beauty parlor with me until im through yes but the money if you want something to worry about said roberta you might look at my leg and i gave up mom and i helped her back to the bedroom and doctored her leg jo went to practice her play frankie went after shannon about tenthirty after the others had gone to bed she and shannon came in shannon threw her arms around me and kissed me and said she was going to be good all next day and i was relieved because i knew that she would remember and keep her promise a promise is a sacred thing with shannon i think one reason that she has so little use for us is that we have made so many promises to her that we havent kept but that may not be it if i were she id dislike us just on general principles she unfolded one tiny fist and dropped something into my lap a nickel i didnt get candy she explained proudly i told the man i wanted a nickel for you to buy whisky with i choked and started to swear and then i thought oh hell what is the use so i kissed her goodnight again and she and frankie went to bed about fifteen minutes later when i was settling down with a magazine mom came in wearing the old wrapper she sleeps in and sat down on the lounge i thought youd gone to bed i said frankie woke me up i wish youd speak to frankie jimmie what about you know about her drinking and everything frankie can carry liquor i said shes the one person ive seen that it really did good she never drinks to keep from feeling bad its always to make her feel better well its a bad thing anyway its cheapening and coarsening shes going to take one drink too many with some of these fellows and itll be too bad frankies not like that you dont know what shes like no one does oh all right i said ill speak to her i wish you would what do you think wed better do about pop jimmie oh i dont know mom i said look havent we had enough trouble for one evening do we have to thresh out everything now we are going to have to do something jimmie dont i know it am i holding back but i cant think tonight i just cant mom looked down at her hands do you suppose if i rented a typewriter please dont ask me that mom dont you think its a lot in your own mind jimmie dont you think that if you really tried i laughed thats it i said i havent really tried not really you get me a typewriter monday and ill go to work again the sarcasm was wasted on mom i might have known it would be im always broadcasting when i should be receiving thats a bargain she said getting up ill get the typewriter and have the table cleared for you right after supper all youll have to do is write all ill have to do is write so i had that to worry about i thought i was hungry i told myself i was i threw down the magazine and went into the kitchen i made a big pot of coffee and a plate of tuna sandwiches i started to eat the first sandwich started coming up as i was biting into the second i kept right on eating take it damn you i said youve had your own way long enough i swallowed and stuffed a whole sandwich down my throat i threw my head back and tossed down a cupful of scalding coffee that did it i strangled and a geyser spewed out splashing over the walls and floor i got over the sink and there was a tidal wave of it i couldnt stop i couldnt breathe there wasnt any more fish in me but there was plenty of blood i brought up a cupful with every gasp i didnt have to cough a deep breath was enough to start it rolling then roberta was there with her arm around me she sat me down in a chair and fed me cold water what have you been doing to yourself jimmie nothing i whispered did you really want a drink that bad no i said i just thought i wanted one besides we dont have the money to throw away you sit there she said dont move ill be right back she went back into the bedroom and then i heard the front door close and through the dinette window i saw her hurrying down the sidewalk her fur coat over her nightdress she was back in a minute not more than three anyway with a pint of whisky i took a stiff drink before i told her that she shouldnt have bought it it was my money she said id been saving it to take to church its been so long since i took anything anything like that jimmie and youre supposed to and i hated to go any more without doing it and and honey i said oh for christs sake i guess i had forgotten how much roberta did and does love me i guess i have wanted to forget you cannot fight a person who loves you and i have had to fight but now well i know what the church means to roberta and i knew that in her own mind she had damned herself a little by diverting that dollar from its original destination that dollar the seven cents she had chiseled from mom was probably part of it i remembered all over again i was going to school at the university of nebraska and lois my parther in so many nights of love had been married a month and i was to put it politely on the make i met roberta at a school mixer i rubbed her and felt her and she didnt seem to mind so the next night i took her for a ride and the night after that i took her to another dance it was still all right i could go as far as i liked well i had observed the best fraternity traditions id shown her a good time i hadnt got her drunk or told her shed have to walk or ride it was just a case of two people wanting something they knew would be good or so i thought we went up to my room i said dont you want to take your dress off it might get wrinkled she took off her dress and lay down again i said how about those other things can i help you she said does it hurt very much i didnt get it for a minute youre not sewed into them are you you know what i mean she said i dont mind but if its going to hurt i want to know so i wont holler look i said are you a havent you ever done this before i certainly have not well well what the hell are you doing here then why you know i love you well look honey i said i appreciate it and all that but but i dont want it that bad youll love some other guy later on and no i wont now show me how but but baby i said i wont let you do this and she said calmly you may as well ill never love anyone but you no one will ever have me but you i was never any good at arguments two months later when jo was conceived we got married i didnt have to marry her she made that very clear but she also made it clear that wherever i was there she was going to be forever and always i thought it might be inconvenient to have her and children around without a marriage license so but as i was saying there is one thing i am sure of roberta loves me she loves me so much that she doesnt give a whoop whether i go to heaven or hell if she can go along she would in fact prefer hell i would need her there i might not i might see someone i liked better in the other place that is roberta i didnt mind so much that saturday night we moved in to the lounge and she took a nip or two from the bottle so that the whisky on my breath wouldnt bother her and then we sat and talked about everything under the sun i said i was going to get ahold of myself and be different and she said i didnt need to be different however or whatever i was shed love she said she was the one that was going to be different know im hateful and cross and mean jimmie but it seems like i just cant help it im always sorry afterwards but i cant help it at the time but im going to be different from now on really i am thats the way the evening ended not quite but weve covered the other matter there was an armistice all day sunday i almost felt good monday morning mom fixed my breakfast and i actually ate some you still want me to get the typewriter jimmie she said sure im going to sit down tonight and beat the holy hell out of it gross picked me up in a new ford just as id crossed pacific you see that really wasnt my car the other night he said this is my car i mean its the one my wifes folks bought for her its a nice car i said yeah he said i already heard plenty about how nice it is i wish i could tell em to take it and ram it inlaws are funny people i said they aint to me i dont know what to do sometimes i thought maybe if i could get a little clerical experience i might get some kind of civil service job that would be nice and dignified and it would pay pretty good i kept him talking about himself i knew if i didnt the conversation would turn to my private affairs when he left college he said hed played pro football for two years then hed begun to lose his speed and theyd canned him and hed joined the army they discharged him after eleven months because of a permanently disabled ankle he received a sevendollar compensation check from the government every month hed gone from the army into aircraft work he didnt say so but it was apparent that he was fit for nothing but manual labor we walked into the plant together moon was at the desk examining the books i see you havent straightened these out yet gross he said ominously im making headway gross protested the things are crazy moon and you know how it is half the time i dont know when stuff is brought in or taken out of here dilly said moon do you think you can handle these books why i began why i i think you can moon said gross show dilly the ropes when you get through you can start dusting the racks early last winter i was coming out of the post office in oklahoma city when i ran into mike stone i told him id just been up to the recruiting station trying to join the army it was the day mike had been released under dollar bond on a criminal syndicalism charge and he undoubtedly had many things on his mind but he stopped to inquire into my troubles regardless i dont think a change of scenery is going to help you dill he said but but if youve just got to go some place how about the west coast our attorney borrowed a car from his brother at san diego when he was out there on vacation and hes got to send it back if you want to take it your transportation wont cost you anything it sounded pretty good if i got out there on a limb sort of maybe the foundation would extend my fellowship or maybe i could connect with one of the hollywood studios i went home well said roberta wheres your uniform i thought youd be on the way to fort sill by now they didnt turn you down because you had a wife and three children did they jimmie was probably afraid theyd make him sleep on the ground said mom i never saw such a boy always to be afraid hed get an ant or a little worm on him or something you ought to join the foreign legion jimmie said frankie you could get some good material for stories i said get my things packed im going to california hohum said roberta can you folks eat macaroni and cheese for lunch im going in a car mike stones lawyer is going to give me his car to go in roberta came alive then so id been chasing around with those filthy reds again well she hoped theyd send me over the road with the rest of the crowd itd serve me right jimmie you mustnt have anything to do with them mom said weve already got about all the trouble we can stand frankie said i always liked mike whats the deal maybe ill go along im getting doggoned tired of cashiering for fifteen a week and getting docked for shortages i dont make im going by myself i said as soon as i get settled and see how things are ill send for the rest of you roberta when my check comes wire me forty and keep the rest youre not going any place but to jail said roberta i warn you james dillon if you even look like youre going to i dont know roberta said mom it might be all right theres really nothing ive got to stay here for and frankie ought to get away from chick i dont see how she stands him slobbering and sulking around all the time oh chicks all right mom said frankie he just doesnt know quite how to take you people and he gets blue and disgusted because he doesnt have a better job if he goes im not said mom the reason he doesnt get anywhere is because no one likes him hes just a big sulking calf no ones going but me i said dont be such a pig jimmie said frankie you wouldnt want us to stay here just barely getting by if we could do well out there would you asked mom ive been trying to think what i could wear said roberta i guess my green slack suit would be the best now look here i said you folks just cant get up and tear off like this its absolutely crazy well of course if you dont want us said mom hes always trying to get away from me mom said roberta ever since we got married hes not going to though well we came to california i felt pretty sorry for chick chick is an expert mechanic on pinball machines and other gambling devices its probably the only thing hes any good at since they were outlawed in the southwest hes had to work at anything he could get at about a fourth of what he used to make there really wasnt room for him in the car and we did promise wed look out for him but after we got here we were so busy looking out for ourselves that we couldnt be bothered a great deal he wrote frankie a rather nasty letter then one to the family in general so now none of us knows quite what to do frankie wants to see him im sure but mom and roberta are so angry still that seeing him would mean not seeing them so i dont know why the family is so damned casual about some things and so intense about others i couldnt get an extension on my fellowship they were afraid that the war would so change things that any material i gathered would have no value or so they said i wrote to a couple of hollywood writers id corresponded with they didnt reply fawcetts was willing to give me a try at studio gush and gossip but the hays office wouldnt accredit me there were too many writers only halfliving in hollywood already in the end i went out to the aircraft factory hoping they wouldnt hire me and wondering what id do if they didnt and thats about all its hard to say how i feel about the place id like to be disinterested but i cant and hold my job and as jobs go its no worse than any would be that i had to hold its just something to endure something to live through numb yet painfully aware of what is going on around me its like well ill try to give you an example three months after mack was born a doctor acquaintance of mine performed a vasectomy on me it was around christmas and the only payment he exacted was ten fingers out of a quart of rye in advance yes i think he must have served an apprenticeship at cutting out baseball covers because i was going around in a sling for weeks afterward but what i started to say was to strike a parallel with my job it drove me nuts without actually hurting at all i was so shot full of local that he could have trimmed out my appendix without hurting me but that snipping and slicing finally got me so bad that i raised up and whanged the hell out of him and he had to sit on my chest to finish the plant in this my fourth week is beginning to make a little sense there is still a great deal that confuses me but i am getting a vague idea of what its all about i should have sooner but for my timidity on the day i took over grosss job moon remembered his promise to show me around we went down to the drophammer department first and watched the manifolds and other castings being pounded out they are as large as a small room some of these hammers and when they are dropped the concrete floor shakes for hundreds of feet around the men are the huskiest ive seen and you can see just about all of them because theyre practically naked their bodies and particularly their arms are covered with scars from the splattering metal and from cleaning out the hot pots i didnt think that was as it should be there are very few things with which i cant find something wrong i suggested to moon that it would be better if they bundled themselves against the heat and other hazards of their work as cooks do he replied these men have been working this way a long time and they probably know whats best we only looked through the door of the plannishing department and that was enough to give me a headache for the rest of the morning here the castings are run back and forth through a series of rapidly moving hammers until they are beaten smooth and the noise is too frightful to describe it has no cadence you cant accustom yourself to it every one of the hundreds of thousands of blows of the hammers rips right through you through a side door leading into the yard i noticed several men wandering idly around massaging their ears and heads smoking but not talking some of the plannishing boys said moon they get a rest period every halfhour or so have to have it or theyd go nuts i suppose they get pretty good money i said not so much theyre here because they cant get out of it at least most of them are theyre put in here not knowing what plannishing means and pretty soon they begin to build up seniority so they hang on hoping theyll get a break and be transferred to some other department if the company gives you a transfer you know you dont lose your seniority but if you demand it they can start you in in a new department at a beginners rate thats pretty hard to take when youve been in a department four months you draw twelve and a half cents an hour above the minimum a dollar a day more a man with a family is going to do a lot of thinking before he gives that up but most of these fellows are just kids i said theyre not old enough to have families i should think moon gave me one of his solemn looks which someway have the effect of making me feel even more the idiot than i am ever hear of the draft act dilly yes of course i have well where do you think these young fellows would be if the company didnt want to have them deferred well i didnt have any suggestions that time we went out to the carpenter shop where the wing spars are made and then we came back inside and started up the sheetmetal forming line its called a line but its actually four each about fifty yards long each line consists of possibly a hundred benches and workmen practically every operation is done with handtools at the beginning of the line is a metalcrimping machine from which the parts come in rough form from this they go from bench to bench each man doing his particular little task until the last bench is reached there the moveboys pick them up and trundle them off to the paint and dope shops that is as far as i got in fact i didnt get quite that far i progressed only far enough to reach certain conclusions midway in an explanation of one of the processes moon abruptly excused himself and hurried off and in something less than five minutes a company guard had me by the elbow and asked me what i was doing im a new man i said my leadman has been showing me around who is your leadman i told him whered he go to i dont know lets take a look at your identification card i gave him my card and he studied it carefully looking now and then from it to me rather reluctantly i thought he handed it back i guess its all right he said but dont waste any time were all here to work i went on by myself and the fifteen minutes or so i spent wandering around before i returned to the stockroom were of course absolutely wasted i didnt take time to see very much and what i did see meant nothing i was that badly frightened i naturally told moon id made out all right i didnt dare risk another interview with a guard so as i say ive had to pick up little by little what i should have known at the start only a relatively small number of the parts which i saw being made that day reach us hundreds of them come through as parts of assemblies others are being made for other plants for instance we make manifolds for several factories we have the men and equipment to make them with and they dont for the same reason we have to buy stuff from them no aircraft factory is selfsufficient the items which we sell or buy vary from day to day depending upon the availability of labor equipment and materials i have in all four types of parts to keep record on assembly subassembly and regular assemblyline issue the fourth consists of parts such as cowling and firewalls which because they are bulky and difficult to handle go direct to the assembly line a fact which does not excuse us from keeping track of them when a plane reaches a certain stage it has a definite number of parts we i am supposed to know what those parts are regardless of whether i have seen them and to show them as having been issued there is something screwy about this when i think of what it is i will tell moon about it i am also going to find out why we are constantly short on some parts and invariably long on others we issue or try to issue parts in units of twentyfive not twentyfive pieces of each part but enough for twentyfive planes a flap requires only one nosecover but it uses sixteen ribs of a certain type so the unit number on the nosecover is but it is on the rib the release books are at first glance the ultimate in simplicity the first which is our major concern since we have not yet completed twentyfive planes consists of twelve billsofmaterial one for each station on the left side of the bill is the part number its description and the unit number on the right oppositc each number are twentyfive squares when a part is received say fortyeight pieces of l which has a unit number of six i draw a wavy line through eight of the squares opposite that number when the fortyeight pieces are issued i merely block the squares in but instead of getting fortyeight pieces i may get fortynine then i must carry my wavy line through eight and onesixth squares and they are extremely tiny if six were the maximum unit number i might stay somewhere near straight as far as this particular difficulty is concerned but the unit number on some parts runs up to one hundred and sixtyfour and theres no way on gods green earth of splitting the squares that fine i told moon about it and a lot of good that did well he said feeling in his pocket for an apple a few pieces like that dont make much difference dilly just do the best you can but its not just a few pieces i said youve got seven releases seven hundred and fifty ships or a total of thirty bills of material for each assembly station by the time you multiply even a very small error by thirty youre going to be in one hell of a mess well he said again what do you want to do about it i didnt know im just trying to explain why the records are off i said i just didnt want you to think it was my fault he climbed up on my stool on his knees and hurled the apple core over the fence and far down the line above the whine of unishears and the hoophoop of the rivet guns there rose a yell well as long as its only a few pieces dilly but moon i just got through saying we dont care he sauntered off that was in my third week here and this is the end of my first month and im beginning to catch on to things better but it seems like the more i understand the less i know the more trouble i find the design for our plane hasnt been frozen yet engineering changes are being made every day almost every hour and theyre completely balling up our records system which is static in design were getting through dozens of parts that arent on the bills of material some of them are effective on the first plane some on the tenth and so on and i dont know how the hell to show the things i dont know whether theyre replacing other parts or whether theyre outright additions moon says if theyre not on the bills of material why to hell with them and i have let a lot of them slip but that isnt going to do the stockroom is getting filled with parts that we have no record on and consequently when we make our issues were not throwing them out this is going to mean only one thing in the end the government will reject the planes because they do not meet specifications and a certain stockroom bookkeeper is going to be on the spot and still that isnt all when a part is replaced or supplemented by another the unit number on the original part is naturally changed for example where at one time seventyfive pieces of a part were required to complete twentyfive ships we may now use only fifty but but what in the hell are you going to do when your records show that youve already issued more than enough of the first part for twentyfive planes where are you going to put the supplementary or additional parts i can see where the difficulty is the fact that we have issued parts for twentyfive planes doesnt necessarily mean that the assembly station has put them to productive use theyve been ruined or rejected by inspection knowing this however doesnt help i talked to moon about it well what do you want to do about it dilly the office must keep a record on scrapped and rejected parts i want to see it they dont know anything up there the only way they know about scrapped parts is when they start runfling short and you cant prove theyve been scrapped then the guys out in final will say that our records are wrong that they never got the parts but the office would know by checking on raw stores moon shook his head complacently no they wouldnt dilly youve got experimental and testing to reckon with and then were swapping and lending stuff all the time to other plants up in purchased parts this morning i noticed we had an invoice for forty staticground tailwheel tires we paid for em and we received em but we dont have them on hand and final assembly doesnt have them god knows where they are if i could just get a report on rejections then wouldnt do any good when a part is rejected it goes to the chief inspector if he rejects it it goes back to the department responsible for the flaws they let it lay around a while and then if it cant be reworked and sent back to final they scrap it and send the rejection tag up to the office or maybe if rejections have been running heavy against them they throw it away anyway you look at it though we dont learn about the rejection for weeks and its too late then to help us i didnt say anything but i guess i looked a lot dont let it get you down dilly said moon youre doing all right as well as could be expected so thats the way things are or were for theyre getting worse by the moment i cant say that im bored any more i dont say that the work is beneath me it would take a genius to work his way out of this mess i dont know what in the name of god to do ive been cutting down on the liquor at night so that my head will be clear but it makes me so restless and sleepless that im not sure its a good idea ive tried to talk to roberta about it and mom and frankie but theyre no help some of robertas old prophecies are coming true and shes more interested in seeing me repent than anything else anyway she doesnt know anything mom says i worry too much and frankie says they really cant pin anything on me if it comes to a showdown and just to tell em all to go jump in the lake jo for one has made a sensible suggestion she says i ought to get some books on accounting but i dont know im afraid it would take me so long to learn anything that it would be too late to help and anyway ive got to write at night i told mom i would and i cant let her down shes already making over her old suit to go back and see pop in i dont know what shell do after she sees him but the hell the bad part about it is that i cant quit there was a young fellow over in one of the other plants who had a grudge against his foreman he thought a good way of getting even would be to change the labels on a number of the parts cribs he did it and then he quit and three months later the fbi picked him up on the east coast i dont think theyll be too hard on him because he comes from a good republican family and his fathers a legionnaire but me oh good god almighty the stuff ive written my friends and associates the car i came out here in if i mess things up or if things get messed up where i am whatll it look like dont tell me ive studied and ive thought and ive worn a path in the concrete sidewalk around our house from walking at night and still i dont know what to do jesus i dont know if i could just calm down if i could just do that and i have tried and you see how it turns out i used to work as a postingclerk for a seed and nursery company when our books wouldnt balance wed start copying from one ledger into another until when we reached our mistake our pencils warned us of it and ive tried to do much the same thing here without anticipating any problem ive tried to and its no go ive just wound up as usual too rattled to know my head from my hatband youre probably wondering about gross so am i all i can say is hes been a lot more decent on the surface than i would have been in the same circumstances and that i feel tremendously sorry for him when i left the plant today saturday he said that he had to go to town anyway and that if i wanted him to hed drive me home i accepted i wouldnt have if moon had been around because im pretty sure that anyone who is friendly with gross wont be with moon but moon had already gone on the way gross said im glad you took over the books i wanted moon to let me off of them glad i could help you out i said they are pretty much of a headache havent got them straightened out yet huh no i thought moon said you were an a bookkeeper i didnt say anything i guess you think i dont know how to keep books i suppose you told moon you couldnt fix up the books because i made so many mistakes i havent discussed you with moon i said if you want to let me out ill walk the rest of the way no you wont either he said i was just talking when we reached the house i thanked him and started to get out wait a minute he said i want to show you something while i watched he took an old envelope and a fountain pen from his pocket and after several preliminary gyrations of his hand executed a picture of a bird with one flourish can you do that he asked i admitted that i couldnt well keep that then he said regally and tossed it into my lap of course i had to ask him to autograph it and ill be damned if he didnt do it my fifth week more accurately the beginning of the sixth things at the plant are in a worse tangle than ever ive got a raise shannon has been very sick theres not much use talking about the first item the raise i got last friday i was working away at the books for dear life i mean that literally when moon and a little fellow id seen wandering around the plant but had never paid much attention to came up to my desk dilly said moon mr dolling wants to talk to you mr dolling is the superintendent of all the stockrooms there wasnt the slightest change in his voice or expression im positive he was as lackadaisical and phlegmatic as always and yet somehow i sensed a sneer and i think dolling sensed it also dolling is barely five feet tall potbellied sandy of hair and he has a voice that would awaken any dead who werent completely decomposed there is a rumor that he owns a big slice of stock in the company but i dont know whether its true he looked at moon sharply all right thank you moon said dont mention it and walked away dolling turned back to me mr moon he said in his rodeoannouncers voice tells me that you are a very conscientious worker well thank you i said ive noticed a small improvement in things myself he continued bellying up to the desk so that he was at my side instead of facing me did you understand the conditions under which you went to work here why i dont know exactly what you mean i said i believe i understood them according to company policy a longestablished policy any man who passes our thirtyday probationary period is entitled to a fourcent raise we state this very clearly in the company rule book but we dont run this company any more the union runs it they gave us a contract and we signed it with a gun at our heads and the contract the union contract mind you not ours specifies that any man who has worked here sixty days and is not drawing fiftyeight cents an hour is entitled to demand a raise to that amount it says nothing whatever about raising you to fiftyfour cents after thirty days now i have nothing against the union whatsoever if a man in this company wants to join the union i will not persuade him to do otherwise i definitely will not say and i am not saying anything against the union understand of course i said im just explaining our position before it was our policy to raise all approved probationers to fiftyfour cents now since the union doesnt care why should we i suppose you shouldnt i said but moon tells me youre a good man he said and paused for confirmation thank you and i must say that in this case i believe moon is right pause thank you sir you seem to be the type of man we like to have around industrious pause yes sir sober yes sir conservative yyes ssir so we are raising you to fiftyfour cents an hour effective this pay period thats all he paced away hands folded behind his back when moon showed up again i started to tell him about the raise but hed already heard about it he said i was just down in plannishing he said i didnt have any trouble hearing while he was talking to you well four cents an hour isnt much only a couple of dollars extra on the week but it did make me feel kind of good and i suppose the folks saw how i felt and they didnt kid me about it even when i invited it by kidding myself everyone said that the company must think a lot of me to make an exception like that after a good deal of very friendly debate we decided to spend the extra two on a sunday dinner with me planning and preparing the menu i can cook you know i mean i did it many years ago for a living i started for the store and shannon asked me if she could go along and of course i said she couldnt because i was afraid she might start something i should have known that there was something wrong with her or she wouldnt have asked shedve just gone but i didnt think and surprisingly enough she didnt come anyway she just got up and went back into the bedroom and closed the door she wasnt around at supper time but we didnt think anything of it shes in the habit of keeping her own hours but along about eight oclock we began to get worried and we started looking for her i wont tell you where all we looked i even went clear down to the bay to make it short i found her in the closet in our bedroom id gone in there to get a jacket because it was getting kind of cool and when i lifted it off the hook i knocked some dresses down and i saw shannon she was way back in the corner sitting on the floor shed got frankies manicure set and some lipstick and other cosmetics and she was a sight oh my god i said now what will your mother say dont you know weve been looking all over the country for you cant you ever behave yourself come on out of there she got up and held out her hands and like a damned fool i didnt understand now dont daub that stuff all over my pants for christs sake come on out and wash yourself and eat something if you want it and go to bed dont you think my hands are pretty daddy she said and then i began to catch on but at that moment roberta came up she let out a wild shriek shannon look at your dress and youve got that stuff all over my suede shoes and she grabbed her and began to slap her and shannon didnt fight back and then she roberta began to understand and she got down on her knees and hugged and kissed her of course youre pretty youre the prettiest girl in this whole wide world wasnt that nice of her daddy to make herself so pretty for us just think all this time she was bback we were all crying even jo and mack we were all thinking a little girl a fouryear old back in that dark closet for four hours a little girl who had never been wanted and who i realize now knew that she had never been wanted trying to make herself wanted fighting at the last ditch with a weapon she had always scorned to use trying to make herself pretty i thought of her fierceness how with the animals desperate impulse for survival she had struggled against neglect and slight the tantrums she had thrown to secure a new dress or a warm coat her swiftness in striking before she could be struck her dogged determination to have the food she desired and needed yes and her wakefulness the fear of attack in her sleep and i thought of how during those four years that she had been with us she must have wept in her heart even as she fought and screamed the loneliness that must have been hers the fear and dread and i thought why did it have to be this way and as with everything else i could find no answer i was a dollaramonth editor on the writers project that year and pop was losing his mind and i didnt know it he came to me with a proposition a lease deal and it looked good and i borrowed dollars to swing it pop could never give a coherent explanation of where the money went but it did go never more to return and i had fifty dollars a month to pay back out of my salary our rent was forty dollars you can see how it was one night i found roberta in a faint on the bathroom floor a swollen twist of slipperyelm bark protruding from her and i thought she would be pulled apart before we could remove it but shannon the bubble the egg whatever you want to call it held firm we went to see a woman down in southtown she took fifteen dollars from us and prodded and poked roberta with something that looked like a bicycle pump she poked and pulled and pushed for more than an hour and roberta bled and fainted and writhed with the knowledge of the damnation that was to be hers and shannon fought again and won she fought the sitz baths the cotton root and ergot the quinine she fought the jolts that came from roberta jumping off the divan from climbing stairs from hanging up clothes no im not being romantic she did fight you could feel her indomitability feel it and hate it as you would hate a drowning person who threw his arms around your neck then the doctor said it looked like she would be a christmas baby yes sir it did and finally as the days passed he became sure of it and roberta and i became ashamed of ourselves and silently we prayed to shannon for forgiveness it would be all right now we wouldnt starve we could pay the doctor and the hospital wed always wanted her we said it was just that we didnt see how we could now it would be all right i should explain that christmas babies in our town were sort of municipal property all the banks and loan sharks made up cash purses the stores donated clothing and furniture and food you got a years supply of milk and ice and stuff like that for nothing you got well you got just about everything you know they probably do things the same way all over the country at eleven oclock on christmas eve i was sitting at robertas bedside in the hospital the local florists had got wind of what was up and flowers were already beginning to arrive there was candy too and a big cake from one of the bakeries with happy birthday xmas babe spelled out on the icing even some reporters had been there to interview roberta and snap her picture for the morning papers of course the doctor was there pacing back and forth and gloating over all the free publicity he was going to get and asking the little lady how she felt she felt fine not too good understand but good enough she felt in short like she was going to have the baby on christmas day maybe it was the excitement maybe shannon distrusting us sensed our will and rebelled against it but at eleventhirty robertas lips stiffened and she groaned the doctor wasnt alarmed it wasnt a real bearingdown pain he was sure that she groaned again her stomach revolved like a football being rolled inside a sweater she clutched herself and the involuntary spasms of her stomach rocked her back and forth i wont she screamed i wont i wont i wont they wheeled her out to the delivery room the doctor pathetically tagging along behind the nurses and the closing door cut off robertas hatefilled and outraged protests shannon was born at twelve minutes of twelve i cannot say that we were cruel to her roberta may sometimes have neglected to heat her milk or change her diapers but roberta was sick a great deal i may have smoked too much too close to her and kept her awake with my typewriter but i was trying to write a novel the advances on which were necessary for our existence i suppose that the worst i can say is that our kindness and attention were deliberate we had to think about doing things for her occasionally conscience stricken wed smother her with gifts and caresses but we always had to think we never did it automatically and to shannon i guess it seemed a long time between thoughts our spasmodic fits of affection upset her and she learned to fight against them she distrusted us so she ordered her own life and all things considered i think she did well there was a summer evening when she was about two when we were all sitting out on the lawn of our home shannon suddenly announced that she had to go to the toilet roberta declared that she didnt shes just trying to make me get up jimmie she said i never sit down for a minute that she doesnt think of something have to go said shannon well do it in your pants then said roberta hurt bottom said shannon you take me daddy i started to get up but roberta said no dont you give in to her now jimmie so i sat back down again you dont really have to go baby wait a minute and youll get over it have to go she repeated go by yourself then snapped roberta all i hope is that a big bitey gets you shannon looked toward the dark house and her knees shook a little and then her head went back and she marched up the steps and through the door she was still gone after fifteen minutes so i went in and there she was sitting on the stool and grinning toothiessly to herself and she had had to go there was no doubting that stink the biteys she said stinkem to def fighting fighting shortly before she was three we took a house adjacent to one of the parks one day when i was escorting her and jo there we saw an old man approaching and jo shrank behind me that man she whimpered he said he was going to cut my ears off oh he was just joking i laughed youre not afraid are you shannon uhuh said shannon i fix him she was carrying an enormous rag doll with a china head before i could stop her she was down the sidewalk had drawn the doll back over her shoulder and had hurled it with all her astonishing energy straight into the old mans solar plexus im not exaggerating when i say it almost killed him you couldnt scare her by the mention of policemen the mere fact that we told her they would get her for her misdeeds was proof to her that they were vulnerable it got so bad that we couldnt take her downtown at the sight of a cop she was off fists flying mouth open to bite and slash and even at two and three she could inflict serious damage we were warned officially more than once that if we didnt do something about her it would be just too bad she wasnt afraid of well she just wasnt afraid in her lonely friendless world she had survived the horror of not being wanted and she knew there was nothing worse to fear we tried we tried very hard to make things up to her remembering we would buy her some trinket or article of clothing that jo actually deserved but with the coming of mack with his square shoulders and low chuckle it was harder to remember and shannon made overtures which we seldom understood like the time she washed robertas bedspread in the toilet or well like the other night when she brought me that nickel to buy whisky with after the sound and fury had died roberta might say but why didnt you ask mother and daddy first and shannon not knowing how to translate the whisper of her instincts not knowing how to say that she did not ask us because she did not think we knew would stand mute grinning or glaring furious and amused and sick but never defeated ready to fight until the last tick of her tiny heart she wouldnt eat any supper that night she kept saying that she was tired and she wanted me to hold her she didnt seem to have any fever but after a while she began to complain about being hot so i picked her up she weighs almost nothing and walked outside with her i carried her over to the park then down to the bay her fingers twined in my jacket her great blue eyes reflecting the stars and when i wanted to sit down on one of the pilings she still fussed that she was hot look baby i said daddys hot too how about going home and getting a bottle of beer and well sit out on the steps together she deliberated a moment staring blankly at me go to my store she said oh now baby i said not tonight daddys you go to my store she said you hear my store my store my all right all right i said just dont get excited well go were going right now so we went and i will never be happier or more sad over an act of mine it had never occurred to me i suppose that shannon would be welcome any place but here she was more than welcome the carhop girl who had been slouching in front of the place seemed to come alive when she saw her she came rushing over and wanted to take shannon out of my arms but shannon wouldnt go so she contented herself with pinching her cheeks and running her redfingernailed hands through her hair hows my brat tonight she cooed wanta fight me brat huh wanta fight alice she went inside with us and called to the soda jerker hey ray heres our brat draw us a tall carbolic and arsenic without ice now dont you call shannon a brat admonished ray shannons my sweetheart were going to get married arent we shannon and before shannon could do anything more than grin wisely the proprietor was there seating us and saying no shannon couldnt get married because she had to work for him he introduced himself and i said rather embarrassed that i hoped shannon hadnt given him too much trouble trouble he appeared astonished then he laughed well we did have a painful few days before we learned how to take her she came in here and demanded some chewing gum and she raised so much well we finally had to give it to her and the next day it was the same old story and the next it was cheaper to give her the coke or the candy or whatever she wanted than it was to argue about it after wed paid our toll she still wouldnt leave but she was quiet shed go over there to the magazine rack and fuss around and we all thought she was looking at the comics and then ray noticed it wasnt ray it was me said the carhop well then alice alice noticed that shannon was arranging the magazines shed looked all around and decided that was what needed doing worst so by george shed taken on the job and a darned good job she was doing too i can she read i dont know i think she must be able to i dont see how she could remember the looks of things well enough to do what she does why ive got almost magazines and periodicals there mr dillon and shannon knows them all she never makes a mistake shell come over here in the morning and open up twenty or thirty bundles and rack every one in the right place he laughed and slapped his knee oh shannons worth her weight in gold these highschool jellybeans that used to come in and buy a coke and thumb through the magazines for half a day dont hang around any more shannons got them all spotted shell give em about five minutes and then i want some beer said shannon now baby i said how about a nice ice cream beer of course she has drunk beer we have it around the house and theres no way of stopping her but out in public like that the druggist felt her pulse and laid a hand over her heart his eyebrows went up if you dont mind a little beer might help her she needs to sleep they brought a fresh bottle shannon wouldnt take mine she lay back in my arms nursing it sipping daintily and licking at the foam yessir shannons a great girl i only wish she was mine said the druggist and i didnt say anything but i thought i thought well why couldnt you have had her why couldnt you instead of us or why couldnt we have had your security so that we could have wanted her as you want her for oh christ as she lies here in my arms exhausted but afraid to sleep living on hatred even the thought that we did not want to want her makes me feel a criminal and i am not and roberta is not we wanted jo and we wanted shannon and we wanted mack six in all we had dreamed of and a big white house with a deep lawn and many bedrooms and a pantry that was always full we wanted them but we wanted that too not for ourselves but for them we wanted it because we knew what it would mean if we didnt have it i knew how i was and roberta knew how she was and we knew how it would be as it had been with us we did want her goddammit i say we did we want her now i was crazy to say that we didnt or hadnt but we are getting tired and we are so cramped and there are so many things to be done why i ask why is it like this not for roberta not for myself but for all of us why karl and what will you do about it not twenty years from now when shannon and all the other shannons have bred and a plague spreads across the land and brother slays brother not then when it is too late but now and you god what have you to offer sweet music pie in the sky yes but on earth now and on earth yes sir said the druggist a great girl you should be very proud of her i am proud i said i did not know just how proud i was or how much i loved her until tonight the bottle slipped from shannons hands and crashed to the floor her head fell back against my arm and a tremor ran through her fragile body and then she was asleep and try as i will i cannot describe the beauty of her smile that was last saturday and shannon has been sick all week weve had the doctor twice and i dont know how in the hell were going to pay him but about all he could tell us was that shannon was overwrought and undernourished we are supposed to keep her quiet and we have some vitamin tablets to give her and thats about all we can do we have been very quiet all of us for a week now weve not had a single brawl but it doesnt seem to help much shannon is getting more listless every day she sits for hours looking off into space and she seems to be listening for something and every once in a while she will get up and prowl around the house looking i dont know for what weve offered her everything we could think of and tried to find out what the trouble was but it doesnt do any good if we talk to her too much she begins to cry and it is terrible when she cries jo has no sympathy for her she has the idea apparently that shannon is putting on and she gets pretty sarcastic but mack seems to know what it is all about he is becoming as silent and distraught as she and he seldom leaves her for more than a few minutes when she sits he sits as close as he can get to her and when she starts looking he looks with her it is an eerie thing to see these two tots wandering from room to room eyes vacant hands tightly clasped roberta says if it doesnt stop pretty soon she wont be able to stand it but she is so afraid i think she will hold in a while longer were being as quiet as we know how i said that already i know but we dont know of anything else to do and it is a comfort to know to keep thinking that we are doing something but shannon isnt any better and the thing is getting ahold of mack ive stopped using the typewriter ive stopped drinking almost we dont even keep a light on after nine oclock but well yesterday we had a letter from marge ill give you the letter itll explain about pop and marge too dear mama frankie jimmie roberta kids thought id better drop you a line before you thought i was dead tell roberta i will write her a long letter just as soon as i get around to it mrs pinny was here you remember her she always wore that footie little green hat that made her look like one of robin hoods men and she stayed and she stayed and walter came home and he was so unreasonable about everything as if it was my fault that she came in and i hadnt got supper anyway he came home early and i was terribly upset i dont know what makes him act like that you know hes superintendent of all the stores here now and he had a nice raise and he should be feeling awful good but hes just as cranky as some old bear i told him he was simply going to have to snap out of it or i was utterly through with him he never takes me to a dance or anything and everyones talking about it the other night he brought a boy home from one of the stores his name is johnnie and hes real tall and has dark hair and hes a marvelous dancer i tried to get walter to dance with me but he said he was too tired so johnnie did after while walter wanted to go to bed and he said it would be all right for johnnie and me to go out and dance some place johnnie kind of hung back but walter insisted and we finally went hes a marvelous dancer he said he was going to come back again tonight and if he doesnt im going to make walter call him up he had kind of a hard time with pop last night and he was pretty mad about it but i told him it would just do him good to think about someone but himself for a change and it will i guess if i can look after pop all day he can do it for a few hours at night i told you that id gone and got pop didnt i im sure i did as soon as i received your last letter i got out the car my car i mean walter has a new pontiac coupe he uses himself and i went right up there and got him mama i dont think there is anything wrong with pop i charged a new suit of clothes for him and got him fixed up a little and he looks just like he always did now pops not a bit of trouble mama and were delighted to have him but i think youd better write him a long letter about certain things i dont want to hurt his feelings but you could do it i think you ought to tell him to go to church and read the bible because they have got him in the habit of swearing a lot at that place he was in i dont mind myself a bit but walter is always bringing someone home to dinner and i think it makes him mad to have pop swearing so much i told him that pop never used to swear and that it was just that place he had been in but he simply refuses to understand i wish you would tell pop about using the bathroom too mama i cant get him to do it i guess he got so much in the habit of being out in the country when he was drilling oil wells that he doesnt think about other people being around i dont think he sees very well either he usually goes out on the porch and does it or if he has toif he has to do something besides pee he uses the shrubs in the front yard the other day i got out in the yard and stood a few feet away from him and waved my hands so that he could see that i could see him but he kept right on i think the whole trouble is that pop is just forgetful now mama when you write him dont let on that i said anything and dont say anything that will hurt his feelings hes very sensitive just tell him to be sure and use the toilet theres one right next to the telephone downstairs and theres another one upstairs right off the south bedroom i believe that if you can make pop understand that hes supposed to use them he will do so id talk to him but its been so long since i was around him much that i hardly know how to any more im sending you a box of stuff nothing much but i hope you can use it they got in some imported canadian hams at the no i store the other day and you ought to eat more meat mama so i got one also put in some cigarettes and candy and other stuff because the box was too big and i had to fill it up anyway well walter just called and said he couldnt come home so i guess i wont get to go out after all i dont know why he does things like that i think ill just have johnnie come over here anyway and pop can watch us because he enjoys music and dancing as much as anyone else now write soon mama and you too frankie and jimmie i wont ask roberta to write because i still owe her a letter but i am going to write real soon would have before this but it seems like i just cant get anything done love marge ps dont bother to write pop he doesnt seem to be able to read any more when i finished that letter i said mom is that girl completely crazy whats the matter with marge asked mom beginning to bristle it looks to me like shes doing all right shes taking care of pop shes always been good to us shes the only member i can think of offhand that ever remembered my birthday i remembered it mom said roberta a good many times it always worked out though that we had some old note or something to pay off at the same time but look mom i said you know walter isnt going to put up with this the last time i saw him he was getting pretty fed up and pop wasnt around then i guess marge can handle him said mom frankie when she came home saw things my way jimmies right mom youd better write her to take pop back they dont want him back theyll have to take him anyway theyve got to keep him a little while until we can make some arrangements what arrangements i dont know of any well until jimmie sells a story and when will that be hes not written a line all week now christ almighty i said why throw that up to me you know why i havent written what do you want me to do sit out in the gutter and type keep your voice down said roberta sharply well what do you want me to do i repeated nothing said mom absolutely nothing but dont get in the way of people who are doing something she got up and plodded out and frankie told me not to pay any attention to her she was just upset i was pretty hurt marge to the best of my knowledge never contributed a dime of cash money to the family in her life but through her faculty for remembering mothers day and her habit of waking you up in the middle of the night to ask if youre sleeping well she seems to be in moms eyes the trunk of the tree mind im not jealous of marge although she always got the best of everything when it was available long after pop had more money than he knew what to do with i carried a paper route and worked for western union and caddied because pop thought that a job any kind of a lousy goddamned job gave character to a boy and while i was doing that marge was taking lessons on the violin at rates up to thirtyfive dollars an hour and she hated the violin and i loved it i used to get her instrument out of its case and run the scales and saw out things like home sweet home and turkey in the straw and i guess it was pretty awful and pop would fidget and after while hed ask me if i didnt have some work to do or hed dismiss me with thats good now lets hear you play marge i wanted to be a violinist at least i wanted to get away from jobs where people snubbed and swore at you i wanted never to have to ask any one for money i wanted attention and admiration and the chance to express myself i started to write you could get a pencil and a piece of paper anywhere oddly enough i sold the first thing i wrote a sketch about a golf game but it was a very long time between that first story and the second and although i never gave up writing i kept at it largely from habit pop went broke and his was the irremediable brokeness of a man past fifty who has never worked for other people i had to distinguish myself and support the family at the same time and even at fifteen a highschool freshman i knew i wasnt going to do it by writing i got a job as a bellhop in the largest hotel in town they didnt want me because i was so tall they didnt have a uniform that would fit me but i kept going down standing around the lobby and looking wistful and i dug up an old pair of blue serge pants and had some braid sewed on them and finally when one of the night boys was careless enough to get himself arrested for pandering they put me on my hours were from ten at night until seven in the morning i went to high school from eightthirty until threethirty i didnt think i could do it at first i wasnt even sure that it was worth the effort you see i thought that a bellboy was supposed to carry icewater and baggage to the rooms and my first month i barely made expenses when i found out about the other things it made me a little sick but i didnt know what to do then any more than i do now i didnt see any other way out we needed money and this apparently was the only way of getting it i began to get mom wasnt very worldlywise and im pretty sure she really did not know how those thick rolls of ones and fives and tens were produced pop well pop knew and he came to despise me for it but he didnt do anything about it he didnt produce any money himself well i drank give the bellhop a drink was party etiquette in those prohibition days most of the stuff was poison but after a few drinks i began to forget my shame and my fear of exposure and arrest and i could concentrate on the allimportant business of making money i bolstered myself with other things also i bought society brand suits and twentydollar borsalinos and florsheim shoes and i bought a snappy dort coupe but nothing took the place of drink some of the boys they ranged up to fortyfive in age sniffed cocaine and i tried it several times but i always preferred liquor in my second year i was sick in bed for six weeks i was delirious most of the time and i burned and froze by turns the doctors called it malaria it was beyond their ken i guess that a sixteenyearold boy could be suffering from alcoholism the twentynine boom was building up then and it cost me a hundred dollars to buy my job back plus two dollars and a half a night to work and i had to go after the money harder than ever in my fourth year i broke down completely tuberculosis alcoholism nervous exhaustion marge was engaged to walter then and our home had to be maintained and im sure i have to be sure that the family didnt know how sick i was i struck out by myself i got drunk in mineral wells and lost the little money i had and i suppose i would have got a stiff jail sentence if they hadnt been afraid id die on them as it was im a little blank on a lot of things but i wound up eventually as a night watchman on a pipeline that was being built from iraan to the gulf on the night that my highschool class graduated i was seated on a generator far out on the texas plains and on the ground below me a huge rattlesnake listened raptly as i screamed and cursed and raved at him id never been particularly afraid of crawling things before but after that after those two years a roach or an ant made me cringe and if i was not on guard scream i had no rest from them you see while i tossed on my cot in camp during the day they were with me the ones that were worse than the real ones they ringed me in the rattlers the tarantulas the great blackandwhite tarantulas as large as saucers and with fur like rabbits the teninch centipedes the scorpions the vinegarroons and gilas i say they ringed me in everywhere i looked they were there at my head my sides and feet and then before i could leap over them always before i could leap over them the thing happened to me ten thousand times a dozen times in a day but i could never bring myself to leap until it was too late then then as i say another ring would come up to reinforce the first it would climb and slide and crawl on top of the first ring and then another ring would climb and crawl and slide on top of it and then there would be another and another and another and another another another oh christ they rose to the top of the cot they mounted higher and higher around me and as they mounted the rings drew in to form a sort of beehive drew in drew in and finally finally there was only a speck of light left and then the pile began to sag sag down i pleaded with them i told them funny stories i sang to them i pleaded and sang and told funny stories all at once and then they dropped down on me in a mass and their weight stopped my heart and i ceased to breathe whatta they keep that crazy bastard around for ahh hes a good kid i been through this myself come on slim snap out of it he needs a drink anyone gotta drink got a can of heat he can have well squeeze it out for him slim goddam yuh get this down your gullet huh huh dont yuh know its bad luck to die in a tent at night when i went out on the line they were still with me the real ones and the others and i could never be sure which was which i had thirty generators to oil gas and water a ditcher and a dragline so i needed to keep moving and i did not know when it was safe to walk through the things in front of me and when it was not sometimes most times my feet would melt through their bodies but sometimes a diamondshaped head would lash out at my eighteeninch boot or a great furry mass would leap straight toward my face and then i would stumble backwards run knocking over fuel cans tripping over pipe battering myself against the generators run and run and run until i could run no more good men were scarce in those days thats probably obvious i was getting fifty cents an hour for twelve hours seven days a week with only a dollar a day out for board and flop so i stayed on after i got well after homesickness was beginning to take the place of the other a hundred and fifty dollars a month clear to be sent home so i stayed after two years something more than two years a few days before thanksgiving we put the button on the job and i beat my way home i got there thanksgiving day the folks were over at marges for dinner and i was broke and there wasnt anything to eat in the house i got cleaned up and put on some other clothes an hour later i had bought back my job on the installment plan and was hopping bells again yes as the lawyers say im going to connect all this up ive laid the groundwork for it or am laying one for something else i worked at the hotel another year and a half and then the bug began to bite me again i had to lay off a lot frankie was thirteen that summer and big for her age and i got her a job slinging hash in the coffee shop but it worried me so much to see her walking around in her sleep to see her insulted and propositioned and bawled out that i made her quit after a few weeks so there we were we had to make a jump and we didnt know which way then one evening while i was killing time in the library i picked up a copy of the texas monthly and there on the title page was a line oil field vignettes by james dillon i had written that story almost a year before one bitter night down on the pecos written it by lanternlight with the sleet beating down against the nickel tablet and my hands swathed in mittens and i had sent it to town with the provision truck and promptly forgotten about it i called on the editor and we spent a whole afternoon talking it was that kind of magazine he couldnt pay me in money but he had a lot of advice to offer chiefly to the effect that i had better get myself some more schooling how weeli he just might be able to help me there his alma mater was nebraska he had a great many friends on the faculty if he could arrange a loan for the tuition i told pop about it that night i wanted to hurt him i guess all i did was to prove something that i had always known down in my heart that i was small and he was big youll go of course he said dont let anything stop you go but what about about you ill get by i wouldnt want to live anyway if i thought id made you miss a chance like this and mom and frankie well mom had a sister in nebraska she and frankie could stay with her a while i didnt want her to because i remembered what that sister was like but but the decision was taken out of our hands i learned one morning that i had sold a quart of whisky to a federal man one of those singular prohibition agents who couldnt be bought off a warrant was being drawn for my arrest we were on our way out of town by noon destination nebraska now to connect up i think ive explained or partially explained a number of things how i came to be in nebraska and thus had the opportunity to meet roberta why i was with her as i was why i am like i am and why roberta is like she is perforce why in a way we have had such a completely messy existence why i we are in a mess now and why we will not get out of it unless it is to get into something worse i havent said anything about marge that is the only way i can say anything about her to say nothing as far back as i can remember not quite but almost marge was blinding herself to facts which she did not care to recognize and at twelve when the familys fortunes took a turn for the better it was as if her mind had been swept free of what misery and poverty she had known before swept free for that matter of everything else a mean thing to say but largely true she had brights disease she was an invalid for a couple years it interrupted her schooling she forgot things that she was never able to remember i shouldnt feel toward her as i do because i recall with terrifying clarity how the disease was brought on but to use an oilfield phrase id as soon be smothered with dung as wild honey when i last saw her a couple of years ago i was never sure whether i wanted to pat her head or wring her neck now im afraid the pull will all be in one direction shes incapable of doing anything useful she has no idea of the value of time or money and and she insists on telling everyone shes three years younger than i am if she breaks up with walter i dont know what well do because shell come here of course ill ask her to come ill insist upon it because shes my sister and i love her but i dont know how well put up with it mom will spend threefourths of her time cooking special dishes for her and the other fourth working over her clothes and roberta will be mad boiling mad and jealous from one week to the next see here james dillon if you think for a minute im going to do without just so your sister i dont even want to think about it therell be turkish cigarettes everywhere you turn the bathroom sink will be full of henna always therell be fudge in the ashtrays and lipstick on the drinking glasses and movingpicture magazines from hell to breakfast ill never be able to write or read the house will be filled constantly with the handsomest fellow and the most refined man and the phone will ring unceasingly and the doorbell likewise and always always in that timid halfhesitant drawl of hers marge will give us her views her advice on everything from intercourse to the international situation well maybe pop is better after all its been almost eight months since we saw him but i dont think so things just dont work out that way for us as soon as we straighten out one problem were faced with another i sometimes wonder if we wouldnt do just as well if we simply sat back and did nothing i tried to discuss this with mom the other night mom i said what do you suppose would have happened back there when i was fifteen if i hadnt gone to work as a bellhop what would we all have done well you know how i always felt about that she said i knew it wasnt the right thing for a growing boy to be out all night i didnt want you to do it dont you remember how i used to fuss at pop and now dont get on your high horse i said good god mom cant we talk to each other any more i guess i know what you mean said mom i used to wonder the same thing i dont think we should though when i think of how i used to take you kids to a fivecent movie and sit in it all day to save fuel and of how we skimped on food do you remember the games we used to play id break up the bread on your plates at breakfast and pour coffee over it and each piece would be a fish and wed be big sharks ourselves and then at noon the bread and gravy would be cars and our mouths would turn into tunnels i laughed yeah and where were we living when you chased down the alley that day and got those two roadworkers for boarders i remember marge and i had a pet chicken named dickie and how we bawled when you took it to the store and swapped it for fifty cents worth of groceries to give these guys their first meal with yes and then pop came home and he never noticed anything and he could talk with his mouth full our boarders didnt get anything but their coffee they never came back we sat looking at the floor not wanting to meet each others eyes mom got up i guess it had to be done she said im going to fix myself a cup of tea and go to bed i think i ought to be entitled to a cup of tea at least i jumped up and followed her out into the kitchen sure it had to be done i said it does make sense it has to why if it didnt jimmie yes mom dont be like pop was dont always be looking for an excuse to run away from your obligations but mom if it didnt make any difference if everyone got along just as well better got along how by doing without food and clothes by living with relatives and sponging off the neighbors you mustnt even think about it jimmie im making a little progress at the plant i dont mean by that that the books are in anything like good order but i am beginning to see daylight you remember that i mentioned certain parts which we never saw and yet were required to keep a record on and that something seemed to be wrong with this if i could only think of what it was well it finally came to me and as a consequence ive got about fifty less parts to deal with if we know say that a fuselage must be equipped with a firewall before it reaches motorpreparation what reason is there for keeping a record on firewalls absolutely none you can forget about them then ive got moon to get the chief dispatcher to issue an order that all parts must clear the other stockrooms subassembly sheetmetal and so on before they touch us this will or should stop parts that dont belong in our stockroom from getting there at least if any do get to us we can lay the blame on the other stockrooms finally at my insistence moon has put murphy to taking inventory along the assembly line and as he finds out what they have out there i am able to solve many of the tangles that had been baffling me vail was supposed to have taken the inventory because he has more time to spare than murphy but he declared that busken couldnt take care of the purchased end of things by himself so murphy got stuck he didnt like it very well he and vail are barely speaking but i dont see that thats my fault i have never worked in a place where it was assumed that i knew so much more than i actually did now moon and murphy yes and gross knew that a new part would be integrated in one ship before we received a quantity order of it and i suppose common sense should have told me as much all i had to do was to take the part and go up and down the assembly lines until i found a ship that had a part to match it the part would be effective from that shipnumber on everyone knew this but me and so sure were they that i knew it that they could not understand my fretting over the effectivenumbers of new parts or perhaps they thought it would do me good to find out such things for myself every man is pretty much on his own here every man has just a little bit more to do than he can get done in eight hours and theres no time to help another man even if you want to you may give a fellowworker a handup or a quick word of advice but if hes slow to take either you keep right on going you have to ive received much more assistance and cooperation than im entitled to by the rules of the game partly because i believe they are getting tired of changing bookkeepers largely because moon can humiliate gross by keeping me on that was the catch in the job i have found out why moon has it in for gross moon has been in aircraft work for almost five years relatively speaking hes a veteran not only that not only does he have more experience than per cent of the men in the plant but he has a natural and unusual talent for the business hes worked in final assembly sub wing even in engineering part numbers dont bother him he can look at one small part and reconstruct an entire assembly of several hundred a day or so ago during the lunch period he and vail played a game for dollar stakes by turns one would go outside the fence and down the assembly line to a plane which the other could not see then he would call out something like this six inches inboard from the right wing tip and three inches down and the other would answer say compressionrib bracket one sixtyfourth of an inch dural with a quarterinch hole and a onecoat green prime or five inches up from tailcone bottom tailfairing connecting and thats easy arens tabcontrol minus control rod vail knows something about planes himself hes got two years behind him and seventy hours in the air moon finally stuck him though on rivet sizes now a man like that is extremely valuable at any time and particularly at a time like this it would actually be impossible to replace him and moon is not inclined to underestimate his worth about three months ago or just before i came here moon was getting a dollar and four cents an hour and he was none too well satisfied with it but the company was negotiating with the union at the time and he was content to wait for developments well then the agreement was signed and it specified that the wage of a leadman need be only per cent higher than that of the highest paid worker in his department in this case the highest paid was vail at eighty cents so the personnel office in their pennywise fashion cut moons wage to a dollar moon made no complaint he simply went over to another plant where he was promptly hired at a dollarsixteen then he handed in his resignation here of course production had to hear about it and when they did they hit the ceiling what in hell was personnel trying to do didnt they know we were here to build planes did they think fiveyear men could be picked up off the street every day you guys had better wake up moon was advised that his pay from that moment was a dollarsixteen he called up the other plant they offered him a dollartwentyfive our plant saw the raise and twelve and a half cents more the other made it onefifty even our plant began to see red you cant do us this way they declared well report you to knudsen well make it warm for you in the aeronautical chamber of commerce its bad ethics its sabotage j edgar hoover shall hear about it well the other plant didnt want that they told moon very firmly that they couldnt accept his application for employment unless our plant decided they didnt want to keep him moon started coming to work late the timekeepers didnt notice he began eating apples and throwing cores at the guards the guards were instructed to think this was funny he arranged the crates of pilotseats into a pyramid with an aerie at the summit and he would lie there all day long reading and eating candy bars and blowing smoke through the skylight officially no one noticed they didnt want to they knew him and they were sure that in time he would become bored by the game and give up busken and vail liked moon and tried unnecessarily to cover for him murphy who told me the story was on the inside and at any rate wouldnt have played stoolpigeon gross however didnt have the lowdown and he didnt particularly care for moon it seemed to him that his good friend the personnel manager would be shocked if he knew what was going on also that with moon out of the way he gross with all his experience in football would be the logical candidate for leadman well it was pitiful in a way personnel had forgotten who moon was they sent him a discharge notice on the spot and a copy to production the latter caught moon just as he was going out the gate and they had to give him onefifty to get him to come back and ever since then theyve had to let him do about as he pleased moon found out about gross and while gross did do him a favor he doesnt like him very much there is one thing about this place if you are good enough at your job you can get away with anything three weeks ago the week shannon took sick we began moving into the extension to the plant everything was in twice the usual uproar the production lines were running full blast final assembly was running extra shifts engineering and experimental were working as furiously as ever we were receiving and throwing out parts more frantically than usual and amidst all this we had to move youd see a fuselage roll by on a jig with half a dozen men swarming over and inside it we threw out and received parts while the racks were rocking along on the dollies nothing stopped for a moment well you might have thought that at such a time allowances would have been made for any disarray or untidiness but the day we started to move the frontoffice announced a cleanup campaign when we went outside at noon there suspended by his neck from one of the hoisttracks was a dummy of a man the ugliest most scabrous object i have ever seen placarded sloppy sam underneath his title was another placard that read i am at home in this department on the adjacent bulletin board there was a notice saying that sloppy sam would be awarded to the department which was adjudged the dirtiest by a committee composed of soandso and soandso the award to be made the following monday i dont know just how far sloppy sam set back production but it must have been considerable rivet guns were replaced by brooms the unishear men went around picking up scraps moon wouldnt even let me post my travelers i had to get a dust cloth and start polishing the racks when we came through the plant entrance monday we all shuddered a little because it looked like sam was suspended over our space but when we came closer we saw that it was tooling the department next to ours that had drawn him and still there was no letdown wed got by this week but we might get him next and moon like any good leadman had his pride now tooling men in their own eyes at least are a race apart they go around spitting out tobacco and fractions and they sometimes not often become so absorbed in what they are doing that they dont hear the quitting whistle incidentally there arent many of them not nearly as many as the plant would like to have living somewhat in a world above us they were not treated to the jeers and jokes that we doubtless would have received but they were outraged nonetheless and they brought all their fine art to bear to show just how they felt about things at some time during the morning they lowered the dummy when they raised it again it was equipped with a giant phallus so gigantic in fact that sloppy sam required both hands to hold it upright or to be more exact outright for by changing a line here and shading one there they had given the detestable creature a look of lewd beatitude that gave the lie to any innocent theory that he was urinating or acquiring a suntan perhaps the highhats didnt know about it perhaps they chose to ignore it at any rate sloppy sam remained there until quitting time the following morning he had a companion she was facing sam and her skirts were up and so cunningly had the nightshift artists wrought rubber and red lead and excelsior that you could tell from fifty yards away why sam was no longer using his hands inside of a halfhour the chief of the company police was there a moment later he was joined by the first vicepresident the second and third vicepresidents and the factory manager the department foreman was called who was responsible for this this this that oh i guess all the boys had a hand in it so then you can inform your men each of them that they are to get a threeday layoff without pay well i kinda think they wont come back if you do that myself ive sorta been looking around baldwin the production manager came up harried of face prematurely gray his pockets bulging with papers now see here what the hell is this are we getting out planes or running a restaurant what what these men well you can write mine out too i go all the way to jersey to get a good man just one good man and you by god i give up they all walked away except the chief of police who remained to cut the dummies down weve heard and seen nothing more of sloppy sam and the cleanup campaign i would like to be as indispensable as that not here it is too much like home here this is the one place ive been that was as crazy as my home and i couldnt stand two such places very long but if i could get back into writing again real writing i had about words done when shannon became sick since then ive only done around three hundred the only place i could think of to write where the typewriter wouldnt bother her is the bathroom so ive been trying to write in there and i havent been very successful for one thing there isnt enough room for a table and the typewriter is a little too large to fit over the toilet seat for another the family seems to have to go every few minutes before that ill swear that roberta would go for a day at a time and mom and frankie were in the same class but now well just let me get settled good and about ready to hit the keys and there they are beating on the door i told them last night that they were going to have to get some pots but that brought up the question of who would form the sanitation detail and no one would so were in the same shape we were i wish shannon would get well i dont think any of us can go much longer without letting off some steam and i guess ive made a pretty bad show of being funny i am worried about her i couldnt write anywhere so long as she is like this well to mention something cheerful ive got a ride to and from work now i started riding with murphy wednesday gross laid off that day throwing us shorthanded so we worked overtime until fivethirty moon didnt have his car for some reason and he asked murphy to take him home murphy just about had to say yes of course and since the three of us were together he also just about had to ask me to ride too moon got in the back seat and put his feet up murphy and i rode in front we stopped in front of our house just as frankie was going in and she turned and waved your wife dilly said moon my sister i said and i added shes married she and her husband live here with you she does oh he said look murphy he said why dont you carry dilly back and forth to work its not much out of your way youd help out on the gas wouldnt you dilly id be glad to i said i dont know just what you would have to have but i could give you a dollar a week murphy all right he said i dont want to force myself on you itll be all right dilly said moon and they drove off and it does seem to be all right murphy just doesnt have a whole lot to say that is most of the time he doesnt ive learned that he originally came to the plant as a draughtsman and that he used to be a lightweight fighter and he told me the story about moon trying to get fired but hes a moody cuss and you get the impression that hell be glad to leave you alone for the same kind of favor or maybe thats just my imagination im always going around reading things into people and their actions which are nonexistent at any rate i do have a ride and it makes things much more pleasant than they were that walk up the hill was getting me down i havent said much lately about being sick because theres nothing new about it and it cant be helped but im i dont think im getting any better i get through the mornings pretty well but along about one oclock my body seems to increase in weight and from then until threethirty i have to fight to keep from dropping down on the floor and stretching out im not sleepy its been a long time since i was i just want to rest roberta has been very attentive to me these past ten days or so probably because the ordinary outlet for her emotions has been closed i imagine that has something to do with the way i feel and my inability to write but but im getting off on a sidetrack i started off to tell you about shannon tonight was saturday and i had intended going down to the library to get a book or two on blueprint reading i need to know blueprint reading in my work well i made my intentions known to the family and everyone that is mom roberta and frankie discussed the matter and decided it would be all right for me to go it is absolutely fantastic the debates that can be held over such a thing as my going over to the drugstore after a package of cigarettes it isnt that they dont want me to go they simply have to discuss it and if i dont wait until the discussion is over someone is hurt it is crazy but thats the way it is if go without waiting ill discover when i return that mom wanted a spool of black thread number or roberta would have gone along if id just waited until she got her hair combed or frankie will remember that if id just waited until five minutes after eight there was a place down the street where i could have got a free quart of beer with my fags ive always the last couple years at least had to furnish roberta with my itinerary and a timetable when i stepped out but thats aside from and in addition to the debates but they decided i could go and i got cleaned up so that id be ready to leave right after supper if you dont get down to the library early on saturday its hard to get waited on besides i was afraid if i hung around too long thered be an argument of some kind and i never would get there jo was down the street somewhere practicing a play shes always practicing with half a dozen groups and she didnt come home until the meal was almost over that irritated roberta her nerves have been worse than usual anyway what with mack and shannon glumly refusing food sitting side by side in their chairs as listless as two statues jo squeezed my hand and patted me on the shoulder before she sat down gee you look nice daddy going some place just to the library i said by the way jimmie said roberta pick me out a good mystery will you something by well you know something good all right i said roberta looked at jo and her nostrils started to tremble now what are you snickering about what did i say that was so funny answer me why i wasnt laughing mother said jo innocently may i go to the library with daddy no you cant what do you want to go for anyway theres a book i want its about early elizabethan costumes i really need it mother your daddy will bring it to you but i dont know the name of it i dont know what to tell him i have to go down and pick it out myself roberta finished a mouthful while jo waited anxiously may i mother do you know your catechism oh of course jo well i just said of course for god let her go roberta i said what difference does it make she can go said roberta just as soon as i hear her catechism jo brightened right now mother im really not hungry you can hear ill hear it when i get ready to hear it and not one minute before were not running this house for your benefit i said let her go honey she can recite her catechism when she gets back why dont you roberta frankie put in after we get em out of the way you and ill step out and get a coke roberta didnt say anything well im sorry jo i said but im going to have to leave as soon as i finish eating perhaps you can go some other time i need to go tonight said jo you ought to make mother let me go well i should have she was right but roberta laid down her fork jo dillon she said just one more word out of you and ill slap you to sleep jo got up and started to leave the table excuse yourself snapped roberta you told me not to say another word jo are you deliberately trying to get my to make me mad no mother said jo excuse me she gave me a peculiar lingering look which i could not interpret but which i know now was meant as an apology for what was to follow then she went into the bedroom when she came back she was wearing a housecoat and she had done something extraordinary with her hair and face no well yes she had been into the rouge and lipstick and bobby pins but that didnt account for the change it was the way she held herself some alteration in expression she looked except for her size a good ten years older she looked very much like roberta she sauntered over to the lounge and pulled the pillows off onto the floor now what are you doing demanded roberta why im just going to lie down said jo looking at her levelly theres nothing wrong with lying on the floor is there mother dont you think its fun to lie on the floor mother well said roberta well you be sure and put them back now jo lay down on her back with her knees in the air and her housecoat fell down against the cushions revealing that she had nothing on underneath jo said roberta although not very severely do you think thats dont you want some pants on ummm said jo closing her eyes and rolling her body gently ummm ooooh uh uh uh mmm jo i said and roberta said jo you get up from there this instant jo didnt get up she knew that she would have to pay for this act of vengeance and she intended getting her moneys worth robertas face was fiery red and she was shaking so that her chair creaked mom was looking pretending to look at her plate frankie was hiding behind a section of the evening paper and from the sound of things slowly strangling and jo the jo that was roberta kept on fascinated sick with shame i watched the conclusion of the performance thinking of the observations and study that lay back of it of what a terrible thing it is to rear children in poverty and hatreds how something that should have been beautiful and sweet to jo must always be an indecent mockery she was on the small of her back bottom upward heels against her thighs and then roberta had her she grabbed her by the hair and dragged hurled her against the wall and she was screaming curses as she beat and kicked and slapped her all at once you you filthy little bbastard ill kill you you sonofabitch you you scum you you goddam you ill kill you do you hear me ill kill you i will i will i will and i knew that she would kill her and jo was laughing so wildly that she could not fight back or get away i grabbed roberta by the arms but she had her hands tangled in jos hair and i did not know what to do because she was so insanely angry that i was afraid she might literally yank jos scalp off and just to help out mom had to say that jo deserved a good spanking you just let roberta spank her jimmie the idea a child doing a thing like that and i lost my head of course and yelled goddammit did she want the kid murdered and if she couldnt do anything wouldnt she at least keep still so that brought frankie into it dont you talk to mom that way jimmie she doesnt have to take it from you or anyone else well you take it then i yelled if you dont like it jo broke loose from roberta she ran between her legs i believe because roberta fell forward and banged her head against the fireplace not hard enough to knock her out just enough to make her madder jo got behind me and kept moving me around as roberta fought to get at her and roberta seemed to think that i was holding her off which i suppose i was and she started slapping me and kicking me on the shins and mom and i and frankie were all screaming at each other and well i do think it was about the worst brawl we have ever had then shannon took a hand yes shannon she wasnt listless any more far from it before i knew what was happening id been hit about sixteen solid punches in the groin i think jo caught it next a slashing bite on the rump but i cant be sure because she and roberta whod had her corns stamped on yelled at the same time and then shannon started going around us like a cooper around a barrel you goddam mama you goddam jo you goddam daddy beat the hell outta you fix you all beat the mack came rushing in from the bathroom carrying the toilet plunger he knew his limitations in combat knew that he needed a weapon but shannon was in so many places at once that he couldnt use it so he kept proffering it to her heah shan hit em wif a tick shan we got worn out mack and shannon discovered that they were hungry and mom had them go into the kitchen and stand on a chair by the stove so that they could supervise the scrambling of their eggs i took roberta into the bathroom and washed and bandaged her head and made over her and jo came back and hugged us both and said she was sorry and could she go to the library by herself and roberta said i think itll be all right dont you jimmie and i said yes frankie hollered down the hall that shed buy a quart of beer and i hollered back get two and ill pay for one and roberta hollered get some potato chips too frankie and ill give you the money when you get back and later on i told mom i didnt know what i was saying and she said oh thats all right so it is hideous when you think about it a child two children sick without this insanity which is driving them insane lost and bewildered when it was withdrawn living in a malarial swamp and not daring to leave it i think perhaps if we could catch them now change their environment by gentle stages if necessary something could be done but we cannot do that nothing is settled you see we have spent something tonight that we can never replace that i i know cannot replace and we have solved nothing it is futile to hope that we ever will one of us i think any one of us alone might solve something but he would have to be alone be far away if we were away where the poisons in us could not be refreshed and restored daily there might be a chance or if i could change things so magnificently that we could have separate rooms a separate way of life freedom of action without impinging upon others so that we would not have to struggle against one another to preserve our own identities so that we could become acquainted gradually as strangers should but theres no chance of that either i was sitting in the dinette late tonight typing when mack came through to get a drink of water id worked three hours and i must have had all of thirty words i who used to knock out five thousand in a day he pulled a chair up to the sink turned on the faucet filled a glass and drank it then he brought one to me saw a bitey inna hail he said yeah yop inna hall daddy he waited saw a bitey inna hall daddy i turned my head away you sick daddy youd better learn a new joke boy i said better learn a lot of new jokes the first time i called at robertas house she and her mother were in the kitchen roberta let me in and whispered ill be right with you honey and then she went back into the kitchen and i could hear her and her mother talking in low voices i wanted to smoke but i couldnt find an ashtray i looked around for something to read and there wasnt anything not a newspaper not a book or a magazine of any kind i began to get nervous i wondered what in the name of god they were talking about whether the old lady was trying to talk her out of going out with me lois mother hadnt been exactly fond of me either and her father who was in the school of economics at the college felt that lois needed someone a little more stable but it hadnt been like this there my dear boy arent you just frozen lois will be right down shes had such a cold today barely able to drag herself around i dont suppose i could persuade you two to spend the evening here the doctor and i are going out and goodness gracious youre sneezing arent you afraid that lois will catch its nothing serious id say just tb oh now youre teasing me arent you by the way ive a book you must take with you when you go dear dear willa i do know youll enjoy her what sacrifices she must have made what a lonely life she must have led willa which willa do you mean why miss cather oh i thought you were talking about the other one which what other is there another then the doctor chuckling martha martha by the way jim ive just received my copy of the prairie schooner your story is very well done too bad there isnt some money in that sort of thing too bad thats the way it had been at lois house they didnt hide in the kitchen there they seated you in a room with a baby grand and more books than a branch library and then they pelted you with words until your hide became so sore that you began to shout and snarl even before you were touched until you made such a fool and a boor of yourself that you could never go back but at robertas i got up and began to pace the floor and finally call it eavesdropping if you will i stopped where i could hear why mother you dont mean it yessir thats just what she did she took a little cornmeal and beat it up with some canned milk and water and she dipped the bread in that and it made the finest french toast you ever saw i thought well for the love of but it went on and on mrs shropshires husband came back no yes i was standing out in the no i was coming up from the cellar when i saw him getting out of the car i dont know where hed get the money to buy a car with do you now i just wonder mother and you cant guess how much i paid for eggs today well now how much was that last dozen when we were outside in the car i said do you always keep your dates waiting while you discuss the price of eggs roberta said after a minute i dont have very many dates she flared out too with but if they dont want to wait they know what they can do this one knows i said and i drove back around the block and opened the door of the car i didnt mean to make you mad she said not stirring its hereditary you didnt do it you know what i mean mother and i have always been pals im about the only person she really enjoys talking to im away all day and she looks forward to being with me at night what about your father hes not much company anyway hes on the night shift with the police department well look i said suppose i hadnt come around suppose no one had come around what would you have done all evening just sat there and talked about nothing we werent talking about nothing i enjoy being with mother just as much as she enjoys being with me but but dont you ever read anything girl mother cant mother doesnt care much for reading but you what about you roberta i guess id be a fine one to sit with my nose in a book when mother couldntdidnt have anyone to talk to now wouldnt i she did like to read i found that out after we were married but nothing that would help her to a better understanding of herself and me i was working on an assignment for a string of puff sheets a cent a word six weeks before publication and i had to pay travel out of that across iowa the dakotas and missouri down through oklahoma and texas when we wanted amusement we had to fall back on the public libraries and i was a long time in learning not to be exasperated i suppose i never learned but why cant i have what i like jimmie why because edgar wallace is only a man not a factory now you tell me why oh my roberta heres an adventure story its all about a city way off in africa and goddesses and battles and stuff like that a guy named flaubert wrote it i think hes going places i think youll like him better even than max brand now please read it honey i did read it when well i sort of looked through it roberta why in the name of god wont you just once read a book i knew why in time the why of the books and everything else she was afraid she wasnt sure of me and she was afraid that in traveling those paths which might make her sure which would bind us together she would only fail in front of me now i only thought i didnt know it was better to leave it that way she didnt mind my reading aloud not a bit not until jo came but jimmie youre keeping her awake youll make her nervous no i wont shell go to sleep when she gets tired listening listening a threemonthsold baby whats the matter are you afraid shell learn something oh go ahead i suppose she may as well get used to it early then a oneroom apartment in fort worth or dallas or kansas city jo watching my face roberta lying on the bed watching both of us now listen carefully jo whats the little girls name next door woof thats fine ruth and the other little girl the one down the hall mawy thats right youre all little girls but youve got different names isnt that funny mmhmm three little girls and now look at this thing again this thing here on the wall remember

difference does it make what difference does anything make whats the use in having the best job i ever had in my life in selling everything i can write whats the use in anything oh christ lets take a drink and forget about it i couldnt do it jimmie i just cant do things like that i cant sit there like a bump on a log and when someone says something not know what i just cant jimmie im not blaming anyone unless its myself not roberta ive only been telling you about roberta not blaming her she couldnt have been any different under the circumstances just as jo couldnt have been any different or i couldnt have been any different abe lincoin could have but i couldnt maybe he couldnt and no it would have been the same story with a different twist with lois we found that out the hard way one day after she was married and i was married we met on the street in lincoln and i undressed her with my eyes and she me with hers and nothing mattered but that we should be together again we drove to marysyule kansas and registered at a hotel we even wrote letters unmailed fortunately explaining why we had had to do what we had done then the physical reunion and after that talk lying there together in the dusk she had it all planned she had a sorority sister whose husband owned a big advertising agency in des moines and he was a perfectly gorgeous person if i would just be nice to him what do you mean nice ive never spit in anyones face yet well thats what i mean dear you say so many things that are misunderstood they give people the wrong impression of you they think that that ive been in some pretty nasty places well i have been and anyone who doesnt like it can lump it please dear i think its marvelous the way youve worked to make something of yourself with so little success is that what you mean well what do you want me to do never mind ill tell you ooh my deah mrs bunghole what a delightful blend of pee excuse me tea and what are your beagles doing this season mrs bunghole beagling why how gorgeously odd do tell me now youre becoming impossible perhaps i always was perhaps we went back to lincoln that same night five years later i would have admitted in the security i had then that she was not superficial and she would have conceded that the common streak in me was no broader than it needed to be and each would have borrowed from the other and profited by it and yet i wonder im pretty sure that those five years did things to me which made her wince when she thought of our onetime intimacy and i can say positively that i felt the same way about her if i had been her husband i think i should have put a saddle on her and trotted her around the countryside until she had worked off about forty pounds the fool shouldnt have let her get that way she wouldnt have with me this is a typical day for me i arise at four shave wash and dress and at fourthirty i start writing or at least i sit down to my typewriter i sit there until six and i usually get something done by which time mom has such breakfast as i care to eat when i have eaten i lie down on the lounge and rest and smoke until about a quarter of seven then i go outside and wait for murphy to arrive he seldom gets here with any time to spare i can hear him coming several blocks away and when i do i get over on the other side of the street and hop in as he slows down i grit my teeth and close my eyes as we start down the hill to the bay and i have a theory that he does too we make the descent in twelve jumps one for each intersection a good half of the time either the front or rear wheels or both are in the air stopsigns children playing ball switch engines across our path mean nothing maybe we jump over them at the boulevard he forces his left front wheel between the bumpers of two other cars usually one is forced to give way if not he shoots the car into reverse then darts ahead with the right wheels on the sidewalk and the others scraping fenders with those in the procession until he sees another opening and so on until he is able to crash through the road leading to the plant is only twolane and the night shift is coming off duty at the time but murphy doesnt mind them he stays on the left side of the road and if the night workers want to eat breakfast at home instead of in the hospital they will pull off on the bay shore well murphy will give way but i think he feels imposed upon when he has to after all he is only a few seconds in getting to the plant while they are minutes on the road we arrive at the plant midway between the first and last whistle and punch in as the last one is blowing he smiles with satisfaction thought we were going to be late didnt you i thought we were going to be dead ha huh didnt scare you did i oh no the stockroom floor is covered with piles of parts that have come in during the night i list the travelers on each pile then check the list with my books any parts that are short on the assembly lines are sent out at once i have to see that the travelers match the parts they accompany the moveboys delight in dropping the right traveler on the wrong part and that lefts and rights of a certain part have not come in on the same traveler frequently a part that has been universal is changed into left and right or inboard and outboard without our being notified engineering forgets about it or the office makes one of its many slips and we have the same number on more than one part this obviously wont do but my chief trouble is with the stockchasers or expediters there is one expediter for every two positions on final assembly and one each for wing and control surfaces it is their job to see that there is a continuous flow of parts from the manufacturing departments to their assemblies or projects to see that never at any time is there a delay in production because of parts shortages it is my opinion and the opinion of every other stockroom worker that they are damned nuisances who actually slow things down instead of speeding them up but i suppose were prejudiced practically every defense plant has them if they werent a necessity they wouldnt be there blueprints and work orders get mislaid foremen keep putting off a difficult job for an easy one parts become buried in the various stockrooms moveboys pile finished parts in with unfinished so the expediters who speed from one end of the plant to the other who keep themselves informed of plans before they are reduced to paper who are bursting with knowledge of every phase of production connected with their project they really are necessary any shortage means a reproof for them many shortages mean dismissal so shortages are their only concern they pour through the gate the moment it is opened grab up such parts as they need to stay an immediate shortage and dash out again without the formality of telling me what they have taken i or murphy or one of the others will call out hey there where you going with that position the stockchaser calls back theyre waiting for let em wait what you got anyway oh hell just a half dozen pieces ill tell you about it after half a dozen hell i can see eight from here what are those anyway tanksupport brackets yeah ill give you the number after youll give it right now whats the matter with you guys dont you know we have to keep records here thatd throw us off in two places the travelerd be short and finald be long sometimes it will go like this now wait a minute wings already got plenty of that you tell em to look around down there no they havent dilly ill swear to god theyve been crying for this stuff for a week let me take it now and if i find any down there moon oh moon whats the matter dilly our friend here is trying to get out with these static tubes wings got enough already put them back where you got them says moon eyeing the stockchaser somberly i cant moon by god i just got to have them no you dont theyve already got enough static tubes down there yeah but theyre short on pitots i was going to just what i thought says moon grimly you were going to change the tape on them and use em for pitots just wait until material control hears about this aw now moon put em down then and the old harried question whats the matter with you guys anyway dont you know what that would do to our records wed show fifty statics out and no pitots when wed actually have twentyfive of each one of the most infuriating tricks of the stockchasers is the taking of parts from the paint shop or plating direct to the assemblies without telling us about it another is to have parts reworked into other parts without a rework order yes there are rules against this sort of thing but the plant authorities wink at them anything to solve an emergency regardless of whether the solution creates another emergency or not i suppose i should be glad that things are like this because it would be extremely difficult to hold me culpable for any costly mistakes or delays that occur im not breathing any too easily but i think it would be but despite that fact i would rather find some other way out i dont like so much turmoil so many arguments i think there is an easier less nervewracking and better way of doing things i think the essential difficulty is our system of keeping records and i dont think there will ever be any improvement until we change it as it is the parts are classified according to positions and assemblies and a part may be carried in one position one day and another the next this makes for a lot of erasing and scratching out it makes it possible for us to show a shortage on a part when we actually have more than we need and vice versa it means that the only way you can be sure that you have not overlooked a part is to start searching for it at the top of the first page of the release book and search right through to the last worst of all is this business of breaking everything up into shipunits of twentyfive what is gained by that i wonder if the fellow who set up this system thought of the work it would involve that to receive a quantity of only one part the bookkeeper would have to make as many as thirty entries and there are no places to show dates of arrivals and issues no wonder we can never win an argument with the other departments its simply our word against theirs or rather their many words against ours so were always to blame but to get on i spend an hour or so out on the assembly lines checking for parts that may have been shortcircuited around us and tracing out the effective numbers on new parts i may have made this last seem a little too simple when i first spoke of it you see many parts on a plane are concealed i come back to the stockroom and usually find a number of parts which do not belong there yes the moveboys did and do have instructions to bring nothing to us until it has been turned down by the other stockrooms and theyll always swear that theyve done so but if they dont and obviously they dont theres little to be done moving is pretty much a beginners job few stay on it after their probationary period is over by the time you reported a moveboy and ive never done it hed probably be in some other department so to repeat theres little to be done and of course these mistakes arent always the moveboys fault probably not more than half the time speaking frankly moon gives me more trouble than any man outside the department he usually forgets to write down the parts he issues invariably instead of setting down the part number he uses the name and no that doesnt do just as well weve got three or four hundred different kinds of brackets for instance and its impossible to distinguish one from the other by name or description particularly when your vocabulary is as limited as moons you can do it by number gross is a constant source of trouble too but with him its deliberate i can never take his count on anything i have to make a recheck as for murphy well hes careful and conscientious and hes friendly toward me but theres a flaw in his vision a peculiar quirk which makes him write backwards and upside down for and w for m in a way of course the situation has its bright side in the same way that my difficulties with the expediters have their bright side but i still dont like it in fact i feel some days that i cant stand it i want to shake moon and tell gross to straighten up or get out and advise murphy to see an oculist but of course i dont ive got to get along i never go to the toilet or take a drink of water on my own time i dont have enough of it the lunch period is only thirty minutes and it takes about five minutes to get out of the plant and find a spot to sit and another five to get back in again obviously unless i want to swallow my food whole and do without smoking i drink and go to the toilet on the company everyone does well the whistle blows and i race for the door and two thousand other men are racing with me by the time i get outside sitting space against the sheetmetal sides of the building is already at a premium i see an empty space far down the wall and run for it hey turdhead someone calls i dont look around hey prick i hurry on by stopping i would admit that i knew my name i go on down the wall and if the space i come to is not marked restricted area i sit down i unscrew the vacuum bottle as i reach into my lunch sack so that not one of the precious twenty minutes will be wasted yes i mind the first time i was called by name i got white in the face and stopped and demanded to know who said that it was a boy of twenty or so cleancut good will shining out of his face embarrassed and very much astonished he muttered something about kidding and someone near by said cant you take a joke so i went on and ive never stopped since but i mind its not that ive never been called things like that before you hear some pretty salty talk around hotel lockerrooms and in the pipeline camps you hear so much that if you are like me you will do almost anything to get away from it and when you do and have to come back it is all the harder particularly if you are thirtyfive and see no way of getting away again while we are on this subject in the ten weeks i have been here i have heard the word f k used more often than i had in my life heretofore everyone uses it from the factory manager down to the maintenance men upstairs in the office you will hear it fifty times in an hour and the women and girls have become so accustomed to it that they never so much as raise an eyebrow a part is f ked up sheetmetal is f king around again if those f kers in engineering dont do this well do so and so a design is f king well all right if youre in error youve f ked things youre f ked i dont know why the word should be so much more popular in aircraft than it is elsewhere but there must be a reason ive been dallying with the idea of writing ben botkin about it perhaps doing a little paper on it but of course i wont if i do any writing itll be on my story its about finished and i can get some money for it i hope generally you dont hear as much offcolor talk around the plant as you would elsewhere what you do hear is less sordid seemingly than the brand outside there is something lighthearted about it i have heard only one shady story since i have been here only one that you couldnt tell in church san diego prior to the establishment of the aircraft factories was not inappropriately dubbed the city of the living dead there were no industries there was no construction the towns one asset was its climate if you were young and wanted excitement and had a living to make why the town wouldnt want you and you wouldnt want it if you were old and had a small income or pension you couldnt have found a more attractive place to live in well when the defense boom struck the town just couldnt throw off its lethargy it did ultimately but for a long time the city fathers idea of taking care of a ioo per cent increase in population was to up the price of rents and other living incidentals by a corresponding increase living isnt cheap here now or even moderately reasonable but the government has stepped in and but heres the story a newly arrived aircraft worker walked into a bar and ordered a cheese sandwich and a bottle of beer the waitress took the dollar bill he proffered in payment and gave him back a dime in change ruefully the aircrafter asked her if there wasnt some mistake oh no sandwich fifty beer forty no mistake funny said the aircrafter in a tone that said it wasnt and his eyes settled on the buxom mounds of her bosom whats those the waitress colored why theyre my breasts you fool whatd you think they were didnt know everything else is so high in here i thought they might be the cheeks of your ass offhand id say that twothirds of the men are under thirty half of them probably under twentyfive and intelligence is much higher than the average once in a while a misfit like gross or myself slips in but not often and you can be reasonably sure that the misfits are not without certain valuable talents the plant believes that in them it has something to work on and it is willing to risk a little money on the belief practically every production worker who is not already a skilled mechanic must be a tradeschool graduate which means invariably that he is a highschool graduate also in nonproduction work such as i am in two years of college or the equivalent are required degrees are so numerous around here as to be commonplace an average of only one out of every twentyfive applicants is given a job and fully a fourth of those are discharged during or at the end of the thirtyday probationary period i mention all this not by way of giving myself an indirect pat on the back but because of the newspaper talk to the effect that the aircraft plants have made the wpa and other relief agencies unnecessary nothing could be further from the truth you find no dispossessed sharecroppers or barnyard mechanics here they get no farther than the officeboy in the personnel department well theres the whistle so a final drag on a cigarette and back we go again for four more hours the office crowd has begun to get its breath by now and is hollering for something more to worry about the autocall roars the phone begins to ring dilly how about a shortage report on position by threethirty ill try for how many ships well where are we now weve got fifty in the yard but were not through with em you know we need props on about fifteen and the cockpit leathers and weve got an acceptance on fifty though make it for the next twentyfive then all right say i notice youre still figuring thirteen wing inspectionhole covers to a ship were using twentytwo well catch it youll get the report for us swell one thing i like about this plant you dont have to hem and haw and be sugartongued with anyone they dont want you to if youve got a criticism or some information to pass on you do it in the quickest possible fashion and no formalities i mister our superintendent dolling and try to choose my words because without doing or saying anything he insists upon it but with anyone else the chief inspector the production manager or whoever its heres the dope and on to something else and if someone regardless of his position butts in on something that he knows less about than you do you tell him where to get off a few days ago while moon and i were at the window checking through some travelers one of the many vicepresidents stalked up there was a pile of leading edges on the floor he nodded at them looked at me i am older than moon i also dress less roughly i suppose the vp thought i was in charge nice bunch of edges youve got there he said i said yes what about them get them off the floor this instant what do you think those racks are for i looked at moon tell him to go piss up a rope said moon idly the vp choked spluttered and rushed away a few minutes later our phone rang and moon answered it yeah i told him that he said only i didnt say pee those edges are drilled wrong were waiting for a moveboy to pick em up that was the end of the matter i spoke of having turned out fifty planes the government has accepted that many but only a few of them are complete were short of props instrument panels tailwheels and dozens of smaller items a few of the things may actually be in the plant the majority i believe are not every day searching parties from dispatch inspection and material control go through but they rarely find anything any more no one can be sure that an order we received hasnt been scrapped or loaned to another plant no one can be sure of anything some of the things that happen in here are nothing less than fantastic one monday morning while i was posting my travelers i ran across three for a certain type of fairing that had no count on them i checked with all the boys trying to find out who had put them up and they all denied that they had i went through the fairing section piece by piece and i couldnt find anything that matched the description on the travelers i checked my books i wasnt carrying any fairing under those three numbers i checked with the foremen on final assembly theyd never heard of any fairing like that certainly theyd never put any on the planes i could see that for myself i began to get cold chills according to the travelers those fairings had been used from the start fifty pieces of each had cleared through me and should have gone on the planes but they hadnt and i didnt have them as i say i didnt even have a record on them i went to moon with it he got kind of pale around the gills and went to baldwin baldwin tore his hair out by the handful and began calling material control and sheetmetal inspection dispatching painting and dope shop and the various foremen and superintendents came rushing up to his office to study the travelers and nope theyd never seen anything like that i wont give you all the painful details blueprintcrib finally solved the puzzle the travelers bore workorder instead of finishedparts numbers they actually covered only one part which we carried on our books under an assembly number some overlyfastidious routing clerk averse to the idea of crowding one traveler with the delineation of the hundreds of processes involved in making the assembly had innocently spread the information through subdivision numbers which he had picked off the blueprint well ill admit it i dont see how i could possibly have anything to be afraid of but im keeping my fingers crossed it sounds foolish childish but its been my experience that i can avoid a potential disaster by worrying about it enough anyway its just as well to think that i do have to stay here because of course i must at least until i can get my story sold and pop settled and frankie toned down a little and as to why the government accepts planes that cant be flown i dont know the way i figure it is that weve either got a darned good sales manager or someone in the government procurement office is overly anxious to make a showing im getting sixtyfive cents an hour now thats supposed to be very good for a man who has been here such a comparatively short time and dolling made it very clear that the company wasnt obliged to give it to me its as much as murphy gets its five cents more than grosss wage i think im underpaid naturally but i cant say anything so long as the records are in their present shape it isnt my fault but i cant say anything if anyone has been mistreated here its murphy that really is his right name hes halfirish halfmexican when he ruined his hands fighting he took what money he had and studied mechanical engineering for two years some small cheap and not very good school that few have ever heard of graduating he was unable to get a job at his profession and he worked as a messenger sodaclerk and whatever he could get to do for a few years when wpa opened up he got a job as a cartographer on one of the records projects and with the beginning of defense work he applied and was accepted here i dont suppose he was outstanding as a draughtsman on the other hand he was probably no worse than dozens of others and given time he doubtless would have become a valuable man but he didnt mix well and he looked like a mexican and and hes down here now at one oclock my head begins to swim i pour out half of the cup of coffee i have saved and toss it down at a quarter of two my head snaps up and i look at the paper in my typewriter there are two lines more of type than there should be when i last looked saw there were three lines now there are five they all seem to be all right though i get a drink of water and come back again just enough to sleep on and not hear and no morning and write no morning and write but drink and sleep but write dilly oh dilly moon is at my side not looking at me not noticing moon is good much kinder to me than he should be want to take a walk upstairs dilly get us some carbon i go upstairs you can smoke up there you can light up as soon as you hit the foot of the stairs twothirty and the rest of the coffee three half tonight and half in the morning write and sleep no job job the low voice again it has to be low to get under the noise you soon learn that you cant get above it got about ten minutes dilly dilly about through ten minutes huh sure sure just about set i rip out the five copies one for us one for dispatching one for production and one for the expediter god will he catch it what about the extra copy a thousand times and youve forgotten cant ask anyone theyll think youre crazy material control no sheetmetal subassembly factory manager no no no plating painting planning lofting no no no drophammer plannishing oh god no what would they want with it punchpress sewing singing praying dilly you made a copy for inspection didnt you inspection inspection oh sure sure taking em around right now the fiveminute whistle blows upstairs and back four blocks and five minutes to do it in they want you out of here when that second whistle blows if youre caught inside without an overtime pass you cant get out matter dillon you tired i sit up murphy is grinning sympathetically and we are crossing pacific boulevard kind of kind of a hard day say murph i know i must have but did you notice whether i punched out yeah you punched out all right i was right behind you well here we are see you in the morning huh yup i may be a little late got to bring the wife in and now not too late murph one more ride like that this morning ha huh okay dillon so long so long murph the whistle is blowing and moon is talking to me want to help me take some stuff down to the express office dilly we can get a couple hours for it two hours of overtime two dollars it wont really be working and that doctor bill of shannons why sure thanks i thought maybe you and your wife and frankie and me might do something tonight i dont know about frankie moon i think she said something about aw she cant always be tied up well he waits for me to say it well all right shannon and mack were sitting on the front steps moon who was preceding me stopped in front of them seen any policemen around they grinned and shook their heads well theres some in the neighborhood he declared solemnly and he fumbled in his pocket and produced two dimes you take these and stay out here and sort of keep on the lookout for em if you see any run in and tell me ill come out and beat em up get ice cweam said mack good ice cream at my store said shannon looking at moon hopefully sure said moon but look out for the policemen i said hadnt you better wait until after dinner but of course no one paid any attention to me shannon dashed off mack churning along behind her his usual three paces to the rear moon went on into the kitchen and put the packages down hi mom he said why its mr moon said mom pleased you would catch me looking like this got enough skillets to cook four pounds of pork chops you didnt get four pounds said mom jimmie what did you let mr moon get so much for now never you mind said moon opening another sack just get em cooked or you dont get any of this sherry it was ten years old i was kind of ashamed of but more sorry for mom the way her eyes glittered when she tasted it shes had so few good things and she enjoys them so much only well maybe im a snob but what right had he to come into my house and call my mother anything but mrs dillon and take it for granted that shed be as glad to get the wine as as she was i guess ive answered my own question i am too thinskinned everyone says so he fixed rye highballs for himself and me getting down the glasses and making himself perfectly at home we went back into the living room and he opened the hall door and shouted for roberta well perhaps shout is the wrong word he never raises his voice very much roberta opened the bedroom door is that you mooney im not dressed yet goody said moon come right on out roberta laughed and above the sizzle of chops and the clinking of glass i heard mom laugh i laughed too moon was looking at me and he hadnt said anything out of the way moon is all right roberta came in and shoved him playfully hi mooney hi sunny she laughed different from the way she usually laughs whatre you drinking oh phoot why didnt you get gin you know how i like tom collinses i didnt know it you did too you knew she paused seeing moon wink at me you did get some didnt you did we dilly i cant remember why you mean thing said roberta and she pushed him again i went out into the kitchen and fixed her a tom collins no please get that straight i am not never have been jealous of roberta sometimes when i have been looking for a reason to escape i have wished that i had cause to be jealous but i know i havent that i never will have actually i suppose i was angry with myself angry because any outsider could make himself more at home than i could when i took robertas drink to her i brought along another stiff drink for myself i began to thaw a little after id got it down jo came in and sat down on the arm of my chair cant you say hello to mr moon said roberta hello said jo moon said hello jo how are you jo smiled at him silently moon ran his hand into his pocket you dont know any dances do you jo id give a quarter to see a real good dance i dont know any said jo you do too jo said roberta you know a ive forgotten mother but youve been dancing around here all day you couldnt have im tired mother jo it was probably a very good thing that frankie arrived at that moment she dropped down on the divan next to moon pushing her hat back and kicking off her shoes she removed the drink from his hand and gripping her nose with two fingers killed it at a gulp ugh i dont see how you can drink rye mixed like one straight said moon well okay he got the bottle and we all had another drink frankie had a new story it was the one about the old king who had three beautiful daughters one of whom he was going to award to a knight for doing something or other the question was which one did the knight choose and the answer none he took the king this was a fairy story moon didnt laugh very hard i got the impression that he didnt like to hear frankie talk like that and i wondered what business it was of his how she talked i dont wonder now because i know that despite everything he was in love with her got a date tonight he said yep thought we all might go down to tia juana well gee said frankie and glanced at me id sure like to go said roberta you ought to go too jimmie all the time weve been here and youve never been across the border maybe you could get an idea for a story i laughed probably not very pleasantly do you suppose i could get the time to write it too do you good to get out dilly said moon and it wouldnt do me any harm said roberta ive not been out of this house in weeks i may not be as smart as some people but im still human now honey i said mom came in from the kitchen if youall want to go ill take care of the kids i guess i could break my date said frankie well well it suits me fine i said lets go we didnt eat much dinner frankie and roberta had a lot of getting ready to do and moon and i had drunk too much to be very hungry none of us was drunk though just feeling good roberta and moon and frankie were feeling good and i felt less bad than usual as we rushed through the night toward the border roberta snuggled close to me and tucked my hand under her breast youre not mad at me are you i thought we just about had to come i suppose we did moons been by so many times and hes your boss and all and i thought we had to i said got any money with you all of seven cents ive got a dollar but lets not spend it unless we have to we need so many things jimmie look i said whose idea was this anyway how do you expect to go down here and spend an evening without money moons got plenty of money you just let him pay for things i guess ill have to she stiffened in my arm and looked straight ahead and i knew that i was as bewildering and unreasonable to her as she was to me i pulled her head down in my lap and put my mouth over hers and after a moment her lips parted and her hands were twining in my hair she rolled from the waist bringing her feet up into the seat and the wind dropped her dress around her thighs and in the moonlight they were pure ivory she had no girdle on only the frilly white panties which she buys or used to buy by the dozens because she knows i am disturbed by the potential uncleanliness of colors and she used no perfume because i object to that for much the same reason and i thought bending over her knowing that her eyes were closed so that mine might be open how many ways in this one way the one way she understood she had tried to make herself over to my pattern and i thought how thankless the task must seem to her and i longed for the moment at least to look only on those efforts and their results to look to forget and to want no more and i knew before the wish was fullformed that i couldnt i couldnt because i had been down to the bottom and i knew what was there and i knew each pleasant and deceptive curve of the descent i couldnt because of a tall overweight farm boy who had entered the first grade when he was sixteen and who was admitted to the bar at twentyone an absentminded untidy fat man who won of his first cases a man who forgot to pay grocery bills but who would borrow money for the letters of the presidents or american history in romance a broke and friendless old man who had told me to leave him and go to school we didnt stop at the mexican customs office moon merely slowed the car a little honked and sped by the two guards in their multibuttoned uniforms looked after us smilingly although it seemed to me a shade crestfallen in another two minutes we were entering the long main street of the town moon said wednesday wasnt a very good night we ought to come down some saturday but it was good enough for roberta she sat up leaning first out of my window then hers laughing excitedly pointing asking questions oh look honey look frankie that woman isnt she a movie star no that one oh shes gone now are all those places saloons mooney how do they all make a living do you suppose that stuff on the pushcarts is good to eat i guess thered be a law if it wasnt dont you honey oh frankie with a long sigh look at those hats did you ever why theyre as big as umbrellas like to have one said moon turning the car into the curb i guess not said frankie how much are they asked roberta ill make them give us some said moon come on leave your hats in the car as we got out a dozen or so ragged children swarmed around us give us penny misters ladies give us pennies penny penny penny they screamed roberta and frankie automatically began fumbling with their purses but moon pushed us on ahead into one of the dozens of curio and souvenir shops its not the money you give one of them anything and well have a parade behind us all evening wherever we go moon speaks spanish or i should say mexican fluently the kind of mexican that the mexicans speak he and the proprietor were haggling in a friendly fashion all the time we were trying on hats i dont know what he paid for them but i think it was a dollar each they werent as big as umbrellas they were bigger there wasnt room for two of us on the sidewalk when we had them on so we took them off and carried them we walked across the street to the longest bar in the world there were only a few people in it all nonmexican except for the employees but the marimba band was playing away as vigorously as if the place had been packed the girls went back to the restroom and moon and i had scotch and sodas they hadnt returned by the time we had finished them so we had tequila with salt and lemon and then because it slid down so nicely we had another things began to get pretty rosy about that time a drunk hatless and with a filthy vest staggered out on the floor and approached the end marimba player the latter a plump elflike fellow tried to shoo him away but the drunk wouldnt be shooed he kept shouting for home on the range and the more he was disdained the more determined he became finally he started to climb up on the platform the marimbaplayer moved his sticks off into space a few inches and without the barest flicker of a smile tapped out the remainder of the score on the drunks bald head the drunk went down on his knees and was hustled out by two waiters well it doesnt sound funny now but i laughed so hard that i would have fallen off my stool if moon hadnt caught me he wasnt as drunk as i was i guess in fact im sure he wasnt roberta and frankie came out and had drinks and then we strolled up and across the street to the mona lisa its run by chinese as many of the places in tia are and the prices are pretty stiff of course you can get beer for fifteen cents a glass and a shot of tequila for the same but youre liable to find that your table is needed shortly if you do the hosts of aunt jane arent at all inhibited about things like that they feel not the slightest shame in telling you that youre not drinking fast enough to be a good customer if you want to fight about it thats all right too youll never want to brawl again after youve been in tia jail once moon ordered sunrise specials at fifty cents a piece before they could be brought roberta and i got out on the dance floor but we neednt have done so moon had made a deposit with the cashier when we came in and no checks were ever brought to the table i dont know how large the deposit was roberta and i could never make anything more than a rough estimate as to the size of our bill but i think it must have been twenty dollars anyway i dont know either when moon and frankie left the place began to fill up and the orchestra was playing steadily wed go back to the table and frankie and moon wouldnt be there and wed just suppose they were out on the dance floor for that matter we werent bothered about anything much but having a good time i was drunk not staggering drunk i never stagger but totally irresponsible roberta who doesnt have much capacity was tipsy itd been two or three years since id seen her enjoy herself so much itd been that long since we could really cut loose without scrimping for a month afterwards tonight we didnt have to worry about money well but money couldnt bring us back those two or three years along about eleven oclock we were sitting much more than we were dancing and roberta kept saying i wonder where they could be jimmie and id say huh and shed say moon and frankie i must say theyve got darned bad manners to go off and leave us like this where do you suppose they could be i dunno lets have another drink after a while i suggested that we go to bed you got a dollar i recalled we can get a room for a dollar jimmie whats wrong with that were going to get some black coffee and something to eat and youre going to straighten up oh that frankie we had ham and eggs and coffee we were on our second pot of coffee when moon and frankie returned and where have you been roberta demanded frankie slumped against the bench wearily oh what a time weve had we went outside to get a breath of air and one of mooneys tires was going down so we drove down the street to get it fixed we finally found one a filling station where they did tire work and got it patched and then the car wouldnt start something wrong with the battery the switch said moon well anyway anyway we finally got here moon said how about another drink roberta no thank you i dont think i want any i said jimmie and i have to be going said roberta we should have gone a long time ago so should i said moon well go as soon as frankie and i have one he and frankie had double bourbons straight and they did look like they needed them then we left the ride home wasnt exactly pleasant there were probably thirty cars ahead of us at the u s customs office and we were almost an hour getting to the head of the line and the silence while we waited was pretty heavy frankie got off a joke or two but they didnt go over roberta was mad moon was getting and i was trying out of a sense of duty to work up to it at last a door on each side of the car was jerked open and two khaki clad patrol officers turned their flashlights on us united states citizens yes birthplace we told them anything to declare cigarettes liquor clothing no no well we did have those hats we wont charge you for those lets take a look in your back end moon pulled his bunch of keys from the switch and handed them out how about hurrying it up a little he said how about getting out and opening it yourself said the guard moon muttered something under his breath and got out i felt constrained to get out also i followed him around to the back of the car and watched while he tried each of the keys in the lock he straightened up for a minute wiped the sweat from his forehead and began trying them over again cant you find the right key said the sternfaced grayhaired guard sure said moon im just stalling you guys ive got six chinks and a ton of opium in here better snap into it snap into my ass said moon the younger guard took a step toward him but the other put out his hand step in the station bill he said and bring out the hacksaw now youre not going to saw that lock said moon can you open it no i cant i must have left the keys at home too bad the other guard came back with the saw frankie climbed out of the car whatre you going to do anyway were going to saw the lock lady well of all things what are you going to do that for we dont have anything in there we dont know that lady roberta stuck her head out if you ask me there isnt much you do know the two guards looked at each other the oldest one turned to moon pull over here under the shed now what the hell and cut out the cursing we dont take it but we cant bother with you now youll have to wait until we get rid of these other cars we waited hours passed and still we waited as long as the guards could see a car approaching they made us wait and then taking their time they sawed the lock it was fivethirty when we pulled up in front of our house in san diego moon went on home saying that he thought hed lay off that day frankie said she thought she would too she works on a straight salary not an hourly rate as i do roberta said jimmie you know you cant work today whats the use of being stubborn about it i said oh hell when youre working fortyeight hours the day you lose is your overtime my rate was only a little over five dollars a day but if i lost a day my check would be short eight dollars we couldnt get along without it i fussed and swore around until she finally dug down in the trunk and got the little brown bottle shed hidden then she went to bed crying saying that she jjust hoped i blew the top of my ddamned head off now theres nothing wrong with this drug the trouble is with the people who take it two tablets in a glass of coke will put you on such a wildly delicious drunk that youll never want to come out of it and you may not a tablet and perhaps a fraction of one the morning after will convince you that you have the hangover problem licked a dose the same dosage produces different effects on different days will have you believing that sleep and food are nonessentials i started off with half a tablet and added to it by eighths at a tablet and a quarter my eyelids snapped open so hard that it was like two doors slamming there was a lull then so i took another quarter my scalp prickled and the hair seemed to rise and drop back to my head my back and shoulder muscles flexed themselves my nostrils trembled and i could smell a thousand scents i had never smelled before my eyes coned outward the pupils narrowing and i knew without really looking that there were exactly bricks in the fireplace and that the corner of the rug beneath the divan was turned up and i was filled with such furious energy and impatience that to be idle was agony unlike alcohol this drug doesnt leave you stupid and drowsy it makes you want to work and you can literally work yourself to death while under the influence you are suddenly impelled to do all the forbidding tasks you have been putting off and you do them well too because your mind is wearing itself out at the rate of about an hour per minute that day shot past so swiftly that the scenes of its composition while perfectly clear and unbiurred at the time are impossible to recall there were so many thousands of them and they were moving so rapidly for that matter however only a few are really pertinent i remember asking murphy if it was characteristic of the mexican temperament always to be late whether or not he had ever consulted an oculist about his eyes and whether or not he did not think it would be better for him to take any job he could get and go back to school for a few years that vail told me to mind my own goddamned business and hed mind his and that i neither protested nor was disturbed there were so many things that needed doing that i had a huge mass of index cards spread out in front of me and that i wasnt having the slightest difficulty in operating the typewriter with one hand while i turned the pages of the release books with the other that a prematurely gray man baldwin the production manager was leaning over my desk frowning i dont know dilly did you ask dolling about this whats the use he doesnt know anything what goddamned fool set this system up anyway i did and i remember that when i went outside that night murphy had gone memorial day came that weekend and we had a threeday holiday beginning on friday i had time to get straightened out after a fashion id finished my story a few weeks before and didnt have that to contend with and the folks had decided among themselves that i was entitled to a rest rest and such things are always spoken of around our house as luxuries which i guess they are around our house anyway well roberta had said the story was marvelous and mom said well jimmie arent you glad you tried now but i knew it was rotten unbalanced the way i felt lay over the pages like a black shadow we sent it off to macfaddens first and when it bounced to fawcetts then to moe annenbergs string and on to but it doesnt matter i didnt care whether it sold or not in fact i hoped it wouldnt i knew that if it sold theyd be after me to write another one and the next one would be worse and having it constantly impressed upon me how much id slipped and was slipping would kill that last feeble desire to really write but im getting off the track again the folks decided i was entitled to a rest so they fixed a lunch and went down to the beach early saturday morning and stayed all day and they all got frightfully sunburned they were going around for days afterward covered with cornstarch and walking spraddlelegged and i wasnt very sympathetic id come home in the evening all jumpy and fagged out from the mess id started at the plant and there wouldnt be anything to eat because no one had felt up to going to the store and id be expected to examine backsides and shake out talcum powder and speak with a sob i never got so thoroughly sick of looking at hindends in my life and ive looked at quite a few what with changing diapers for two families and and one thing and another i wanted to blister them a lot worse than they were what in the name of christ were you doing all day i snarled standing on your heads we were trying to keep out of the way so you could rest couldnt you have done it with some long slacks and an umbrella did you think youd make me feel better by getting barbecued well we didnt know it was so hot and anyway my slacks were dirty and shannon took the umbrella over to why didnt you stay under the cliffs then good god girl i fell thirty feet into the pecos one night when it was covered with ice and our nearest camp was twelve miles away but i didnt just accept things i didnt say well ive got my matches wet and lost my lantern so ill have to freeze i started one of the generators and oh dont tell me about that again were not all as smart as you are i know why you did it you wanted to make me feel responsible sorry for you you wanted to appear ten times as dumb and helpless as you really are so that id think that i had to stick around you dont need to stick around me said mom im sorry i even mentioned getting sunburned lets not say another word about it roberta ill go to the store tomorrow night and no ill go mom you feel worse than i do the kids would start screaming could they go along and pretty soon everyone would forget how it all started and the next night id go to the store again and have to take just a peek at the spots that had peeled that day and it was like that for ten or twelve days i hated myself for being that way they are all more than solicitous about me when i am sick and i have been pretty sick i have had the doctor twice in the past month i didnt want him because i knew how it would turn out but they called him anyway the first time was about two weeks after i got hopped up i was eating supper when a piece of bread went down the wrong way and the next thing my plate was filled with blood the doctor came and listened to my chest and asked a lot of questions about what i ate and drank and how much i smoked and how many hours i slept and the following evening i had to go downtown for an xray and urinalysis and blood test they didnt show anything of course he called up a few days later while i was at work and gave roberta the report pretty disgusted he was i gathered there wasnt any lung infection the old scars were healed there wasnt anything at all wrong with me except that i smoked and drank too much didnt sleep enough and didnt eat the right things when the folks gave it to me with a lot of you see jimmie and i told you so i thought they were trying to kid me it was so goddamned funny i laughed until i got another coughing fit and everyone said oh jimmie thinks hes so smart he knows more than the doctor does and i finally stopped laughing they really were sincere they didnt understand i started going to bed not to sleep at ten oclock i didnt drink anything i consumed a lot of eggs and milk i smoked only five cigarettes a day well that week was about the same as any other except that i practically stopped sleeping and my digestion was worse than it had ever been i dont mean that the same things happened i mean it just wasnt any worse maybe some but not much on sunday morning about the time id gone to sleep i heard roberta up stirring around i sat up and asked her what was the matter she said nothings the matter im just going to church thats all but its only fourthirty i said well ive got to walk down there dont i or have you got taxi fare they were still running busses the last i heard im getting sick of riding busses id rather walk and i suppose they dont hold mass except at six oclock they dont for people with half a dozen kids to look after you know i cant go after they get up its never stopped you before you went at ten oclock last sun well this sunday im going now she went into the bathroom to fix her face and i tossed around for a few minutes and finally followed her ive been trying to figure out i said what you were getting even with me for she whirled on me surprised yes actually surprised for she didnt know im sure she only felt now spill it i said what am i charged with going outside while you were listening to walter winchell telling jo that she probably wouldnt die if she didnt brush her teeth three times a day passing frankie the bread before i passed it to you or what she stared at me getting whiter by the second you know i like frankie you know how good i try to be to mom i think you want them around i admitted even when youre pretending hardest that theyre a burden if you didnt want them im pretty sure they wouldnt be here they are closer to you than they are to me you can hold me in line with them you can hurt me through them just as they can hurt me through you you all hold that threat over me constantly say she snapped just what is this all about anyway ive got a little off the subject i said i wanted to know what you were getting even with me for not that it wasnt about time for you to break over youve been holding in much longer than i expected you to she began unbuttoning her dress all right i wont go no no i want you to go dont mind anything she slammed into the bedroom waking mack up and got in bed and of course he wanted to get in our bed too so she was in the position of not even being able to go to bed any more and i was sorry as hell but i couldnt help what id said i couldnt help it any more than she could help waking me up at fourthirty to go to mass i took mack out in the kitchen to fix him some breakfast but i dropped the skillet on the floor and that awakened shannon so pretty soon all of us were out there except jo and roberta and shannon and mack were chasing each other around the table and i was trying to explain what the trouble was well why didnt you let her go to church said mom good lord a persons got a right to their own belief shes got the money i know that she didnt give me back the change when she paid the paper boy it wasnt church it was and ill give you the change no no i dont want the change i was just saying that but dammit shes got money shes got my whole check shes just trying to make me oh i know how it is said frankie but its nothing any worse than the rows chick and i used to have or anyone else has jimmie just needs to put his foot down thats all that is as close as frankie can come to understanding relatively speaking frankie caught more of the spartan training and life than i did shes never known anything but trading punches with chainstore customers and keeping the desk between her and the boss and she pretty much believes that if you get the worst of a deal youll change it when you get tired enough of it i finally went back and pleaded with roberta until i was forgiven and she went off to mass at ten oclock at twelve just before she returned clarence and five other portuguese arrived wed asked clarence over for dinner because hed been so good about bringing us fish and the like but wed forgotten that it was this sunday and we certainly hadnt counted on these others they were cousins i believe when roberta walked in her mouth dropped open almost a foot she did manage to speak and smile before she went through to her bedroom but it was rather grim no our guests didnt notice it was beyond their understanding that any friend of another friend could drop into a third friends house and be unwelcome i remember clarence picked me up one sunday when he was supposed to have a date with frankie and shed gone off and he toured me around point loma we picked up fresh passengers at almost every block it seemed until we were packed in the car three deep we must have stopped at a dozen houses and no one seemed to think a thing of our all trooping in in fact i gathered that they would have been hurt if we hadnt we were pressed with port and theres nothing wrong with it the way the portuguese make it and if we declined that there was whisky or beer or something you did want and food big plates of chicken and ham and tuna pickles a half a dozen kinds of bread you felt that they had known you were coming for a week and had spent the time preparing for you thats the way they were are so they naturally couldnt see why anyone should be disturbed over only five unexpected guests tuna fishermen in case youre wondering do pretty well for themselves those who arent yanked overboard to the sharks or who dont die from exposure or exhaustion average from five to ten thousand dollars a year right now a number of them like clarence have been beached the government has bought up a lot of the boats for mine sweepers as i say though there they were and they had to be fed and we only had enough short ribs and browned potatoes for ourselves i went around to the little neighborhood grocery and got extra bread and a lot of canned meat it came to two dollars and all in all we had a pretty good meal mom didnt eat and frankie and i only made passes at things roberta stayed in our bedroom after dinner our friends didnt want to be rude and hurry away and they wanted to show their appreciation so one of them went out and came back with a case of beer and a box of cigars each of them drank a beer and smoked a cigar then leaving the balance with us they left they were very gentlemanly i am afraid we rather rushed them out the door well i wasnt drinking and i dont care for cigars and we didnt have any food the afternoon was practically gone too and roberta had wanted to go to a show before the night prices became effective we couldnt now of course we couldnt even afford matinee tickets and the house was upset and the kids were all demanding something to eat frankie bought some lunch meat and canned beans and they and we ate that but frankie thought roberta was blaming her for clarence and roberta was sulking and snappy and mom was hurt she got out the helpwanted ads and called about a dozen numbers where theyd advertised for housemaids and practical nurses i finally grabbed the paper out of her hands and banged up the telephone and tore out of the house when i came back around eight everything seemed to be lovely mack was asleep jo was reading roberta had made some fudge and she and mom and frankie were gossiping in a very friendly way mom said something about well heres our wild man but frankie said dont mom and roberta sat down on the arm of my chair and kissed me wheres shannon i said gone to bed why i dont know said roberta has she mom mom went back to look she looked through all the closets and in the bathroom shannon wasnt there oh shes probably gone over to the drugstore said frankie shell come home when she gets ready did you see her leave jo i said jo said she hadnt i had a premonition that something was wrong i began to get so uneasy that i couldnt sit still so roberta and i walked over to the drugstore we didnt go inside the druggist was nice enough that time i talked to him but i got the impression that he didnt regard me very highly roberta couldnt go in because she wasnt dressed she wasnt there anyway no one was there but the soda clerk we could see that from the door we walked back home and mom was waiting on the front steps part of her clothes are gone roberta sos that little dressing case of frankies roberta slumped mom i dont know where the child could be do you jimmie cant you think of anything i didnt know what to think once when she was three shed told us she was going away and leave us for good and traditionally wed said thats just fine and wed fixed her a lunch and packed some clothes for her to take thinking wed bluff her out of it you know it was almost a day before we got her back a brakie found her sitting in the caboose of a freight that was getting ready to pull out for chicago i dont know i said she didnt have any money did she not that i know of well i said thinking out loud that night we were down to the bay she kept wanting to get into one of the boats she said she bet she could cross the ocean if roberta screamed thats where shes gone shell be drowned i know shes drowned my baby my then she fainted mom and i lugged her into the house frankie started telephoning she called the travelers aid the police the transportation company she was almost hysterical for one of the few times in her life and i guess they could only halfunderstand what she was talking about because but i didnt wait for her to finish as soon as id dropped roberta i got out and headed for the bay as fast as i could run there wasnt any beach there there at the place where we had been just an embankment and a private dock and the mud flats that were already vanishing under the incoming tide forty or fifty feet out from the waters edge was a small rowboat one of dozens that were rocking and leaping with the waves something white clung desperately to its side and strangling faintly i could hear shannon calling i knew what had happened she had walked out there on the mud before the tide started coming in perhaps as the waves began to sweep and crash around her she had tried to walk back perhaps she had been trying to get the anchor undone and had fallen over now i shouted for her to hold on shouting i slid down the embankment to the mud and plowed into the water a wave swept me off my feet and i still kept shouting and i was strangled but i came up halfrunning trying to run and halfswimming toward the boat i got there holding on to the edges i worked my way around to the place where shannon was it wasnt shannon it was a piece of canvas i was plodding back up the hill so completely out of my head that i didnt know how cold i was when i met frankie coming down jimmie what on earth shes dead i said she fell into the bay and shes home in bed said frankie she was with the druggist bbut you know how much she gets on jos nerves well during all the excitement this afternoon jo wrote a note to the druggist on your typewriter and signed your name to it and asked him to look after shannon for a few days she said you were going to be out of town and you knew how much he enjoyed having her and so on it was a darned sight better than i could have written i dont blame the guy for being taken in as soon as jo saw all the commotion she was causing she got scared and told us about it but why i told you jo has a lot of plays shes working on and she didnt want shannon around at least thats all shed say she didnt have time to say much before she locked herself in the bathroom when we got home mom was standing in the door way very red and apologetic and a cop was sitting in a scout car out in front there was another cop coming down the steps and he was mad and apologetic and the old man in front of him a very dignified old codger was just plain damned mad he was cursing every breath he drew but the little girl in his arms was bawling so hard that you couldnt understand what he was saying frankie and i kind of scurried around the procession and just as we darted in the door another car pulled up in front a woman in a blue suit and an overseas cap emerged she opened the rear door of the car and a negro girl a cute little tot of six or seven with pinkribboned pigtails and an eartoear grin got out mom gritted her teeth and told me to take care of roberta ill settle this frankie started telephoning again i made for the bathroom roberta had an insectspray gun she was trying to shoot the spray through the keyhole and kick the door down at the same time she was shouting that shed kill jo if she didnt open the door and that shed kill her as soon as she did get it open jo wasnt saying anything she was sitting on the stool reading theres always something to read in the bathroom mom got rid of the travelers aid woman and frankie finished notifying people that the lost was found and between the three of us we dragged roberta into the front room and held her down until shed cooled off mom told about the cops and the old fellow with the little girl and the travelers aid woman with the little negro girl and it was funny funny unless you thought about it from my standpoint roberta began to giggle then to laugh mom made a pot of coffee for all hands and told me id better change clothes i went back and advised jo that it was safe to come out roberta shook her a little by one arm in a sort of absentminded way and that was all there was to it i didnt think it was funny and it wasnt just because id got a ducking out of the business jo wouldnt feel any different toward shannon tomorrow than she did tonight she wanted to get away from shannon and she couldnt so she was trying to get shannon away from her and it was pretty obvious that she didnt care how she did it as obvious as the fact that shannon wasnt going to change or make herself any less detestable to jo jo is resourceful she has the iq of a person ten years older and there is no use denying that she can be deadly hard and contemptuous of consequences i couldnt help thinking what a nineteenyearold girl might do to a i shut the idea out of my mind things werent that bad yet jo still felt a deep affection for shannon she was proud of her fighting prowess shed dress her up and drag her around the neighborhood to plays share things with her so no they werent that bad yet but they were bad enough long after she forgot kindnesses shannon would remember such things as being shoved off on the druggist under false pretenses remember and hold it against jo just as i hold things against marge now the violin lessons for instance her frailties and fawnings and simperings that got her the things i was denied yes i do hold it against her i may as well admit it it was about three in the morning before i went to sleep and i have been getting up at five since i started walking again i didnt think i could make it but of course i did theres nothing new about that so i wont go into details i wont take up the days individually moon was well ill use the present tense because things havent changed any except for the worse moon is distinctly cold theres no more going up to the office for a walk no more soothing drawl to wake me when i doze off im strictly on my own murphy doesnt speak to me vail ignores me which means naturally that i get the cold shoulder from busken also gross pretends friendliness but that only makes matters worse it only makes moon more cool and watchful i dont know whether he is angry because of the way roberta acted or whether he blames me for the considerable expense he was put to on our tia juana excursion or whether he is simply on the defensive because of frankie probably all those things figure in it to an extent the chief factor i believe however is that he thinks im trying to put something over on him he doesnt like it because i didnt discuss this new records system with him before taking it up with baldwin he cant conceive of a man going to all that extra effort merely to do a job that needed doing i should explain about the system theres nothing very original about it im simply taking the parts off the release books and putting them on cards the cards to be filed in chronological order this does away with any chance of duplications it makes it possible to locate a part and the data on it in a second instead of fifteen minutes and there is only one posting to make instead of from one to thirty as used to be the case there are two columns per card one for stockroom inventory one for the assemblies debits and credits are reflected within the balances not set out by themselves so the number of parts needed to complete ships can be obtained instantly by adding the two balances less any x items and subtracting the total from that amount x items are spare or extra parts the thing has one serious flaw or will have when i get it finished we issue parts and make shortage reports by positions my cards are filed in chronological order this will mean that to locate all the cards in one position i will have to search through the entire file of several thousand cards ill have to get around that some way ive been playing with several ideas but i cant seem to im off the track again i had to keep up our present records system i had to work on the new one i had to have inventories taken and no one would take them for me i had to work twice as hard as i had before and i felt half as much like working and i had to walk back and forth thats the way it was thats the way it still is we got a wire from marge tuesday saying that pop was pretty sick and we were all in an uproar for the rest of the week i mean we had the uproar from that in addition to our customary one mom felt that she just had to go but she knew that neither frankie nor i had the money and she wouldnt let us borrow any so what was the use of asking us twenty times a night if i wanted a drink i was sick for one and i didnt know what to do with my hands all evening sitting around without a cigarette but i followed instructions sunday night we got a longdistance call from marge a collect one because walter was slowly being hounded out of his job by bill collectors and hed told her she simply couldnt run up any more bills pop was better well enough to be taken back to the place and after shed divulged that she talked of absolutely nothing at all to the best of my knowledge for fifteen solid minutes roberta and i had gone to bed and mom was doing all the talking or listening roberta kept saying youve just got to stop her jimmie well never be able to pay it and frankie wont be able to pay it and well be stuck now you just go in there and tell her when mom came in to tell us what marge had said roberta turned over on her side with her back to her that made everything lovely then i came home monday evening and everything was lovely roberta couldnt wait until i got in the house to throw her arms around me and kiss me all over the face and the kids even jo were screaming with excitement mack was going away on the choochoo and shannon was going to buy a gun and jo was going to take dancing lessons mom got the opened letter off the mantel and gave it to me it was from the foundation they had a project which would interest me very much but before discussing that they were forced to mention the matter of last years research it was not impressive it definitely was not the style was stilted the subject matter superficial at least so it appeared to them but this was doubtless more their fault than mine they had given me a great deal of latitude in working and they had not made their wants clear in fact there had been some doubt in their own minds about what was most desirable now however i began to laugh roberta didnt understand isnt it nice honey im so glad for you i kept on laughing stop it i said youre killing me whats so funny said roberta smiling uncertainly i dont see why theyve discovered that old collection of mine the one that was published three years ago well all they want me to do i said is write like that write like i did then thats all and i got down on the floor and rolled the doctor came and went and i didnt know about it i only know that i went to sleep when i woke up i began pumping roberta as to what hed said and i couldnt get much out of her for a while except that he asked all about you and everything he didnt mention anything about three months of absolute rest did he i said well he did but when i told him i know i dont want you to work so hard jimmie i dont know what i can do about it though i know you dont i said have you got the whisky yet what whisky the whisky he told you to let me have i didnt know what kind he did say you mustnt drink too much jimmie what about cigarettes you mustnt smoke too many of them either thats damned good advice i said ill have to remember it i hope you will honey i get so worried one more thing he told you there wasnt anything organically wrong with me at all thats just what he said honey he said if youd just keep quiet and not worry and not get excited about things and eat more and not smoke and drink so much and why then id be all right uhhuh you will mind him wont you honey youll do it for my sake i nodded i couldnt laugh any more and i was too tired to get up and beat her william sherman dillon wellknown inmate of the h sanitarium and former millionaire oilman politician and attorney died at his residence early sunday morning after gorging himself on the excelsior from his mattress at his bedside was his wife who had to be his daughter margaret who didnt know any better and several imbeciles who wanted to taste the

together nothing more im not mad im not angry i mean im just eh can you make it a little louder pop i know we used tobut you dont need to keep your voice down in here let it roll out as it used to roll through the courtrooms raise it like thunder above the thunder of a drilling well shout and roar and pound the table as if you meant it and if anyone doesnt like it we will beat their goddam heads and leave them there for dead goddam their eyes no i guess it isnt a very nice song i forgot you didnt like songs like that what was it you liked i will take you home again kathleen humoresque on the banks of the wabash yeah nice violin pieces i never played the violin you remember have a drink have a cigarette aw go on little drink never hurt anyone remember i told you that once before remember that sunday morning when i fell down on the front porch and almost bit a hole in the planks and you carried me into the bathroom eyes filled with disgust yeah i knew what you thought of me i never got so drunk that i didnt and you always called cigarettes coffinnails going around with a coffinnail pasted in my lip pasted ill never forget that yes i drank until i never fell down and i smoked coffinnails but i never had gravy on my clothes no goddamit i never had that my clothes were a damned sight better than yours ever were i saw to that and i supported the family ten times better than youd ever done and my manners were better i didnt sit down at the table and gobble up everything in sight i didnt walk through doors ahead of people i didnt keep breaking in when someone else was talking goddam you i was better i showed you i was and i made you like it ahhh you never you never had a thought for anyone marge maybe after youd got all you wanted for yourself and shed saw away on that damn fiddle until the sky was green and youd sit with your eyes closed tapping on the arm of your chair and no one dared to say a word im not sore i just want to approach this thing from the the scientific viewpoint thats the right word scientific you should know you always knew and i had to stop and think and why in the hell shouldnt it have been that way ill tell you a thing or two those two years you were in mexicofinding a copper mine and sinking the shaft and getting the machinery hauled in by burro and then not being able to move your ore ha ha not being able to move it because the bandits had goddam well made hash out of the railroad and those two years i was wearing dresses and i laughed when i saw the sun or the trees making shadows on the grass or a sparrow hopping through the dust i laughed because it was good to laugh there was no bad only error and i slept long hours and i was still fat with motherfat then snow lay on the ground and in the cold room where mom watched by the window a little girl and i tossed a ball back and forth by the hour a ball made out of an old stocking and there was nothing so funny as when it rolled under the bed or fell behind the door and i wondered how the little girl could ever bear to stop and then the snow was green and we were like the others now not the big others but the others that were bigger than we were and we did not need sleds and warm boots and mackinaws barefoot we walked down to the grove and we laid sticks upon the ground and i sat on the ground with them holding back my laughter with my hand and the little girl frowned and she was the teacher and i laughed when the clods fell around us and the little girl ran this way and that and tried to climb the trees ran in circles crying and screaming until her eyes rolled white in her head ran because there was nothing to do but run ran because mom was at the house and she was not at the house and i laughed because everything was laughter there was the smell of fresh earth and yellow dust and a great pile that was a mountain of gold and the gold spouted downward from a pipe in the sky falling around my head mounting above my feet like golden sand above my waist and shoulders and i was looking into the mans eyes far above and he was looking down into mine and i knew that we were playing a game that he was going to hide me beneath the gold and i could not understand why mom came racing across the field nor why the mans teeth bared like a frightened dogs but i knew that everything was good and i laughed then the grass was white again and the stockingball was strange and no longer funny but there were other things of laughter the closet that was a cave and the bedsheets that could make a ghost and the frosted window that was a slate and the cracks in the floor and the snow sifting in at the eaves and the wind whispering in the chimney and the broom with its whiskers and an old newspaper between the mattress and springs and and a big bear that was tired and had to rest now and two little bears that had to go to sleep too and when you wake up itll be daylight many things and some to laugh at and then the grass again the snow and the grass and then only the grass and there was a long table where the others sat and mom going from the table to the stove from the stove to the table from the pantry to the table and we could not be seen because we had made kings xs in front of us and we smelled all the things and counted the bites the others took and sometimes i could forget why we were counting sometimes and it was funny and there was a cupboard and the little others the little others who were still bigger although we were bigger would reach down great brown loaves and smear thick slices from them with jams and jellies and watch you as you watched them stuff their mouths and then you were hiding behind the doorway the plate of tarts you had found in front of you the plate that had been so easy to find and then you saw the woman the woman who looked like mom and you smiled up at her because she was smiling and you did not notice the brown flecks that moved along your hands that swarmed up your arms and then there were needles in your throat and in the top of your mouth and your tongue was on fire and your lips puffed and the flecks marched in and out of your nostrils and they stood outward from your face like acrobats burying their furious fiery heads in your flesh and you knew that she did not know you thought that she knew something that you did not because you were crying and she was laughing and you tried to tell her and she only laughed then the leaves turning brown and the water in the pails slopping over your feet tickling them and your shoulders and arms drawn tight and numb tickled also the great baskets of fuzzy cobs for the stove tickled your chin and you laughed at that laughed at those things and then somehow the tickling became pain the laughter weeping and you no longer saw the shadows the sun the sparrows in the dust and the snow fell and your shoes were too tight and your coat dragged upon the ground and you wondered at the shortness and the longness of the days and you wondered why you could not sit in the room with mom and you were told why you were told and you could not understand there was food and warmth and sunshine and the sparrows hopping from foot to foot and you knew that these things were better than the things you had but when you told them they only laughed they laughed now they sometimes you laughed at the little girl but when mom noticed she pressed her lips together and shook her head and you began to know that it was not funny when after the little girl had sat for hours a day rigid frightened into immobility her eyes rolled back into her head and the urine spurted from her pantslegs it was not funny to you and you did not want them to laugh when you could not you hated them for being able to laugh and you began to hate her for making them then and then the straw cushions of the day coach the shaded lanterns swinging from their hooks and your image floating along in the night outside dancing along with the clicking of the rails and staring in at you sullenfaced laughterless and the woman across the aisle the friendly motherly woman with the ostrich plume cant you smile for me little boy my my what make urns look so mad what make urns look so mad god you with your fat dignity and me with my toes permanently overlapped and my body outgrown my organs so that i could never eat what i needed and what you might call my soul ha ha my soul turned inward because i knew how unbeautiful it was inarticulate and awkward and angry angry raging suspicious not pleasant to have under your eye something that could carry golf clubs and telegrams and be kept out of the way as much as possible and never mind it wasnt that jimmie i will have you know now that it wasnt you were so pale and brooding and i wanted you to be strong and mix with other boys i knew that marge had broken and i did not want you to oh never mind yes and when you got off the train i was shocked and outraged when i saw marge when i saw you when mom told me things i did not know there were people like that i suppose i did know but i had never thought of them as touching us me and mine i tried never to think of things like that they made me i know im the same way and i didnt know it would be so long there were so many things i hadnt anticipated the peons were bound to the land the dons no matter what we paid them they got no more than a subsistence so they didnt care when the shaft was halfway down they let a dumppail filled with dynamite drop and ten of them were killed by the time wed indemnified the dons and their families and yeah you told us all about it you had a tough time i guess but why the hell why the hell in the first place pop i dont remember but i can read and mom has told me and you have told me you were doing all right before why the when i went into law there were only two other things to go into medicine and schoolteaching but you were so damned good pop there wasnt a lawyer in the southwest that could come up to you not even bill gilbert or temple houston with his flowered vests and tengallon hat or the blind man gore or moman prewitt none of them i dont know whether it was what you said or the way you said it frankly i used to get so sick of reading and hearing about you when we didnt have but let that go i dont know whether you knew a hell of a lot of law although i dont see how you could have or no i didnt know the law as well as i should have and i knew that i could never know it i was afraid every time i stepped before a jury timid afraid for my client my size was with me and i had a good voice and i was terribly afraid of losing that was all i had it wasnt enough i lost six cases everyone has to lose some time only six out of a hundred and only six cases if i had known what i should have as it was i dropped four men through the trap and sent two over the road oh hell well i know how you might feel but you could have got out of it used it to step into something else you could have been united states attorney for i never pled a mans case unless i was convinced he was innocent i wouldnt try to convict him unless i was sure he was guilty you could have gone to congress i was looking back through an old newspaper todayone mom had saved a yellowed special electionedition and there was your picture everywhere bill dillon in a liontamers outfit and the western half of the state a cowering lion the western district a dove eating out of your hand a monkey on a chain sitting on your shoulder and there were pages about you they took you apart and put you together again and and it was a nonparty paper they couldnt find anything that wasnt good why didnt you yes i think i would have liked that i thought id told you why you told me so many things so many times i began shutting my ears pretty early i dont mean anything i suppose seeing so many people you forgot when youd told a story and when you hadnt well i was from the north and so was my campaign manager our fathers marched with sherman to the sea my middle name was sherman in all modesty i think i could have won without a manager but this man was my friend well our state particularly my district was strongly rebel in its sympathies however that wasnt the reason id never obtruded my full name and background i wouldnt deceive anyone about them i simply liked bill dillon better and i was content to let old hatreds die but i had a threecar railway train traveling over my district with a band and campaign workers and various influential people on election day each one of those railway cars blossomed forth with a banner william sherman dillon moreover the band played marching through georgia at every stop a double cross no i dont think so i dont like to think so i suppose my manager felt that the election was in the bag anyway and hed just let the rebels know the yankees had won another war of course we lost by a landslide no one could be that dumb why didnt you stop him you must have known about it as soon as it began it was my name marching through georgia was a good piece there was nothing dishonorable or indecent about it i couldnt deny my name or the piece that my father marched to in helping to liberate the slaves oh my god free the slaves it is what i believed right or wrong i believed in it you will find this jimmie to get even as far as i did you must believe in something believe in it so firmly that it is part of you so much that you would no sooner think of changing it than you would of twisting your arm out of shape or cutting off a leg you say that all the stinkers and grafters and nitwits that get into office and you tell me im not talking about them they can we couldnt yeah but pop the money us what right did you have to marry and bring children into the world and what right has anyone but i know i know how that is of course you dont plan it that way you think everything is going to be swell and yes and in his love for his family a man will do all the things that he shouldnt and do the one thing that he should when desperation drives him to it i was a lawyer a politician an insurance salesman a little bit of everything i didnt get into the oil business soon enough i was too old to learn the things one had to know to exist in it pop did did you hate us very much i did i had come in from the outside and i was different from you the things i had to tell bored you bored your mother i had learned to push in front of people to raise my voice to interrupt when an interruption seemed necessary in my environment food had not been dallied with and clothes had been to keep you covered and i was absentminded and there were times when i preferred reading to talking because i enjoyed reading and i knew what a terrible thing it is not to know enough and because i was different from you and would not be as you were you hated me and in selfdefense i hated you you ringed me in with my failures and each action of mine that was unlike yours you snatched up and laid on top of this ring and in time i was walled in with nothing but failure to look at and from my prison i peered cautiously out at you angrily at first then boldly then cautiously and i began to think perhaps i was wrong perhaps the things i thought right were wrong and the wrong right and i began to lose something called character yes i knew about the money i smelled the whores and the whisky but out of your eyes you despised me and i could not speak because there were no ears to hear and i was no longer sure you were as you have pointed out supporting the family ten times better i didnt mean that pop honest to god i didnt mean it you meant it and it was true true and damnably false but i couldnt be sure i couldnt talk to you perhaps but i dont hate you that much i dont hate you at all now food you drink mine was food when you are walled in you do something it must have been hell pop to have been a big man to have been something yes and may you never know that hell jimmie because i love you now i hoped you would die out there on the pipeline i had taken your money because i thought i would shame you by not taking it and you had shamed me instead i thought you were mean rotten to the core a dirty blob of scum that floated by virtue of its own filth you came back and i sank even farther within myself i wanted to talk to you pop i wanted to tell you about the stories i know that now i never understood you and i could not take the time for understanding there were so many things to do and but you came back it started all over again then you came to me and told me about the magazine about going to school and you made me pop you stood there before the empty house with the locked doors and without a penny in your pocket damned little anyway and there was a smile on your face as we drove off yes we understood each other then twenty years too late it was not your fault or mine circumstances had made us different and we were too long in adjusting ourselves well and then you married and settled in oklahoma city and i was working as a janitor there and it was like beginning life all over again like it but not the same the things i had to tell you were interesting true but i had lost my sureness of them and i could never bring it back and i was surrounded by doubts as to how far i should move a hand or foot and i had to think when i spoke because there were so many words to choose from and so many had been laughed and sneered at i would see your impatience when i began to speak and so i spoke less i was slow when i walked and so i pop but it was nice i cant tell you how nice how much i appreciated it we would sit there in your apartment in the evenings and i would close my eyes and jo would climb up onto my lap and roberta wouldnt notice when i called her mom and jo would be marge and you would be jimmie of course your voice was husky and you were big but a boys voice should be husky and he should be big and then later farther down the years jo and i would walk and we talked and walked the same jo worshiped you pop when she heard that you were dead she broke down shes in with roberta now would you like to see her jo roberta and we we talked and walked only one of us could go pop i sold the story but there was only money enough for one that was the reason i didnt come it wasnt because i was ashamed of hated you for eating the and we talked and i didnt mean it about marge i know now i know about the violin lessons i know why you pop and we not yet pop seventy years and thirtyfive years and we didnt speak and jo and roberta are coming and i want to and pop pop o christ just for a minute come to bed honey want me to fix you a little drink youve not had much want to take a drink and come to bed pop was here hes been talking to me there there honey he came to take me for a walk said jo he was shaved and he had a haircut and he had on a suit without any back mom came in early last week she shared expenses with some people who were coming this way in a car so the trip cost her only twelve dollars she was pretty much worn out they drove straight through without an overnight rest and she hadnt eaten much she couldnt have eaten very much she didnt have the money to do it with pop had a burial insurance policy for a hundred dollars but the stuff they furnished for that price wasnt even decent the cheapest thing she could get next to the hundred was a hundred and fifty and it wasnt at all bad so she had ordered that shed paid ten dollars down and signed a note for the other forty and then there had been the lot to buy and that was ten dollars down and a note for a hundred and ninety there were a lot of people there jimmie pops picture one of the old ones theyd taken when he was running for congress was in the paper and there was quite a long piece about him people id never seen before real welldressed people kept coming up and speaking to me and looking into the casket and there were all kinds of flowers how was pop dressed said jo never mind i said im glad you did things right mom well i felt like we couldnt do much less but weve got those notes to pay they come to twenty dollars a month all together and dont worry about that either i said well take care of the notes i expected roberta to stiffen up and say something and i was prepared to say something back but she didnt she didnt say what i expected her to no dont you worry a darned bit mom she said i thought as much of pop as i did my own father i only wish we could do more and i squeezed her hand and was proud of her and mom kind of took a deep breath as if shed just jumped a chasm frankie didnt say much she started to cut loose once but i stopped her with a look frankies motto is theres no time like the present and i didnt think mom was in any condition to hear what she had to say on top of everything else she was worried about marge walters about to lose his job or says he is and he blames it on marge the next night when i got home frankie was already there shed taken sick down at the office and mom had been told and she was all torn up about it i will say this we dont have many inhibitions you cant have when you live as close to each other as we do anyone can discuss anything at any time and everyone feels free to put in his two cents worth the powwow began as soon as i hit the door and it continued on into the night until the chief participants jo among them gave up and went to bed and of course we talked about everything under the sun except the subject at hand and of course we didnt get anywhere mom said i shouldnt have let frankie do it i should have been looking out for her and how should i know what she was doing i said yes mom how could we know said roberta we looked up all of a sudden and they were gone they told us theyd gone to get a tire fixed well jimmie ought to have talked to her mom said i warned him a long time ago that she was going to get into something like this oh mom said frankie you know i wouldnt have paid any attention to jimmie the way he what said roberta why not nothing said frankie i was just saying that i was twentyfive years old if i dont know what im doing by this time i never will well its a fine mess said mom her mouth working it just looks like theres always ssomething to oh whats the use of getting in such an uproar but what are you going to do you cant send for chick can you heavens no hes not that dumb well what then what do you think jimmie why the usual thing i suppose you mean a prescription or no medicine wont do you any good not if youre really caught youre sure you are are you i know i am i dont know why you had to get in such a fix said mom ill declare frankie the way i tried to youll have to get a doctor i cant seem to find out about any ive been kind of feeling my way around with some of the other girls but i told you wed find one ive never been i stopped and avoided robertas eyes im pretty sure we can find a doctor but itll cost to beat hell the way things are out here now theyre all getting by so good and they wont touch it unless you make it worth their while fifty dollars thats depression rates we might get it done for a hundred frankie flexed her bare toes and looked down at her fingernails i guess i could get it if i had to some loanshark would let me have it probably at ioo per cent interest youll not do anything of the kind said mom my goodness you talk as if hundred dollars grew on trees child well just make that fellow moon pay for it thats all jimmie you just tell him hed better get the money and get it quick or hell wish he had no dont do that frankie i dont want you to id look fine telling him he had to come through i said the first thing id know id be walking down the road talking to myself ive got about a month to go before im eligible for unemployment compensation i dont care what happens after that but im sticking around until then roberta looked at me oh she said so thats it thats what youve been thinking about when you sat around here evenings looking off into space if you think for a minute james dillon that im going to skimp along on fifteen or eighteen dollars a week when you could be making itd be around twenty and you could have it all id go off some place and kind of get straightened out and no sir no siree any time you go im going right along with you youre not going any place unless the family and all of us go too get that idea out of your head right now but if i could get away and start writing again i guess if you really want to write you can do it here you sold that last story didnt you well yes i sold it i sat in here and picked it out at fifty words a night and i average ten cups of coffee and a package of cigarettes to every line i didnt write i just kept reaching out and throwing down handfuls of words and i moved them around and struck out and erased until i secured combinations that werent completely idiotic and in the end i sold the thing to a fourthrate magazine i cant do it again i wont do it again i thought we were going to talk about me said frankie why jesus christ i said i dont see how you can ask me to what if youd been a singer not a great one but pretty good and you knew how a thing ought to be sung but your voice was cracked you needed some repairs before you could sing again it was in such bad condition that it was plain hell for you to listen to it and you knew it was at least as bad to others so you werent singing you couldnt and the effort of trying left you so sick and discouraged with yourself that if you kept on you would never recover well then under those circumstances would you still take engagements would you i would if i could get a hundred dollars said mom and roberta said jimmies always been like that mom why one week when he got five hundred dollars for two little old stories he was going around pulling his hair and swearing and saying that he was ruined that hed forgotten how to write youdve thought the world was coming to an end now you know you did jimmie you know youve always been like that well i guess i have i guess every writer has but there was a difference a difference that only another writer can understand oh see here said frankie cant we stick to the and thats another thing i said when and if i do start writing again theres going to be no more of this crap im getting plenty sick of writing with a picture of a cop and a kindergarten tot pasted on my paper carriage never again you understand all of you get that through your heads im going to write what i want to write and the way i want to write it another book i suppose said roberta lord deliver us said mom all right i said maybe i will write another book whats so funny about that nothing as i remember said frankie but i thought we were ill say it wasnt funny said roberta you remember mom hed come home from work at night and youdve thought he was walking in his sleep hed sit down and maybe hed speak and maybe hed just stare at you and if you said anything to him he wouldnt answer or what he would say didnt make sense and half of the time youd think hed been in a wreck his clothes all sloppy and his vest buttoned up wrong and cigarette ashes and coffee stains from one end of him to the other he always wore such good clothes too it just made me sick to look at him oh god i said yes oh god said roberta thats what i used to say hed finish his supper and it didnt make any difference how nice it was he never noticed and then hed fuss and fidget around and get his typewriter out and put it right down in the middle of the table before i could get the dishes off it didnt make any difference if id finished my coffee and then the dirtdaubers would start coming in i said there was thats what he called my friends mom dirtdaubers they were real nice ladies too women mother said jo will you shut your mouth there was that foureyed bitch i said that was always telling you you ought to make me help with the housework and that halfwit youd met over at the grocery store and that droopydrawered gal i dont think you ever told me her name i dont think she knew what it was herself and youd get in the other room and talk just loud enough so that id know you were talking but not so that i could hear what you were saying and it would go on by god for hours yes mom said roberta id have company in and i never knew it to fail thered be collectors coming to the door all evening and id have to go and talk to them with everyone listening i couldnt let jimmie go because hed either swear at them or promise them the world with a ring around it to make them go away i tell you oh i know how it was said mom i know how pop i got so mad i wanted to kill him sometimes all he was getting was a teeny little old fifteendollaraweekadvance and we just barely had enough money to get by on and he could have been making all kinds of money macfaddens wanted him to do a serial and gangbusters was calling him longdistance and sending wires and fawcetts was begging him to go to that governors convention and pick up ten or twelve little editorials on crimeprevention it wouldnt have taken any time at all and he could have gotten seventyfive dollars a piece for them well i finally gave in i said i rushed the book on out rushed it the devil said roberta you talk about being slow now you couldnt have been any slower and written anything at all i thought id go crazy and and sunday was the worst day of all we couldnt go any place wed hardly get out of bed before jimmies friends they werent my friends ill tell you would start coming in and theyd be there all day drinking coffee and scattering cigarette ashes all over everything and and youd have thought it was their place instead of ours theyd flop right down on my clean bedspread and sprawl around on the floors and go to the toilet and you could hear them going mom theyd go in there and leave the door wide open and holler in to the front room when they had anything to say and if they wanted something to eat they just went right into the kitchen and helped themselves there was one fellow that always wore dirty old corduroys and i know he hadnt had a bath in years and he was the worst one of all one sunday i had half a roast id been saving and he got it and brought it into the front room with the salt and pepper shakers and i want you to know that he sat there shaking salt and pepper all over my clean carpet and he ate every bit of it gulped it right down mom sitting right there in front of everyone just as unconcerned as as anything i never got so if i remember rightly i said he paid rather handsomely for everything he ever got from us he was just about the best painter in the southwest before he went to washington to do some murals he gave us a portable electric phonograph and a complete set of carl sandburg recordings and dont mention those records said roberta i never got so sick of listening to anything in my life i heard them from morning until night every time jimmie couldnt think of anything else to do when he was tired or nervous or cross and he always was when he was working on that crazy book hed get those records out and of all the disgusting filthy thats where he got that foggy foggy dew business and sam hall theyre old english folksongs you cant expect old english folksongs my eye i guess i know when i hear filth and i certainly heard those things enough well i got rid of them yes you got rid of them after i i got rid of them and the people and the book and after youd put me through all that the book wasnt published wasnt it i said id forgotten it must have been quite a disappointment to you well said roberta i couldnt help it funny how it slipped my mind i said but of course i wasnt really interested in the thing robertas mouth shut and there was the old helpless puzzled sullen look around it i dont know why i cant ever say anything youre doing fine honey youve said quite a bit jimmie said frankie give up what i want to know is i think thats the thing to do jimmie said mom plucking absently at a safety pin in her dress what give up i already have i knew that wasnt what she meant shed been having a long discussion with me even if i hadnt heard it and she had reached a satisfactory conclusion i knew it but i wouldnt admit it that is one trick of moms that exasperates me do what i said what are you talking about anyway why about the story we can send it to this last magazine they liked your work so well and we could have a check back inside of a month frankie would pay you back of course but it would save borrowing from i looked at her i looked at frankie and roberta jo was grinning everyone else apparently seemed to think it was all right mom had pulled a rabbit out of a hat she had dived down into the muck and come up with a diamond well i will be goddamned i said i will be damned by all the saints and christ and mary willingly by god they can damn me individually and collectively and i will not say a word they can come in pairs and squads and regiments in trucks and sidecars on roller skates and bicycles and they can damn me to their hearts content what in the name of i got the bottle out of the kitchen and had a slug dont pay any attention to him mom said roberta hes just acting crazy now look i said once and for all i am not jimmie youre spilling that stuff all over the rug i positively will not write another story ill peck horseturds with the sparrows jimmie you dirty thing ill swill slop with the hogs ill peddle french postcards ill bend over bathtubs jimmie ill adopt frankies triplets or whatever she has and give them the same thoughtful and tender rearing id give my own but i will not i utterly by god will not write another story i sat down again he means he wont write another story frankie remarked idly to roberta oh said roberta well said mom i dont see why not i choked on the drink i was taking mom said frankie well i dont said mom of course this isnt the best place in the world to write but you cant always have things just like you want them why look at the way jack london did jimmie he now just a minute i said i want to introduce a piece of evidence will you look at this for just a minute mom looked at the blackandwhite photostat and handed it back i dont see what your birthcertificate has to do with it it establishes the fact that i am not jack london it proves conclusively that i am not jack london but a guy named james dillon it youd better stop acting so crazy jimmie said roberta you know how youll get no youre not jack london said mom fumbling faster with the safety pin jack london didnt give up just because he didnt have everything right like he wanted it he wrote on fishing boats and in lumber camps and yes and i wrote in caddie houses and hotel locker rooms and out on the pipeline i wrote between orders of scrambled eggs and hot beef sandwiches i wrote in the checkroom of a dance hall i wrote in my car while i was chasing down deadbeats and skips i wrote while i was chopping dough in a bakery i held five different jobs at one time and i went to school and i wrote i wrote a story a day every day for thirty days i wrote i think wed all better go to bed said roberta come on hon i will not go to bed i didnt mean anything said mom i was just saying you didnt read your jack london far enough he began slipping off the deep end when he was thirty well im thirtyfive thirtyfive can you understand that and ive written three times as much as london wrote i lets skip it said frankie you skip it skip through fifteen million words for the writers project skip through half a million for the foundation skip through the back numbers of five strings of magazines skip through forty fifty yes seventyfive thousand words a week week after week for the trade journals skip through thirtysix hours of radio continuity do you know what that means thirtysix hours did you ever sit down and write thirtysix hours of conversation conversation that had to sparkle had to make people laugh or cry had to keep them from tuning to another station did you did you please jimmie of course you didnt why should you what would it get you what did it get me shall i tell you youre damned right i shall it got me a ragged ass and beans three times a week it got me haircuts in barber colleges it got me piles that you could stack washers on it got me a lung that isnt even bad enough to kill me it got me in a dump with six strangers it got me in jail for fortyeight hours a week and a lunatic asylum on sunday it got me whisky yes and cigarettes yes and a woman to sleep with yes it got me twentyfive thousand reminders ten million times a day that nothing id done meant anything it got me this this extraordinarily valuable this priceless piece of information that im not i opened my eyes and said jack london i was sitting on the divan roberta had her arm around me frankie was holding out a drink im sorry i said i guess i slopped over i didnt mean you hadnt worked hard said mom i know how hard youve worked youd better go to bed mom said frankie im going to turn in as soon as no im all right i said now that weve buried the dead lets take up the living what do you think wed better do frankie well what do you think about moon i dont know he spends a lot he might not have it yeah i know you could borrow the money if you had to a hundred bucks is a pretty stiff loan for a shark i know that too i could get part of it though maybe i could get part of it one place and part another youre not going to though said mom and thats final i couldnt see at the time why mom was so dead set against it frankies got money from sharks before and this was certainly an emergency why not mom because theres other because that moon can just be made to come across what if he wont well hell have to oh for well we dont have to decide anything tonight i said we dont even know of a doctor yet anyway we all went to bed and jo kept getting up to go to the toilet and roberta lay taut and silent hurt now that the excitement was over after a while jimmie yes are you asleep yet i wanted to say yes yes im asleep but i knew i hadnt better no honey i said im still awake well jimmie yes did you mean all those things you no honey i was just raving you know how i get you said some pretty mean things jimmie i patted her on the bottom her nightdress was up and it was bare she turned facing me you really didnt mean them no and you really do love me thats one thing you can count on no matter what i say or do or where i am ill always love you and it was and it is true i had my mind on that the abstract and i didnt notice when she wiggled closer you dont act like you loved me im sorry honey you you never kiss me or pet me any more im sorry dear well you dont jimmie sorry she leaned over me and pressed her lips against mine in a long kiss and her shoulder straps were down and one of her breasts slid under my armpit good night jimmie good night honey thinking and worn out and i had no more emotion to spend i was thinking of why i couldnt talk to frankie of how she had got to be like this a little girl who was big for her age a little girl with yellow hair who was thirteen in years and eighteen in size whose eyes were as innocent and blue as a tenyearolds walking down commerce street the little girl and i who was that woman that spoke to you jimmie no one you know lots of women dont you jimmie every time we go down the street forget it one of the girls in the coffee shop wants to come out to our place and live i told her she couldnt sleep with you because pop dont talk to those tramps a man gave me a whole dollar last night and hes going to give me another one tonight can i put one of them in my bank i guess so and he said if id meet him after work hed give me five dollars he said you point the sonofabitch out to me ill have him rode but hes a nice man jimmie he said he knew you and it would be all just point him out and a big girl living with relatives taking magazine subscriptions from door to door selling christmas cards going to school more and more infrequently a big girl who could walk into a garage or a barber shop or a warehouse and hand back as good as she was given a girl who studied harpers and who read the new yorker who memorized good english and wisecracks because they were valuable to have and a woman an overweight overdressed woman with blondined hair and too much lipstick who sat behind the cash register in coffee shops and barbershops and cigar stores hiya jack what you got up your pantsleg besides your sock say frankie you got to hear this one this onell slay you just a minute how do you do mr pendergast was everything satisfactory very something for you thank you so much now what were you saying jack a woman who knew there was something wrong and wanted to get out of it a woman who would marry the first man who came along to get out of it a woman who could never feel anything very deeply regard anything very highly i sat up roberta raised her head where are you going just to the bathroom oh when are you coming back do you have to go no i just wondered i got my cigarettes out of my pants and went into the bathroom i stood in front of the mirror and blew smoke out at myself and looked sinister and heroic and solemn no reason i just did it i sat down on the stool and started thinking and somehow a crazy story id read came into my mind crazy isnt the right word it was by a writer named robert henlein and it was one of the finest pieces technically ive ever read heres the gist of it an inmate in a private nuthouse is talking to a psychiatrist the latter is drawing him out trying to get at the basis of the persecution complex from which the inmate is obviously suffering the lunatic is firmly convinced that the whole world is in a conspiracy to make him do things he doesnt want to do everyone is plotting against him and they always have when he was a little boy the other children dropped their games when he came around and stood off by themselves whispering and looking at him when he entered a room where adults were talking they stopped until he had left the psychiatrist laughs well theres nothing very unusual about that oh but that isnt all says the nut when i entered college they wouldnt let me study the things i wanted to they made me study the things that but you had to be equipped for a job says the psychiatrist their judgment of what you needed to fit into life was probably better than yours no it wasnt insists the lunatic when i got out i got a job and it didnt make sense and they made me stay there against my will they who are they anyhow well my wife and my employer and all the others maybe you were in on it too i see says the psychiatrist but how do you mean the job didnt make sense why it just didnt i slept all night so that i could be rested enough to go to work in the morning and i got up and ate breakfast so that id have strength enough to get through until noon and at noon i ate so that id have strength enough to get through the afternoon and i went home at night and ate and slept again so that i could go to work the next morning and the money i made was just enough to keep me strong and rested so that i could work so that id be strong and rested so that the psychiatrist throws up his hands but those things are true of any job no no says the patient no theyre not there is work that does make sense i know there is if i could just find it they are keeping me from it they keep putting things in my path making me see things that arent real trying to make me do something i dont want to do the psychiatrist shakes his head sadly and gets up and walks out then comes the final scene the mans wife his employer his college teachers and a host of other demons yes demons are in conclave there is a plot hes getting on to us says the wife i think hes going to run away again whatll we do this time let him go says the psychiatrist well get him back we always get em back i guess i dont tell the thing very well but if you read it itll stick in your mind for days you get to wondering jimmie i jumped roberta was in the doorway her breasts were completely bared and her gown was hiked up but i was thinking and she often sleeps that way with the thing just tied around her middle when the weather is warm her breasts are so full that the gown bothers her it seems and she likes to spread her legs wider than it will allow so she sleeps that way ive asked her why she doesnt do without a gown because theres not much left to expose but she says she gets cold there and maybe she does my unspoken theory is that she simply knows the value of understatement arent you ever coming to bed oh sure right away well come on then she went back into the bedroom and i sat there a moment longer thinking about that crazy story that wasnt crazy and then she hollered again and i went in to her but i was still sort of dreaming i lay down and and there was a fury upon me sobbing mad with impatience shivering with heat an angelfury with creamyellow thighs who had made herself over and who would never be able to unmake herself a frankenstein monster with silky lashes and a white smile with breasts that turned outward with their fullness you better you always better you hear me you better what would i do if not now dont answer now i dont think i had realized until then how impossibly hopeless it all was i have been riding with gross i couldnt very well get out of it he knew that i didnt have a ride and he offered to haul me back and forth for nothing and i needed a ride i couldnt have made it walking much longer i take a quart vacuum bottle of coffee to work instead of a pint and what with the knowledge that everyone there would like nothing better than to catch me asleep i have kept from dozing off but i couldnt walk any longer im sure of course that gross isnt putting himself out any merely to favor me im just about to get my new system set up although ive not solved that one problem i spoke about and he knows that baldwin is pleased with it and in me i think he sees someone on whose coattails he can ride but clubbing up with gross hasnt helped me any with moon personally that is i think he is doing all he can about frankie he wasnt at all bad when i first spoke to him about it he stood rapping my desk with a ruler looking off absentmindedly toward the finalassembly line at last he said youre sure it was my fault dilly im sure i said and nothing more when youve lived like we have when you put yourself on a spot of this sort youve got to take that kind of question i guess it was all right he said how much do you think itll take a hundred dollars anyhow he nodded you think you can get it done for that when my wife was im not sure i said i just supposed we could well i think i can get a hundred you ought to be able to i said taking courage he nodded again it looks that way dont it dilly im running better than seventyfive dollars a week but im paying for that car and we bought us a houseful of furniture here a while back and ive been sending money to my brothers folks it looks that way but when you try to lay your hands on even a hundred dollars all in one chunk its not easy well have to have it moon i said id try to get it im pretty sure i can well it was a couple days later that i started riding with gross and as soon as moon learned of it he got me off in a corner did you tell gross about this of course not i said why the hell should i moon he didnt say anything for a minute and when he did he didnt answer my question are you after my job dillon after your i burst out laughing are you or not he was serious i couldnt believe it but he was no moon i said i positively am not why what in the name of god would i want with your job youre drawing seventyfive cents an hour im getting twice that much but i dont like this work moon youd like a dollar and a half an hour wouldnt you not if i had to stay here to get it im a writer at least i used to be if i took your job itd mean i couldnt ever get away i wouldnt have the excuse that i could make more writing it would be the end of my writing how much were you making before you came here on this fellowship you told me about twentyone hundred a year well but my job pays almost twice that much i know moon i said but but what he said staring at me somberly why goddammit didnt i just tell you keep your voice down are you trying to tell everybody in here about it im through talking i said think what you want to a few days later he came around again if you dont want my job what are you working so hard for whyd you want to learn blueprints and set up this new system and would you rather i hadnt i said would you rather i just sat here and let things go to hell like they were going if you would just say so im getting pretty goddamned tired of working my head off for a bunch of numbskulls who dont appreciate it and wont lift a finger to help me i just asked dilly and i told you think what you want to do what you want to i am pretty confident of one thing he doesnt dare fire me he might make things so uncomfortable for me that i couldnt stay but i dont think he would even do that weve been inquiring around you see and dollars seems to be about the minimum for the job we need doing and moon is undoubtedly figuring on my paying a good share of it if i lost my job i have already seen one man crowded down the line a new man in our department it was a vicious and fascinating piece of business he was an honorgraduate from high school perhaps that was the trouble perhaps he was a little too eager to show his knowledge of things in general for that is one way of getting your ears knocked down very quickly in here knowledge is taken for granted here you dont flaunt it you use it he hadnt been here three days before i was aware that everyone had it in for him and that he wasnt going to last moon say would set him to sweeping the floor when he got up in the purchasedparts department busken would call him over to help shelve some parts the kid would have worked at this for an hour or so when moon strolled around i thought i told you to sweep the floor well mr busken asked me to well hurry it up it was then buskens turn all right go on i wont ask you to help me again why whats the matter mr busken go on i didnt think youd go around griping to moon just because i asked you to give me a hand naturally that alarmed the kid he didnt want people mad at him he insisted on staying and helping working frantically so that he could still get the floor swept and invariably when he did get the broom in his hands again there was murphy or gross needing assistance if he hesitated hey moon whats the matter here cant i have a little help sure you can grab ahold there shorty you wont get your hands dirty if the kid didnt hesitate but grabbed ahold at once when are you going to get this floor swept well mr mur right away sir that night of course the floor wouldnt be swept dolling brought the kids dismissal slip down the third week of his probation it said general attitude sullen helps others unwillingly competence seldom completes assignments remarks wholly unsatisfactory and it was all true but i dont think a brighter faster betternatured boy ever walked into the plant it is even easier to crowd a man down the line in the assemblies the parts for the different positions are being changed constantly timestudy may learn that a part that has been put on in position can be better handled at position and when a new part is turned out it may have to be put on at the door or in the yard because the planes have progressed that far and they cannot be returned say to position where the part would normally be integrated under these circumstances it is obviously easy to make a competent man look the opposite and when he is called on the carpet he has no alibi there has been another shift in parts he has no more to do than he should easily accomplish i feel extremely sorry for the timestudy men life for them is utter hell they go from department to department timing the workers in their various operations and no one likes to be timed and everyone makes it as difficult as possible the worker may flatly refuse get the hell away from me i dont want to be bothered now and the timestudy man may not reply in kind or call the foreman except as a last resort he must time the process yes but it will be very bad for him if he causes a skilled worker to throw down his tools and walk out anyone can tell time everyone cannot run a rivetgun or assemble a control column he laughs pleasantly got to keep em flying huh want me to drop back after lunch no answer ha ha like to have me drop back after lunch i dont give a damn what you do he comes back after lunch all set ha ha fine fi get away from me please ive got to you heard me clear out the timestudy man calls the foreman im sorry your man wont let me time him oh yeah whats the matter bill aw the sonofabitch keeps getting in my light mac yeah look you you go back to the office and tell em if they want this process timed they can send a man down that knows how to do it now scram and so it goes timestudy men come and go rapidly today i saw one a poorly dressed hungrylooking fellow of about fortyfive who probably will not be here very long someone had constructed a replica of a sanitary napkin from gauze and waste dipped it in red paint and stapled it to the back of his coat he could see the men grinning as he passed and feel something flopping and splashing against his rear but he couldnt see it or reach it so he concluded i guess that the men were merely in a good humor and that the other was his imagination when the office sees him i imagine theyll let him out if not id think hed be too humiliated to come back down in the foundries it is even worse the drophammer men like nothing better than to catch a timehound in the narrow aisle between their implements then it is bang bang bang and the jolts are enough to throw him off his feet and the pressure enough to deafen him he has whitehot washers dropped into his pockets oily waste is speared to his coattails and set afire and he may find the guards may find when he leaves that night that he is carrying out some expensive tool or part yes they know the office knows but no one is going to discharge or even reprimand an essential worker because of a timestudy man i said once before that you could get away with anything here if you were good enough but i didnt mean it literally i do when i say it now i have never yet gone into the toilet when there was not someone asleep on the stools the sleepers were particularly numerous during the afternoon the guards used to take their badgenumbers and it would mean a threeday layoff but now they wake them up and that is the end of the matter it used to be that you could hardly find a place to smoke at noon because of the restricted areas and planes in the yard now however if the guards see you smoking where you shouldnt be and they dont go out of their way to see you they approach very slowly so that you will have time to finish before they arrive no more tickets are handed out for such things as running in the aisles the incessant practical joking is generally winked at a riveter will take a paper cup of water and pour it into the tailcone where his buckerup lies prone and helpless the guard sees it takes a step forward then remembers and turns away i feel pretty sorry for the guards too i think i told you of the guard who accosted me when i first went to work here well a few days ago he came up to my window and he was no longer in natty khaki and sam browne he was wearing unionalls just another parts boy i looked at his badge what do you want with noseover posts theyre not put on at your station well my leadman sent me after them who is your leadman he told me i gave him a suspicious stare where is he now well i dont know just where right now better find him and make it snappy were all here to work you know yes i think he did recognize me and i felt ashamed of myself afterwards hed already been punished enough for lacking tact and diplomacy i dont know i dont know why i cant like the job better get interested in it working conditions couldnt be better the pay is at least fair everything within reason that can be done for the worker is done were turning out four planes a day now but we have the men to do it with the speedup has slowed down i dont have to worry about my past bobbing up its not pleasant to work in a department where the others are unfriendly but ive worked where the atmosphere was much colder and not minded particularly i minded but it wasnt enough to make me want to get up and pull out of course those were writing jobs and still i dont know out in the yard at noon when a plane goes over everyone looks up they stop eating and talking to look up at a plane that they have seen in the plant at least a thousand times and the counterparts of which are all around them and then the discussions about torque and drag and potential efficiency and the arguments anent the merits of liquid and aircooling and the minute comparisons of the different kinds of rudder tabs and shockstruts and tail pants and god knows what all and the little groups drawing diagrams in the dust and slapping their notebooks and well goddammit its crazy its infuriating youd think there was nothing more important in the world than oh sure i do know it doesnt make sense to me any more than polishing a paragraph for two hours would make sense to them i dont want it to make sense if it ever does i will give up that will be the end yes and i am going to get out of it i will get out of it as soon as i see frankie clear of this mess i am clearing out they can all do what they please but i am leaving i mean it if i only knew what to do about roberta she is the main problem i had always thought before that i was the only one who was that way but now i know that she is too and i dont know what she would do i know there would never be any other man for her and jo has been extremely nervous lately she seems to sense that i am about ready to take flight and she will not leave me alone for a minute she is on the arm of my chair squeezing my hand bringing me things and talking to me from the minute i get home until i go to bed we can hardly make her go to bed any more before i do i dont know what jo would do if i left i am the only one there who understands her and speaks her language then shannon i think i could do something with shannon if i had the time perhaps if i could get her off by herself for a few hours each evening i dont see how i could but and mack is trying to learn some new jokes they still deal with biteys and theyre hardly hilarious but if he doesnt have anyone to encourage him hell never make any progress mack looks a lot like the pictures of me when i was his age hell grow into one of those big slow extremely sensitive boys and hes going to need a sense of humor hes going to have to have it and moms heart has been bad id hate to think that anything i did made it worse made it fatal ive been thinking i might take a room some place here in town something just big enough for a typewriter and a table and a bed i could do my own cooking and washing so it wouldnt cost very much i dont think id mind writing another thriller if i knew i could use the money to get into some real writing roberta could have my unemployment compensation and id finance myself with a few puips of course it would be kind of difficult living right in the same town with them and not seeing them and if i did see them why oh i dont know things could be worse i guess mom has been hinting that marge should come out walter has had his salary attached by about a dozen different creditors and theyve barely got enough to live on and hes treating her pretty wretchedly it seems but i put my foot down there i simply had to well there goes the telephone but moon is catching it and evidently im going to catch it about something i wonder you tell your mother not to call me here any more dillon my mother yes your mother if she calls down here one more time why why youll shell i got off my stool what well she just cant do that dilly were not supposed to get outside calls in here you know that if thatd been a girl on the switchboard that didnt know me i didnt know mom was going to call you if i had idve told her not to im doing all i can dilly you know i am moms getting worried moon so am i you cant let these things go forever i know it dilly i went to two different loan places last night and i couldnt do any good i owe so much money they dont think im a good risk besides theyre afraid i might be he broke off the sentence and a look that i could not define came into his eyes dont say anything more now your fr gross is watching when gross drove me home he asked me what moon and i had been talking about gross isnt at all reticent about inquiring into things that he wants to know particularly when they are none of his business nothing i said i thought i heard him say something about your mother well does moon go to your house quite a bit no youve got a sister aint you i cant like the guy i feel sorry for him but i cant like him so of course i had to be thrown right up against him where i couldnt get away what did you eat for breakfast i said did you and your wife get together last night how much rent do you pay what kind of underwear do you have on do you think itll rain and what in the hell will you do about it he grinned sheepishly i guess im always butting in where i hadnt ought to be i just like to talk we didnt say anything more until we stopped in front of the house i do appreciate riding with you i said are you sure a dollar a week is enough oh sure id carry you for nothing dilly youre the only friend i got in the plant see you in the morning then i said good night mom was peeling potatoes and by the way her hands were moving i knew that she was building herself up to jump me before i could say anything to her i called that moon fellow she announced i told him hed better show up here with that money or it would be too bad the idea of a married man running around moons doing all he can mom i said and you mustnt call him down there any more itll just make him mad he wont get any madder than i am said mom but you mustnt mom you might cause him to lose his job then we would be in a pickle i thought you said they thought so much of him they wouldnt let him quit they do they did but if someone keeps calling down there when hes trying to work well if he dont want to be called hed better get the money i poured myself a drink theres no use arguing i guess no theres not well have to face it mom moon cant get the whole two hundred and fifty i think itll be a darn tight squeeze for him even to get half of it we may as well make up our minds that frankie is going to have to borrow part of the money mom rinsed the potatoes covered them with water and placed them on the stove she got hamburger out of the icebox and began making it into patties shell have to mom i said she cant jimmie why not she always has borrowed when well mom turned and looked at me defiantly shes got to borrow money for marge to i put my glass down with a bang mom are you out of your mind how the hell what will we oh my shes already sent it jimmie and if marge isnt welcome here if you cant make a place for your own sister when youve got a good job and her veined red hands went up to her eyes and i did not curse or storm the curtain had risen again and i saw those hands transforming bits of bread into fish and steamboats saw them slipping food from her plate food that she was starving for to take up to the cold room so that a little boy there might laugh a little longer and i saw the little girl again smiling patient tossing a ball by the hour a ball made from an old stocking shell be welcome mom i said anything ive got she can have and i meant it and there wasnt much else to say yes the children always did stand off by themselves and whisper when i approached and grown people did stop their talk when i went into a room well theres nothing very unusual about that i didnt know how to play i was shy and sullen and i made people uncomfortable the first thing that really meant anything that inclined me to think that something or someone was working against me happened when i was fifteen after id been hopping bells for a few months i didnt go to school that morning i waited downtown at the streetcar stop where i knew pop would get off and when he did i grabbed him and took him into a restaurant into one of the booths he was freezing up toward me even at that time but he saw that i wasnt drunk just excited and he came along pop i said did you ever hear of a man named s i knew him very well said pop he and i and president harding crossed the country together on hardings private train lets see gaston means was in the party too and jake hamon never mind that now i said impatiently what became of s no one knows he was president of a small insurance company after hardings death he disappeared with a million and a half dollars in negotiable securities they never found either him or them how much would the bonding companyor the security company or whatever it is pay to get that stuff back pop how much i should think theyd pay per cent gladly say a hundred and fifty thousand thats the way he figured it i said our share would be seventyfive thousand thats what he told me pop pop looked at me sharply who told you s hes here in town pop hes at the hotel and hes on the snow i took him up a i took him up some cigarettes last night and he kept looking at me and asking questions and finally he asked me if my name was dillon and if you werent my father and he said you were the only man in the world hed trust and pop hell tell us where the stuff is hidden and all he wants is half of the reward and a promise that they wont prosecute him and and itll be all right wont it pop youll do it wont you i was afraid that hed say no because being broke hadnt changed him a bit but hed been a lawyer and he knew that things like that were done every day and it was a lot better for the stockholders to get part of their money back than none at all so he said yes hed act as intermediary and then he began to get as excited as i was hed put the money in trust for me he said well maybe hed borrow a little of it if i wanted him to and i said oh no pop i want you to handle it all and he straightened up looking kind of proud and pleased and sure of himself and i knew that everything was going to be all right between us for all of us that it wasnt too late then to make a new start i was supposed to be standing on the corner of eighth and houston streets at seventhirty that evening alone s would come by in a rentacar and pick me up and we would drive from there to the trinity river viaduct on the north edge of town where pop would be waiting s was no sucker even if he was walking the mountain tops in case of a doublecross id be thoroughly mixed up in the deal another lousy bellhop trying to pull something crooked he trusted pop yes but he trusted him a lot more with his son as security i went home i told mom i was too tired to go to school and to wake me up at six that night i wanted to go to a show pop and i thought that story was best mom wouldnt understand things and shed be scared and marge might spill something well mom called me at nine oclock that night after pop had got worried and phoned the house mom said i was sleeping so soundly and she guessed i needed my rest a lot more than i needed to see a show that was the last of s needless to say he checked out without bothering to take his baggage i went to lincoln i enrolled in the college of arts and sciences which was the logical the only practical place for me to enroll then i went around to the two newspapers and applied for a job and they laughed at me heartily why they had applications from graduate students in journalism who were glad to work for the experience i went to the western newspaper union not knowing that they only handled boilerplate stuff and they laughed heartily also but a girl in the office took pity on me one of the biggest farm journals in the country was in lincoln why didnt i apply over there i did i walked in there in my brown kuppenheimer suit and my snapbrim stetson and i was carrying a tweed topcoat id paid ninety dollars for and the pbx girl said why certainly any of the editors would be glad to talk to me i was ushered upstairs and introduced to a young man of about my own age and he said yes it was entirely possible that they could do something for me he was going to the university himself several of the editors there were just a moment and hed call some of them in he called them in and by god they acted like they were glad to meet me they wrung my hand and looked at me like i was something good to eat and they insisted that i come out to the house for dinner the next day sunday well hell i didnt know about those things i supposed maybe they all rented a house together to cut down on expenses two of them came by in a swank roadster and got me and they took me out to the house and it looked like they had about a hundred other guests and i began to get wise then that id put my foot in something but i still didnt know what it was all about i didnt know until id had a swell dinner and five or six stiff drinks until id been shaken by the hand and slapped on the shoulder and talked to by about fifty guys of the kind that id always wanted to talk to or thought i had then in a small room upstairs with half a dozen of them crowded around me encircling me but dont you like us dillon why why sure and i appreciate your being so nice to me but but what its surely not the money is it youre the type of man whos used to the better things of life you couldnt get decent board and room for much less well but i really need a job right now didnt we tell you wed help you thats what were here for to help each other and im already enrolled in arts and sciences we get enrollments changed every day dont need to worry about that at all and even if you werent coming in with us you ought to switch to agriculture you can still get english and journalism and and youll really be prepared to do something then you know how it is yourself you tried to get a job on the newspapers here the only place that could give you a any encouragement was the farm magazine i surrendered in the end i hocked half of my wardrobe to get the immediate cash necessary to be pledged and they enrolled me in the college of agriculture and i had a swell time from then on oh swell the good brothers taught me how to clean out the furnace and wash dishes and every six weeks the scholarship committee applied barrel staves to my backside in an exasperated effort to make me remember the distinguishing points between rye and barley or something else equally nonsensical and i cut open the guts of turkeys looking for symptoms of blackhead and i felt hens butts and tried to guess how many eggs they would lay and they didnt like it and i cribbed so many problems in farm physics that i lost any sense of being a cheat well how could they get me a job on a farm paper dumb as i was they got me a job in an allnight restaurant i got the others myself hell in case youre interested is actually the college of agriculture of the university of nebraska you can take my word for it i was going with lois she was wearing my pin we hadnt started fighting yet i was very much in love with her and very humble i knew that when i became uncomfortable or wanted to lash out it was only because of the money angle because i was on the defensive i knew that if i could show any tangible assets if i could assure her folks that i would complete my four years and have something for emergencies their attitude would be completely different they werent unreasonable they simply didnt want her to lose her head over someone who already had more than he could take care of and who admittedly acted on impulse rather than logic i knew this and then i knew they were right and i almost didnt open the letter i thought someone was trying to sell me some stocks and bonds and i didnt want any but i did open it and it was from blackie martin blackie and i hopped bells together he was a kind of standoffish kid and he didnt stay at the hotel long but hed always liked me and after he went to new york hed dropped me a card now and then i didnt always write back the only time id written since id been in lincoln was right after i joined the fraternity when i wrote everyone i could think of on the fancy house stationery i suppose he got the idea that i was in the money he knew something he wouldnt say how but he knew it cord motors was going to take a hell of a jump i was to get on it with as much as i could on as narrow a margin as i could i wecould clean up hed trust me to give him his split he knew i was honest well i started to laugh it off but i couldnt do it something told me that it was straight goods blackie wasnt given to popping off and i knew hed always liked me everything fitted he was working for a broker he was on the level and he liked me and i had a hundred and fifty in the bank id been saving it up to repay the studentloan id gotten when i first enrolled in school the thing was long past due and theyd been riding me pretty hard id even drawn a check for the full amount the day before and id intended mailing it but they didnt have anything but threecent stamps at the confectionary across from the house so i hadnt id be damned if id spend an extra penny for those birds well i went down to the bank and i drew a check to cash for the hundred and fifty and the guy that had been standing behind me when i got it followed me right to the door and stopped me he was one of those big bony guys with a head like a quailtrap and a little button of a nose and a cometoheaven smile and the seat of his blueserge pants looked like hed been carrying books in it i dont know where guys like that come from i dont think theyre born and i cant figure out how they always get on the boards and committees of this and that and the other how they always manage to run things they do though by god ha ha dillon he giggled ill bet you were looking for me werent you now you dont need to get sarcastic i said im going to pay your damned loan dont swear dillon i might lose my temper ha ha give me that money ha ha i said ill send you a check tomorrow ive got to pay a hospital bill with this you wont need a hospital now dillon ha ha and he took the money he clawed it right out of my hand i dont know which made me maddest at the time losing the money or walking into a fast one like that i knew by the end of the week when cord jumped twentyeight points in a day if id had shares at a dollar margin but i didnt have when blackie martin wrote me i marked the letter moved address unknown and sent it back i know i mustnt start thinking that way but its hard not to at times i didnt need anyone to help me ive never wanted anyone to all ive ever asked is to be left alone and no one will ever leave me alone someone is always doing whats best for me making me do what i should do from their standpoint but i mustnt begin thinking that it was deliberate that baldly there is a plot against me it is becoming harder not to but i know i must not i must not moon hung up the phone before he could say it i said i cant stop her moon did you tell her id tried every place and couldnt get the money yes i told her well what does she keep calling for then shes old moon and shes mad and worried you know how youd feel but it doesnt do any good to keep calling dilly itll just get me run out of here and if im fired with that on my record i cant go to work any place else not in any kind of a job i dont suppose she cares much moon the moment the words were out of my mouth i knew id said the wrong thing but it was true moms viewpoint was that she had everything to gain and nothing to lose by cracking down she might force him to come through if he didnt if he did lose his job shed partly evened scores shed tried to get frankie to call too and even to come down to the plant of course frankie wouldnt thats just what i thought said moon i thought you said you didnt want my job you should think it ive only told you about fifty times what makes your mother keep calling for then im through talking i said well if i said i was through talking he turned away you wont get it even if i am canned ill see to that i didnt answer him travelers were piled on my desk a foot deep i still had some of the old inventory to transfer from the release books to the cards under the old system you might show the same part in more than one place for instance in leftwing and rightwing that is why partly things were balled up so badly you couldnt keep the thing evened up the rack men would throw out parts for say the right wing when you were carrying your inventory on the left and according to the records you didnt have the parts to throw well i have had to pick this stuff upsome parts are used in dozens of different places and it hasnt been easy moon went upstairs i suppose in fact i know he did because he didnt use the telephone when he came around again he said that production wanted a shortage report on every position by threethirty thats fine i said without looking up it wont hurt them to want youre not going to get them out you know i cant you used to be able to you could do it when we were using the old release books and i can do it now i said in a few days at least right at the moment i dont have any way of sorting my cards into positions fine system you dreamed up he said and i began to boil a little that system is its almost like a piece of writing its a damned sight better than the one they had i told him so as soon as im able to sort the cards i can turn out reports three times as fast as i used to the office wants em now did you tell them they wanted them i said you went up there and got them to tell you to have me get out the reports when you knew i couldnt are you going to do it or not no im not well see about that he said and headed for the stairs i was watching the clock it was just five minutes before the phone rang dilly it was baldwin yes can you come up here a minute i can i said but if its about those shortage reports youd better come down here he hesitated okay be right down i dropped the receiver and snatched up the scissors and a handful of blank cards id had the idea in my head for days but id never got around to working it out moon unlocked the gate and baldwin came skimming in ahead of him pockets bulging with papers bursting with impatience as usual now whats the matter here moon tells me you refused to obey orders why cant you get out the shortage reports whats wrong with in the first place you dont need shortage reports i said i watch this stuff coming and going and i know what im talking about you dont need them thats what you say said moon thats what i say i said now hold up said baldwin lets get to the bottom of this thing supposing we did need shortage reports now why couldnt we get them ive got no way of sorting my cards the parts were listed by position now we carry them chronologically and alphabetically baldwin frowned and shook his head not so good i didnt didnt you think of that when you were setting these cards up god if we cant get them by position theyre no good to us all we need i said is a simple sorting device oh no you dont said baldwin and his frown deepened and moon tried to suppress a smile that stuff costs to beat hell wed never get an okay for one of those machines besides theyve got to be installed to fit the system and it would take forever to get one i dont mean to buy one i mean to make one make one how the look i said picking up the handful of cards its as simple as this heres a card for each of the positions the cards are slotted at the bottom in twelve places a slot to each position starting at the left all the slots are uniform except one which is lower than the others on the next row its the same way and the next and all the way across in each row eleven of the slots are alike one is lower than the others i picked up a pencil and slid it under the first row of slots this is position i said and i raised the pencil and position card rose up and the others remained stationary i did the same thing on the other rows all we need is a file with a sliding lever running beneath it it would probably cost all of a couple of dollars say said baldwin he took the pencil and ran it back and forth in the slots well ill be damned he said moon cleared his throat youre just using a few cards now it wont work with two or three thousand why not said baldwin it just wont i guess you and i went to different schools said baldwin he looked from moon to me whats the trouble between you birds anyway no trouble said moon everythings okay with me i said well im glad to have you both here but youll have to tie the fights outside understand good moon well let those shortage reports slide and he was on his way again moon and i didnt speak for the rest of the day i hate it about moon he was kind to me here when i needed kindness badly i feel somehow that it is i who have put him behind the eightball instead of the other way around marge was sitting on the steps that lead down to the walk i had wondered how long it was going to take her to get there at first she had stood in the doorway then on the porch then she sat on the porch steps and now she was down to the street i told gross good night abruptly and slammed the door as marge arose for a moment we were like two people who meet on the street and cant determine which way the other is going in actions that is i knew which way marge was going and i kept in front of her she rose on her toes arid peered over my shoulder as grosss car roared away angrily now jimmie she said stamping her foot and showing the whites of her eyes why do you always do things like that i could understand her being cross she was dressed in green a leafgreen tweed sports coat seagreen street slacks green socks and snakeskin oxfords that had cost twentytwo dollars and a half i knew what they had cost because walter had written his last note to her on the back of the bill and she had showed it to us her hair was freshly tinted her face was a flawless cream and pink mask it must have taken her at least six hours to fix herself i slid around the question did you want to go some place she brightened at once lets do well all go frankies sick and mom will have to take care of the kids but you and i and roberta could go and maybe youd see someone you knew or maybe roberta wouldnt want to go not an expensive place jimmie abe lymans at pacific square and it only costs two dollars and a half and we wouldnt need more than a cocktail or im afraid we cant even do that marge i said well try to figure out something for saturday but it wouldnt cost hardly anything jimmie and you said ive got to finish that story too you know that has to be done well she said all right well really go some place saturday you promise i promise i said rather desperately can i go over to the drugstore now and get a coke im about out of cigarettes too and i gave her what change i had in my pockets and she counted it out meticulously although not very accurately and wrapped it in her handkerchief now you remember that jimmie ill pay you back as soon as i get some she started up the walk just a minute kid i said why dont you go over after while after dinner why cant i go now well you can i said but i hardly knew how to put it well shannons over there and she doesnt you wouldnt enjoy yourself having to take care of her i mean oh well ill wait we went up the steps together and do something else for me kid please dont go next door to use the telephone any more why not jimmie because they know we have a telephone and that boy works down at the plant it makes things kind of embarrassing for me please dont do it again i guess theres not much i can do she said in a small voice she went into the kitchen i went on back to the bedroom roberta was examining a pair of hose youll have to buy me some new stockings she said i had these hanging in the bathroom and someone wiped a mascara brush all over them all right i said i dont know why anyone has to do things like that ill tell her to be more careful no dont say anything to her jimmie she cant help it and she is your sister now what the hell is this i said you get me worked up to do something and then well she is your sister jimmie mom came in what did you say to marge i didnt say anything to her i just asked her not to go over to the drugstore right now and not to use the telephone next door well im getting out of here said mom im packing up my clothes and getting out tonight i put up with the work and the noise and people biting my head off every time i open my mouth but im not going to stand by and watch you mistreat marge i i went into the bathroom and turned on the shower frankie pushed the door open oh you in here no i said this is my spirit getting ready to take flight my spirits got some sense frankie chuckled whats the trouble with marge the same thing thats always been the trouble with her dont be too hard on her jimmie she cant take it all right i forget i called the loan company today you can get the money you didnt tell mom shell raise hell with moon and it wont help any no i didnt tell her think youll finish the story tonight i suppose look jimmie is roberta sore about all this you know ill pay you back just as soon as no shes not sore i said truthfully on the contrary shes damned well pleased frankie looked blank what do you mean you figure it out itll give you something to think about besides your sins and get out so i can take a bath i dont believe i took one i had the shower turned on and my clothes off but looking back i dont believe i bathed my piles were unusually bad and i stood up on a chair and got to examining myself in the mirror and then i believe i put my clothes back on again and went out i dont remember eating supper either although i suppose i did i know that when i was back in the bedroom writing afterwards i had the sensation of having eaten a great deal more than i should have i had never thought i would see the time when anyone could isolate himself mentally in our house but i guess i am beginning to at eightthirty the page in my typewriter was numbered and halfway down was the symbol i pulled the sheet out slipped it under the bottom of the others and reached for a bundle of manuscript envelopes i didnt want to look at it again i couldnt rewrite it i suppose it was that fastidiousness which makes certain criminals averse to handling the implements of larceny any more than they have to jo was lying on the bed eyes wide are you going out now daddy yes when will you be back you go to sleep can i go with you no and once and for all go to sleep she turned over on her side i gave her a little pat as i went out but i dont think it helped much shes not used to my hollering at her going out said roberta ive got to mail this manuscript why dont you go along with him marge said mom youve not been out all day oh i guess id better not said marge raising a magazine in front of her face roberta said now you just go on marge itll do you good to get out i dont care about walking or id go so i said sure marge come along marge put down the magazine do you really want me to go of course i do but hurry please she was fifteen minutes getting ready dont ask me what she was doing roberta gave me fifty cents for stamps and i drank half a glass of whisky and smoked two cigarettes finally marge came out and said she hated to go looking like that but i grabbed her by the arm and got her outside i walk very rapidly after we had gone three blocks i became conscious that marge was dragging back on my arm going too fast for you well how far are we going jimmie to the post office itd take forever to transfer around there on the bus well hadnt we better take a taxi marge i said cant you then i caught myself honey if i had the money you could have a dozen taxis dont you know that you never had to ask or hint for money when i had it i want you to have fun i dont want to deprive you of things im not stingy of course youre not stingy she exclaimed no oned better say you are around where i am i told walter that if he was just half as good to me as well all the money i have is just enough for postage but ive still got that sixtyfive cents jimmie but marge youve ive look we wont go all the way to the post office well get some stamps along here some place and mail it itll still go out in the morning but we wont get to see any people then jimmie well well maybe we will we tried two drugstores and neither of them would sell us stamps they had them undoubtedly but we didnt want to buy anything so why should they sell them to us then i happened to think of a chain liquor store down the hill toward the bay which i had occasionally well damn frequently patronized they had stamps and they couldnt very well refuse to let me have some it was about seven blocks down there with all the walking around we did we might as wellve gone to the post office i mailed the manuscript in a corner box and we started back up the hill im awful tired jimmie said marge cant we sit down for a minute some place she was looking at a beer and cocktail bar half a block or so up the street a place with a cinder drive and a tremendous neon sign and awninged windows its patrons were chiefly aircraft workers that was reason enough for me to stay out of there with marge ill tell you what i said sit down on the curb and rest a minute then well go on home and ill mix highballs for all of us and well roll up the rug and dance how will that be marge has moments of awareness they are becoming rarer but she still has them jimmie she said what do you think id better do how do you mean you know im no good for anything theres nothing i can do and theres nothing i can do about it i tried to read those books and magazines you got for me because i thought if i could know some of the things you know we could talk together again like we used toand youd like me better bbut she drew a deep breath i couldnt even do that i dont even have the sense to kill myself somehow i still want to keep on living tell me what you think id better do you really want to know yes but if its anything like studying i think you ought to march right down here and have a drink and listen to the music a while the taut intense look the awareness vanished she almost clapped her hands something just told me i ought to come along with you tonight she declared here you take my sixtyfive cents the place had a little dance floor and a coin phonograph and booths in the rear there were only a few couples there besides us most of the business was at the bar out front i dropped a nickel in the juke box and we had a brief dance then the waitress was there with our drinks she shifted impatiently from foot to foot while i fished out sixty cents i had seven cents more change from the stamp money but i wanted a nickel for the phonograph anyway i didnt like the waitress looks any more apparently than she liked mine and a dime tip was enough i laid the money on the table and she still waited finally she snapped out one dollar please what for i said for your drinks what do you think rum and cokes are twentyfive apiece the sign out on your bar says so thats at the bar back here theyre fifty cents you can take mine back said marge i didnt really want we dont take drinks back well youll take these i said sixty cents is all ive got say she said what kind of a gyp is this i got to pay for them drinks myself i got to pay for them before i brought em back here to you you come in here an order drinks an the music had stopped and everyone was watching us watching and listening it was my pet nightmare come to life i got nervous and started to pick up my drink and the waitress snatched it out of my hand no you dont ill throw em down the drain first you gimme that money an if you ever show up in here again what goes on mame it was gross oh hello butch this guys tryin to get out without payin for aw nuts said gross these people are friends of mine he opened his billfold and shoved something into her hand bring me a drink and then bring us another drink all around the waitress took the money and glanced sidewise at me im sorry mister theres so many guys come in here an i got to pay out of my own pocket thats all right i said i knew how it had been with frankie gross sat down and naturally i introduced marge youre a lot better looking than your brother he said dilly youre sure shes your sister shes not your daughter now is she marge ducked her head and looked up at him kittenishly now mr gross jimmies only three years older than i am you shouldnt say things like that she gave him a delicate tap on the arm oh thats all right dilly wont get mad dillys the best friend ive got it may have been true relatively speaking anyway i couldnt very well deny it to his face and i was grateful for being pulled out of a hole they danced and then they kept on dancing and i noticed that marges jaws were moving pretty steadily but well i sat there smoking and drinking and my mind drifted off onto something else a dozen other things when i came out of it it was eleventhirty marge didnt want to leave then but a reminder as to how roberta was going to feel induced her gross drove us home if youll wait just a minute i said ill get you the money for those drinks whats the matter he said an ugly note creeping into his voice aint i good enough to buy you a drink were both working for wages i said you need your money as much as i need mine he didnt say anything marge said afterward that i was awful cool toward him and it was no wonder i made him mad but i dont think that had anything to do with what happened he saw a chance to push himself ahead at my expense and he would have done it eventually no matter what i said or did i got the money and virtually pulled marge out of the car and we started up the walk to the porch then i saw that gross had stopped the car and was rolling down the window i hesitated thinking he had something to say he did have good night comrade he called and his mean cackle floated back to us as he raced away i grabbed marge what did you tell that guy wwhy nothing jimmie i was just telling him about the books id been reading and he wanted to know why and yes i did tell him about how you got out here he didnt come after me the next morning of course i was sure he wouldnt and i didnt wait for him i wouldnt have gone at all if i hadnt been afraid not to i was sure that if i stayed away gross would spill everything he knew i thought that if i was there within reaching distance he might think twice before he said anything i should have known better physically at least there wasnt any comparison between gross and me i couldnt eat anything i didnt have any stomach i took a couple of stiff drinks but they stopped at my tonsils and made a round trip before id gone a block i got through the gate safely and went inside it was almost seven but there wasnt anyone in the stockroom that i could see i sat down on my stool and sort of pulled myself together then the whistle blew and i saw gross stick his head around the corner of a rack at the far end of the room i stared straight at him and he marched boldly out behind him came moon murphy and the others i turned around to my desk and waited went to work there wasnt anything else to do they all kept away from me that morning all except murphy that is about ten oclock he came around to look at a card as he studied it he said from the corner of his mouth im taking off at noon if youve got anything at home you want to get rid of give me a note and ill do it for you i didnt have anything if i had i wouldnt have fallen for a gag as old as that at least i thought it was a gag thanks i said i dont have anything im afraid for anyone to see okay i know how you feel i didnt go outside at noon badly as i wanted a smoke i was afraid my legs would tremble if i walked around very much and somehow i felt safer inside one oclock came two twothirty one hour to go and i knew i wasnt going to get through it the skies were going to fall before i could get out of there suddenly i didnt care if they did i ceased to be afraid i had worried all i could and been afraid all i could so i just stopped perhaps youve had the same sort of thing happen to you three oclock the phone rang moon picked it up he has been very quick to answer the phone since mom started calling i hoped it wasnt mom this time i knew it wouldnt affect what was going to happen to me but i just didnt want her to call i didnt want to go out of there with moon hating me any more than he did how about a shortage on wing dilly he said phlegmatically can you get it out i nodded and then because i wanted to get everything in order because as long as i live i will have to make changes do things i think should be done i said why dont we have a purchasedparts shortage to tie in with it ive been thinking lately why worry about plant parts when we dont have the rivets and other stuff to put them together with all right said moon you go tell vail to give you his shortages dont you think youd better tell him i said he turned away without answering i got off my stool and walked up to purchasedparts vail was weighing up bolts on the computing scales busken was sacking what do you say red said vail how about giving me a shortage on wing i said what do you want with it red i want it to want it to send to russia red now look here i said moon told me to then i jumped three feet in the air i turned halfsquatting sick with pain i dont think anyone can know how much those piles hurt busken was holding the broom giggling still fencing at me with the end of it he he mustnt jump so high red might drop a bomb out of i snatched the broom from his hands and brought it down on his head rather i aimed at his head he threw his head back and the tough sharp straws swept down across his face instantly it was bleeding in a dozen places i was sorry of course as soon as id done it but vail had to choose that moment to say the thing that infuriates me more than any other why dont you pick on someone your own size so i let him have it too and i did get him in the head then gross was trotting up pushing his way around them this was what he had been waiting for the chance to put himself in good with everyone let me get him guys just let me get ahold of the red sonofa i swung on him not with the broom but with a twopound sack of bolts i dont know why it didnt kill him then the guards came when did you join the communist party dillon late in i forget the month what was your motive in joining the usual one i suppose i was pretty disgusted with the oldline parties there wasnt any other inducement well yes there was usually some good conversation i like good talk you werent paid any money on the contrary he wasnt as old as i was the fbi man he had yellow hair combed straight back from his forehead and the blandest blue eyes i have ever seen that is they appeared bland until you met his gaze squareon then you saw that they were something else is dillon your right name said the plant chiefofpolice youve seen my birth certificate the chief brought the front legs of his chair down to the floor with a crash his finger shot out i asked you if dillon was your right name lets let mr reynolds handle this said baldwin frowning at him and the fbi man took up again now you dropped out of the party you say yes in the spring of what was your reason it caused trouble at home for one thing my wife and children are roman catholic werent they roman catholic when you went into the party that wasnt the only reason a number of the people id known had moved away it didnt seem the same without them reynolds stared at me and i couldnt look away from him what was the real reason you dropped out ive told you no you havent all right i said i was beginning to drink pretty hard about that time they didnt want me as a member you were kicked out then no i took some hints the chief leaned forward if it hadnt been for that would you still be in the party baldwin said no one can answer a question like that chief i couldnt decide now what i might have done in the past under different circumstances im no longer the same man that i was then besides that said reynolds a faint flicker of a smile on his lips i dont think mr dillon would give us an answer that would prejudice us against him i didnt say anything his smile disappeared had you ever done any aircraft work before you came here none at all you knew nothing about it no let me see dillons employment record baldwin baldwin handed him a sheet of typewritten paper reynolds studied it what would you say about this record is it unusual good or bad its exceptionally good ill even say that weve never had a new man who did as well i think he realized that he was hurting me even as he said it but after all the opposite would have hurt also now dillon youd never been in aircraft work before you say until you came here and yet you are drawing more money than men who have been here two years and longer you know more youre worth more presumably how do you account for that it may be i said because i needed money worse than they did most of them are single im married have children and other dependents i need money too dillon but it wouldnt turn me into an a aircraft man well ive held some pretty good jobs before i came here certain abilities can be used in one place as well as another yes but dillon does mostly paper work said baldwin reynolds said what do you pay your clerical workers in the office mr baldwin well twenty a week or so and dillon is getting twice that much why well i didnt mean to say that he doesnt have to know anything about aircraft he has to know a lot doesnt he well oh hell yes the chief crossed his legs and leaned back against the wall i couldnt see him smile but i knew he did when i came here i said i filled out an application blank it gives my past employment record reynolds nodded it shows you as a freelance writer most of the time for the past twelve years you were your own employer do you mean by that i said that during the time i was writing i was also doing aircraft work you could have been dillon well i wasnt now you are no longer a communist you say i not only said it im not you severed all connection with the party in yes all right but despite that fact the communist party supplies you with a new car and the money to travel halfway across the continent so that you could go to work here now wait a minute a man who stands convicted of criminal syndicalism and who is now under tenyear sentence gave you that car and the money to come out here on why im not answering that question i said you dont have to dillon you can have a lawyer if you want one i dont want one but i dont want to be asked the parallel of whether ive stopped beating my wife yet ive told you how i got that car tell me again i met mike stone in the post office i told him i wanted a change in scenery that i should really carry on some of my research in another area he introduced me to his attorney who gave me the car to deliver here not to keep but just to deliver thats all there was to it but why should stone have cared whether you got here or not you werent in the party any longer why should he want to do you a favor why not dont ask me questions im asking you ive answered why not is the only answer i can give it wasnt any trouble the car had to be brought back here and stone knew i wouldnt wreck it or run off with it thats all there was to it the chief spoke up fellows drive cars in here from the middle west all the time mr reynolds it saves freight charges the dealers back there are glad to give a man his passage and a few dollars for driving a car out here i was surprised i began to feel a little more comfortable too but reynolds seemed not to have heard mr baldwin he said i believe youve had a great deal of trouble in your stockroom parts getting lost mislabeled unfinished parts and parts that belonged to other departments being stowed away in there and consequently causing expensive delays when did this trouble begin well six or seven months ago or about the time dillon went to work here just a minute the door opened and another man a man who somehow looked like reynolds poked his head in nothing he said a few books but they were all from the public library thanks jack the door closed again about your question said baldwin yes our trouble did begin about the time dilly started to work here but that was also about the time when we were really getting into production wed received our first large government orders before that an order for a dozen ships was an event everything was snarled up six or seven months ago every department was in a jam are they still well were pretty well lined out now but youre still having trouble in your main stockroom however yes but thats the nerve center of the entire plant and and dillys just about to get things straightened out in there hes set up a new records system that should remove a lot of the trouble but it hasnt yet things are still far from what they should be baldwin admitted that they were now these discords and disputes between the various workers in the department when did they begin well baldwin scuffed his feet against the linoleum and lighted a cigarette he exhaled a cloud of smoke and tapped the cigarette nervously into a tray mr reynolds youre making out a very bad case against a man who at the worst has only been misguided or too impulsive those quarrels can be attributed almost entirely to this fellow gross hes a talebearer and troublemaker from the word go but hes a husky devil and hes clever dillys been catching the brunt of things that gross started personnel shoved him off on us or idve canned him long ago i took over grosss job you see i said yes said baldwin and gross tried to get moon fired one time and he looks down on murphy because murphy is part mexican that murphy is quite a kid said the chief idly i saw him fight a couple o times reynolds glanced at his wrist watch and i thought he sighed slightly we dont seem to be making a great deal of headway he said dillon came out here under circumstances that were suspicious and yet werent suspicious there were serious mixups from the time he went to work but there might have been anyway they havent ceased yet but they will everyone in the department has been fighting and quarreling but that could be grosss fault he looked around at us i think i might add that its practically impossible to obtain positive evidence of sabotage the saboteur has to keep on working if hes to be of any real value he cant pull a trick or two and skip out hes got to be clever hes got to do one thing and appear to be doing the opposite dillon is on the spot and he isnt on the spot said the chief it all depends on which way youre looking at him yes i wont say that hes on it but it would be a lot better if he could take a step in another direction well said baldwin i dont know that i can say anything more than i have how about whats his name moon the leadman is he still around i thought youd already talked to him said baldwin only in a general way when i talked with the others is he still around im not sure that he is its pretty late and hes here said the chief i thought you might want him hes waiting downstairs have him come up please the chief went out reynolds sat staring at me baldwin lighted another cigarette from his first one mr reynolds he said yes well about moon hes been somewhat jealous of dillon and i know hes vindictive i dont believe that he left the sentence unfinished i see said reynolds and i knew what he saw nothing that you could put your finger on the suspicious linked with its antithesis proof and no proof and i knew that no proof was necessary in these times only a belief in the mind behind those bland blue eyes only a charge conviction would be automatic moon came in half of a huge red apple in his hand he took a bite as he laconically settled into the chiefs chair and chewing he looked the fbi man up and down he didnt seem to mind looking into his eyes his stare was as hard and straight as reynolds reynolds smiled faintly and shifted his gaze you know why weve asked you to come up moon yes said moon flatly he turned the apple half a revolution and raised it to his lips youve had some very serious trouble in the stockroom moon it began at the time or about the time dillon came here now moon held up his hand he gulped and swallowed jus just before dillon came here i was trying to quit didnt give a damn what happened i let everything go including that gross guy dilly stepped right into the middle of a firstclass mess oh said reynolds maybe youd rather finish your apple before i can talk all right said moon itd been a lot better for dilly if hed let things slide everyone would have liked him better wouldnt do it though so here he is i see said reynolds now youve had the chance to observe dillon very closely you and he work largely in the stockroom while the others spend much of their time outside did any of his actions ever strike you as being suspicious was there ever anything in connection with his work that seemed suspicious moon studied the remainder of the apple he tossed it into the cuspidor thoughtfully he stared at the floor well i dont know i dont know whether youd call it suspicious or not the fbi man leaned forward explain exactly what you mean well i used to think he was going to blow the place up blow it up uhhuh used to sit on that stool so long without going to the toilet i was afraid he was going to explode all over us there was a dead silence then baldwin brought his open palm down on the desk and began choking and strangling on his cigarette reynolds reddened but he grinned i guess thats all mr moon thank you for coming in dont mention it said moon and he strolled out his hands swinging limply at his skinny shanks baldwin wiped his eyes i think its pertinent to tell you that moon is leaving us hes been called back into the navy we could have had him deferred but he wanted to go so we didnt try to hold him we tried to keep him from leaving once before and it didnt work out so well very interesting reynolds got up and held out his hand to me well try to get together again under more pleasant circumstances i shook hands not saying anything baldwin said youll get to see dilly all right hell be around hes taking over moons job when i reached the top of the hill that night the corner moon was waiting for me in his car thought id say adios he said as i got in and sat down would have brought you home but i thought it might not be a good idea you just about saved my neck i said yeah well i guess i owed you something dilly hows frankie shes going to be all right i wish i could have done what i should have i liked frankie dilly it wasnt just another one of those things i know i know how it is want a drink i guess not moon i guess i dont either im sorry youre leaving i hope im were not the cause of it idve probably gone anyway dilly ive been looking for an excuse for a long time you know i didnt want your job i said you know im not going back dont let me keep you from it dilly it isnt that he nodded i ought tove known youd be too smart youve got some good tricks dilly but they wouldnt carry you there forever and it would be all the harder on you afterwards yes and that isnt all moon he waited i dont know i said probably ill never be able to explain to anyone not even if i wrote a book end
