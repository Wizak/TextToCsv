 the little regiment and other episodes of the american civil war by stephen crane contents the little regiment three miraculous soldiers a mystery of heroism an indiana campaign a grey sleeve the veteran the little regiment i the fog made the clothes of the men of the column in the roadway seem of a luminous quality it imparted to the heavy infantry overcoats a new colour a kind of blue which was so pale that a regiment might have been merely a long low shadow in the mist however a muttering one part grumble three parts joke hovered in the air above the thick ranks and blended in an undertoned roar which was the voice of the column the town on the southern shore of the little river loomed spectrally a faint etching upon the grey cloudmasses which were shifting with oily languor a long row of guns upon the northern bank had been pitiless in their hatred but a little battered belfry could be dimly seen still pointing with invincible resolution toward the heavens the enclouded air vibrated with noises made by hidden colossal things the infantry tramplings the heavy rumbling of the artillery made the earth speak of gigantic preparation guns on distant heights thundered from time to time with sudden nervous roar as if unable to endure in silence a knowledge of hostile troops massing other guns going to position these sounds near and remote defined an immense battleground described the tremendous width of the stage of the prospective drama the voices of the guns slightly casual unexcited in their challenges and warnings could not destroy the unutterable eloquence of the word in the air a meaning of impending struggle which made the breath halt at the lips the column in the roadway was ankledeep in mud the men swore piously at the rain which drizzled upon them compelling them to stand always very erect in fear of the drops that would sweep in under their coatcollars the fog was as cold as wet cloths the men stuffed their hands deep in their pockets and huddled their muskets in their arms the machinery of orders had rooted these soldiers deeply into the mud precisely as almighty nature roots mullein stalks they listened and speculated when a tumult of fighting came from the dim town across the river when the noise lulled for a time they resumed their descriptions of the mud and graphically exaggerated the number of hours they had been kept waiting the general commanding their division rode along the ranks and they cheered admiringly affectionately crying out to him gleeful prophecies of the coming battle each man scanned him with a peculiarly keen personal interest and afterward spoke of him with unquestioning devotion and confidence narrating anecdotes which were mainly untrue when the jokers lifted the shrill voices which invariably belonged to them flinging witticisms at their comrades a loud laugh would sweep from rank to rank and soldiers who had not heard would lean forward and demand repetition when were borne past them some wounded men with grey and bloodsmeared faces and eyes that rolled in that helpless beseeching for assistance from the sky which comes with supreme pain the soldiers in the mud watched intently and from time to time asked of the bearers an account of the affair frequently they bragged of their corps their division their brigade their regiment anon they referred to the mud and the cold drizzle upon this threshold of a wild scene of death they in short defied the proportion of events with that splendour of heedlessness which belongs only to veterans like a lot of wooden soldiers swore billie dempster moving his feet in the thick mass and casting a vindictive glance indefinitely standing in the mud for a hundred years oh shut up murmured his brother dan the manner of his words implied that this fraternal voice near him was an indescribable bore why should i shut up demanded billie because youre a fool cried dan taking no time to debate it the biggest fool in the regiment there was but one man between them and he was habituated these insults from brother to brother had swept across his chest flown past his face many times during two long campaigns upon this occasion he simply grinned first at one then at the other the way of these brothers was not an unknown topic in regimental gossip they had enlisted simultaneously with each sneering loudly at the other for doing it they left their little town and went forward with the flag exchanging protestations of undying suspicion in the camp life they so openly despised each other that when entertaining quarrels were lacking their companions often contrived situations calculated to bring forth display of this fraternal dislike both were largelimbed strong young men and often fought with friends in camp unless one was near to interfere with the other this latter happened rather frequently because dan preposterously willing for any manner of combat had a very great horror of seeing billie in a fight and billie almost odiously ready himself simply refused to see dan stripped to his shirt and with his fists aloft this sat queerly upon them and made them the objects of plots when dan jumped through a ring of eager soldiers and dragged forth his raving brother by the arm a thing often predicted would almost come to pass when billie performed the same office for dan the prediction would again miss fulfilment by an inch but indeed they never fought together although they were perpetually upon the verge they expressed longing for such conflict as a matter of truth they had at one time made full arrangement for it but even with the encouragement and interest of half of the regiment they somehow failed to achieve collision if dan became a victim of police duty no jeering was so destructive to the feelings as billies comment if billie got a call to appear at the headquarters none would so genially prophesy his complete undoing as dan small misfortunes to one were in truth invariably greeted with hilarity by the other who seemed to see in them great reenforcement of his opinion as soldiers they expressed each for each a scorn intense and blasting after a certain battle billie was promoted to corporal when dan was told of it he seemed smitten dumb with astonishment and patriotic indignation he stared in silence while the dark blood rushed to billies forehead and he shifted his weight from foot to foot dan at last found his tongue and said well im durned if he had heard that an army mule had been appointed to the post of corps commander his tone could not have had more derision in it afterward he adopted a fervid insubordination an almost religious reluctance to obey the new corporals orders which came near to developing the desired strife it is here finally to be recorded also that dan most ferociously profane in speech very rarely swore in the presence of his brother and that billie whose oaths came from his lips with the grace of falling pebbles was seldom known to express himself in this manner when near his brother dan at last the afternoon contained a suggestion of evening metallic cries rang suddenly from end to end of the column they inspired at once a quick businesslike adjustment the long thing stirred in the mud the men had hushed and were looking across the river a moment later the shadowy mass of pale blue figures was moving steadily toward the stream there could be heard from the town a clash of swift fighting and cheering the noise of the shooting coming through the heavy air had its sharpness taken from it and sounded in thuds there was a halt upon the bank above the pontoons when the column went winding down the incline and streamed out upon the bridge the fog had faded to a great degree and in the clearer dusk the guns on a distant ridge were enabled to perceive the crossing the long whirling outcries of the shells came into the air above the men an occasional solid shot struck the surface of the river and dashed into view a sudden vertical jet the distance was subtly illuminated by the lightning from the deepbooming guns one by one the batteries on the northern shore aroused the innumerable guns bellowing in angry oration at the distant ridge the rolling thunder crashed and reverberated as a wild surf sounds on a still night and to this music the column marched across the pontoons the waters of the grim river curled away in a smile from the ends of the great boats and slid swiftly beneath the planking the dark riddled walls of the town upreared before the troops and from a region hidden by these hammered and tumbled houses came incessantly the yells and firings of a prolonged and close skirmish when dan had called his brother a fool his voice had been so decisive so brightly assured that many men had laughed considering it to be great humour under the circumstances the incident happened to rankle deep in billie it was not any strange thing that his brother had called him a fool in fact he often called him a fool with exactly the same amount of cheerful and prompt conviction and before large audiences too billie wondered in his own mind why he took such profound offence in this case but at any rate as he slid down the bank and on to the bridge with his regiment he was searching his knowledge for something that would pierce dans blithesome spirit but he could contrive nothing at this time and his impotency made the glance which he was once able to give his brother still more malignant the guns far and near were roaring a fearful and grand introduction for this column which was marching upon the stage of death billie felt it but only in a numb way his heart was cased in that curious dissonant metal which covers a mans emotions at such times the terrible voices from the hills told him that in this wide conflict his life was an insignificant fact and that his death would be an insignificant fact they portended the whirlwind to which he would be as necessary as a butterflys waved wing the solemnity the sadness of it came near enough to make him wonder why he was neither solemn nor sad when his mind vaguely adjusted events according to their importance to him it appeared that the uppermost thing was the fact that upon the eve of battle and before many comrades his brother had called him a fool dan was in a particularly happy mood hurray look at em shoot he said when the long witches croon of the shells came into the air it enraged billie when he felt the little thorn in him and saw at the same time that his brother had completely forgotten it the column went from the bridge into more mud at this southern end there was a chaos of hoarse directions and commands darkness was coming upon the earth and regiments were being hurried up the slippery bank as billie floundered in the black mud amid the swearing sliding crowd he suddenly resolved that in the absence of other means of hurting dan he would avoid looking at him refrain from speaking to him pay absolutely no heed to his existence and this done skilfully would he imagined soon reduce his brother to a poignant sensitiveness at the top of the bank the column again halted and rearranged itself as a man after a climb rearranges his clothing presently the great steelbacked brigade an infinitely graceful thing in the rhythm and ease of its veteran movement swung up a little narrow slanting street evening had come so swiftly that the fighting on the remote borders of the town was indicated by thin flashes of flame some building was on fire and its reflection upon the clouds was an oval of delicate pink ii all demeanour of rural serenity had been wrenched violently from the little town by the guns and by the waves of men which had surged through it the hand of war laid upon this village had in an instant changed it to a thing of remnants it resembled the place of a monstrous shaking of the earth itself the windows now mere unsightly holes made the tumbled and blackened dwellings seem skeletons doors lay splintered to fragments chimneys had flung their bricks everywhere the artillery fire had not neglected the rows of gentle shadetrees which had lined the streets branches and heavy trunks cluttered the mud in driftwood tangles while a few shattered forms had contrived to remain dejectedly mournfully upright they expressed an innocence a helplessness which perforce created a pity for their happening into this caldron of battle furthermore there was under foot a vast collection of odd things reminiscent of the charge the fight the retreat there were boxes and barrels filled with earth behind which riflemen had lain snugly and in these little trenches were the dead in blue with the dead in grey the poses eloquent of the struggles for possession of the town until the history of the whole conflict was written plainly in the streets and yet the spirit of this little city its quaint individuality poised in the air above the ruins defying the guns the sweeping volleys holding in contempt those avaricious blazes which had attacked many dwellings the hard earthen sidewalks proclaimed the games that had been played there during long lazy days in the careful shadows of the trees general merchandise in faint letters upon a long board had to be read with a slanted glance for the sign dangled by one end but the porch of the old store was a palpable legend of widehatted men smoking this subtle essence this soul of the life that had been brushed like invisible wings the thoughts of the men in the swift columns that came up from the river in the darkness a loud and endless humming arose from the great blue crowds bivouacked in the streets from time to time a sharp spatter of firing from far picket lines entered this bass chorus the smell from the smouldering ruins floated on the cold night breeze dan seated ruefully upon the doorstep of a shotpierced house was proclaiming the campaign badly managed orders had been issued forbidding campfires suddenly he ceased his oration and scanning the group of his comrades said wheres billie do you know gone on picket get out has he said dan no business to go on picket why dont some of them other corporals take their turn a bearded private was smoking his pipe of confiscated tobacco seated comfortably upon a horsehair trunk which he had dragged from the house he observed was his turn no such thing cried dan he and the man on the horsehair trunk held discussion in which dan stoutly maintained that if his brother had been sent on picket it was an injustice he ceased his argument when another soldier upon whose arms could faintly be seen the two stripes of a corporal entered the circle humph said dan where you been the corporal made no answer presently dan said billie where you been his brother did not seem to hear these inquiries he glanced at the house which towered above them and remarked casually to the man on the horsehair trunk funny aint it after the pelting this town got youd think there wouldnt be one brick left on another oh said dan glowering at his brothers back getting mighty smart aint you the absence of campfires allowed the evening to make apparent its quality of faint silver light in which the blue clothes of the throng became black and the faces became white expanses void of expression there was considerable excitement a short distance from the group around the doorstep a soldier had chanced upon a hoopskirt and arrayed in it he was performing a dance amid the applause of his companions billie and a greater part of the men immediately poured over there to witness the exhibition whats the matter with billie demanded dan of the man upon the horsehair trunk how do i know rejoined the other in mild resentment he arose and walked away when he returned he said briefly in a weatherwise tone that it would rain during the night dan took a seat upon one end of the horsehair trunk he was facing the crowd around the dancer which in its hilarity swung this way and that way at times he imagined that he could recognise his brothers face he and the man on the other end of the trunk thoughtfully talked of the armys position to their minds infantry and artillery were in a most precarious jumble in the streets of the town but they did not grow nervous over it for they were used to having the army appear in a precarious jumble to their minds they had learned to accept such puzzling situations as a consequence of their position in the ranks and were now usually in possession of a simple but perfectly immovable faith that somebody understood the jumble even if they had been convinced that the army was a headless monster they would merely have nodded with the veterans singular cynicism it was none of their business as soldiers their duty was to grab sleep and food when occasion permitted and cheerfully fight wherever their feet were planted until more orders came this was a task sufficiently absorbing they spoke of other corps and this talk being confidential their voices dropped to tones of awe the ninth the first the fifth the sixth the third the simple numerals rang with eloquence each having a meaning which was to float through many years as no intangible arithmetical mist but as pregnant with individuality as the names of cities of their own corps they spoke with a deep veneration an idolatry a supreme confidence which apparently would not blanch to see it match against everything it was as if their respect for other corps was due partly to a wonder that organisations not blessed with their own famous numeral could take such an interest in war they could prove that their division was the best in the corps and that their brigade was the best in the division and their regiment it was plain that no fortune of life was equal to the chance which caused a man to be born so to speak into this command the keystone of the defending arch at times dan covered with insults the character of a vague unnamed general to whose petulance and busybody spirit he ascribed the order which made hot coffee impossible dan said that victory was certain in the coming battle the other man seemed rather dubious he remarked upon the fortified line of hills which had impressed him even from the other side of the river shucks said dan why we he pictured a splendid overflowing of these hills by the sea of men in blue during the period of this conversation dans glance searched the merry throng about the dancer above the babble of voices in the street a faraway thunder could sometimes be heard evidently from the very edge of the horizon the boomboom of restless guns iii ultimately the night deepened to the tone of black velvet the outlines of the fireless camp were like the faint drawings upon ancient tapestry the glint of a rifle the shine of a button might have been of threads of silver and gold sewn upon the fabric of the night there was little presented to the vision but to a sense more subtle there was discernible in the atmosphere something like a pulse a mystic beating which would have told a stranger of the presence of a giant thing the slumbering mass of regiments and batteries with tires forbidden the floor of a dry old kitchen was thought to be a good exchange for the cold earth of december even if a shell had exploded in it and knocked it so out of shape that when a man lay curled in his blanket his last waking thought was likely to be of the wall that bellied out above him as if strongly anxious to topple upon the score of soldiers billie looked at the bricks ever about to descend in a shower upon his face listened to the industrious pickets plying their rifles on the border of the town imagined some measure of the din of the coming battle thought of dan and dans chagrin and rolling over in his blanket went to sleep with satisfaction at an unknown hour he was aroused by the creaking of boards lifting himself upon his elbow he saw a sergeant prowling among the sleeping forms the sergeant carried a candle in an old brass candlestick he would have resembled some old farmer on an unusual midnight tour if it were not for the significance of his gleaming buttons and striped sleeves billie blinked stupidly at the light until his mind returned from the journeys of slumber the sergeant stooped among the unconscious soldiers holding the candle close and peering into each face hello haines said billie relief hello billie said the sergeant special duty dan got to go jameson hunter mccormack d dempster yes where is he over there by the winder said billie gesturing what is it for haines you dont think i know do you demanded the sergeant he began to pipe sharply but cheerily at men upon the floor come mac get up here heres a special for you wake up jameson come along dannie me boy each man at once took this call to duty as a personal affront they pulled themselves out of their blankets rubbed their eyes and swore at whoever was responsible thems orders cried the sergeant come get out of here an undetailed head with dishevelled hair thrust out from a blanket and a sleepy voice said shut up haines and go home when the detail clanked out of the kitchen all but one of the remaining men seemed to be again asleep billie leaning on his elbow was gazing into darkness when the footsteps died to silence he curled himself into his blanket at the first cool lavender lights of daybreak he aroused again and scanned his recumbent companions seeing a wakeful one he asked is dan back yet the man said haint seen im billie put both hands behind his head and scowled into the air cant see the use of these cussed details in the nighttime he muttered in his most unreasonable tones darn nuisances why cant they he grumbled at length and graphically when dan entered with the squad however billie was convincingly asleep iv the regiment trotted in double time along the street and the colonel seemed to quarrel over the right of way with many artillery officers batteries were waiting in the mud and the men of them exasperated by the bustle of this ambitious infantry shook their fists from saddle and caisson exchanging all manner of taunts and jests the slanted guns continued to look reflectively at the ground on the outskirts of the crumbled town a fringe of blue figures were firing into the fog the regiment swung out into skirmish lines and the fringe of blue figures departed turning their backs and going joyfully around the flank the bullets began a low moan off toward a ridge which loomed faintly in the heavy mist when the swift crescendo had reached its climax the missiles zipped just overhead as if piercing an invisible curtain a battery on the hill was crashing with such tumult that it was as if the guns had quarrelled and had fallen pellmell and snarling upon each other the shells howled on their journey toward the town from shortrange distance there came a spatter of musketry sweeping along an invisible line and making faint sheets of orange light some in the new skirmish lines were beginning to fire at various shadows discerned in the vapour forms of men suddenly revealed by some humour of the laggard masses of clouds the crackle of musketry began to dominate the purring of the hostile bullets dan in the front rank held his rifle poised and looked into the fog keenly coldly with the air of a sportsman his nerves were so steady that it was as if they had been drawn from his body leaving him merely a muscular machine but his numb heart was somehow beating to the pealing march of the fight the waving skirmish line went backward and forward ran this way and that way men got lost in the fog and men were found again once they got too close to the formidable ridge and the thing burst out as if repulsing a general attack once another blue regiment was apprehended on the very edge of firing into them once a friendly battery began an elaborate and scientific process of extermination always as busy as brokers the men slid here and there over the plain fighting their foes escaping from their friends leaving a history of many movements in the wet yellow turf cursing the atmosphere blazing away every time they could identify the enemy in one mystic changing of the fog as if the fingers of spirits were drawing aside these draperies a small group of the grey skirmishers silent statuesque were suddenly disclosed to dan and those about him so vivid and near were they that there was something uncanny in the revelation there might have been a second of mutual staring then each rifle in each group was at the shoulder as dans glance flashed along the barrel of his weapon the figure of a man suddenly loomed as if the musket had been a telescope the short black beard the slouch hat the pose of the man as he sighted to shoot made a quick picture in dans mind the same moment it would seem he pulled his own trigger and the man smitten lurched forward while his exploding rifle made a slanting crimson streak in the air and the slouch hat fell before the body the billows of the fog governed by singular impulses rolled between you got that feller sure enough said a comrade to dan dan looked at him absentmindedly v when the next morning calmly displayed another fog the men of the regiment exchanged eloquent comments but they did not abuse it at length because the streets of the town now contained enough galloping aides to make three troops of cavalry and they knew that they had come to the verge of the great fight dan conversed with the man who had once possessed a horsehair trunk but they did not mention the line of hills which had furnished them in more careless moments with an agreeable topic they avoided it now as condemned men do the subject of death and yet the thought of it stayed in their eyes as they looked at each other and talked gravely of other things the expectant regiment heaved a long sigh of relief when the sharp call fall in repeated indefinitely arose in the streets it was inevitable that a bloody battle was to be fought and they wanted to get it off their minds they were however doomed again to spend a long period planted firmly in the mud they craned their necks and wondered where some of the other regiments were going at last the mists rolled carelessly away nature made at this time all provisions to enable foes to see each other and immediately the roar of guns resounded from every hill the endless cracking of the skirmishers swelled to rolling crashes of musketry shells screamed with pantherlike noises at the houses dan looked at the man of the horsehair trunk and the man said well here she comes the tenor voices of younger officers and the deep and hoarse voices of the older ones rang in the streets these cries pricked like spurs the masses of men vibrated from the suddenness with which they were plunged into the situation of troops about to fight that the orders were longexpected did not concern the emotion simultaneous movement was imparted to all these thick bodies of men and horses that lay in the town regiment after regiment swung rapidly into the streets that faced the sinister ridge this exodus was theatrical the little soberhued village had been like the cloak which disguises the king of drama it was now put aside and an army splendid thing of steel and blue stood forth in the sunlight even the soldiers in the heavy columns drew deep breaths at the sight more majestic than they had dreamed the heights of the enemys position were crowded with men who resembled people come to witness some mighty pageant but as the column moved steadily to their positions the guns matteroffact warriors doubled their number and shells burst with red thrilling tumult on the crowded plain one came into the ranks of the regiment and after the smoke and the wrath of it had faded leaving motionless figures every one stormed according to the limits of his vocabulary for veterans detest being killed when they are not busy the regiment sometimes looked sideways at its brigade companions composed of men who had never been in battle but no frozen blood could withstand the heat of the splendour of this army before the eyes on the plain these lines so long that the flanks were little streaks this mass of men of one intention the recruits carried themselves heedlessly at the rear was an idle battery and three artillerymen in a foolish row on a caisson nudged each other and grinned at the recruits youll catch it pretty soon they called out they were impersonally gleeful as if they themselves were not also likely to catch it pretty soon but with this picture of an army in their hearts the new men perhaps felt the devotion which the drops may feel for the wave they were of its power and glory they smiled jauntily at the foolish row of gunners and told them to go to blazes the column trotted across some little bridges and spread quickly into lines of battle before them was a bit of plain and back of the plain was the ridge there was no time left for considerations the men were staring at the plain mightily wondering how it would feel to be out there when a brigade in advance yelled and charged the hill was all grey smoke and firepoints that fierce elation in the terrors of war catching a mans heart and making it burn with such ardour that he becomes capable of dying flashed in the faces of the men like coloured lights and made them resemble leashed animals eager ferocious daunting at nothing the line was really in its first leap before the wild hoarse crying of the orders the greed for close quarters which is the emotion of a bayonet charge came then into the minds of the men and developed until it was a madness the field with its faded grass of a southern winter seemed to this fury miles in width high slowmoving masses of smoke with an odour of burning cotton engulfed the line until the men might have been swimmers before them the ridge the shore of this grey sea was outlined crossed and recrossed by sheets of flame the howl of the battle arose to the noise of innumerable wind demons the line galloping scrambling plunging like a herd of wounded horses went over a field that was sown with corpses the records of other charges directly in front of the blackfaced whooping dan carousing in this onward sweep like a new kind of fiend a wounded man appeared raising his shattered body and staring at this rush of men down upon him it seemed to occur to him that he was to be trampled he made a desperate piteous effort to escape then finally huddled in a waiting heap dan and the soldier near him widened the interval between them without looking down without appearing to heed the wounded man this little clump of blue seemed to reel past them as boulders reel past a train bursting through a smokewave the scampering unformed bunches came upon the wreck of the brigade that had preceded them a floundering mass stopped afar from the hill by the swirling volleys it was as if a necromancer had suddenly shown them a picture of the fate which awaited them but the line with muscular spasm hurled itself over this wreckage and onward until men were stumbling amid the relics of other assaults the point where the fire from the ridge consumed the men panting perspiring with crazed faces tried to push against it but it was as if they had come to a wall the wave halted shuddered in an agony from the quick struggle of its two desires then toppled and broke into a fragmentary thing which has no name veterans could now at last be distinguished from recruits the new regiments were instantly gone lost scattered as if they never had been but the sweeping failure of the charge the battle could not make the veterans forget their business with a last throe the band of maniacs drew itself up and blazed a volley at the hill insignificant to those iron entrenchments but nevertheless expressing that singular final despair which enables men coolly to defy the walls of a city of death after this episode the men renamed their command they called it the little regiment vi i seen dan shoot a feller yesterday yes sir im sure it was him that done it and maybe he thinks about that feller now and wonders if he tumbled down just about the same way them things come up in a mans mind bivouac fires upon the sidewalks in the streets in the yards threw high their wavering reflections which examined like slim red fingers the dingy scarred walls and the piles of tumbled brick the droning of voices again arose from great blue crowds the odour of frying bacon the fragrance from countless little coffeepails floated among the ruins the rifles stacked in the shadows emitted flashes of steely light wherever a flag lay horizontally from one stack to another was the bed of an eagle which had led men into the mystic smoke the men about a particular fire were engaged in holding in check their jovial spirits they moved whispering around the blaze although they looked at it with a certain fine contentment like labourers after a days hard work there was one who sat apart they did not address him save in tones suddenly changed they did not regard him directly but always in little sidelong glances at last a soldier from a distant fire came into this circle of light he studied for a time the man who sat apart then he hesitatingly stepped closer and said got any news dan no said dan the newcomer shifted his feet he looked at the fire at the sky at the other men at dan his face expressed a curious despair his tongue was plainly in rebellion finally however he contrived to say well theres some chance yet dan lots of the wounded are still lying out there you know theres some chance yet yes said dan the soldier shifted his feet again and looked miserably into the air after another struggle he said well theres some chance yet dan he moved hastily away one of the men of the squad perhaps encouraged by this example now approached the still figure no news yet hey he said after coughing behind his hand no said dan well said the man ive been thinking of how he was fretting about you the night you went on special duty you recollect well sir i was surprised he couldnt say enough about it i swan i dont believe he slep a wink after you left but just lay awake cussing special duty and worrying i was surprised but there he lay cussing he dan made a curious sound as if a stone had wedged in his throat he said shut up will you afterward the men would not allow this moody contemplation of the fire to be interrupted oh let him alone cant you come away from there casey say cant you leave him be they moved with reverence about the immovable figure with its countenance of masklike invulnerability vii after the red round eye of the sun had stared long at the little plain and its burden darkness a sable mercy came heavily upon it and the wan hands of the dead were no longer seen in strange frozen gestures the heights in front of the plain shone with tiny campfires and from the town in the rear small shimmerings ascended from the blazes of the bivouac the plain was a black expanse upon which from time to time dots of light lanterns floated slowly here and there these fields were long steeped in grim mystery suddenly upon one dark spot there was a resurrection a strange thing had been groaning there prostrate then it suddenly dragged itself to a sitting posture and became a man the man stared stupidly for a moment at the lights on the hill then turned and contemplated the faint colouring over the town for some moments he remained thus staring with dull eyes his face unemotional wooden finally he looked around him at the corpses dimly to be seen no change flashed into his face upon viewing these men they seemed to suggest merely that his information concerning himself was not too complete he ran his fingers over his arms and chest bearing always the air of an idiot upon a bench at an almshouse door finding no wound in his arms nor in his chest he raised his hand to his head and the fingers came away with some dark liquid upon them holding these fingers close to his eyes he scanned them in the same stupid fashion while his body gently swayed the soldier rolled his eyes again toward the town when he arose his clothing peeled from the frozen ground like wet paper hearing the sound of it he seemed to see reason for deliberation he paused and looked at the ground then at his trousers then at the ground finally he went slowly off toward the faint reflection holding his hands palm outward before him and walking in the manner of a blind man viii the immovable dan again sat unaddressed in the midst of comrades who did not joke aloud the dampness of the usual morning fog seemed to make the little campfires furious suddenly a cry arose in the streets a shout of amazement and delight the men making breakfast at the fire looked up quickly they broke forth in clamorous exclamation well of all things dan dan look whos coming oh dan dan the silent raised his eyes and saw a man with a bandage of the size of a helmet about his head receiving a furious demonstration from the company he was shaking hands and explaining and haranguing to a high degree dan started his face of bronze flushed to his temples he seemed about to leap from the ground but then suddenly he sank back and resumed his impassive gazing the men were in a flurry they looked from one to the other dan look see whos coming some cried again dan look he scowled at last and moved his shoulders sullenly well dont i know it but they could not be convinced that his eyes were in service dan why cant you look see whos coming he made a gesture then of irritation and rage curse it dont i know it the man with a bandage of the size of a helmet moved forward always shaking hands and explaining at times his glance wandered to dan who saw with his eyes riveted after a series of shiftings it occurred naturally that the man with the bandage was very near to the man who saw the flames he paused and there was a little silence finally he said hello dan hello billie three miraculous soldiers i the girl was in the front room on the second floor peering through the blinds it was the best room there was a very new rag carpet on the floor the edges of it had been dyed with alternate stripes of red and green upon the wooden mantel there were two little puffy figures in clay a shepherd and a shepherdess probably a triangle of pink and white wool hung carefully over the edge of this shelf upon the bureau there was nothing at all save a spread newspaper with edges folded to make it into a mat the quilts and sheets had been removed from the bed and were stacked upon a chair the pillows and the great feather mattress were muffled and tumbled until they resembled great dumplings the picture of a man terribly leaden in complexion hung in an oval frame on one white wall and steadily confronted the bureau from between the slats of the blinds she had a view of the road as it wended across the meadow to the woods and again where it reappeared crossing the hill half a mile away it lay yellow and warm in the summer sunshine from the long grasses of the meadow came the rhythmic click of the insects occasional frogs in the hidden brook made a peculiar chugchug sound as if somebody throttled them the leaves of the wood swung in gentle winds through the darkgreen branches of the pines that grew in the front yard could be seen the mountains far to the southeast and inexpressibly blue marys eyes were fastened upon the little streak of road that appeared on the distant hill her face was flushed with excitement and the hand which stretched in a strained pose on the sill trembled because of the nervous shaking of the wrist the pines whisked their green needles with a soft hissing sound against the house at last the girl turned from the window and went to the head of the stairs well i just know theyre coming anyhow she cried argumentatively to the depths a voice from below called to her angrily they aint weve never seen one yet they never come into this neighbourhood you just come down here and tend to your work insteader watching for soldiers well ma i just know theyre coming a voice retorted with the shrillness and mechanical violence of occasional housewives the girl swished her skirts defiantly and returned to the window upon the yellow streak of road that lay across the hillside there now was a handful of black dots horsemen a cloud of dust floated away the girl flew to the head of the stairs and whirled down into the kitchen theyre coming theyre coming it was as if she had cried fire her mother had been peeling potatoes while seated comfortably at the table she sprang to her feet no it cant be how you know its them where the stubby knife fell from her hand and two or three curls of potato skin dropped from her apron to the floor the girl turned and dashed upstairs her mother followed gasping for breath and yet contriving to fill the air with questions reproach and remonstrance the girl was already at the window eagerly pointing there there see em see em rushing to the window the mother scanned for an instant the road on the hill she crouched back with a groan its them sure as the world its them she waved her hands in despairing gestures the black dots vanished into the wood the girl at the window was quivering and her eyes were shining like water when the sun flashes hush theyre in the woods theyll be here directly she bent down and intently watched the green archway whence the road emerged hush i hear em coming she swiftly whispered to her mother for the elder woman had dropped dolefully upon the mattress and was sobbing and indeed the girl could hear the quick dull trample of horses she stepped aside with sudden apprehension but she bent her head forward in order to still scan the road here they are there was something very theatrical in the sudden appearance of these men to the eyes of the girl it was as if a scene had been shifted the forest suddenly disclosed them a dozen brownfaced troopers in blue galloping oh look breathed the girl her mouth was puckered into an expression of strange fascination as if she had expected to see the troopers change into demons and gloat at her she was at last looking upon those curious beings who rode down from the north those men of legend and colossal tale they who were possessed of such marvellous hallucinations the little troop rode in silence at its head was a youthful fellow with some dim yellow stripes upon his arm in his right hand he held his carbine slanting upward with the stock resting upon his knee he was absorbed in a scrutiny of the country before him at the heels of the sergeant the rest of the squad rode in thin column with creak of leather and tinkle of steel and tin the girl scanned the faces of the horsemen seeming astonished vaguely to find them of the type she knew the lad at the head of the troop comprehended the house and its environments in two glances he did not check the long swinging stride of his horse the troopers glanced for a moment like casual tourists and then returned to their study of the region in front the heavy thudding of the hoofs became a small noise the dust hanging in sheets slowly sank the sobs of the woman on the bed took form in words which while strong in their note of calamity yet expressed a querulous mental reaching for some near thing to blame and itll be lucky fer us if we aint both butchered in our sleep plundering and running off horses old santos gone you see if he aint plundering but ma said the girl perplexed and terrified in the same moment theyve gone oh but theyll come back cried the mother without pausing her wail theyll come back trust them for that running off horses o john john why did you why did you she suddenly lifted herself and sat rigid staring at her daughter mary she said in tragic whisper the kitchen door isnt locked already she was bended forward to listen her mouth agape her eyes fixed upon her daughter mother faltered the girl her mother again whispered the kitchen door isnt locked motionless and mute they stared into each others eyes at last the girl quavered we better we better go and lock it the mother nodded hanging arm in arm they stole across the floor toward the head of the stairs a board of the floor creaked they halted and exchanged a look of dumb agony at last they reached the head of the stairs from the kitchen came the bass humming of the kettle and frequent sputterings and cracklings from the fire these sounds were sinister the mother and the girl stood incapable of movement theres somebody down there whispered the elder woman finally the girl made a gesture of resolution she twisted her arm from her mothers hands and went two steps downward she addressed the kitchen whos there her tone was intended to be dauntless it rang so dramatically in the silence that a sudden new panic seized them as if the suspected presence in the kitchen had cried out to them but the girl ventured again is there anybody there no reply was made save by the kettle and the fire with a stealthy tread the girl continued her journey as she neared the last step the fire crackled explosively and the girl screamed but the mystic presence had not swept around the corner to grab her so she dropped to a seat on the step and laughed it was was only the the fire she said stammering hysterically then she arose with sudden fortitude and cried why there isnt anybody there i know there isnt she marched down into the kitchen in her face was dread as if she half expected to confront something but the room was empty she cried joyously theres nobody here come on down ma she ran to the kitchen door and locked it the mother came down to the kitchen oh dear what a fright ive had its given me the sick headache i know it has oh ma said the girl i know it has i know it oh if your father was only here hed settle those yankees mighty quick hed settle em two poor helpless women why ma what makes you act so the yankees havent oh theyll be back theyll be back two poor helpless women your father and your uncle asa and bill off galavanting around and fighting when they ought to be protecting their home thats the kind of men they are didnt i say to your father just before he left ma said the girl coming suddenly from the window the barn door is open i wonder if they took old santo oh of course they have of course mary i dont see what we are going to do i dont see what we are going to do the girl said ma im going to see if they took old santo mary cried the mother dont you dare but think of poor old sant ma never you mind old santo were lucky to be safe ourselves i tell you never mind old santo dont you dare to go out there mary mary the girl had unlocked the door and stepped out upon the porch the mother cried in despair mary why there isnt anybody out here the girl called in response she stood for a moment with a curious smile upon her face as of gleeful satisfaction at her daring the breeze was waving the boughs of the apple trees a rooster with an air importantly courteous was conducting three hens upon a foraging tour on the hillside at the rear of the grey old barn the red leaves of a creeper flamed amid the summer foliage high in the sky clouds rolled toward the north the girl swung impulsively from the little stoop and ran toward the barn the great door was open and the carved peg which usually performed the office of a catch lay on the ground the girl could not see into the barn because of the heavy shadows she paused in a listening attitude and heard a horse munching placidly she gave a cry of delight and sprang across the threshold then she suddenly shrank back and gasped she had confronted three men in grey seated upon the floor with their legs stretched out and their backs against santos manger their dustcovered countenances were expanded in grins ii as mary sprang backward and screamed one of the calm men in grey still grinning announced i knowed youd holler sitting there comfortably the three surveyed her with amusement mary caught her breath throwing her hand up to her throat oh she said you you frightened me were sorry lady but couldnt help it no way cheerfully responded another i knowed youd holler when i seen you coming yere but i raikoned we couldnt help it no way we haint atroubling this yere barn i dont guess we been doing some mighty tall sleeping yere we done woke when them yanks loped past where did you come from did did you escape from the the yankees the girl still stammered and trembled the three soldiers laughed no mm no mm they never cotch us we was in a muss down the road yere about two mile and bill yere they gin it to him in the arm kehplunk and they pasted me thar too curious and sim yere he didnt get nothing but they chased us all quite a little piece and we done lose track of our boys was it was it those who passed here just now did they chase you the men in grey laughed again what them no indeedee there was a mighty big swarm of yanks and a mighty big swarm of our boys too what that little passel no mm she became calm enough to scan them more attentively they were much begrimed and very dusty their grey clothes were tattered splashed mud had dried upon them in reddish spots it appeared too that the men had not shaved in many days in the hats there was a singular diversity one soldier wore the little blue cap of the northern infantry with corps emblem and regimental number one wore a great slouch hat with a wide hole in the crown and the other wore no hat at all the left sleeve of one man and the right sleeve of another had been slit and the arms were neatly bandaged with clean cloths these haint no more than two little cuts explained one we stopped up yere to mis leavitts she said her name was and she bind them for us bill yere he had the thirst come on him and the fever too we did you ever see my father in the army asked mary john hinckson his name is the three soldiers grinned again but they replied kindly no mm no mm we haint never what is he in the cavalry no said the girl he and my uncle asa and my cousin his name is bill parker they are all with longstreet they call him oh said the soldiers longstreet oh theyre a good smart ways from yere way off up nawtheast there haint nothing but cavalry down yere theyre in the infantry probably we havent heard anything from them for days and days said mary oh theyre all right in the infantry said one man to be consoling the infantry dont do much fighting they go bellering out in a big swarm and only a few of em get hurt but if they was in the cavalry the cavalry mary interrupted him without intention are you hungry she asked the soldiers looked at each other struck by some sudden and singular shame they hung their heads no mm replied one at last santo in his stall was tranquilly chewing and chewing sometimes he looked benevolently over at them he was an old horse and there was something about his eyes and his forelock which created the impression that he wore spectacles mary went and patted his nose well if you are hungry i can get you something she told the men or you might come to the house we wouldnt dast go to the house said one that passel of yanks was only a scouting crowd most like just an advance more coming likely well i can bring you something cried the girl eagerly wont you let me bring you something well said a soldier with embarrassment we haint had much if you could bring us a little snack like just a snack wed without waiting for him to cease the girl turned toward the door but before she had reached it she stopped abruptly listen she whispered her form was bent forward her head turned and lowered her hand extended toward the men in a command for silence they could faintly hear the thudding of many hoofs the clank of arms and frequent calling voices by cracky its the yanks the soldiers scrambled to their feet and came toward the door i knowed that first crowd was only an advance the girl and the three men peered from the shadows of the barn the view of the road was intersected by tree trunks and a little henhouse however they could see many horsemen streaming down the road the horsemen were in blue oh hide hide hide cried the girl with a sob in her voice wait a minute whispered a grey soldier excitedly maybe theyre going along by no by thunder they haint theyre halting scoot boys they made a noiseless dash into the dark end of the barn the girl standing by the door heard them break forth an instant later in clamorous whispers wherell we hide wherell we hide there haint a place to hide the girl turned and glanced wildly about the barn it seemed true the stock of hay had grown low under santos endless munching and from occasional levyings by passing troopers in grey the poles of the mow were barely covered save in one corner where there was a little bunch the girl espied the great feedbox she ran to it and lifted the lid here here she called get in here they had been tearing noiselessly around the rear part of the barn at her low call they came and plunged at the box they did not all get in at the same moment without a good deal of a tangle the wounded men gasped and muttered but they at last were flopped down on the layer of feed which covered the bottom swiftly and softly the girl lowered the lid and then turned like a flash toward the door no one appeared there so she went close to survey the situation the troopers had dismounted and stood in silence by their horses a greybearded man whose red cheeks and nose shone vividly above the whiskers was strolling about with two or three others they wore doublebreasted coats and faded yellow sashes were wound under their black leather swordbelts the greybearded soldier was apparently giving orders pointing here and there mary tiptoed to the feedbox theyve all got off their horses she said to it a finger projected from a knothole near the top and said to her very plainly come closer she obeyed and then a muffled voice could be heard scoot for the house lady and if we dont see you again why much obliged for what you done goodbye she said to the feedbox she made two attempts to walk dauntlessly from the barn but each time she faltered and failed just before she reached the point where she could have been seen by the bluecoated troopers at last however she made a sort of a rush forward and went out into the bright sunshine the group of men in doublebreasted coats wheeled in her direction at the instant the greybearded officer forgot to lower his arm which had been stretched forth in giving an order she felt that her feet were touching the ground in a most unnatural manner her bearing she believed was suddenly grown awkward and ungainly upon her face she thought that this sentence was plainly written there are three men hidden in the feedbox the greybearded soldier came toward her she stopped she seemed about to run away but the soldier doffed his little blue cap and looked amiable you live here i presume he said yes she answered well we are obliged to camp here for the night and as weve got two wounded men with us i dont suppose youd mind if we put them in the barn in in the barn he became aware that she was agitated he smiled assuringly you neednt be frightened we wont hurt anything around here youll all be safe enough the girl balanced on one foot and swung the other to and fro in the grass she was looking down at it but but i dont think ma would like it if if you took the barn the old officer laughed wouldnt she said he thats so maybe she wouldnt he reflected for a time and then decided cheerfully well we will have to go ask her anyhow where is she in the house yes replied the girl shes in the house she shell be scared to death when she sees you well you go and ask her then said the soldier always wearing a benign smile you go ask her and then come and tell me when the girl pushed open the door and entered the kitchen she found it empty ma she called softly there was no answer the kettle still was humming its low song the knife and the curl of potatoskin lay on the floor she went to her mothers room and entered timidly the new lonely aspect of the house shook her nerves upon the bed was a confusion of coverings ma called the girl quaking in fear that her mother was not there to reply but there was a sudden turmoil of the quilts and her mothers head was thrust forth mary she cried in what seemed to be a supreme astonishment i thought i thought oh ma blurted the girl theres over a thousand yankees in the yard and ive hidden three of our men in the feedbox the elder woman however upon the appearance of her daughter had begun to thrash hysterically about on the bed and wail ma the girl exclaimed and now they want to use the barn and our men in the feedbox what shall i do ma what shall i do her mother did not seem to hear so absorbed was she in her grievous flounderings and tears ma appealed the girl ma for a moment mary stood silently debating her lips apart her eyes fixed then she went to the kitchen window and peeked the old officer and the others were staring up the road she went to another window in order to get a proper view of the road and saw that they were gazing at a small body of horsemen approaching at a trot and raising much dust presently she recognised them as the squad that had passed the house earlier for the young man with the dim yellow chevron still rode at their head an unarmed horseman in grey was receiving their close attention as they came very near to the house she darted to the first window again the greybearded officer was smiling a fine broad smile of satisfaction so you got him he called out the young sergeant sprang from his horse and his brown hand moved in a salute the girl could not hear his reply she saw the unarmed horseman in grey stroking a very black moustache and looking about him coolly and with an interested air he appeared so indifferent that she did not understand he was a prisoner until she heard the greybeard call out well put him in the barn hell be safe there i guess a party of troopers moved with the prisoner toward the barn the girl made a sudden gesture of horror remembering the three men in the feedbox iii the busy troopers in blue scurried about the long lines of stamping horses men crooked their backs and perspired in order to rub with cloths or bunches of grass these slim equine legs upon whose splendid machinery they depended so greatly the lips of the horses were still wet and frothy from the steel bars which had wrenched at their mouths all day over their backs and about their noses sped the talk of the men moind where yer plug is steppin finerty keep im aff me an ould elephant he shtrides like a schoolhouse bills little mar she was plum beat when she come in with crawfords crowd crawfords the hardestridin cavalryman in the army an he dont use up a horse neither much they stay fresh when the others are most adroppin finerty will yeh moind that cow a yours amid a bustle of gossip and banter the horses retained their air of solemn rumination twisting their lower jaws from side to side and sometimes rubbing noses dreamfully over in front of the barn three troopers sat talking comfortably their carbines were leaned against the wall at their side and outlined in the black of the open door stood a sentry his weapon resting in the hollow of his arm four horses saddled and accoutred were conferring with their heads close together the four bridlereins were flung over a post upon the calm green of the land typical in every way of peace the hues of war brought thither by the troops shone strangely mary gazing curiously did not feel that she was contemplating a familiar scene it was no longer the home acres the new blue steel and faded yellow thoroughly dominated the old green and brown she could hear the voices of the men and it seemed from their tone that they had camped there for years everything with them was usual they had taken possession of the landscape in such a way that even the old marks appeared strange and formidable to the girl mary had intended to go and tell the commander in blue that her mother did not wish his men to use the barn at all but she paused when she heard him speak to the sergeant she thought she perceived then that it mattered little to him what her mother wished and that an objection by her or by anybody would be futile she saw the soldiers conduct the prisoner in grey into the barn and for a long time she watched the three chatting guards and the pondering sentry upon her mind in desolate weight was the recollection of the three men in the feedbox it seemed to her that in a case of this description it was her duty to be a heroine in all the stories she had read when at boardingschool in pennsylvania the girl characters confronted with such difficulties invariably did hairbreadth things true they were usually bent upon rescuing and recovering their lovers and neither the calm man in grey nor any of the three in the feedbox was lover of hers but then a real heroine would not pause over this minor question plainly a heroine would take measures to rescue the four men if she did not at least make the attempt she would be false to those carefully constructed ideals which were the accumulation of years of dreaming but the situation puzzled her there was the barn with only one door and with four armed troopers in front of this door one of them with his back to the rest of the world engaged no doubt in a steadfast contemplation of the calm man and incidentally of the feedbox she knew too that even if she should open the kitchen door three heads and perhaps four would turn casually in her direction their ears were real ears heroines she knew conducted these matters with infinite precision and despatch they severed the heros bonds cried a dramatic sentence and stood between him and his enemies until he had run far enough away she saw well however that even should she achieve all things up to the point where she might take glorious stand between the escaping and the pursuers those grim troopers in blue would not pause they would run around her make a circuit one by one she saw the gorgeous contrivances and expedients of fiction fall before the plain homely difficulties of this situation they were of no service sadly ruefully she thought of the calm man and of the contents of the feedbox the sum of her invention was that she could sally forth to the commander of the blue cavalry and confessing to him that there were three of her friends and his enemies secreted in the feedbox pray him to let them depart unmolested but she was beginning to believe the old greybeard to be a bear it was hardly probable that he would give this plan his support it was more probable that he and some of his men would at once descend upon the feedbox and confiscate her three friends the difficulty with her idea was that she could not learn its value without trying it and then in case of failure it would be too late for remedies and other plans she reflected that war made men very unreasonable all that she could do was to stand at the window and mournfully regard the barn she admitted this to herself with a sense of deep humiliation she was not then made of that fine stuff that mental satin which enabled some other beings to be of such mighty service to the distressed she was defeated by a barn with one door by four men with eight eyes and eight ears trivialities that would not impede the real heroine the vivid white light of broad day began slowly to fade tones of grey came upon the fields and the shadows were of lead in this more sombre atmosphere the fires built by the troops down in the far end of the orchard grew more brilliant becoming spots of crimson colour in the dark grove the girl heard a fretting voice from her mothers room mary she hastily obeyed the call she perceived that she had quite forgotten her mothers existence in this time of excitement the elder woman still lay upon the bed her face was flushed and perspiration stood amid new wrinkles upon her forehead weaving wild glances from side to side she began to whimper oh im just sick im just sick have those men gone yet have they gone the girl smoothed a pillow carefully for her mothers head no ma theyre here yet but they havent hurt anything it doesnt seem will i get you something to eat her mother gestured her away with the impatience of the ill no no just dont bother me my head is splitting and you know very well that nothing can be done for me when i get one of these spells its trouble thats what makes them when are those men going look here dont you go way you stick close to the house now ill stay right here said the girl she sat in the gloom and listened to her mothers incessant moaning when she attempted to move her mother cried out at her when she desired to ask if she might try to alleviate the pain she was interrupted shortly somehow her sitting in passive silence within hearing of this illness seemed to contribute to her mothers relief she assumed a posture of submission sometimes her mother projected questions concerning the local condition and although she laboured to be graphic and at the same time soothing unalarming her form of reply was always displeasing to the sick woman and brought forth ejaculations of angry impatience eventually the woman slept in the manner of one worn from terrible labour the girl went slowly and softly to the kitchen when she looked from the window she saw the four soldiers still at the barn door in the west the sky was yellow some treetrunks intersecting it appeared black as streaks of ink soldiers hovered in blue clouds about the bright splendour of the fires in the orchard there were glimmers of steel the girl sat in the new gloom of the kitchen and watched the soldiers lit a lantern and hung it in the barn its rays made the form of the sentry seem gigantic horses whinnied from the orchard there was a low hum of human voices sometimes small detachments of troopers rode past the front of the house the girl heard the abrupt calls of sentries she fetched some food and ate it from her hand standing by the window she was so afraid that something would occur that she barely left her post for an instant a picture of the interior of the barn hung vividly in her mind she recalled the knotholes in the boards at the rear but she admitted that the prisoners could not escape through them she remembered some inadequacies of the roof but these also counted for nothing when confronting the problem she felt her ambitions her ideals tumbling headlong like cottages of straw once she felt that she had decided to reconnoitre at any rate it was night the lantern at the barn and the camp fires made everything without their circle into masses of heavy mystic blackness she took two steps toward the door but there she paused innumerable possibilities of danger had assailed her mind she returned to the window and stood wavering at last she went swiftly to the door opened it and slid noiselessly into the darkness for a moment she regarded the shadows down in the orchard the camp fires of the troops appeared precisely like a great painting all in reds upon a black cloth the voices of the troopers still hummed the girl started slowly off in the opposite direction her eyes were fixed in a stare she studied the darkness in front for a moment before she ventured upon a forward step unconsciously her throat was arranged for a sudden shrill scream high in the treebranches she could hear the voice of the wind a melody of the night low and sad the plaint of an endless incommunicable sorrow her own distress the plight of the men in grey these near matters as well as all she had known or imagined of grief everything was expressed in this soft mourning of the wind in the trees at first she felt like weeping this sound told her of human impotency and doom then later the trees and the wind breathed strength to her sang of sacrifice of dauntless effort of hard carven faces that did not blanch when duty came at midnight or at noon she turned often to scan the shadowy figures that moved from time to time in the light at the barn door once she trod upon a stick and it flopped crackling in the intolerable manner of all sticks at this noise however the guards at the barn made no sign finally she was where she could see the knotholes in the rear of the structure gleaming like pieces of metal from the effect of the light within scarcely breathing in her excitement she glided close and applied an eye to a knothole she had barely achieved one glance at the interior before she sprang back shuddering for the unconscious and cheerful sentry at the door was swearing away in flaming sentences heaping one gorgeous oath upon another making a conflagration of his description of his troophorse why he was declaring to the calm prisoner in grey you aint got a horse in your hull army that can run forty rod with that there little mar as in the outer darkness mary cautiously returned to the knothole the three guards in front suddenly called in low tones sssh quit pete here comes the lieutenant the sentry had apparently been about to resume his declamation but at these warnings he suddenly posed in a soldierly manner a tall and lean officer with a smooth face entered the barn the sentry saluted primly the officer flashed a comprehensive glance about him everything all right all right sir this officer had eyes like the points of stilettos the lines from his nose to the corners of his mouth were deep and gave him a slightly disagreeable aspect but somewhere in his face there was a quality of singular thoughtfulness as of the absorbed student dealing in generalities which was utterly in opposition to the rapacious keenness of the eyes which saw everything suddenly he lifted a long finger and pointed whats that that thats a feedbox i suppose whats in it i dont know i you ought to know said the officer sharply he walked over to the feedbox and flung up the lid with a sweeping gesture he reached down and scooped a handful of feed you ought to know whats in everything when you have prisoners in your care he added scowling during the time of this incident the girl had nearly swooned her hands searched weakly over the boards for something to which to cling with the pallor of the dying she had watched the downward sweep of the officers arm which after all had only brought forth a handful of feed the result was a stupefaction of her mind she was astonished out of her senses at this spectacle of three large men metamorphosed into a handful of feed iv it is perhaps a singular thing that this absence of the three men from the feedbox at the time of the sharp lieutenants investigation should terrify the girl more than it should joy her that for which she had prayed had come to pass apparently the escape of these men in the face of every improbability had been granted her but her dominating emotion was fright the feedbox was a mystic and terrible machine like some dark magicians trap she felt it almost possible that she should see the three weird man floating spectrally away through the air she glanced with swift apprehension behind her and when the dazzle from the lanterns light had left her eyes saw only the dim hillside stretched in solemn silence the interior of the barn possessed for her another fascination because it was now uncanny it contained that extraordinary feedbox when she peeped again at the knothole the calm grey prisoner was seated upon the feedbox thumping it with his dangling careless heels as if it were in nowise his conception of a remarkable feedbox the sentry also stood facing it his carbine he held in the hollow of his arm his legs were spread apart and he mused from without came the low mumble of the three other troopers the sharp lieutenant had vanished the trembling yellow light of the lantern caused the figures of the men to cast monstrous wavering shadows there were spaces of gloom which shrouded ordinary things in impressive garb the roof presented an inscrutable blackness save where small rifts in the shingles glowed phosphorescently frequently old santo put down a thunderous hoof the heels of the prisoner made a sound like the booming of a wild kind of drum when the men moved their heads their eyes shone with ghoulish whiteness and their complexions were always waxen and unreal and there was that profoundly strange feedbox imperturbable with its burden of fantastic mystery suddenly from down near her feet the girl heard a crunching sound a sort of a nibbling as if some silent and very discreet terrier was at work upon the turf she faltered back here was no doubt another grotesque detail of this most unnatural episode she did not run because physically she was in the power of these events her feet chained her to the ground in submission to this march of terror after terror as she stared at the spot from which this sound seemed to come there floated through her mind a vague sweet vision a vision of her safe little room in which at this hour she usually was sleeping the scratching continued faintly and with frequent pauses as if the terrier was then listening when the girl first removed her eyes from the knothole the scene appeared of one velvet blackness then gradually objects loomed with a dim lustre she could see now where the tops of the trees joined the sky and the form of the barn was before her dyed in heavy purple she was ever about to shriek but no sound came from her constricted throat she gazed at the ground with the expression of countenance of one who watches the sinistermoving grass where a serpent approaches dimly she saw a piece of sod wrenched free and drawn under the great foundationbeam of the barn once she imagined that she saw human hands not outlined at all but sufficient in colour form or movement to make subtle suggestion then suddenly a thought that illuminated the entire situation flashed in her mind like a light the three men late of the feedbox were beneath the floor of the barn and were now scraping their way under this beam she did not consider for a moment how they could come there they were marvellous creatures the supernatural was to be expected of them she no longer trembled for she was possessed upon this instant of the most unchangeable species of conviction the evidence before her amounted to no evidence at all but nevertheless her opinion grew in an instant from an irresponsible acorn to a rooted and immovable tree it was as if she was on a jury she stooped down hastily and scanned the ground there she indeed saw a pair of hands hauling at the dirt where the sod had been displaced softly in a whisper like a breath she said hey the dim hands were drawn hastily under the barn the girl reflected for a moment then she stooped and whispered hey its me after a time there was a resumption of the digging the ghostly hands began once more their cautious mining she waited in hollow reverberations from the interior of the barn came the frequent sounds of old santos lazy movements the sentry conversed with the prisoner at last the girl saw a head thrust slowly from under the beam she perceived the face of one of the miraculous soldiers from the feedbox a pair of eyes glintered and wavered then finally settled upon her a pale statue of a girl the eyes became lit with a kind of humorous greeting an arm gestured at her stooping she breathed all right the man drew himself silently back under the beam a moment later the pair of hands resumed their cautious task ultimately the head and arms of the man were thrust strangely from the earth he was lying on his back the girl thought of the dirt in his hair wriggling slowly and pushing at the beam above him he forced his way out of the curious little passage he twisted his body and raised himself upon his hands he grinned at the girl and drew his feet carefully from under the beam when he at last stood erect beside her he at once began mechanically to brush the dirt from his clothes with his hands in the barn the sentry and his prisoner were evidently engaged in an argument the girl and the first miraculous soldier signalled warily it seemed that they feared that their arms would make noises in passing through the air their lips moved conveying dim meanings in this signlanguage the girl described the situation in the barn with guarded motions she told him of the importance of absolute stillness he nodded and then in the same manner he told her of his two companions under the barn floor he informed her again of their wounded state and wagged his head to express his despair he contorted his face to tell how sore were their arms and jabbed the air mournfully to express their remote geographical position this signalling was interrupted by the sound of a body being dragged or dragging itself with slow swishing sound under the barn the sound was too loud for safety they rushed to the hole and began to semaphore until a shaggy head appeared with rolling eyes and quick grin with frantic downward motions of their arms they suppressed this grin and with it the swishing noise in dramatic pantomime they informed this head of the terrible consequences of so much noise the head nodded and painfully but with extreme care the second man pushed and pulled himself from the hole in a faint whisper the first man said wheres sim the second man made low reply hes right here he motioned reassuringly toward the hole when the third head appeared a soft smile of glee came upon each face and the mute group exchanged expressive glances when they all stood together free from this tragic barn they breathed a long sigh that was contemporaneous with another smile and another exchange of glances one of the men tiptoed to a knothole and peered into the barn the sentry was at that moment speaking yes we know em all there isnt a house in this region that we dont know who is in it most of the time we collar em once in a while like we did you now that house out yonder we the man suddenly left the knothole and returned to the others upon his face dimly discerned there was an indication that he had made an astonishing discovery the others questioned him with their eyes but he simply waved an arm to express his inability to speak at that spot he led them back toward the hill prowling carefully at a safe distance from the barn he halted and as they grouped eagerly about him he exploded in an intense undertone why that thats capn sawyer they got in yonder capn sawyer incredulously whispered the other men but the girl had something to ask how did you get out of that feedbox he smiled well when you put us in there we was just in a minute when we allowed it wasnt a mighty safe place and we allowed wed get out and we did we skedaddled round and round until it peared like we was going to get cotched and then we flung ourselves down in the cowstalls where its lowlike just dirt floor and then we just naturally went awhooping under the barn floor when the yanks come and we didnt know capn sawyer by his voice nohow we heard im discoursing and we allowed it was a mighty pert man but we didnt know that it was him no mm these three men so recently from a situation of peril seemed suddenly to have dropped all thought of it they stood with sad faces looking at the barn they seemed to be making no plans at all to reach a place of more complete safety they were halted and stupefied by some unknown calamity how do you raikon they cotch him sim one whispered mournfully i dont know replied another in the same tone another with a low snarl expressed in two words his opinion of the methods of fate oh hell the three men started then as if simultaneously stung and gazed at the young girl who stood silently near them the man who had sworn began to make agitated apology pardon miss pon my soul i clean forgot you was by deed and i wouldnt swear like that if i had knowed deed i wouldnt the girl did not seem to hear him she was staring at the barn suddenly she turned and whispered who is he hes capn sawyer mm they told her sorrowfully hes our own capn hes been in command of us yere since a long time hes got folks about yere raikon they cotch him while he was avisiting she was still for a time and then awed she said will they will they hang him no mm oh no mm dont raikon no such thing no mm the group became absorbed in a contemplation of the barn for a time no one moved nor spoke at last the girl was aroused by slight sounds and turning she perceived that the three men who had so recently escaped from the barn were now advancing toward it v the girl waiting in the darkness expected to hear the sudden crash and uproar of a fight as soon as the three creeping men should reach the barn she reflected in an agony upon the swift disaster that would befall any enterprise so desperate she had an impulse to beg them to come away the grass rustled in silken movements as she sped toward the barn when she arrived however she gazed about her bewildered the men were gone she searched with her eyes trying to detect some moving thing but she could see nothing left alone again she began to be afraid of the night the great stretches of darkness could hide crawling dangers from sheer desire to see a human she was obliged to peep again at the knothole the sentry had apparently wearied of talking instead he was reflecting the prisoner still sat on the feedbox moodily staring at the floor the girl felt in one way that she was looking at a ghastly group in wax she started when the old horse put down an echoing hoof she wished the men would speak their silence reenforced the strange aspect they might have been two dead men the girl felt impelled to look at the corner of the interior where were the cowstalls there was no light there save the appearance of peculiar grey haze which marked the track of the dimming rays of the lantern all else was sombre shadow at last she saw something move there it might have been as small as a rat or it might have been a part of something as large as a man at any rate it proclaimed that something in that spot was alive at one time she saw it plainly and at other times it vanished because her fixture of gaze caused her occasionally to greatly tangle and blur those peculiar shadows and faint lights at last however she perceived a human head it was monstrously dishevelled and wild it moved slowly forward until its glance could fall upon the prisoner and then upon the sentry the wandering rays caused the eyes to glitter like silver the girls heart pounded so that she put her hand over it the sentry and the prisoner remained immovably waxen and over in the gloom the head thrust from the floor watched them with its silver eyes finally the prisoner slipped from the feedbox and raising his arms yawned at great length oh well he remarked you boys will get a good licking if you fool around here much longer thats some satisfaction anyhow even if you did bag me youll get a good walloping he reflected for a moment and decided im sort of willing to be captured if you fellows only get a dd good licking for being so smart the sentry looked up and smiled a superior smile licking hey nixey he winked exasperatingly at the prisoner you fellows are not fast enough my boy why didnt you lick us at and at and at he named some of the great battles to this the captive officer blurted in angry astonishment why we did the sentry winked again in profound irony yes i know you did of course you whipped us didnt you fine kind of whipping that was why we he suddenly ceased smitten mute by a sound that broke the stillness of the night it was the sharp crack of a distant shot that made wild echoes among the hills it was instantly followed by the hoarse cry of a human voice a faraway yell of warning singing of surprise peril fear of death a moment later there was a distant fierce spattering of shots the sentry and the prisoner stood facing each other their lips apart listening the orchard at that instant awoke to sudden tumult there were the thud and scramble and scamper of feet the mellow swift clash of arms mens voices in question oath command hurried and unhurried resolute and frantic a horse sped along the road at a raging gallop a loud voice shouted what is it ferguson another voice yelled something incoherent there was a sharp discordant chorus of command an uproarious volley suddenly rang from the orchard the prisoner in grey moved from his intent listening attitude instantly the eyes of the sentry blazed and he said with a new and terrible sternness stand where you are the prisoner trembled in his excitement expressions of delight and triumph bubbled to his lips a surprise by gawd now now youll see the sentry stolidly swung his carbine to his shoulder he sighted carefully along the barrel until it pointed at the prisoners head about at his nose well ive got you anyhow remember that dont move the prisoner could not keep his arms from nervously gesturing i wont but and shut your mouth the three comrades of the sentry flung themselves into view pete devil of a row can you ive got him said the sentry calmly and without moving it was as if the barrel of the carbine rested on piers of stone the three comrades turned and plunged into the darkness in the orchard it seemed as if two gigantic animals were engaged in a mad floundering encounter snarling howling in a whirling chaos of noise and motion in the barn the prisoner and his guard faced each other in silence as for the girl at the knothole the sky had fallen at the beginning of this clamour she would not have been astonished to see the stars swinging from their abodes and the vegetation the barn all blow away it was the end of everything the grand universal murder when two of the three miraculous soldiers who formed the original feedbox corps emerged in detail from the hole under the beam and slid away into the darkness she did no more than glance at them suddenly she recollected the head with silver eyes she started forward and again applied her eyes to the knothole even with the din resounding from the orchard from up the road and down the road from the heavens and from the deep earth the central fascination was this mystic head there to her was the dark god of the tragedy the prisoner in grey at this moment burst into a laugh that was no more than a hysterical gurgle well you cant hold that gun out for ever pretty soon youll have to lower it the sentrys voice sounded slightly muffled for his cheek was pressed against the weapon i wont be tired for some time yet the girl saw the head slowly rise the eyes fixed upon the sentrys face a tall black figure slunk across the cowstalls and vanished back of old santos quarters she knew what was to come to pass she knew this grim thing was upon a terrible mission and that it would reappear again at the head of the little passage between santos stall and the wall almost at the sentrys elbow and yet when she saw a faint indication as of a form crouching there a scream from an utterly new alarm almost escaped her the sentrys arms after all were not of granite he moved restively at last he spoke in his even unchanging tone well i guess youll have to climb into that feedbox step back and lift the lid why you dont mean step back the girl felt a cry of warning arising to her lips as she gazed at this sentry she noted every detail of his facial expression she saw moreover his mass of brown hair bunching disgracefully about his ears his clear eyes lit now with a hard cold light his forehead puckered in a mighty scowl the ring upon the third finger of the left hand oh they wont kill him surely they wont kill him the noise of the fight in the orchard was the loud music the thunder and lightning the rioting of the tempest which people love during the critical scene of a tragedy when the prisoner moved back in reluctant obedience he faced for an instant the entrance of the little passage and what he saw there must have been written swiftly graphically in his eyes and the sentry read it and knew then that he was upon the threshold of his death in a fraction of time certain information went from the grim thing in the passage to the prisoner and from the prisoner to the sentry but at that instant the black formidable figure arose towered and made its leap a new shadow flashed across the floor when the blow was struck as for the girl at the knothole when she returned to sense she found herself standing with clenched hands and screaming with her might as if her reason had again departed from her she ran around the barn in at the door and flung herself sobbing beside the body of the soldier in blue the uproar of the fight became at last coherent inasmuch as one party was giving shouts of supreme exultation the firing no longer sounded in crashes it was now expressed in spiteful crackles the last words of the combat spoken with feminine vindictiveness presently there was a thud of flying feet a grimy panting redfaced mob of troopers in blue plunged into the barn became instantly frozen to attitudes of amazement and rage and then roared in one great chorus hes gone the girl who knelt beside the body upon the floor turned toward them her lamenting eyes and cried hes not dead is he he cant be dead they thronged forward the sharp lieutenant who had been so particular about the feedbox knelt by the side of the girl and laid his head against the chest of the prostrate soldier why no he said rising and looking at the man hes all right some of you boys throw some water on him are you sure demanded the girl feverishly of course hell be better after awhile oh said she softly and then looked down at the sentry she started to arise and the lieutenant reached down and hoisted rather awkwardly at her arm dont you worry about him hes all right she turned her face with its curving lips and shining eyes once more toward the unconscious soldier upon the floor the troopers made a lane to the door the lieutenant bowed the girl vanished queer said a young officer girl very clearly worst kind of rebel and yet she falls to weeping and wailing like mad over one of her enemies be around in the morning with all sorts of doctoring you see if she aint queer the sharp lieutenant shrugged his shoulders after reflection he shrugged his shoulders again he said war changes many things but it doesnt change everything thank god a mystery of heroism the dark uniforms of the men were so coated with dust from the incessant wrestling of the two armies that the regiment almost seemed a part of the clay bank which shielded them from the shells on the top of the hill a battery was arguing in tremendous roars with some other guns and to the eye of the infantry the artillerymen the guns the caissons the horses were distinctly outlined upon the blue sky when a piece was fired a red streak as round as a log flashed low in the heavens like a monstrous bolt of lightning the men of the battery wore white duck trousers which somehow emphasised their legs and when they ran and crowded in little groups at the bidding of the shouting officers it was more impressive than usual to the infantry fred collins of a company was saying thunder i wisht i had a drink aint there any water round here then somebody yelled there goes th bugler as the eyes of half the regiment swept in one machinelike movement there was an instants picture of a horse in a great convulsive leap of a deathwound and a rider leaning back with a crooked arm and spread fingers before his face on the ground was the crimson terror of an exploding shell with fibres of flame that seemed like lances a glittering bugle swung clear of the riders back as fell headlong the horse and the man in the air was an odour as from a conflagration sometimes they of the infantry looked down at a fair little meadow which spread at their feet its long green grass was rippling gently in a breeze beyond it was the grey form of a house half torn to pieces by shells and by the busy axes of soldiers who had pursued firewood the line of an old fence was now dimly marked by long weeds and by an occasional post a shell had blown the wellhouse to fragments little lines of grey smoke ribboning upward from some embers indicated the place where had stood the barn from beyond a curtain of green woods there came the sound of some stupendous scuffle as if two animals of the size of islands were fighting at a distance there were occasional appearances of swiftmoving men horses batteries flags and with the crashing of infantry volleys were heard often wild and frenzied cheers in the midst of it all smith and ferguson two privates of a company were engaged in a heated discussion which involved the greatest questions of the national existence the battery on the hill presently engaged in a frightful duel the white legs of the gunners scampered this way and that way and the officers redoubled their shouts the guns with their demeanours of stolidity and courage were typical of something infinitely selfpossessed in this clamour of death that swirled around the hill one of a swing team was suddenly smitten quivering to the ground and his maddened brethren dragged his torn body in their struggle to escape from this turmoil and danger a young soldier astride one of the leaders swore and fumed in his saddle and furiously jerked at the bridle an officer screamed out an order so violently that his voice broke and ended the sentence in a falsetto shriek the leading company of the infantry regiment was somewhat exposed and the colonel ordered it moved more fully under the shelter of the hill there was the clank of steel against steel a lieutenant of the battery rode down and passed them holding his right arm carefully in his left hand and it was as if this arm was not at all a part of him but belonged to another man his sober and reflective charger went slowly the officers face was grimy and perspiring and his uniform was tousled as if he had been in direct grapple with an enemy he smiled grimly when the men stared at him he turned his horse toward the meadow collins of a company said i wisht i had a drink i bet theres water in that there ol well yonder yes but how you goin to git it for the little meadow which intervened was now suffering a terrible onslaught of shells its green and beautiful calm had vanished utterly brown earth was being flung in monstrous handfuls and there was a massacre of the young blades of grass they were being torn burned obliterated some curious fortune of the battle had made this gentle little meadow the object of the red hate of the shells and each one as it exploded seemed like an imprecation in the face of a maiden the wounded officer who was riding across this expanse said to himself why they couldnt shoot any harder if the whole army was massed here a shell struck the grey ruins of the house and as after the roar the shattered wall fell in fragments there was a noise which resembled the flapping of shutters during a wild gale of winter indeed the infantry paused in the shelter of the bank appeared as men standing upon a shore contemplating a madness of the sea the angel of calamity had under its glance the battery upon the hill fewer whitelegged men laboured about the guns a shell had smitten one of the pieces and after the flare the smoke the dust the wrath of this blow were gone it was possible to see white lugs stretched horizontally upon the ground and at that interval to the rear where it is the business of battery horses to stand with their noses to the fight awaiting the command to drag their guns out of the destruction or into it or wheresoever these incomprehensible humans demanded with whip and spur in this line of passive and dumb spectators whose fluttering hearts yet would not let them forget the iron laws of mans control of them in this rank of brutesoldiers there had been relentless and hideous carnage from the ruck of bleeding and prostrate horses the men of the infantry could see one animal raising its stricken body with its fore legs and turning its nose with mystic and profound eloquence toward the sky some comrades joked collins about his thirst well if yeh want a drink so bad why dont yeh go git it well i will in a minnet if yeh dont shut up a lieutenant of artillery floundered his horse straight down the hill with as little concern as if it were level ground as he galloped past the colonel of the infantry he threw up his hand in swift salute weve got to get out of that he roared angrily he was a blackbearded officer and his eyes which resembled beads sparkled like those of an insane man his jumping horse sped along the column of infantry the fat major standing carelessly with his sword held horizontally behind him and with his legs far apart looked after the receding horseman and laughed he wants to get back with orders pretty quick or therell be no battry left he observed the wise young captain of the second company hazarded to the lieutenantcolonel that the enemys infantry would probably soon attack the hill and the lieutenantcolonel snubbed him a private in one of the rear companies looked out over the meadow and then turned to a companion and said look there jim it was the wounded officer from the battery who some time before had started to ride across the meadow supporting his right arm carefully with his left hand this man had encountered a shell apparently at a time when no one perceived him and he could now be seen lying face downward with a stirruped foot stretched across the body of his dead horse a leg of the charger extended slantingly upward precisely as stiff as a stake around this motionless pair the shells still howled there was a quarrel in a company collins was shaking his fist in the faces of some laughing comrades dern yeh i aint afraid t go if yeh say much i will go of course yeh will youll run through that there medder wont yeh collins said in a terrible voice you see now at this ominous threat his comrades broke into renewed jeers collins gave them a dark scowl and went to find his captain the latter was conversing with the colonel of the regiment captain said collins saluting and standing at attention in those days all trousers bagged at the knees captain i want t get permission to go git some water from that there well over yonder the colonel and the captain swung about simultaneously and stared across the meadow the captain laughed you must be pretty thirsty collins yes sir i am well ah said the captain after a moment he asked cant you wait no sir the colonel was watching collinss face look here my lad he said in a pious sort of a voice look here my lad collins was not a lad dont you think thats taking pretty big risks for a little drink of water i dunno said collins uncomfortably some of the resentment toward his companions which perhaps had forced him into this affair was beginning to fade i dunno wether tis the colonel and the captain contemplated him for a time well said the captain finally well said the colonel if you want to go why go collins saluted much obliged t yeh as he moved away the colonel called after him take some of the other boys canteens with you an hurry back now yes sir i will the colonel and the captain looked at each other then for it had suddenly occurred that they could not for the life of them tell whether collins wanted to go or whether he did not they turned to regard collins and as they perceived him surrounded by gesticulating comrades the colonel said well by thunder i guess hes going collins appeared as a man dreaming in the midst of the questions the advice the warnings all the excited talk of his company mates he maintained a curious silence they were very busy in preparing him for his ordeal when they inspected him carefully it was somewhat like the examination that grooms give a horse before a race and they were amazed staggered by the whole affair their astonishment found vent in strange repetitions are yeh sure agoin they demanded again and again certainly i am cried collins at last furiously he strode sullenly away from them he was swinging five or six canteens by their cords it seemed that his cap would not remain firmly on his head and often he reached and pulled it down over his brow there was a general movement in the compact column the long animallike thing moved slightly its four hundred eyes were turned upon the figure of collins well sir if that aint th derndest thing i never thought fred collins had the blood in him for that kind of business whats he goin to do anyhow hes goin to that well there after water we aint dyin of thirst are we thats foolishness well somebody put him up to it an hes doin it say he must be a desperate cuss when collins faced the meadow and walked away from the regiment he was vaguely conscious that a chasm the deep valley of all prides was suddenly between him and his comrades it was provisional but the provision was that he return as a victor he had blindly been led by quaint emotions and laid himself under an obligation to walk squarely up to the face of death but he was not sure that he wished to make a retraction even if he could do so without shame as a matter of truth he was sure of very little he was mainly surprised it seemed to him supernaturally strange that he had allowed his mind to manoeuvre his body into such a situation he understood that it might be called dramatically great however he had no full appreciation of anything excepting that he was actually conscious of being dazed he could feel his dulled mid groping after the form and colour of this incident he wondered why he did not feel some keen agony of fear cutting his sense like a knife he wondered at this because human expression had said loudly for centuries that men should feel afraid of certain things and that all men who did not feel this fear were phenomena heroes he was then a hero he suffered that disappointment which we would all have if we discovered that we were ourselves capable of those deeds which we most admire in history and legend this then was a hero after all heroes were not much no it could not be true he was not a hero heroes had no shames in their lives and as for him he remembered borrowing fifteen dollars from a friend and promising to pay it back the next day and then avoiding that friend for ten months when at home his mother had aroused him for the early labour of his life on the farm it had often been his fashion to be irritable childish diabolical and his mother had died since he had come to the war he saw that in this matter of the well the canteens the shells he was an intruder in the land of fine deeds he was now about thirty paces from his comrades the regiment had just turned its many faces toward him from the forest of terrific noises there suddenly emerged a little uneven line of men they fired fiercely and rapidly at distant foliage on which appeared little puffs of white smoke the spatter of skirmish firing was added to the thunder of the guns on the hill the little line of men ran forward a coloursergeant fell flat with his flag as if he had slipped on ice there was hoarse cheering from this distant field collins suddenly felt that two demon fingers were pressed into his ears he could see nothing but flying arrows flaming red he lurched from the shock of this explosion but he made a mad rush for the house which he viewed as a man submerged to the neck in a boiling surf might view the shore in the air little pieces of shell howled and the earthquake explosions drove him insane with the menace of their roar as he ran the canteens knocked together with a rhythmical tinkling as he neared the house each detail of the scene became vivid to him he was aware of some bricks of the vanished chimney lying on the sod there was a door which hung by one hinge rifle bullets called forth by the insistent skirmishers came from the faroff bank of foliage they mingled with the shells and the pieces of shells until the air was torn in all directions by hootings yells howls the sky was full of fiends who directed all their wild rage at his head when he came to the well he flung himself face downward and peered into its darkness there were furtive silver glintings some feet from the surface he grabbed one of the canteens and unfastening its cap swung it down by the cord the water flowed slowly in with an indolent gurgle and now as he lay with his face turned away he was suddenly smitten with the terror it came upon his heart like the grasp of claws all the power faded from his muscles for an instant he was no more than a dead man the canteen filled with a maddening slowness in the manner of all bottles presently he recovered his strength and addressed a screaming oath to it he leaned over until it seemed as if he intended to try to push water into it with his hands his eyes as he gazed down into the well shone like two pieces of metal and in their expression was a great appeal and a great curse the stupid water derided him there was the blaring thunder of a shell crimson light shone through the swiftboiling smoke and made a pink reflection on part of the wall of the well collins jerked out his arm and canteen with the same motion that a man would use in withdrawing his head from a furnace he scrambled erect and glared and hesitated on the ground near him lay the old well bucket with a length of rusty chain he lowered it swiftly into the well the bucket struck the water and then turning lazily over sank when with hand reaching tremblingly over hand he hauled it out it knocked often against the walls of the well and spilled some of its contents in running with a filled bucket a man can adopt but one kind of gait so through this terrible field over which screamed practical angels of death collins ran in the manner of a farmer chased out of a dairy by a bull his face went staring white with anticipation anticipation of a blow that would whirl him around and down he would fall as he had seen other men fall the life knocked out of them so suddenly that their knees were no more quick to touch the ground than their heads he saw the long blue line of the regiment but his comrades were standing looking at him from the edge of an impossible star he was aware of some deep wheelruts and hoofprints in the sod beneath his feet the artillery officer who had fallen in this meadow had been making groans in the teeth of the tempest of sound these futile cries wrenched from him by his agony were heard only by shells bullets when wildeyed collins came running this officer raised himself his face contorted and blanched from pain he was about to utter some great beseeching cry but suddenly his face straightened and he called say young man give me a drink of water will you collins had no room amid his emotions for surprise he was mad from the threats of destruction i cant he screamed and in his reply was a full description of his quaking apprehension his cap was gone and his hair was riotous his clothes made it appear that he had been dragged over the ground by the heels he ran on the officers head sank down and one elbow crooked his foot in its brassbound stirrup still stretched over the body of his horse and the other leg was under the steed but collins turned he came dashing back his face had now turned grey and in his eyes was all terror here it is here it is the officer was as a man gone in drink his arm bent like a twig his head drooped as if his neck were of willow he was sinking to the ground to lie face downward collins grabbed him by the shoulder here it is heres your drink turn over turn over man for gods sake with collins hauling at his shoulder the officer twisted his body and fell with his face turned toward that region where lived the unspeakable noises of the swirling missiles there was the faintest shadow of a smile on his lips as he looked at collins he gave a sigh a little primitive breath like that from a child collins tried to hold the bucket steadily but his shaking hands caused the water to splash all over the face of the dying man then he jerked it away and ran on the regiment gave him a welcoming roar the grimed faces were wrinkled in laughter his captain waved the bucket away give it to the men the two genial skylarking young lieutenants were the first to gain possession of it they played over it in their fashion when one tried to drink the other teasingly knocked his elbow dont billie youll make me spill it said the one the other laughed suddenly there was an oath the thud of wood on the ground and a swift murmur of astonishment among the ranks the two lieutenants glared at each other the bucket lay on the ground empty an indiana campaign i when the ablebodied citizens of the village formed a company and marched away to the war major tom boldin assumed in a manner the burden of the village cares everybody ran to him when they felt obliged to discuss their affairs the sorrows of the town were dragged before him his little bench at the sunny side of migglesville tavern became a sort of an open court where people came to speak resentfully of their grievances he accepted his position and struggled manfully under the load it behoved him as a man who had seen the sky red over the quaint low cities of mexico and the compact northern bayonets gleaming on the narrow roads one warm summer day the major sat asleep on his little bench there was a lull in the tempest of discussion which usually enveloped him his cane by use of which he could make the most tremendous and impressive gestures reposed beside him his hat lay upon the bench and his old bald head had swung far forward until his nose actually touched the first button of his waistcoat the sparrows wrangled desperately in the road defying perspiration once a team went jangling and creaking past raising a yellow blur of dust before the soft tones of the field and sky in the long grass of the meadow across the road the insects chirped and clacked eternally suddenly a frouzyheaded boy appeared in the roadway his bare feet pattering rapidly he was extremely excited he gave a shrill whoop as he discovered the sleeping major and rushed toward him he created a terrific panic among some chickens who had been scratching intently near the majors feet they clamoured in an insanity of fear and rushed hither and thither seeking a way of escape whereas in reality all ways lay plainly open to them this tumult caused the major to arouse with a sudden little jump of amazement and apprehension he rubbed his eyes and gazed about him meanwhile some clever chicken had discovered a passage to safety and led the flock into the garden where they squawked in sustained alarm panting from his run and choked with terror the little boy stood before the major struggling with a tale that was ever upon the tip of his tongue major now major the old man roused from a delicious slumber glared impatiently at the little boy come come whats th matter with yeh he demanded whats th matter dont stand there shaking speak up lots is th matter the little boy shouted valiantly with a courage born of the importance of his tale my mas chickens uz all stole an now hes over in th woods who is who is over in the woods go ahead now th rebel is what roared the major th rebel cried the little boy with the last of his breath the major pounced from his bench in tempestuous excitement he seized the little boy by the collar and gave him a great jerk where are yeh sure who saw im how long ago where is he now did you see im the little boy frightened at the majors fury began to sob after a moment he managed to stammer he now hes in the woods i saw im he looks ugliern anythin the major released his hold upon the boy and pausing for a time indulged in a glorious dream then he said by thunder well ketch th cuss you wait here he told the boy and dont say a word t anybody do you hear the boy still weeping nodded and the major hurriedly entered the inn he took down from its pegs an awkward smoothbore rifle and carefully examined the enormous percussion cap that was fitted over the nipple mistrusting the cap he removed it and replaced it with a new one he scrutinised the gun keenly as if he could judge in this manner of the condition of the load all his movements were deliberate and deadly when he arrived upon the porch of the tavern he beheld the yard filled with people peter witheby sootyfaced and grinning was in the van he looked at the major well he said well returned the major bridling well whats che got said old peter got got a rebel over in th woods roared the major at this sentence the women and boys who had gathered eagerly about him gave vent to startled cries the women had come from adjacent houses but the little boys represented the entire village they had miraculously heard the first whisper of rumour and they performed wonders in getting to the spot they clustered around the important figure of the major and gazed in silent awe the women however burst forth at the word rebel which represented to them all terrible things they deluged the major with questions which were obviously unanswerable he shook them off with violent impatience meanwhile peter witheby was trying to force exasperating interrogations through the tumult to the majors ears what no yes how d i know the maddened veteran snarled as he struggled with his friends no yes what how in thunder d i know upon the steps of the tavern the landlady sat weeping forlornly at last the major burst through the crowd and went to the roadway there as they all streamed after him he turned and faced them now look a here i dont know any more about this than you do he told them forcibly all that i know is that theres a rebel over in smiths woods an all i know is that im agoin after im but hol on a minnet said old peter how do yeh know hes a rebel i know he is cried the major dont yeh think i know what a rebel is then with a gesture of disdain at the babbling crowd he marched determinedly away his rifle held in the hollow of his arm at this heroic moment a new clamour arose half admiration half dismay old peter hobbled after the major continually repeating hol on a minnet the little boy who had given the alarm was the centre of a throng of lads who gazed with envy and awe discovering in him a new quality he held forth to them eloquently the women stared after the figure of the major and old peter his pursuer jerozel bronson a halfwitted lad who comprehended nothing save an occasional genial word leaned against the fence and grinned like a skull the major and the pursuer passed out of view around the turn in the road where the great maples lazily shook the dust that lay on their leaves for a moment the little group of women listened intently as if they expected to hear a sudden shot and cries from the distance they looked at each other their lips a little way apart the trees sighed softly in the heat of the summer sun the insects in the meadow continued their monotonous humming and somewhere a hen had been stricken with fear and was cackling loudly finally mrs goodwin said well im goin up to th turn a th road anyhow mrs willets and mrs joe peterson her particular friends cried out at this temerity but she said well im goin anyhow she called bronson come on jerozel youre a man an if he should chase us why you mus pitch inteh im hey bronson always obeyed everybody he grinned an assent and went with her down the road a little boy attempted to follow them but a shrill scream from his mother made him halt the remaining women stood motionless their eyes fixed upon mrs goodwin and jerozel then at last one gave a laugh of triumph at her conquest of caution and fear and cried well im goin too another instantly said so am i there began a general movement some of the little boys had already ventured a hundred feet away from the main body and at this unanimous advance they spread out ahead in little groups some recounted terrible stories of rebel ferocity their eyes were large with excitement the whole thing with its possible dangers had for them a delicious element johnnie peterson who could whip any boy present explained what he would do in case the enemy should happen to pounce out at him the familiar scene suddenly assumed a new aspect the field of corn which met the road upon the left was no longer a mere field of corn it was a darkly mystic place whose recesses could contain all manner of dangers the long green leaves waving in the breeze rustled from the passing of men in the song of the insects there were now omens threats there was a warning in the enamel blue of the sky in the stretch of yellow road in the very atmosphere above the tops of the corn loomed the distant foliage of smiths woods curtaining the silent action of a tragedy whose horrors they imagined the women and the little boys came to a halt overwhelmed by the impressiveness of the landscape they waited silently mrs goodwin suddenly said im goin back the others who all wished to return cried at once disdainfully well go back if yeh want to a cricket at the roadside exploded suddenly in his shrill song and a woman who had been standing near shrieked in startled terror an electric movement went through the group of women they jumped and gave vent to sudden screams with the fears still upon their agitated faces they turned to berate the one who had shrieked my what a goose you are sallie why it took my breath away goodness sakes dont holler like that again ii hol on a minnet peter witheby was crying to the major as the latter full of the importance and dignity of his position as protector of migglesville paced forward swiftly the veteran already felt upon his brow a wreath formed of the flowers of gratitude and as he strode he was absorbed in planning a calm and selfcontained manner of wearing it hol on a minnet piped old peter in the rear at last the major aroused from his dream of triumph turned about wrathfully well what now look a here said peter what che goin t do the major with a gesture of supreme exasperation wheeled again and went on when he arrived at the cornfield he halted and waited for peter he had suddenly felt that indefinable menace in the landscape well demanded peter panting the majors eyes wavered a trifle well he repeated well im goin in there an bring out that there rebel they both paused and studied the gently swaying masses of corn and behind them the looming woods sinister with possible secrets well said old peter the major moved uneasily and put his hand to his brow peter waited in obvious expectation the major crossed through the grass at the roadside and climbed the fence he put both legs over the topmost rail and then sat perched there facing the woods once he turned his head and asked what i haint said anythin answered peter the major clambered down from the fence and went slowly into the corn his gun held in readiness peter stood in the road presently the major returned and said in a cautious whisper if yeh hear anythin you come arunnin will yeh well i haint got no gun nor nuthin said peter in the same low tone what good ud i do well yeh might come along with me an watch said the major four eyes is bettern two if i had a gun began peter oh yeh dont need no gun interrupted the major waving his hand all im afraid of is that i wont find im my eyes aint so good as they was well come along whispered the major yeh haint afraid are yeh no but well come along then whats th matter with yeh peter climbed the fence he paused on the top rail and took a prolonged stare at the inscrutable woods when he joined the major in the cornfield he said with a touch of anger well you got the gun remember that if he comes for me i haint got a blame thing shucks answered the major he aint agoin t come for yeh the two then began a wary journey through the corn one by one the long aisles between the rows appeared as they glanced along each of them it seemed as if some gruesome thing had just previously vacated it old peter halted once and whispered say look a here supposin supposin supposin what demanded the major supposin said peter well remember you got th gun an i haint got anythin thunder said the major when they got to where the stalks were very short because of the shade cast by the trees of the wood they halted again the leaves were gently swishing in the breeze before them stretched the mystic green wall of the forest and there seemed to be in it eyes which followed each of their movements peter at last said i dont believe theres anybody in there yes there is too said the major ill bet anythin hes in there how d yeh know asked peter ill bet he aint within a mile o here the major suddenly ejaculated listen they bent forward scarce breathing their mouths agape their eyes glinting finally the major turned his head did yeh hear that he said hoarsely no said peter in a low voice what was it the major listened for a moment then he turned again i thought i heerd somebody holler he explained cautiously they both bent forward and listened once more peter in the intentness of his attitude lost his balance and was obliged to lift his foot hastily and with noise sssh hissed the major after a minute peter spoke quite loudly oh shucks i dont believe yeh heerd anythin the major made a frantic downward gesture with his hand shet up will yeh he said in an angry undertone peter became silent for a moment but presently he said again oh yeh didnt hear anythin the major turned to glare at his companion in despair and wrath whats th matter with yeh cant yeh shet up oh this here aint no use if youre goin in after im why dont yeh go in after im well gimme time cant yeh said the major in a growl and as if to add more to this reproach he climbed the fence that compassed the woods looking resentfully back at his companion well said peter when the major paused the major stepped down upon the thick carpet of brown leaves that stretched under the trees he turned then to whisper you wait here will yeh his face was red with determination well hol on a minnet said peter you i wed better no said the major you wait here he went stealthily into the thickets peter watched him until he grew to be a vague slowmoving shadow from time to time he could hear the leaves crackle and twigs snap under the majors awkward tread peter intent breathless waited for the peal of sudden tragedy finally the woods grew silent in a solemn and impressive hush that caused peter to feel the thumping of his heart he began to look about him to make sure that nothing should spring upon him from the sombre shadows he scrutinised this cool gloom before him and at times he thought he could perceive the moving of swift silent shapes he concluded that he had better go back and try to muster some assistance to the major as peter came through the corn the women in the road caught sight of the glittering figure and screamed many of them began to run the little boys with all their valour scurried away in clouds mrs joe peterson however cast a glance over her shoulders as she with her skirts gathered up was running as best she could she instantly stopped and in tones of deepest scorn called out to the others why its ony pete witheby they came faltering back then those who had been naturally swiftest in the race avoiding the eyes of those whose limbs had enabled them to flee a short distance peter came rapidly appreciating the glances of vivid interest in the eyes of the women to their lightninglike questions which hit all sides of the episode he opposed a new tranquillity gained from his sudden ascent in importance he made no answer to their clamour when he had reached the top of the fence he called out commandingly here you johnnie you and george run an git my gun its hangin on th pegs over th bench in th shop at this terrible sentence a shuddering cry broke from the women the boys named sped down the road accompanied by a retinue of envious companions peter swung his legs over the rail and faced the woods again he twisted his head once to say keep still cant yeh quit scufflin aroun they could see by his manner that this was a supreme moment the group became motionless and still later peter turned to say sssh to a restless boy and the air with which he said it smote them all with awe the little boys who had gone after the gun came pattering along hurriedly the weapon borne in the midst of them each was anxious to share in the honour the one who had been delegated to bring it was bullying and directing his comrades peter said sssh he took the gun and poised it in readiness to sweep the cornfield he scowled at the boys and whispered angrily why didnt yeh bring th powderhorn an th thing with th bullets in i told yeh t bring em ill send somebody else next time yeh didnt tell us cried the two boys shrilly sssh quit yeh noise said peter with a violent gesture however this reproof enabled other boys to recover that peace of mind which they had lost when seeing their friends loaded with honours the women had cautiously approached the fence and from time to time whispered feverish questions but peter repulsed them savagely with an air of being infinitely bothered by their interference in his intent watch they were forced to listen again in silence to the weird and prophetic chanting of the insects and the mystic silken rustling of the corn at last the thud of hurrying feet in the soft soil of the field came to their ears a dark form sped toward them a wave of a mighty fear swept over the group and the screams of the women came hoarsely from their choked throats peter swung madly from his perch and turned to use the fence as a rampart but it was the major his face was inflamed and his eyes were glaring he clutched his rifle by the middle and swung it wildly he was bounding at a great speed for his fat short body its all right its all right he began to yell some distance away its all right its ony ol milt jacoby when he arrived at the top of the fence he paused and mopped his brow what they thundered in an agony of sudden unreasoning disappointment mrs joe peterson who was a distant connection of milton jacoby thought to forestall any damage to her social position by saying at once disdainfully drunk i spose yep said the major still on the fence and mopping his brow drunk as a fool thunder i was surprised i i thought it was a rebel sure the thoughts of all these women wavered for a time they were at a loss for precise expression of their emotion at last however they hurled this superior sentence at the major well yeh might have known a grey sleeve i it looks as if it might rain this afternoon remarked the lieutenant of artillery so it does the infantry captain assented he glanced casually at the sky when his eyes had lowered to the greenshadowed landscape before him he said fretfully i wish those fellows out yonder would quit pelting at us theyve been at it since noon at the edge of a grove of maples across wide fields there occasionally appeared little puffs of smoke of a dull hue in this gloom of sky which expressed an impending rain the long wave of blue and steel in the field moved uneasily at the eternal barking of the faraway sharpshooters and the men leaning upon their rifles stared at the grove of maples once a private turned to borrow some tobacco from a comrade in the rear rank but with his hand still stretched out he continued to twist his head and glance at the distant trees he was afraid the enemy would shoot him at a time when he was not looking suddenly the artillery officer said see whats coming along the rear of the brigade of infantry a column of cavalry was sweeping at a hard gallop a lieutenant riding some yards to the right of the column bawled furiously at the four troopers just at the rear of the colours they had lost distance and made a little gap but at the shouts of the lieutenant they urged their horses forward the bugler careering along behind the captain of the troop fought and tugged like a wrestler to keep his frantic animal from bolting far ahead of the column on the springy turf the innumerable hoofs thundered in a swift storm of sound in the brown faces of the troopers their eyes were set like bits of flashing steel the long line of the infantry regiments standing at ease underwent a sudden movement at the rush of the passing squadron the foot soldiers turned their heads to gaze at the torrent of horses and men the yellow folds of the flag fluttered back in silken shuddering waves as if it were a reluctant thing occasionally a giant spring of a charger would rear the firm and sturdy figure of a soldier suddenly head and shoulders above his comrades over the noise of the scudding hoofs could be heard the creaking of leather trappings the jingle and clank of steel and the tense lowtoned commands or appeals of the men to their horses and the horses were mad with the headlong sweep of this movement powerful under jaws bent back and straightened so that the bits were clamped as rigidly as vices upon the teeth and glistening necks arched in desperate resistance to the hands at the bridles swinging their heads in rage at the granite laws of their lives which compelled even their angers and their ardours to chosen directions and chosen faces their flight was as a flight of harnessed demons the captains bay kept its pace at the head of the squadron with the lithe bounds of a thoroughbred and this horse was proud as a chief at the roaring trample of his fellows behind him the captains glance was calmly upon the grove of maples whence the sharpshooters of the enemy had been picking at the blue line he seemed to be reflecting he stolidly rose and fell with the plunges of his horse in all the indifference of a deacons figure seated plumply in church and it occurred to many of the watching infantry to wonder why this officer could remain imperturbable and reflective when his squadron was thundering and swarming behind him like the rushing of a flood the column swung in a sabrecurve toward a break in a fence and dashed into a roadway once a little plank bridge was encountered and the sound of the hoofs upon it was like the long roll of many drums an old captain in the infantry turned to his first lieutenant and made a remark which was a compound of bitter disparagement of cavalry in general and soldierly admiration of this particular troop suddenly the bugle sounded and the column halted with a jolting upheaval amid sharp brief cries a moment later the men had tumbled from their horses and carbines in hand were running in a swarm toward the grove of maples in the road one of every four of the troopers was standing with braced legs and pulling and hauling at the bridles of four frenzied horses the captain was running awkwardly in his boots he held his sabre low so that the point often threatened to catch in the turf his yellow hair ruffled out from under his faded cap go in hard now he roared in a voice of hoarse fury his face was violently red the troopers threw themselves upon the grove like wolves upon a great animal along the whole front of woods there was the dry crackling of musketry with bitter swift flashes and smoke that writhed like stung phantoms the troopers yelled shrilly and spanged bullets low into the foliage for a moment when near the woods the line almost halted the men struggled and fought for a time like swimmers encountering a powerful current then with a supreme effort they went on again they dashed madly at the grove whose foliage from the high light of the field was as inscrutable as a wall then suddenly each detail of the calm trees became apparent and with a few more frantic leaps the men were in the cool gloom of the woods there was a heavy odour as from burned paper wisps of grey smoke wound upward the men halted and grimy perspiring and puffing they searched the recesses of the woods with eager fierce glances figures could be seen flitting afar off a dozen carbines rattled at them in an angry volley during this pause the captain strode along the line his face lit with a broad smile of contentment when he sends this crowd to do anything i guess hell find we do it pretty sharp he said to the grinning lieutenant say they didnt stand that rush a minute did they said the subaltern both officers were profoundly dusty in their uniforms and their faces were soiled like those of two urchins out in the grass behind them were three tumbled and silent forms presently the line moved forward again the men went from tree to tree like hunters stalking game some at the left of the line fired occasionally and those at the right gazed curiously in that direction the men still breathed heavily from their scramble across the field of a sudden a trooper halted and said hello theres a house every one paused the men turned to look at their leader the captain stretched his neck and swung his head from side to side by george it is a house he said through the wealth of leaves there vaguely loomed the form of a large white house these troopers brownfaced from many days of campaigning each feature of them telling of their placid confidence and courage were stopped abruptly by the appearance of this house there was some subtle suggestion some tale of an unknown thing which watched them from they knew not what part of it a rail fence girded a wide lawn of tangled grass seven pines stood along a driveway which led from two distant posts of a vanished gate the blueclothed troopers moved forward until they stood at the fence peering over it the captain put one hand on the top rail and seemed to be about to climb the fence when suddenly he hesitated and said in a low voice watson what do you think of it the lieutenant stared at the house derned if i know he replied the captain pondered it happened that the whole company had turned a gaze of profound awe and doubt upon this edifice which confronted them the men were very silent at last the captain swore and said we are certainly a pack of fools derned old deserted house halting a company of union cavalry and making us gape like babies yes but theres something something insisted the subaltern in a half stammer well if theres something something in there ill get it out said the captain send sharpe clean around to the other side with about twelve men so we will sure bag your something something and ill take a few of the boys and find out whats in the dd old thing he chose the nearest eight men for his storming party as the lieutenant called it after he had waited some minutes for the others to get into position he said come ahead to his eight men and climbed the fence the brighter light of the tangled lawn made him suddenly feel tremendously apparent and he wondered if there could be some mystic thing in the house which was regarding this approach his men trudged silently at his back they stared at the windows and lost themselves in deep speculations as to the probability of there being perhaps eyes behind the blinds malignant eyes piercing eyes suddenly a corporal in the party gave vent to a startled exclamation and half threw his carbine into position the captain turned quickly and the corporal said i saw an arm move the blinds an arm with a grey sleeve dont be a fool jones now said the captain sharply i swear t began the corporal but the captain silenced him when they arrived at the front of the house the troopers paused while the captain went softly up the front steps he stood before the large front door and studied it some crickets chirped in the long grass and the nearest pine could be heard in its endless sighs one of the privates moved uneasily and his foot crunched the gravel suddenly the captain swore angrily and kicked the door with a loud crash it flew open ii the bright lights of the day flashed into the old house when the captain angrily kicked open the door he was aware of a wide hallway carpeted with matting and extending deep into the dwelling there was also an old walnut hatrack and a little marbletopped table with a vase and two books upon it farther back was a great venerable fireplace containing dreary ashes but directly in front of the captain was a young girl the flying open of the door had obviously been an utter astonishment to her and she remained transfixed there in the middle of the floor staring at the captain with wide eyes she was like a child caught at the time of a raid upon the cake she wavered to and fro upon her feet and held her hands behind her there were two little points of terror in her eyes as she gazed up at the young captain in dusty blue with his reddish bronze complexion his yellow hair his bright sabre held threateningly these two remained motionless and silent simply staring at each other for some moments the captain felt his rage fade out of him and leave his mind limp he had been violently angry because this house had made him feel hesitant wary he did not like to be wary he liked to feel confident sure so he had kicked the door open and had been prepared to march in like a soldier of wrath but now he began for one thing to wonder if his uniform was so dusty and old in appearance moreover he had a feeling that his face was covered with a compound of dust grime and perspiration he took a step forward and said i didnt mean to frighten you but his voice was coarse from his battlehowling it seemed to him to have hempen fibres in it the girls breath came in little quick gasps and she looked at him as she would have looked at a serpent i didnt mean to frighten you he said again the girl still with her hands behind her began to back away is there any one else in the house he went on while slowly following her i dont wish to disturb you but we had a fight with some rebel skirmishers in the woods and i thought maybe some of them might have come in here in fact i was pretty sure of it are there any of them here the girl looked at him and said no he wondered why extreme agitation made the eyes of some women so limpid and bright who is here besides yourself by this time his pursuit had driven her to the end of the hall and she remained there with her back to the wall and her hands still behind her when she answered this question she did not look at him but down at the floor she cleared her voice and then said there is no one here no one she lifted her eyes to him in that appeal that the human being must make even to falling trees crashing boulders the sea in a storm and said no no there is no one here he could plainly see her tremble of a sudden he bethought him that she continually kept her hands behind her as he recalled her air when first discovered he remembered she appeared precisely as a child detected at one of the crimes of childhood moreover she had always backed away from him he thought now that she was concealing something which was an evidence of the presence of the enemy in the house what are you holding behind you he said suddenly she gave a little quick moan as if some grim hand had throttled her what are you holding behind you oh nothing please i am not holding anything behind me indeed im not very well hold your hands out in front of you then oh indeed im not holding anything behind me indeed im not well he began then he paused and remained for a moment dubious finally he laughed well i shall have my men search the house anyhow im sorry to trouble you but i feel sure that there is some one here whom we want he turned to the corporal who with the other men was gaping quietly in at the door and said jones go through the house as for himself he remained planted in front of the girl for she evidently did not dare to move and allow him to see what she held so carefully behind her back so she was his prisoner the men rummaged around on the ground floor of the house sometimes the captain called to them try that closet is there any cellar but they found no one and at last they went trooping toward the stairs which led to the second floor but at this movement on the part of the men the girl uttered a cry a cry of such fright and appeal that the men paused oh dont go up there please dont go up there pleease there is no one there indeed indeed there is not oh pleease go on jones said the captain calmly the obedient corporal made a preliminary step and the girl bounded toward the stairs with another cry as she passed him the captain caught sight of that which she had concealed behind her back and which she had forgotten in this supreme moment it was a pistol she ran to the first step and standing there faced the men one hand extended with perpendicular palm and the other holding the pistol at her side oh please dont go up there nobody is there indeed there is not please then suddenly she sank swiftly down upon the step and huddling forlornly began to weep in the agony and with the convulsive tremors of an infant the pistol fell from her fingers and rattled down to the floor the astonished troopers looked at their astonished captain there was a short silence finally the captain stooped and picked up the pistol it was a heavy weapon of the army pattern he ascertained that it was empty he leaned toward the shaking girl and said gently will you tell me what you were going to do with this pistol he had to repeat the question a number of times but at last a muffled voice said nothing nothing he insisted quietly upon a further answer at the tender tones of the captains voice the phlegmatic corporal turned and winked gravely at the man next to him wont you tell me the girl shook her head please tell me the silent privates were moving their feet uneasily and wondering how long they were to wait the captain said please wont you tell me then this girls voice began in stricken tones half coherent and amid violent sobbing it was grandpas he he he said he was going to shoot anybody who came in here he didnt care if there were thousands of em and and i know he would and i was afraid theyd kill him and so and so i stole away his pistol and i was going to hide it when you you you kicked open the door the men straightened up and looked at each other the girl began to weep again the captain mopped his brow he peered down at the girl he mopped his brow again suddenly he said ah dont cry like that he moved restlessly and looked down at his boots he mopped his brow again then he gripped the corporal by the arm and dragged him some yards back from the others jones he said in an intensely earnest voice will you tell me what in the devil i am going to do the corporals countenance became illuminated with satisfaction at being thus requested to advise his superior officer he adopted an air of great thought and finally said well of course the feller with the grey sleeve must be upstairs and we must get past the girl and up there somehow suppose i take her by the arm and lead her what interrupted the captain from between his clinched teeth as he turned away from the corporal he said fiercely over his shoulder you touch that girl and ill split your skull iii the corporal looked after his captain with an expression of mingled amazement grief and philosophy he seemed to be saying to himself that there unfortunately were times after all when one could not rely upon the most reliable of men when he returned to the group he found the captain bending over the girl and saying why is it that you dont want us to search upstairs the girls head was buried in her crossed arms locks of her hair had escaped from their fastenings and these fell upon her shoulder wont you tell me the corporal here winked again at the man next to him because the girl moaned because there isnt anybody up there the captain at last said timidly well im afraid im afraid well have to the girl sprang to her feet again and implored him with her hands she looked deep into his eyes with her glance which was at this time like that of the fawn when it says to the hunter have mercy upon me these two stood regarding each other the captains foot was on the bottom step but he seemed to be shrinking he wore an air of being deeply wretched and ashamed there was a silence suddenly the corporal said in a quick low tone look out captain all turned their eyes swiftly toward the head of the stairs there had appeared there a youth in a grey uniform he stood looking coolly down at them no word was said by the troopers the girl gave vent to a little wail of desolation o harry he began slowly to descend the stairs his right arm was in a white sling and there were some fresh bloodstains upon the cloth his face was rigid and deathly pale but his eyes flashed like lights the girl was again moaning in an utterly dreary fashion as the youth came slowly down toward the silent men in blue six steps from the bottom of the flight he halted and said i reckon its me youre looking for the troopers had crowded forward a trifle and posed in lithe nervous attitudes were watching him like cats the captain remained unmoved at the youths question he merely nodded his head and said yes the young man in grey looked down at the girl and then in the same even tone which now however seemed to vibrate with suppressed fury he said and is that any reason why you should insult my sister at this sentence the girl intervened desperately between the young man in grey and the officer in blue oh dont harry dont he was good to me he was good to me harry indeed he was the youth came on in his quiet erect fashion until the girl could have touched either of the men with her hand for the captain still remained with his foot upon the first step she continually repeated o harry o harry the youth in grey manoeuvred to glare into the captains face first over one shoulder of the girl and then over the other in a voice that rang like metal he said you are armed and unwounded while i have no weapons and am wounded but the captain had stepped back and sheathed his sabre the eyes of these two men were gleaming fire but otherwise the captains countenance was imperturbable he said you are mistaken you have no reason to you lie all save the captain and the youth in grey started in an electric movement these two words crackled in the air like shattered glass there was a breathless silence the captain cleared his throat his look at the youth contained a quality of singular and terrible ferocity but he said in his stolid tone i dont suppose you mean what you say now upon his arm he had felt the pressure of some unconscious little fingers the girl was leaning against the wall as if she no longer knew how to keep her balance but those fingers he held his arm very still she murmured o harry dont he was good to me indeed he was the corporal had come forward until he in a measure confronted the youth in grey for he saw those fingers upon the captains arm and he knew that sometimes very strong men were not able to move hand nor foot under such conditions the youth had suddenly seemed to become weak he breathed heavily and clung to the rail he was glaring at the captain and apparently summoning all his will power to combat his weakness the corporal addressed him with profound straightforwardness dont you be a derned fool the youth turned toward him so fiercely that the corporal threw up a knee and an elbow like a boy who expects to be cuffed the girl pleaded with the captain you wont hurt him will you he dont know what hes saying hes wounded you know please dont mind him i wont touch him said the captain with rather extraordinary earnestness dont you worry about him at all i wont touch him then he looked at her and the girl suddenly withdrew her fingers from his arm the corporal contemplated the top of the stairs and remarked without surprise theres another of em coming an old man was clambering down the stairs with much speed he waved a cane wildly get out of my house you thieves get out i wont have you cross my threshold get out he mumbled and wagged his head in an old mans fury it was plainly his intention to assault them and so it occurred that a young girl became engaged in protecting a stalwart captain fully armed and with eight grim troopers at his back from the attack of an old man with a walkingstick a blush passed over the temples and brow of the captain and he looked particularly savage and weary despite the girls efforts he suddenly faced the old man look here he said distinctly we came in because we had been fighting in the woods yonder and we concluded that some of the enemy were in this house especially when we saw a grey sleeve at the window but this young man is wounded and i have nothing to say to him i will even take it for granted that there are no others like him upstairs we will go away leaving your d d old house just as we found it and we are no more thieves and rascals than you are the old man simply roared i havent got a cow nor a pig nor a chicken on the place your soldiers have stolen everything they could carry away they have torn down half my fences for firewood this afternoon some of your accursed bullets even broke my window panes the girl had been faltering grandpa o grandpa the captain looked at the girl she returned his glance from the shadow of the old mans shoulder after studying her face a moment he said well we will go now he strode toward the door and his men clanked docilely after him at this time there was the sound of harsh cries and rushing footsteps from without the door flew open and a whirlwind composed of bluecoated troopers came in with a swoop it was headed by the lieutenant oh here you are he cried catching his breath we thoughtoh look at the girl the captain said intensely shut up you fool the men settled to a halt with a clash and a bang there could be heard the dulled sound of many hoofs outside of the house did you order up the horses inquired the captain yes we thought well then lets get out of here interrupted the captain morosely the men began to filter out into the open air the youth in grey had been hanging dismally to the railing of the stairway he now was climbing slowly up to the second floor the old man was addressing himself directly to the serene corporal not a chicken on the place he cried well i didnt take your chickens did i no maybe you didnt but the captain crossed the hall and stood before the girl in rather a culprits fashion you are not angry at me are you he asked timidly no she said she hesitated a moment and then suddenly held out her hand you were good to me and im much obliged the captain took her hand and then he blushed for he found himself unable to formulate a sentence that applied in any way to the situation she did not seem to heed that hand for a time he loosened his grasp presently for he was ashamed to hold it so long without saying anything clever at last with an air of charging an intrenched brigade he contrived to say i would rather do anything than frighten or trouble you his brow was warmly perspiring he had a sense of being hideous in his dusty uniform and with his grimy face she said oh im so glad it was you instead of somebody who might have might have hurt brother harry and grandpa he told her i wouldnt have hurt em for anything there was a little silence well goodbye he said at last goodbye he walked toward the door past the old man who was scolding at the vanishing figure of the corporal the captain looked back she had remained there watching him at the bugles order the troopers standing beside their horses swung briskly into the saddle the lieutenant said to the first sergeant williams did they ever meet before hanged if i know well say the captain saw a curtain move at one of the windows he cantered from his position at the head of the column and steered his horse between two flowerbeds well goodbye the squadron trampled slowly past goodbye they shook hands he evidently had something enormously important to say to her but it seems that he could not manage it he struggled heroically the bay charger with his great mystically solemn eyes looked around the corner of his shoulder at the girl the captain studied a pine tree the girl inspected the grass beneath the window the captain said hoarsely i dont suppose i dont suppose ill ever see you again she looked at him affrightedly and shrank back from the window he seemed to have woefully expected a reception of this kind for his question he gave her instantly a glance of appeal she said why no i dont suppose you will never why no taint possible you you are a yankee oh i know it but eventually he continued well some day you know when theres no more fighting we might he observed that she had again withdrawn suddenly into the shadow so he said well goodbye when he held her fingers she bowed her head and he saw a pink blush steal over the curves of her cheek and neck am i never going to see you again she made no reply never he repeated after a long time he bent over to hear a faint reply sometimes when there are no troops in the neighbourhood grandpa dont mind if i walk over as far as that old oak tree yonder in the afternoons it appeared that the captains grip was very strong for she uttered an exclamation and looked at her fingers as if she expected to find them mere fragments he rode away the bay horse leaped a flowerbed they were almost to the drive when the girl uttered a panicstricken cry the captain wheeled his horse violently and upon his return journey went straight through a flowerbed the girl had clasped her hands she beseeched him wildly with her eyes oh please dont believe it i never walk to the old oak tree indeed i dont i never never never walk there the bridle drooped on the bay chargers neck the captains figure seemed limp with an expression of profound dejection and gloom he stared off at where the leaden sky met the dark green line of the woods the longimpending rain began to fall with a mournful patter drop and drop there was a silence at last a low voice said well i might sometimes i might perhaps but only once in a great while i might walk to the old tree in the afternoons the veteran out of the low window could be seen three hickory trees placed irregularly in a meadow that was resplendent in springtime green farther away the old dismal belfry of the village church loomed over the pines a horse meditating in the shade of one of the hickories lazily swished his tail the warm sunshine made an oblong of vivid yellow on the floor of the grocery could you see the whites of their eyes said the man who was seated on a soap box nothing of the kind replied old henry warmly just a lot of flitting figures and i let go at where they peared to be the thickest bang mr fleming said the grocer his deferential voice expressed somehow the old mans exact social weight mr fleming you never was frightened much in them battles was you the veteran looked down and grinned observing his manner the entire group tittered well i guess i was he answered finally pretty well scared sometimes why in my first battle i thought the sky was falling down i thought the world was coming to an end you bet i was scared every one laughed perhaps it seemed strange and rather wonderful to them that a man should admit the thing and in the tone of their laughter there was probably more admiration than if old fleming had declared that he had always been a lion moreover they knew that he had ranked as an orderly sergeant and so their opinion of his heroism was fixed none to be sure knew how an orderly sergeant ranked but then it was understood to be somewhere just shy of a majorgenerals stars so when old henry admitted that he had been frightened there was a laugh the trouble was said the old man i thought they were all shooting at me yes sir i thought every man in the other army was aiming at me in particular and only me and it seemed so darned unreasonable you know i wanted to explain to em what an almighty good fellow i was because i thought then they might quit all trying to hit me but i couldnt explain and they kept on being unreasonable blim blam bang so i run two little triangles of wrinkles appeared at the corners of his eyes evidently he appreciated some comedy in this recital down near his feet however little jim his grandson was visibly horrorstricken his hands were clasped nervously and his eyes were wide with astonishment at this terrible scandal his most magnificent grandfather telling such a thing that was at chancellorsville of course afterward i got kind of used to it a man does lots of men though seem to feel all right from the start i did as soon as i got on to it as they say now but at first i was pretty well flustered now there was young jim conklin old si conklins son that used to keep the tannery you none of you recollect him well he went into it from the start just as if he was born to it but with me it was different i had to get used to it when little jim walked with his grandfather he was in the habit of skipping along on the stone pavement in front of the three stores and the hotel of the town and betting that he could avoid the cracks but upon this day he walked soberly with his hand gripping two of his grandfathers fingers sometimes he kicked abstractedly at dandelions that curved over the walk any one could see that he was much troubled theres sickless colt over in the medder jimmie said the old man dont you wish you owned one like him um said the boy with a strange lack of interest he continued his reflections then finally he ventured grandpa now was that true what you was telling those men what asked the grandfather what was i telling them oh about your running why yes that was true enough jimmie it was my first fight and there was an awful lot of noise you know jimmie seemed dazed that this idol of its own will should so totter his stout boyish idealism was injured presently the grandfather said sickless colt is going for a drink dont you wish you owned sickless colt jimmie the boy merely answered he aint as nice as ourn he lapsed then into another moody silence one of the hired men a swede desired to drive to the county seat for purposes of his own the old man loaned a horse and an unwashed buggy it appeared later that one of the purposes of the swede was to get drunk after quelling some boisterous frolic of the farm hands and boys in the garret the old man had that night gone peacefully to sleep when he was aroused by clamouring at the kitchen door he grabbed his trousers and they waved out behind as he dashed forward he could hear the voice of the swede screaming and blubbering he pushed the wooden button and as the door flew open the swede a maniac stumbled inward chattering weeping still screaming de barn fire fire fire de barn fire fire fire fire there was a swift and indescribable change in the old man his face ceased instantly to be a face it became a mask a grey thing with horror written about the mouth and eyes he hoarsely shouted at the foot of the little rickety stairs and immediately it seemed there came down an avalanche of men no one knew that during this time the old lady had been standing in her nightclothes at the bedroom door yelling whats th matter whats th matter whats th matter when they dashed toward the barn it presented to their eyes its usual appearance solemn rather mystic in the black night the swedes lantern was overturned at a point some yards in front of the barn doors it contained a wild little conflagration of its own and even in their excitement some of those who ran felt a gentle secondary vibration of the thrifty part of their minds at sight of this overturned lantern under ordinary circumstances it would have been a calamity but the cattle in the barn were trampling trampling trampling and above this noise could be heard a humming like the song of innumerable bees the old man hurled aside the great doors and a yellow flame leaped out at one corner and sped and wavered frantically up the old grey wall it was glad terrible this single flame like the wild banner of deadly and triumphant foes the motley crowd from the garret had come with all the pails of the farm they flung themselves upon the well it was a leisurely old machine long dwelling in indolence it was in the habit of giving out water with a sort of reluctance the men stormed at it cursed it but it continued to allow the buckets to be filled only after the wheezy windlass had howled many protests at the madhanded men with his opened knife in his hand old fleming himself had gone headlong into the barn where the stifling smoke swirled with the air currents and where could be heard in its fulness the terrible chorus of the flames laden with tones of hate and death a hymn of wonderful ferocity he flung a blanket over an old mares head cut the halter close to the manger led the mare to the door and fairly kicked her out to safety he returned with the same blanket and rescued one of the work horses he took five horses out and then came out himself with his clothes bravely on fire he had no whiskers and very little hair on his head they soused five pailfuls of water on him his eldest son made a clean miss with the sixth pailful because the old man had turned and was running down the decline and around to the basement of the barn where were the stanchions of the cows some one noticed at the time that he ran very lamely as if one of the frenzied horses had smashed his hip the cows with their heads held in the heavy stanchions had thrown themselves strangled themselves tangled themselves done everything which the ingenuity of their exuberant fear could suggest to them here as at the well the same thing happened to every man save one their hands went mad they became incapable of everything save the power to rush into dangerous situations the old man released the cow nearest the door and she blind drunk with terror crashed into the swede the swede had been running to and fro babbling he carried an empty milkpail to which he clung with an unconscious fierce enthusiasm he shrieked like one lost as he went under the cows hoofs and the milkpail rolling across the floor made a flash of silver in the gloom old fleming took a fork beat off the cow and dragged the paralysed swede to the open air when they had rescued all the cows save one which had so fastened herself that she could not be moved an inch they returned to the front of the barn and stood sadly breathing like men who had reached the final point of human effort many people had come running some one had even gone to the church and now from the distance rang the tocsin note of the old bell there was a long flare of crimson on the sky which made remote people speculate as to the whereabouts of the fire the long flames sang their drumming chorus in voices of the heaviest bass the wind whirled clouds of smoke and cinders into the faces of the spectators the form of the old barn was outlined in black amid these masses of orangehued flames and then came this swede again crying as one who is the weapon of the sinister fates de colts de colts you have forgot de colts old fleming staggered it was true they had forgotten the two colts in the boxstalls at the back of the barn boys he said i must try to get em out they clamoured about him then afraid for him afraid of what they should see then they talked wildly each to each why its sure death he would never get out why its suicide for a man to go in there old fleming stared absentmindedly at the open doors the poor little things he said he rushed into the barn when the roof fell in a great funnel of smoke swarmed toward the sky as if the old mans mighty spirit released from its body a little bottle had swelled like the genie of fable the smoke was tinted rosehue from the flames and perhaps the unutterable midnights of the universe will have no power to daunt the colour of this soul
