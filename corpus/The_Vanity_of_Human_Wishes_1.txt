the vanity of human wishes and two rambler papers introduction the pieces reproduced in this little volume are now beginning to bid for notice from their third century of readers at the time they were written although johnson had already done enough miscellaneous literary work to fill several substantial volumes his name far from identifying an age was virtually unknown to the general public the vanity of human wishes was the first of his writings to bear his name on its face there were some who knew him to be the author of the vigorous satire london and of the still more remarkable biographical study an account of the life of mr richard savage and a few interested persons were aware that he was engaged in compiling an english dictionary and intended to edit shakespeare he was also at the moment attracting brief but not overfavorable attention as the author of one of the seasons new crop of tragedies at drury lane but the vanity of human wishes and the rambler were a potent force in establishing johnsons claim to a permanent place in english letters the vanity appeared early in january the rambler ran from march to march with the exception of five numbers and two quoted letters the periodical was written entirely by johnson as moral essays the ramblers deeply stirred some readers and bored others young boswell not unduly saturnine in temperament was profoundly impressed by them and determined on their account to seek out the author taine a century later discovered that he already knew by heart all they had to teach and warned his readers away from them generally speaking they were valued as they deserved by the eighteenth century and undervalued by the nineteenth the first half of the twentieth has shown a marked impulse to restore them as a series to a place of honor second only to the work of addison and steele in the same form raleigh in paid discriminating tribute to their humanity if read he observed against a knowledge of their authors life the pages of the rambler are aglow with the earnestness of dearbought conviction and rich in conclusions gathered not from books but from life and suffering and later we come to closer quarters with johnson in the best pages of the rambler than in the most brilliant of the conversations recalled by boswell the hero of a hundred fights puts off his armour and becomes a wise and tender confessor latterly the style of johnsons essays has been subjected to a closer scrutiny than ever before what taine found as inflexible and inert as a puddingmold is now seen to be charged with life and movement vibrant with light and shadow and color more particularly wimsatt has shown how intimately connected is the vocabulary of the rambler with johnsons reading for the dictionary and how having mastered the words of the experimental scientists of the previous century johnson proceeded to put them to original uses generating with them new stylistic overtones in contexts now humorously precise now philosophically metaphorical employing them now for purposes of irony and satire and again for striking directly home to the roots of morality and religion in a playful mood he is never more characteristic than when he is his own mimic propounding with mock seriousness some preposterous theory like that of the intellectual advantages of living in a garret i have discovered that the tenuity of a defecated air at a proper distance from the surface of the earth accelerates the fancy and sets at liberty those intellectual powers which were before shackled by too strong attraction and unable to expand themselves under the pressure of a gross atmosphere i have found dullness to quicken into sentiment in a thin ether as water though not very hot boils in a receiver partly exhausted and heads in appearance empty have teemed with notions upon rising ground as the flaccid sides of a football would have swelled out into stiffness and extension this is one side of his genius but another and profounder appears in the eloquent simplicity of such a passage as the following against our fears of lessening ourselves in the eyes of others the most useful medicines are often unpleasing to the taste those who are oppressed by their own reputation will perhaps not be comforted by hearing that their cares are unnecessary but the truth is that no man is much regarded by the rest of the world he that considers how little he dwells upon the condition of others will learn how little the attention of others is attracted to himself while we see multitudes passing before us of whom perhaps not one appears to deserve our notice or excite our sympathy we should remember that we likewise are lost in the same throng that the eye which happens to glance upon us is turned in a moment on him that follows us and that the utmost which we can reasonably hope or fear is to fill a vacant hour with prattle and be forgotten when we approach johnsons poetry the revolution of taste becomes a more acute consideration it seems very nearly impossible to compare or contrast eighteenthcentury poetry and that of the twentieth without wilfully tipping the scales in one direction or the other judgment in this area being so much influenced by preference but let us begin with titles for a start let us take from a recent pulitzer prizewinner the days no rounder than its angles are and dont look now but mary is everybody from another distinguished current volume these the trance lost meeting from another after this sea lineman calling meaning motion and from a fourth terror picnic remembered eidolon and monologue at midnight here are individual assertions suggestive of individual ways of looking at things here are headings that signalize particular events in the authors experience moments monuments beside them johnsons title the vanity of human wishes looks very dogged and downright titles are not poems but they have a barometric function the modern titles cited above are evocative of a world with which for the past century and a half we have been growing increasingly familiar this air we are accustomed to breathe it requires no unusual effort of adjustment from us we readily understand that we are being invited to participate in a private experience and by sharing it to help in giving it as much universality as may be it is by no means easy for readers of today to reverse the process to start with the general and find in it their personal account we are more likely to feel a resentment or at least a prejudice against the writer who solicits our attention to a topic without even the pretense of novelty johnsons generation would have found it equally hard to see the matter from our point of view or to allow that the authors of the poems named above were being less than impudent or at best flippant in thus brazenly obtruding their private experience undisguised before the reader we ought moreover to realize that in this judgment they would have the suffrages of all previous generations including the greatest writers from classical times down to their own it is we who are singular not they quite apart from considerations of moral right or wrong of artistic good or bad it obviously therefore behooves us to try to cultivate a habit of mind free from initial bias against so large a proportion of recorded testimony very early in the rambler johnson remarks characteristically that men more frequently require to be reminded than informed he believed this and his generation believed it because they thought that human nature changed little from age to age the problems of conduct that confront the living individual have been faced countless times by his predecessors and the accumulated experience of mankind has arrived at conclusions which in the main are just and therefore helpful today the most important truths are those which have been known for a very long time for that very reason they tend to be ignored or slighted unless they are restated in such a way as to arrest attention while they compel assent hence the best writing is that which most successfully resolves the paradox of combining the sharpest surprise with the widest recognition such an ideal is so difficult of attainment that inevitably many who subscribed to it succeeded only in unleavened platitude and others rejected it for the easier goal of novelty in this most difficult class the vanity of human wishes has won a respectable place it is freighted with a double cargo the wisdom of two great civilizations pagan and christian although based upon juvenals tenth satire it is so free a paraphrase as to be an original poem the english reader who sets it against drydens closer version will sense immediately its greater weight it is informed with johnsons own sombre and most deeply rooted emotional responses to the meaning of experience these although emanating from a devout practising christian and certainly not inconsistent with christianity neither reflect the specific articles of christian doctrine nor are lightened by the happiness of christian faith they are strongly infused with classical resignation the poem is difficult as well as weighty at times its expression is so condensed that the meaning must be wrestled for statements so packed as for example fate wings with evry wish th afflictive dart each gift of nature and each grace of art do not yield their full intention to the running reader one line indeed the eighth from the end has perhaps never been satisfactorily explained by any commentator the eighteenth paragraph of johnsons first sermon might go far to clarify it but such difficulties are worth the effort they demand because there is always a rational and unesoteric solution to be gained the work as a whole has form is shapely even dramatic but it is discontinuous and episodic in its conduct and is most memorable in its separate parts no one can forget the magnificent set pieces of wolsey and charles xii but hardly less noteworthy are the two parallel invocations interspersed the one addressed to the young scholar the other to young beauties of rosy lips and radiant eyes superb admonitions both each containing such felicities of grave compacted statement as will hardly be surpassed the assuaging marmoreal majesty of the concluding lines of the poem are a final demonstration of the virtue of this formal dignity in poetry if it did not appear invidious one would like to quote by way of contrast some lines oddly parallel but on a pitch deliberately subdued to a less rhetorical level from what is indubitably one of the very greatest poems written in our own century mr eliots four quartets i said to my soul be still and wait without

formosissimus annus virg every man is sufficiently discontented with some circumstances of his present state to suffer his imagination to range more or less in quest of future happiness and to fix upon some point of time in which he shall by the removal of the inconvenience which now perplexes him or the acquisition of advantage which he at present wants find his condition of life very much improved when this time which is too often expected with great impatience at last arrives it generally comes without the blessing for which it was desired but we solace ourselves with some new prospect and press forward again with equal eagerness it is some advantage to a man in whom this temper prevails in any great degree when he turns his hopes upon things wholly out of his own power since he forbears then to precipitate his affairs for the sake of the great event that is to complete his felicity and waits for the blissful hour without neglecting such measures as are necessary to be taken in the mean time i have long known a person of this temper who indulged his dream of happiness with less hurt to himself than such chimerical wishes commonly produce and adjusted his scheme with such address that his hopes were in full bloom three parts of the year and in the other part never wholly blasted many perhaps would be desirous of learning by what means he procured to himself such a cheap and lasting satisfaction it was gained only by a constant practice of referring the removal of all his uneasiness to the coming of the next spring if his affairs were disordered he could regulate them in the spring if a regimen was prescribed him the spring was the proper time of pursuing it if what he wanted was at a high price it would fall its value in the spring the spring indeed did often come without any of these effects but he was always certain that the next would be more propitious and was never convinced that the present spring would fail him until the middle of summer for he always talked of the spring as coming till it was past and when it was once past every one agreed with him that it was coming by long converse with this man i am perhaps in some degree brought to feel the same immoderate pleasure in the contemplation of this delightful season but i have the satisfaction of finding many whom it can be no shame to resemble infected with the same enthusiasm for there is i believe scarce any poet of eminence who has not left some testimony of his fondness for the flowers the zephyrs and the warblers of the spring nor has the most luxuriant imagination been able to describe the serenity and happiness of the golden age otherwise than by giving a perpetual spring as the highest reward of uncorrupted innocence there is indeed something inexpressibly pleasing in the annual renovation of the world and the new display of the treasures of nature the cold and darkness of winter with the naked deformity of every object on which we turn our eyes makes us necessarily rejoice at the succeeding season as well for what we have escaped as for what we may enjoy and every budding flower which a warm situation brings early to our view is considered by us as a messenger to inform us of the approach of more joyous days the spring affords to a mind so free from the disturbance of cares or passions as to be vacant to calm amusements almost every thing that our present state makes us capable of enjoying the variegated verdure of the fields and woods the succession of grateful odours the voice of pleasure pouring out its notes on every side with the observation of the gladness apparently conceived by every animal from the growth of his food and the clemency of the weather throw over the whole earth an air of gayety which is very significantly expressed by the smile of nature there are men to whom these scenes are able to give no delight and who hurry away from all the varieties of rural beauty to lose their hours and divert their thoughts by cards or publick assemblies a tavern dinner or the prattle of the day it may be laid down as a position which will seldom deceive that when a man cannot bear his own company there is something wrong he must fly from himself either because he feels a tediousness in life from the equipoise of an empty mind which having no tendency to one motion more than another but as it is impelled by some external power must always have recourse to foreign objects or he must be afraid of the intrusion of some unpleasing ideas and perhaps is always struggling to escape from the remembrance of a loss the fear of a calamity or some other thought of greater horror those who are incapacitated to enjoy the pleasures of contemplation by their griefs may very properly apply to such diversions provided they are innocent as lay strong hold on the attention and those whom fear of any future calamity chains down to misery must endeavour to obviate the danger my considerations shall on this occasion be turned on such as are burthensome to themselves merely because they want subjects for reflection and to whom the volume of nature is thrown open without affording them pleasure or instruction because they never learned to read the characters a french author has advanced this seeming paradox that very few men know how to take a walk and indeed it is very true that few men know how to take a walk with a prospect of any other pleasure than the same company would have afforded them in any other circumstances there are animals that borrow their colour from the neighbouring body and consequently vary their hue as they happen to change their place in like manner it ought to be the endeavour of every man to derive his reflexions from the objects about him for it is to no purpose that he alters his position if his attention continues fixt to the same point the mind should be kept open to the access of every new idea and so far disengaged from the predominance of particular thoughts as to be able to accommodate itself to emergent occasions and remark every thing that offers itself to present examination a man that has formed this habit of turning every new object to his entertainment finds in the productions of nature an inexhaustible stock of materials upon which he can employ himself without any temptations to envy or malevolence faults perhaps seldom totally avoided by those whose judgment is much exercised upon the works of art he has always a certain prospect of discovering new reasons for adoring the sovereign author of the universe and probable hopes of making some discovery of benefit to others or of profit to himself there is no doubt but many vegetables and animals have qualities that might be of great use to the knowledge of which there is required no great sagacity of penetration or fatigue of study but only frequent experiments and close attention what is said by the chymists of their darling mercury is perhaps true of every body through the whole creation that if a thousand lives should be spent upon it all its properties would not be found out mankind must necessarily be diversified by various tastes since life affords and requires such multiplicity of employments and a nation of naturalists is neither to be hoped or desired but it is surely not improper to point out a fresh amusement to those who langush in health and repine in plenty for want of some source of diversion that may be less easily exhausted and to inform the multitudes of both sexes who are burthened with every new day that there are many shews which they have not seen he that enlarges his curiosity after the works of nature demonstrably multiplies the inlets to happiness and therefore the younger part of my readers to whom i dedicate this vernal speculation must excuse me for calling upon them to make use at once of the spring of the year and the spring of life to acquire while their minds may be yet impressed with new images a love of innocent pleasures and an ardour for useful knowledge and to remember that a blighted spring makes a barren year and that the vernal flowers however beautiful and gay are only intended by nature as

be continued on tuesdays and saturdays saturday october quid fit pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non plenius et melius chrysippo et crantore dicit hor all joy or sorrow for the happiness or calamities of others is produced by an act of the imagination that realises the event however fictitious or approximates it however remote by placing us for a time in the condition of him whose fortune we contemplate so that we feel while the deception lasts whatever motions would be excited by the same good or evil happening to ourselves our passions are therefore more strongly moved in proportion as we can more readily adopt the pains or pleasures proposed to our minds by recognising them as once our own or considering them as naturally incident to our state of life it is not easy for the most artful writer to give us an interest in happiness or misery which we think ourselves never likely to feel and with which we have never yet been made acquainted histories of the downfall of kingdoms and revolutions of empires are read with great tranquillity the imperial tragedy pleases common auditors only by its pomp of ornament and grandeur of ideas and the man whose faculties have been engrossed by business and whose heart never fluttered but at the rise or fall of stocks wonders how the attention can be seized or the affections agitated by a tale of love those parallel circumstances and kindred images to which we readily conform our minds are above all other writings to be found in narratives of the lives of particular persons and there seems therefore no species of writing more worthy of cultivation than biography since none can be more delightful or more useful none can more certainly enchain the heart by irresistible interest or more widely diffuse instruction to every diversity of condition the general and rapid narratives of history which involve a thousand fortunes in the business of a day and complicate innumerable incidents in one great transaction afford few lessons applicable to private life which derives its comforts and its wretchedness from the right or wrong management of things that nothing but their frequency makes considerable parva si non fiunt quotidie says pliny and which can have no place in those relations which never descend below the consultation of senates the motions of armies and the schemes of conspirators i have often thought that there has rarely passed a life of which a judicious and faithful narrative would not be useful for not only every man has in the mighty mass of the world great numbers in the same condition with himself to whom his mistakes and miscarriages escapes and expedients would be of immediate and apparent use but there is such an uniformity in the life of man if it be considered apart from adventitious and separable decorations and disguises that there is scarce any possibility of good or ill but is common to humankind a great part of the time of those who are placed at the greatest distance by fortune or by temper must unavoidably pass in the same manner and though when the claims of nature are satisfied caprice and vanity and accident begin to produce discriminations and peculiarities yet the eye is not very heedful or quick which cannot discover the same causes still terminating their influence in the same effects though sometimes accelerated sometimes retarded or perplexed by multiplied combinations we are all prompted by the same motives all deceived by the same fallacies all animated by hope obstructed by danger entangled by desire and seduced by pleasure it is frequently objected to relations of particular lives that they are not distinguished by any striking or wonderful vicissitude the scholar who passes his life among his books the merchant who conducted only his own affairs the priest whose sphere of action was not extended beyond that of his duty are considered as no proper objects of publick regard however they might have excelled in their several stations whatever might have been their learning integrity and piety but this notion arises from false measures of excellence and dignity and must be eradicated by considering that in the eye of uncorrupted reason what is of most use is of most value it is indeed not improper to take honest advantages of prejudice and to gain attention by a great name but the business of the biographer is often to pass slightly over those performances and incidents which produce vulgar greatness to lead the thoughts into domestick privacies and display the minute details of daily life where exterior appendages are cast aside and men excel each other only by prudence and by virtue the life of thuanus is with great propriety said by its author to have been written that it might lay open to posterity the private and familiar character of that man cujus ingenium et candorem ex ipsius scriptis sunt olim simper miraturi whose candour and genius his writings will to the end of time preserve in admiration there are many invisible circumstances which whether we read as enquirers after natural or moral knowledge whether we intend to enlarge our science or encrease our virtue are more important than publick occurrences thus salust the great master has not forgot in his account of catiline to remark that his walk was now quick and again slow as an indication of a mind revolving something with violent commotion thus the story of melancthon affords a striking lecture on the value of time by informing us that when he made an appointment he expected not only the hour but the minute to be fixed that life might not run out in the idleness of suspense and all the plans and enterprizes of de wit are now of less importance to the world than that part of his personal character which represents him as careful of his health and negligent of his life but biography has often been allotted to writers who seem very little acquainted with the nature of their task or very negligent about the performance they rarely afford any other account than might be collected from publick papers and imagine themselves writing a life when they exhibit a chronological series of actions or preferments and so little regard the manners or behaviour of their heroes that more knowledge may be gained of a mans real character by a short conversation with one of his servants than from a formal and studied narrative begun with his pedigree and ended with his funeral if now and then they condescend to inform the world of particular facts they are not always so happy as to select those which are of most importance i know not well what advantage posterity can receive from the only circumstance by which tickell has distinguished addison from the rest of mankind the irregularity of his pulse nor can i think myself overpaid for the time spent in reading the life of malherb by being enabled to relate after the learned biographer that malherb had two predominant opinions one that the looseness of a single woman might destroy all the boast of ancient descent the other that the french beggers made use very improperly and barbarously of the phrase noble gentleman because either word included the sense of both there are indeed some natural reasons why these narratives are often written by such as were not likely to give much instruction or delight and why most accounts of particular persons are barren and useless if a life be delayed till all interest and envy are at an end and all motives to calumny or flattery are suppressed we may hope for impartiality but must expect little intelligence for the incidents which give excellence to biography are of a volatile and evanescent kind such as soon escape the memory and are rarely transmitted by tradition we know how few can portray a living acquaintance except by his most prominent and observable particularities and the grosser features of his mind and it may be easily imagined how much of this little knowledge may be lost in imparting it and how soon a succession of copies will lose all resemblance of the original if the biographer writes from personal knowledge and makes haste to gratify the publick curiosity there is danger left his interest his fear his gratitude or his tenderness overpower his fidelity and tempt him to conceal if not to invent there are many who think it an act of piety to hide the faults or failings of their friends even when they can no longer suffer by their detection we therefore see whole ranks of characters adorned with uniform panegyrick and not to be known from one another but by extrinsick and casual circumstances let me remember says hale when i find myself inclined to pity a criminal that there is likewise a pity due to the country if there is a regard due to the memory of the dead there is yet more respect to be paid to knowledge to virtue and to truth london printed for j payne and j bouquet in paternosterrow where letters for the rambler are
