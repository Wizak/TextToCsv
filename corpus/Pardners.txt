 pardners by rex e beach author of the barrier the spoilers illustrated contents pardners the mule driver and the garrulous mute the colonel and the horsethief the thaw at sliscos bitter root billings arbiter the shyness of shorty the test north of fiftythree where northern lights come down o nights the scourge pardners most all the old quotations need fixing said joyce in tones forbidding dispute for instance the guy that alluded to marriages germinating in heaven certainly got off on the wrong foot he meant pardnerships the same works aint got capacity for both no moren you can build a splitsecond stopwatch in a stone quarry no sir a true pardnership is the sanctifiedest relation that grows is and has its beans while any two folks of opposite sect can marry and peg the game out some way of course all pardnerships aint divine to every one thats heaven borned theres a thousand made in there goes them cussed dogs again he dove abruptly at the tent flap disappearing like a palmed coin while our canvas structure reeled drunkenly at his impact the sounds of strife without rose shrilly into blended agony and the yelps of keno melted away down the gulch in a rapid and rabid diminuendo inasmuch as i had just packed out from camp in a loose pair of rubber boots and was nursing two gall blisters i did not feel called upon to emulate this energy of arbitration particularly in bare feet that black malamoot is a walking delegate for strife he remarked returning sometime ill lose my temper and thats the kind of pardners me and justus morrow was never more do i interrupt the allegory of my mate no matter how startling its structure he adventures orally when and in the manner the spirit calls without rote form or tone production therefore i kicked my blistered heels in the air and grunted aimless encouragement i was prospectin a claim on caribou creek and had her punched as full of holes as a sponge cake when the necessity of a change appealed to me i was out of everything more nourishing than hope and one slab of paystreaked bacon when two tenderfeet mushed up the gulch and invited themselves into my cabin to watch me pan its the simplest thing known to science to salt a tenderfoot so i didnt have no trouble in selling out for three thousand dollars you see they couldnt kick cause some of us old timers was bound to get their money anyhow just a question of time and their inexperience was cheap at the price also they was real nice boys and i hated to see em fall amongst them crooks at dawson it was a shorthorned triumph though like the dead sea biscuits of scripture it turned to ashes in my mouth it wasnt three days later that they struck it right in my last shaft within a foot of where i quit diggin they rocked out fifty ounces first day when the news filtered to me of course i never made no holler i couldnt that is honestly but i bought a six hundred dollar grub stake loaded it aboard a dory and having instructed the trader regarding the disposition of my mortal drunken remains i fanned through that camp like a prairie fire shot in the sirloin with a hot wind of course it wasnt such a big spree nothing gaudy or swedelike but them that should know claimed it was a model of refinement yes i have got many encomiums on its general proportions and artistic finish one hundred dollars an hour for twentyfour hours all in red licker confined to and in me and my choicest sympathizers i reckon all our booze combined would have made a fair sluicehead anyhow i woke up considerable farther down the dim vistas of time and about the same distance down the yukon in the bottom of my dory seekin new fields at six miles an hour the trader had follered my last will and testament scrupulous even to coverin up my legs thats how i drifted into rampart city and justus morrow this here town was the same as any new camp a mile long and eighteen inches wide consisting of saloons dancehalls saloons tradingposts saloons places to get licker and saloons might not have been so many dancehalls and tradingposts as ive mentioned and a few more saloons i dropped into a joint called the reception and whod i see playing bank but single out wilmer the worst gambler on the river mounted police had him on the woodpile in dawson then tied a can on him at the same table was a nice tender philadelphia squab bout fryin size and while i was watching wilmer pulls down a bet belonging to it thats an old game pardon me says the broiler you have my checks what growls single out i knowed this game before you quit nursin bright eyes i can protect my own bets thats right chimes the dealer who i seen was curly budd wilmers pardner lord thinks i theres a pair to draw to do you really think you had ought to play this its a mans game says wilmer nasty i expected to see the youngster dog it nothin of the kind thats my bet he says again and i noticed something dry in his voice like the rustle of silk single out just looks black and snarls at the dealer turn the cards oh very well says the chechako talking like a little girl somebody snickered and thinks i theres sprightly doins hereabouts ill tarry a while and see em singe the fowl i like the smell of burning pin feathers it clears my head over in the far corner was another animal in knee panties riggin up one of these flashlight snappyshot photograft layouts i found afterwards that he done it for a living didnt work none just strayed around as corespondent for an english newspaper syndicate taking pictures and writing story things i didnt pay much attention to him hiding under his black cloth cause the farotable was full of bets and its hard to follow the play well byeandbye wilmer shifted another stack belonging to the easterner the lad never begged his pardon nor nothin his fist just shot out and landed on the nigh corner of wilmers jaw clean and fair and single out done as pretty a headspin as i ever see considering that it was executed in a cuspidore twas my first insight into the amenities of football id like to see a whole game of it they say it lasts an hour and a half of all the cordial whyhowdoyoudo mule kicks handed down in rhyme and story that wallop was the adopted daddy when he struck i took the end of the bar like a steeplechaser for i seen curly grab at the drawer and i have aversions to witnessing gun plays from the front end the tenderfoot riz up in his chair and snatchin a stack of reds in his off mit dashed em into curlys face just as he pulled trigger it spoiled his aim and the boy was on to him like a mountain lion follerin over the table along the line of least resistance it was like takin a candy sucker from a baby curly let go of that six like he was plumb tired of it and the kid welted him over the ear just oncet then he turned on the room and right there my heart went out to him he took in the line up at a sweep of his lamps any of you gentlemen got ideas on the subject he says and his eyes danced like waves in the sunshine it was all that finished and genteel that i speaks up without thinkin you for me pardner just as i said it there come a swish and flash as if a kag of black powder had changed its state of bein i spose everybody yelled and dodged except the picture man he says thank you gents very pretty tableau it was the first flashlight i ever see and all i recall now is a panorama of starin eyeballs and gaping mouths when it seen it wasnt torpedoed the population begin crawlin out from under chairs and tables men hopped out like toads in a rain i crossed the boys trail later that evening found him watchin a dance at the gold belt the photografter was there too and when hed got his doghouse fixed he says everybody take pardners and whoop her up i want this picture for the weekly get busy you there we all joined in to help things the orchestra hit the rough spots and we went highfalutin down the centre to show the english race how our joy pained us and that life in the klondyke had the newport whirl looking like society in a siwash village he got another good picture inside of a week morrow and i had joined up we leased a claim and had our cabin done waiting for snow to fall sos to sled our grub out to the creek he took to me like i did to him and he was an educated lad too somehow though it hadnt gone to his head leaving his hands useless like knowledge usually does one day just before the last boat pulled down river mr struthers the picture man come to us r alonzo struthers of london and frisco he was and showin us a picture he says aint that great sunday supplements full page big display eh it sure was bout x and showing every detail of the reception saloon there was single out analyzing the cuspidore and curly dozin as contorted and welldone as a pretzel there was the crowd hiding in the corners and behind the farotable stood the kid one hand among the scattered chips and cards the other dominating the layout with curleys six it couldnt have looked more natural if wed posed for it it was a bully likeness i thought too till i seen myself glaring over the bar all that showed of william p joyce bachelor of some arts and plenty of science late of dawson was the white of his eyes and talkin of white say i looked like i had washing hung out seemed like the draught had riz my hair up too nothing like it ever seen continues struthers ill call it the winning card or at bay or something like that feature it as a typical klondyke card game ill give you a twopage writeup why its the greatest thing i ever did im sorry says morrow thoughtful but you musnt run it what says he and i thinks oh lord there goes my only show to get perpetufied in ink i cant let you use it my wife might see it your wife says i are you married pardner yes im married and his voice sounded queer ive got a boy too see he took a locket from his flannel shirt and opened it a curlyheaded dimpled little youngster laughed out at me well im d and then i took off my hat for in the other side was a woman and gentlemen she was a woman when i seen her it made me feel blushy and ashamed gee she was a stunner i just stared at her till struthers looked over my shoulder and says excited why its olive troop the singer not any more says morrow smiling oh so youre the fellow she gave up her art for i knew her on the stage something way deep down in the man grated on me but the kid was lookin at the picture and never noticed while hunger peered from his face you cant blame me he says finally shed worry to death if she saw that picture the likeness is too good you might substitute another face on my shoulders that can be done cant it why sure dead easy but ill not run it at all if you feel that way says the artist then morrow resumes youll be in denver this fall struthers eh well i want you to take a letter to her shell be glad to see an old friend like you and to hear from me tell her im well and happy and that ill make a fortune sure tell her too that there wont be any mail out of here till spring now i dont claim no second sight in the matter of female features i aint had no coachin not even as much as the ordinary being raised on a bottle but ive studied the ornery imprints of mens thoughts over green tables and gun barls till i can about guess whether theyve drawed four aces or an invite to a funeral i got another flash from that man i didnt like though his words were hearty he left soon after on the last boat soon as ever the ground froze we began to sink in those days steam thawers wasnt dreamed of so we slid wood down from the hills and burned the ground with fires its slow work and we didnt catch bedrock till december but when we did we struck it right four feet of tencent dirt was what she averaged big well i wonder it near drove morrow crazy billy old boy this means ill see her next summer whenever he mentioned her name he spoke like a man in church or out of breath somehow it made me feel like takin off my cap forty below at that and my ears freeze terrible willing since that winter on the porcupine that evening when i wasnt looking he sneaked the locket out of his shirt and stared at it famished then he kissed it if you might rehabilitate such a scandalous holdfastforthecorner performance by that name i must let her know right away says he how can i do it we can hire a messenger and send him to dawson says i everybody in camp will pay five dollars a letter and he can bring back the outside mail they have monthly service from there to the coast hell make the trip in ninety days so youll get news from home by the first of march windy jim will go hed leave a good job and a warm camp any time to hit the trail just hitch up the dogs crack a whip and yell mush on and hell get the snowshoe itch and water at the mouth for hardship not being housebroke and tame myself i aint authority on the joys of getting mail from home but next to it i judge comes writing to your family anyhow the boy shined up like new money and there was from one to four million pages in his hurried note i dont mean to say that he was grouchy at any time no sir he was the nickelplated sunbeam of the whole creek why ive knowed him to do the cooking for two weeks at a stretch and never kick and wash the dishes too which last as anybody knows is crucifyiner than that smelter test of the three jews in the scripture underneath all of his sunshine though i saw hints of an awful aching devilish starvation it made me near hate the woman that caused it he was a wise one too ive seen him stirring dogfeed with one hand and spouting grays elegy with the other i picked up a heap of knowledge from him for he had american history pat one story i liked particular was concerning the origin of placer mining in this country about a greaser jason somebody who got the gold fever and grubstaked a mob he called the augerknots carpenters i judge from the mess they made of it they chartered a schooner and prospected along asy miner wherever that is i never seen any boys from there but the formation was wrong like texas probably cause they sort of drifted into the sheep business of course that was a long ways back before the rush but the way he told it was great well two weeks after windy left we worked out of that rich spot and drifted into barren ground instead of a fortune wed sunk onto the only yellow spot in the whole claim we crosscut in three places and never raised a colour but we kept gophering around till march in hopes why did i write that letter he asked one day id give anything to stop it before it gets out think of her disappointment when she hears im broke nobody cant look into the ground says i i dont mind losin out myself for ive done it for twenty years and i sort of like it now but im sorry for the girl it means another whole season he says i wanted to see them this summer or bring them in next fall sufferin sluiceboxes are you plumb daffy bring a woman into the yukon and a little baby shed follow me anywhere shes awful proud proud as a kentucky girl can be and those people would make your uncle lucifer look like a cringing cripple but shed live in an indian hut with me sure and follerin out the simile nobody but a siwash would let her if she dont like some other feller better while youre gone whatre you scared about he never answered just looked at me pityfyin as much as to say well you poor drivelin old polyp one day denny the squawman drove up the creek windy jim is back with the mail says he and we hit for camp on the run only fifteen mile she is but i was all in when we got there keepin up with justus his eyes outshone the snowglitter and he sang all the time he wasnt roasting me for being so slow claimed i was active as a toadstool a man aint got no license to excite hisself unless hes struck pay dirt or got a divorce gime my mail quick he says to windy who had tinkered up a onenight stand postoffice and dealt out letters at five dollars per let nothing doing says windy oh yes there is he replies still smiling she writes me every week i got all there was at dawson windy give back and there aint a thing for you i consider the tragedy of this north country lies in its mail service uncle sam institutes rural deliveries so the bolomen can register poisoned arrowheads to the igorrotes in exchange for recipes to make roulade of naval officer but his american miners in alaska go shy on home news for eight months every year that was the last mail we had till june when the river broke we cleaned up one hundred and eightyseven dollars worth of lovely yellow dust and seven hundred and thirtyfive dollars in beautiful yellow bills from the post the first boat down from dawson brought mail and i stood beside him when he got his he shook so he held on to the pursers window instead of a stack of squares overrun with female chiropody there was only one for him a long hungry sport with indications of a law firm in the northwest corner it charmed him like a rattler he seemed scared to open it two or three times he tried and stopped theyre dead thinks i and sure enough when hed looked i knew it was so and felt for his hand sympathy dont travel by word of mouth between pardners its the grip of the hand or the look of the eye what cause says i he turned and shelp me i never want to see the like again his face was plumb grey and dead like wet ashes while his eyes scorched through all dry and hot lines was sinkin into it as i looked its worse says he unless its a joke he handed me the dope in re olive troop morrow vs justus morrow and a letter stating that out of regard for her feelings and bein a gentleman he wasnt expected to cause a scandal but to let her get the divorce by default no explanation no word from her nothing god knows what that boy suffered the next few weeks but he fought it out alone she was proud but he was prouder her silence hurt him the worst of course but what could he do go to her fine both of us broke and in debt also theres such a thing as diggin deep enough to scrape the varnish off of a mans selfrespect leavin it raw and shrinking no he done like you or me let her have her way he took off the locket and hid it and i never heard her name mentioned for a year id been up creek for a whipsaw one day and as i came back i heard voices in the cabin some musher out from town thinks i till something in their tones made me stop in my tracks i could hear the boys voice hoarse and throbbing as though he dragged words out bleeding then i heard the other one laugh a nasty sneering laugh that ended in a choking rattle like a noose had tightened on his throat i jumped for the door and rounding the corner something near took me off my feet something that shot through the air all pretty and knickerbockery with a twofaced cap and nice brown leggins also a little camera was harnessed to it by tugs it arose displaying the face of r alonzo struthers black and swollen with chips stickin in it where hed hit the woodpile he glared at morrow and his lips foamed like a crab out of water i hope im not intrudin i ventures when the kid seen me he says soft and weak like something ailed his palate dont let me kill him billy illustration dont let me kill him billy struthers spit and picked splinters forth from his complexion i told you for your own good its common gossip says he everybody is laughing at you an then i done a leap for life for the kid cause the murder light blazed up white in his face and he moved at the man like he had something serious in view run you idiot i yells to struthers as i jammed the youngster back into the cabin all of a sudden the gas went out of him and he broke hanging to me like a baby it cant be he whispers it cant be he throwed hisself on to a goods box and buried his face in his hands it gripes me to hear a man cry so i went to the creek for a pail of water i never heard what struthers said but it dont take no nick carter to guess that was the fall of the fryin pan strike do you mind it shakespeare george put us on so me and the kid got in ahead of the stampede we located one and two above discovery and by christmas we had a streak uncovered that was all gold she was coarse and we averaged six ounces a day in pickups man that was ground ive flashed my candle along the drift face where it looked like gold had been shot in with a scattergun we was cleaned up and had our pokes at the post when the first boat from dawson smoked round the bend now in them days a mans averdupoise was his abstract of title there was nothing said about records and patentees as long as you worked your ground but likewise when you didnt work it somebody else usually did we had a thousand feet of as good dirt as ever laid out in the rain but there was men around drulin to snipe it and i knowed it was risky to leave however i saw what was gnawin at the boy and if ever a man needed a friend and criminal lawyer that was the time according to the zodiac certain persons to the complainant unknown had a mess of trouble comin up and i wanted to have the bail money handy we jumped camp together i made oration to the general gnatbitten populace from the gangplank to the effect that one william p joyce trap crap and snap shooter was due to happen back casual most any time and any lady or gent desirous of witnessing at first hand a shutzenfest with live targets could be gratified by infestin in person or by proxy the lands tenements and hereditaments of me and the kid well we hit the seattle docks at a canter him headed for the postal telegraph me for a fruitstand i bought a dollars worth of everything from crackerjack to cantaloupe reserving the local option of eatin it there in whole or in part and returning for more first fresh fruit in three years i reckon my proudest hour come when i found beyond peradventure that i hadnt forgot the georgy grind what georgy grind consists of feeding roughhewed slabs of watermelon into your sou soueast corner and squirting a stream of seeds out from the other cardinal points without stopping or strangling i et and et and then wallered up to the hotel sweatin a different kind of fruit juice from every pore not wishing to play any favourites id picked up a basket of tomatoes a gunnysack of pineapples and a peck of green plums on the way them plums done the business id orter let bad enough alone they was nonunion and i begin having trouble with my inside help morrow turned in a hurryup call for the red cross two medical colleges and the society of psycolic research between em they diagnosed me as containing everything from housemaids knee to homesickness of the vital organs but i know i swallered a plum pit and it sprouted next day when i come out of it justus had heard from denver his wife had been gone a year destination unknown somebody thought she went to california so two days later we registered at the palace and the frisco police begin dreaming of five thousand dollar rewards it was no use though one day i met struthers on market street and he was scared stiff to hear that morrow was in town it seems he was night editor of one of the big dailies do you know where the girl is says i yes shes in new york he answers looking queer so i hurried back to the hotel as i was explaining to morrow a woman passed us in the hall with a little boy in the dimness the lad mistook justus oh papa papa he yells and grabs him by the knees laughing and kicking ahh my pardner sighs hoarse as a raven and quickern light he snatched the little shaver to him then seeing his mistake dropped him rough his face went grey again and he got wabbly at the hinges so i helped him into the parlour he had that hungry yukon look and breathed like he was wounded you come with me says i and get your mind off of things the eastern limited dont leave till midnight us to the theatre it was a swell tepee all right variety house with moving pictures and actorbats and twoton soubrettes with barrios diamonds and handpainted socks first good show id seen in three years and naturally humour broke out all over me when joy spreads its wings in my vitals i sound like a boy with a stick running past a picketfence not so morrow he slopped over the sides of his seat like hed been spilled into the house right after the sealions the orchestra spieled some teetery music and out floats a woman slim and graceful as an antelope she had a big paydump of brown hair piled up on her hurricane deck with eyes that snapped and crinkled at the corners she singlefooted in like a derby colt and the somnambulists in the front row begin to show cause something about her startled me so i nudged the kid but he was chindeep in the plush with his eyes closed i marked how drawed and haggard he looked and then of a sudden he raised half on to his feet the girl had begun to sing her voice was rich and low and full of deep still places like a mountain stream but morrow he sunk his fingers into me and leaned forrad starin as though paradise had opened for him while the sweat on his face shone like diamond chips it was the girl of the locket all right on the stage again in vaudeville her song bubbled along rippling over sandy sunlit gravel bars and slidin out through shadowy trout pools beneath the cool alder thickets and all the time my pardner sat burning his soul in his eyes his breath achin out through his throat incidental his digits was knuckledeep into the muscular tissue of william p the gent to the right when she quit i had to jam him back for an encore she sang a reglar american song with music to it when she reached the chorus she stopped then away up in the balcony sounded the tiny treble of a boys soprano sweet as the ring of silver the audience turned to a man and we seen perched among the newsboys the littlest goldenhaired youngster bout the size of your thumb his eyes glued to the face of his mother on the stage below pourin out his lark song serious and frightened twice he done it while by main strenth i held his father to the enjoyments of a twodollar orchestra chair let us in we says three minutes later to the stranger at the stage door but he looked upon us with unwelcome like the sevenheaded hydrant of holy writ its agin the rules says he you kin wait in the alley with the other johnnies i aint acclimated to the cold disfavour of a stage door never having soubretted along the bird and bottle route i was for the layin on of hands moreover i didnt like the company we was in johnnies by designations of the irish terrier at the wicket they smoked readymade cigarettes and some of em must have measured full eight inches acrost the chest let us stroll gently but firmly into over and past the remains of this party to the missus says i but morrow got seized with the shakes of a sudden no no well wait here at last she come out steppin high when she moved she rustled and rattled like she wore sandpaper at the ankles say she was royal she carried the youngster in her arms sound asleep and it wasnt till she stepped under the gaslight that she seen us oh she cried and went white as the lace of her cloak then she hugged the kiddie clost to her standing straight and queenly her eyes ablaze her lips moist and red and scornful god she was grand but him he looked like a barnacle olive says he bullfroggy and thats all just quit like a dog and ate her up by longdistance eyesight lord nobody would have knowed him for the same man that called the crookedest gamblers on the yukon and bolted newspaper men raw he had ingrowing language it oozed out through his pores till he dreened like a harvest hand id have had her in my arms in two winks so that all hell and a policeman couldnt have busted my holt till shed said she loved me she shrivelled him with a look the likes of which aint strayed over the masondixon line since lee surrendered and swept by us invitin an horspitable as an iceberg in a cross sea her cab door slammed and i yanked morrow out of there more dead than alive let me go home says he wearily you bet i snorts its time you was tucked in the dew is fallin and some rude person might accost you you big slob theres a mans work to do tonight and as i dont seem to have no competition in holding the title i spose its my lead i throwed him into a carriage youd best put on your nighty and have the maid turn down your light sweet dreams gussie i was plumb sore on him history dont record no divorce suits in the stone age when a domestic inclined man allus toted a whiteoak billy studded with wire nails according to the pictures and didnt scruple to use it both at home and abroad women was hairy them days and harder to make love honour and obey but principles is undyin i boarded another cab drive me to number giving him the address id heard her use who is it came her voice when i rang the bell messenger boy i replies perjuring my vocal cords when she opened the door i pushed through and closed it behind me what does this mean she cried help shut up it means youre killing the best boy in the world and i want to know why who are you im bill joyce your husbands pardner old tarantula bill that dont fear no man woman or child that roams the forest im here to find what ails you leave this house sir well not to any extent youre a good girl i knowed it when i first seen your picture now i want you to tell me insolent shall i call the police her voice was icy and she stood as solid as stone madam im as gentle as a jellyfish and peaceful to a fault but if you raise a row before i finish my talk ill claim no responsibility over what occurs to the first eight or ten people that intrudes and i drawed my skinnin knife layin it on the planner philanthropy is raging through my innards and two loving hearts need joining i dont love him she quotes like a phonograft ignoring my cutlery ill take exception to that ruling and i picks up a picture of justus shed dropped as i broke in she never batted an eye i nursed that lad through brain fever when all he could utter was your name has he been sick the first sign of spring lit up her peaks most dead notice of the divorce done it hes in bad shape yet morrow never had a sick day in his life but i stomped both feet on the soft pedal and pulled out the tremulo stop oh oh her voice was soft though she still stood like a birch little girl i laid a hand on her shoulder we both love that boy come now what is the matter she flashed up like powder matter i thought he was a gentleman even though he didnt love me that he had a shred of honour at least but no he went to alaska and made a fortune then he squandered it drinking fighting gambling and frittering it away on women bah lewd creatures of the dancehalls too hold up your dope sheet is way to the bad theres something wrong with your libretto who told you all that never mind i have proof look at these and you dare to ask me why i left him she dragged out some pictures and throwed em at me ah why didnt i let the kid kill him says i through my teeth the first was the gamblingroom of the reception there stood morrow with the men under foot there was the bottles and glasses the chips and cards and also the distressful spectacle of tarantula bill joyce a number twelve man all gleaming teeth and rolling eyeballs inserting hisself into a number nine opening and doing surprising well at it look at them look at them well she gibed the second was the goldbelt dancehall with the kid cavorting through a drunken orgy of painted ladies like a bull in a pansy patch but the other it took my breath away till i felt i was on smooth ice with cracks showing it was the inside of a cabin after a big potlatch displaying a table littered up with fizz bottles and dishes galore diamond tooth lou stood on a chair waving kisses and spilling booze from a mug in the centre stood morrow with another girl nestling agin his boosum most horrible lovin gee it was a home splitter and it left me sparring for wind the whole thing exhaled an air of debauchery that would make a wooden indian blush no one thing in particular just the general local colour of a thousanddollar bender charming isnt it she sneered i dont savvy the burro theres something phony about it i can explain the other two but this one then it come to me in a flash the mans face was perfect but he wore knickerbockers now to my personal knowledge the only being that ever invaded rampart city in them things was r alonzo struthers theres secrets of the darkroom that i aint wise to says i but i feel that this is going to be a bad night for the newspaper enterprise of frisco if it dont explain ill fetch the man that busted your larrys and peanuts our what says she larrys and peanuts thats roman the kid told me all about em theyre sort of little cheap gods will you ever go she snapped i dont need your help tell him i hate him she stamped her foot and the iron come into her again till the pride of all kentucky blazed in her eyes she couldnt understand my explanations no more than i could so i ducked as i backed out the door though i seen her crumple up and settle all of a heap on the floor she certainly did hate that man scandalous im glad some editors work nights struthers wasnt overjoyed at my call particular as i strayed in with two janitors dangling from me they said he was busy and couldnt be interrupted and they seemed to insist on it its a bully night says i by way of epigram unhooking the pair of bouncers you wouldnt like me to take you ridin perhaps are you drunk or crazy says he what do you mean by breaking into my office i cant talk to you were just going to press id like to stay and watch it says i but ive got a news item for you at the same time i draws my skinner and lays it on the back of his neck tempting steel in the lamplight is discouraging to some temperaments one of the bodyguards was took with urgent business and left a streamer of funny noises behind him while the other gave autumnleaf imitations in the corner struthers looked like a dose of seasickness on a sour stomach get your hat quick i jobbed him gentle and encouraging age allus commands respect therefore the sight of a sixfoot grizzled klondiker in a wide hat benevolently prodding the night editor in the short ribs and apple sauce with eight bright and chilly inches engendered a certain respect in the reportorial staff youre going to tell mrs morrow all about the pretty pictures i says like a father let me go damn you he frothed but i wedged him into a corner of the cab and took off his collar in strips it interfered with his breathing as i couldnt get a holt low enough to regulate his respiration he kicked out two cab windows but i bumped his head agin the woodwork by way of repartee it was a real pleasure not to say recreation experimenting with the noises he made seldom i get a neck i give a cuss to squeeze his was number fifteen at first by the feel but i reduced it a quarter size at a time when we got there i helped him out one hand under his chin the other back of his ears i done it as much from regard of the neighbours as animosities to him for it was the still medium small hours i tiptoed in with my treatise on the infamies of photography gurgling under my hand but at the door i stopped it was ajar and there under the light i spied morrow in his arms i got glimpses of black lace and wavy brown hair and a white cheek that he was accomplishing wonders with they wouldnt have heard a manhole explosion hes still fitting to be my pardner i thinks and then i heard strutherss teeth chatter and grind i looked at him and the secret of the whole play came to me never having known the divine passion it aint for me to judge but i tightened on his voicebox and whispered youve outlived your period of usefulness struthers and its time to go let us part friends however so i bade him godspeed from the top step looking back on the evening now that adieu was my only mistake i limped for a week he had a bottle in his hip pocket the mule driver and the garrulous mute bill had finished panning the concentrates from our last cleanup and now the silver ball of amalgam sizzled and fried on the shovel over the little chipfire while we smoked in the sun before the cabin removed from the salivating fumes of the quicksilver we watched the yellow tint grow and brighten in the heat theres two diseases which the doctors aint got any license to monkey with began bill chewing out blue smoke from his lungs with each word and theyre both fevers after they butt into your system they stick crossways like a swallered toothpick there aint any patent medicine that can bust their holt i settled against the doorjamb and nodded ive had them both acute and continuous since i was old enough to know my own mind and the taste of tobacco i hold them mainly responsible for my present condition he mournfully viewed his feverridden frame which sprawled a pitiful sixfeettwo from the heels of his gumboots to the grizzled hair beneath his white stetson the first and most rabid he continued is horseracing and tother is the mining fever which last is a heap insidiouser in its action and more lingering in its effect it wasnt long after that deal in the territory that i felt the symptoms coming on agin and this time they pinted most emphatic toward prospecting so me and kink martin loaded our kit onto the burros and hit west kink was a terrible good prospector though allfired unlucky and peculiar most people called him crazy cause he had fits of goin for days without a peep hosstyle and ornery to the whole world sort of bulging out and exploding with silence as it were wed been out in the hills for a week on our first trip before he got one of them deathwatch faces on him and boycotted the english langwidge i stood for it three days trying to jolly a grin on to him or rattle a word loose but he just wouldnt jolt one night we packed into camp tired hungry and dying for a good feed i hustled around and produced a supper fit for old mr eppycure knowing that kink had a weakness for strong coffee that was simply a hinge in him i pounded up about a quart of coffee beans in the corner of a blanket and boiled out a south american liquid that was nothing but the real arbuckle mud this wasnt no chafingdish party either because the wood was wet and the smoke chased me round the fire then it blazed up in spurts and fired the bacongrease so that when i grabbed the skillet the handle sizzled the life all out of my callouses i kicked the fire down to a nice bed of coals and then the coffeepot upset and put it out ashes got into the bacon and oh you know how joyful it is to cook on a green fire when youre dead tired and your hoodoos on vicious when the scoffings were finally ready i wasnt in what you might exactly call a mollyfying and tactful mood nor exuding genialness and enthusiasms anyways noticeable i herded the best in camp towards him watching for a benevolent symptom but he just dogged it in silence and never changed a hair that was the limit so i inquired sort of ominous and gentle is that coffee strong enough for ye mr martin he give a little impecunious grunt implying oh itll do and with that i seen little green specks begin to buck and wing in front of my eyes reaching back of me i grabbed the winchester and throwed it down on him now you laugh darn you i says in a hurry just turn it out gleeful and infractious he stared into the nozzle of that krupp for a minute then swallered twice to tune up his reeds and says friendly and perlite but serious and wheezy why what in hell ails you william laugh you old dongbeater i yells rising gradually to the occasion or ill bust your cupola like a bluerock ive got to have merriment i says i pine for warmth and genial smiles and youre due to furnish the sunshine you emit a few shreds of mirth with expedition or the upper end of your spinalcord is going to catch cold say his jaws squeaked like a screen door when he loosened but he belched up a beauty sort of stagy and artificial it was but a great help after that we got to know each other a heap better yes sir soon after that we got real intimate he knocked the gun out of my hands and we began to arbitrate we plumb ruined that spot for a camping place rooted it up in furrows and tramped each others stummicks out of shape we finally reached an amicable settlement by me getting him agin a log where i could brand him with the coffeepot right there we drawed up a protoplasm by the terms of which he was to laugh anyways twice at mealtimes he told me that he reckoned he was locoed and always had been since a youngster when the injuns run in on them down at frisbee the time of the big killing kink saw his mother and father both murdered and other things too which was impressive but not agreeable for a growing child he had formed a sort of antipathy for injuns at that time which he confessed he hadnt rightly been able to overcome now he allus found himself planning how to hand mr lo the double cross and avoid complications we worked down into south western arizony to a spot about thirtyfive miles back of fort walker and struck a prospect sort of a teaser it was but worth working on wed just got nicely started when kink comes into camp one day after taking a passiar around the butte for game and says the queerest thing happened to me just now kid well scream it at me i says sort of smelling trouble in the air oh it wasnt much says he i was just working down the big canyon over there after a deer when i seen two featherdusters coming up the trail i hid behind a rock watching em go past and im durned if my gun didnt go off accidental and plumb ruin one of em then i looks carefuller and seen it wasnt no featherduster at all nothing but an injun what about the other one thats the strangest part says kink pretty soon the other one turns and hits the backtrail like hed forgot something then i seen him drop off his horse too sudden and all togetherish im awful careless with this here gun he says i hate to see a man laugh from his tonsils forrard the way he did it aint humorous see here i says i aint the kind that finds fault with my pardner nor saying this to be captious and critical of your play but dont you know them cochises aint on the warpath them injuns has been on their reservation for five years peaceable domesticated and eating from the hand this means trouble my old man didnt have no war paint on him one day back at frisbee whispers kink and his voice sounded puckered up and dried and my mother wasnt so darned quarrelsome either then i says well them bodies has got to be hid or well have the tribe and the bluebellies from the fort a scouring these hills till a redbug couldnt hide to hell with em says kink ive done all im going to for em let the coyotes finish the job no siree i replies i dont blame you for having a prejudice agin savages but my parents is still robust and husky and i have an idea that theyd rather see me back on the ranch than glaring through the bars for life im going over to bury the meat off i went but when i slid down the gulch i only found one body tother had disappeared you can guess how much time i lost getting back to camp kink i says were a straddle of the raggedest proposition in this country one of your dusters at this moment is jamming his cayuse through the horizon between here and the post pretty soon things is going to bust loose bout tomorrer evening well be eating hogbosom on uncle sam well well says kink aint that a pity next time ill conquer my natural shyness and hold a postmortem with a rock there wont be no next time i reckon i says cause we cant make it over into mexico without being caught up theyll nail us sure seeing as were the only white men for twentyfive miles around id rather put up a good run than a bad stand anyhow says he and i allows furthermore theres going to be some hard trails to foller and a tolable disagreeable fight before i pleads not guilty to the colonel well both duck over into the santa now dont tell me what route youre going i interrupts cause i believe ill stay and bluff it through rather than sneak for it though neither proposition dont appeal to me i may get raised out before the draw but the percentage is just as strong agin your game as mine boy if i was backing your system says kink id shore copper this move and play her to lose you come on with me and well make it through mebbe no i says here i sticks i made up a packstrap out of my extry overhalls while he got grub together to start south through one hundred miles of the ruggedest and barrenest country that was ever left unfinished next noon i was parching some coffeebeans in the fryingpan when i heard hoofs down the gully back of me i never looked up when they come into the open nor when i heard a feller say halt hello there somebody yells you there at the fire i kept on shaking the skillet over the campfire whats the matter with him somebody said a man got off and walked up behind me see here brother he says tapping me on the shoulder this dont go i jumped clean over the fire dropped the pan and let out a deaf and dumb holler ee ah the men began to laugh it seemed to rile the little leftenant cut this out says he you can talk as well as i can and youre a going to tell us about this injun killin dont try any fake business or ill roast your little heels over that fire like yams i just acted the dummy wiggled my fingers and handed him the joyful gaze heliographing with my teeth as though i was glad to see visitors however i wondered if that runt would really give my chilblains a treat he looked like a west pointer and i didnt know but hed try to haze me well they klowtowed around there for an hour looking for clues but id hid all the signs of kink so finally they strapped me onto a horse and we hit back for the fort the little man tried all kinds of tricks to make me loosen on the way down but i just acted wounded innocence and eed and ahd at him till he let me alone when we rode up to the post he says to the colonel weve got the only man there is in the mountains back there sir but hes playing dumb i dont know what his game is dumb eh says the old man looking me over pretty keen well i guess well find his voice if hes got one he took me inside and speaking of examinations probably i didnt get one he kept looking at me like he wanted to place me but i give him the ee ah till everybody began to laugh they tried me with a pencil and paper but i balked laid my ears back and buckjumped that made the old man sore and he says lock him up lock him up ill make him talk if i have to skin him so i was dragged to the skookumhouse where i spent the night figuring out my finish i could feel it coming just as plain and i begun to see that when i did open up and prattle after kink was safe nobody wouldnt believe my little story i had sized the colonel up as a dead stringy old proposition too he was one of these bigchopped fellers with a mouth set moren half way up from his chin and little thin lips like the edge of a knife blade and just as full of blood face big and rusticfinished i says to myself bud it looks like you wouldnt be forced to prospect for a living any more this season if that old sport turns himself loose youre going to get life three times and a holdover next morning they tried every way to make me talk once in a while the old man looked at me puzzled and searching but i didnt know him from a sweatpad and just paid strict attention to being dumb it was mighty hard too i got so nervous my mouth simply ached to let out a cayoodle the words kept trying to crawl through my sesophagus and when i backed em up they slid down and stood around in groups hanging onto the straps gradually filling me with witful gems of thought the colonel talked to me serious and quiet like i had good ears and says my man you can understand every word i say im sure and what your object is in maintaining this ridiculous silence i dont know youre accused of a crime and it looks serious for you then he gazes at me queer and intent and says if you only knew how bad you are making your case youd make a clean breast of it come now lets get at the truth them thought jewels and wads of repartee was piling up in me fast like tailings from a groundsluice till i could feel myself getting bloated and pussy with langwidge but i thought no tomorrow kink ll be safe and then ill throw a jolt into this mans camp thatll go down in history theyll think some chinamans been thawing out a box of giant powder when i let out my roar i goes to the guardhouse again with a soldier at my back everything would have been all right if we hadnt run into a mule team they had been freighting from the railroad and as we left the barracks we ran afoul of four outfits three span to the wagon with the loads piled on till the teams was all lather and the wheels complainin to the gods trying to pass the corner of the barracks where there was a narrow opening between the buildings now a good muledriver is the littlest orneriest speck in the human line thats known to the microscope but when you get a poor one hed spoil one of them cholera germs you read about just by contact the leader of this bunch was worse than the worst strong on whiparm but surprising weak on judgment he tried to make the turn run plump into the corner of the building stopped backed swung and proceeded to get into grief the mules being hot and nervous he sent them all to the loco patch instanter they began to plunge and turn and back and snarl before you could say craps you lose them shavetails was giving the grandest exhibition of animal idiocy in the territory barring the teamster he follered their trail to the madhouse yanking the mouths out of them cruel and vicious now one mule can cause a heap of tribulation and six mules can break a mans heart but there wasnt no excuse for that driver to stand up on his hind legs close his eyes and throw thirty foot of lash into that plunging buckin whiteeyed mess when he did it all the little words inside of me began to foam and fizzle like sedlitz out they came biting in mouthfuls and streams and squirts backwards sideways and through my nose here you infernal halfspiled dogrobbing walloper i says you dont know enough to drive puddle ducks to a pond you quit heaving that quirt or ill harm you past healing he turned his head and grit out something through his teeth that stimulated my circulation i skipped over the wheels and put my left onto his neck fingering the keys on his blowpipe like a flute then i give him a toss and gathered up the lines say it was like the smell of greasepaint to an actor man for me to feel the ribbons again and them mules knew they had a chairman who savvied em too and had mule talk pat from soda to hock i just intimated things over them with that whip and talked to them like they was my own flesh and blood i starts at the worst words the english langwidge and the range had produced to date and got steadily and rapidly worse as long as i talked arizony may be slow in the matter of standing collars and ragtime but she leads the world in profanity without being swelled on myself ill say too that i once had moren a local reputation in that line having originated some quaint and feeling conceits which has won modest attention and this day i was certainly trained to the minute i addressed them brutes fast and earnest for five minutes steady and never crossed my trail or repeated a thought it must have been sacred and beautiful anyhow it was strong enough to soak into their pores so that they strung out straight as a chalkline then i lifted them into the collars and we rumbled past the building swung in front of the commissary door cramped and stopped with the wheelers on their haunches i backed up to the door square as a die i wiped the sweat out of my eyes and looked up into the grinning face of about fifty swatties realizing i was a mute and a prisoner i heard a voice say bring me that man there stood the colonel oozing out wrath at every pore i parted from that wagon hesitating and reluctant but two soldiers to each leg will bust any mans grip i lost some clothes too after we hit the ground but i needed the exercise the old man was alone in his office when they dragged me in and he sent my guards out so you found your voice did you he says yes sir i answers it came back unexpected regular miracle he drummed on the table for a long time and then says sort of immaterial and irreverent youre a pretty good mule puncher eh it aint for me to say im the best in the territory i says but im curious to meet the feller that claims the title he continues it reminds me of an exhibition i saw once back in new mexico long time ago at the little flatwater canyon maybe youve heard tell of the fight there when the apaches were up yes well i happened to be in that scrimmage i was detailed with ten men to convoy a wagon train through to fort lewis we had no trouble till we came to the end of that canyon just where she breaks out onto the flats there we got it they were hidden up on the ridges we lost two men and one wagon before we could get out onto the prairie i got touched up in the neck first clatter and was bleeding pretty badly still i hung to my horse and we stood em off till the teams made it out of the gulch but just as we came out my horse fell and threw me broke his leg i yelled to the boys go on for gods sake go on any delay there meant loss of the whole outfit besides the boys had more than they could manage injuns on three sides we had a young texan driving the last wagon when i went down he swung those six mules of his and came back up that trail into the gut where the bullets snapped like grasshoppers it was the prettiest bit of driving i ever saw not to mention nerve he whirled the outfit between me and the bluff on two wheels yelling climb on climb on we aint going to stay long i was just able to make it onto the seat in the turn they dropped one of his wheelers he ran out on the tongue and cut the brute loose we went rattling down the gulch behind five mules all the time there came out of that mans lungs the fiercest stream of profanity my ears ever burned under i was pretty sick for a few weeks so i never got a chance to thank that teamster he certainly knew the mind of an army mule though his name was let me see wiggins yes wiggins oh no it wasnt i breaks in foolish it was joyce then i stopped and felt like a kid for the colonel comes up and shuts the circulation out of both my hands i wasnt sure of you bill he says till i saw you preside over those mules out there and heard your speech then i recognized the gift he laughed like a boy still making free with my hands im darn glad to see you bill joyce now then he says tell me all about this killing up in the hills and i done so after i finished he never said anything for a long time just drummed the desk again and looked thoughtful its too bad you didnt speak out bill when you first came in now youve showed everybody that you can talk just a little anyhow and he smiles and they all think youre the man caused the trouble i dont see but that youve got to stand trial i wish i could help you bill but see here colonel i says i couldnt squeal on kink were pardners i just had to give him a chance to cut i played dumb cause i knew if i talked at all being simple and guileless you all would twist me up and have the whole thing in a jiffy that man give me the last drop of water in his canteen on the mojave and him with his own tongue swelled clean out of his mouth too when we was snowed in up in the bitter roots with me snowblind and starving he crawled from sheepshorn clean to millers snow twelve foot deep too and nary a snowshoe in miles but he brought the outfit in to where i was lyin bout gone in he lost some fingers and more toes wallering through them mountain drifts that day but he never laid down till he brought the boys back colonel weve slept on the same blanket weve et the same grub weve made and lost together and i had to give him a show thats all im into this here trouble now tell me how im going to get out what would you do he turns to the open window and says partners are partners thats my horse out there at that post if i were you id run like hell that was the willingest horse i ever rode and i hated to sell him but he was tolable used up when i got across the line the colonel and the horsethief those marks on my arm oh i got em playin horsethief yes playin i wasnt a real one you know well i spose it was sort of a queer game came near bein my last too and if black hawk hadnt been the best horse in texas the old colonel wouldve killed me sure he chased me six miles as it was me with one arm full of his buckshot and anxious to explain and him strainin to get in range again and not wishin any further particulars that was way back in the sixties when i was as wild a lad as ever straddled a pony you see five of us had gone over into the crow nation to race horses with the indians and it was on the way back that the old man and the bullet holes figger in the story at the beginnin it was jim barretts plan and it had jest enough risk and devilment in it to suit a harumscarum young feller like me so we got five of the boys who had good horses lumped together all of our money and rode out to invade the reservation you know how an indian loves to run horses well the crows had a good deal of money then and our scheme was to go over there get up a big race back our horses with all we had and take down the wealth takin chances dont you believe it thats where the beauty of jims plan commenced to sort of shine through you see as soon as the money was up and the horses started every indian would be watchin the race and yellin at the nags then in the confusion our boys was to grab the whole pot indians money and ours too and wed make our get away across the river back into texas we figured that we could get a few minutes start of em and with the horses we had under us there wasnt much danger of their gettin in range before we crossed back to where they couldnt follow us well sir i never see anything work out like that scheme did them crows was dead anxious to run their ponies and seemed skeered that we wouldnt let em get all their money up as we was eatin supper the night before the race donnelly says boys im sore that we didnt have more coin if wed worked em right theyd a give us odds we could a got five to three anyhow and maybe more they shore have got a heap of confidence in them skates of theirn says kink martin i never see anybody so anxious to play a race in my life if it wasnt all planned out the way it is id like to stick and see which hoss is the best id back black hawk agin any hunk of meat in the territory with the kid here in the saddle theyd ribbed it up for me to ride martins mare black hawk while a little feller named hollis rode his own horse donnellys part was to stay in the saddle and keep the other horses close to barrett and martin they was to stick next to the money and one of em do the bearin off of the booty while the other made the protection play we hoped in the excitement to get off without harmin any of uncle sams pets but all three of the boys had been with the rangers and i knew if it came to a show down they wouldnt hesitate to pot one or two in gittin away we rode out from camp the next mornin to where wed staked out a mile track on the prairie and it seemed as if the whole crow nation was there and nary a white but us five theyd entered two pretty goodlookin horses and had their jockeys stripped down to breechclouts while hollis and me wore our whole outfits on our backs as we didnt exactly figger on dressin after the race leastways not on that side of the river just before we lined up jim says now you all ride like and when you git to the far turn well let the guns loose and stampede the crowd then jest leave the track and make a break fer the river everybody fer himself well all meet at them cottonwoods on the other side so we can stand em off if they try to swim across after us that would have been a sure enough hot race if we had run it out for we all four got as pretty a start as i ever see and went down the line all together with abangin of hoofs and indian yells ringin in our ears i had begun to work black hawk out of the bunch to get a clear start across the prairie at the turn when i heard the guns begin snappin like popcorn theyve started already yelled hollis and we turned the rearin horses toward the river three miles away leavin them two savages tearin down the track like mad i glanced back as i turned but instead of seein the boys in the midst of a decent retreat the crowd was swarmin after em like a nest of angry hornets while donnelly with his reins between his teeth was blazin away at three reds who were right at barretts heels as he ran for his horse martin was lashin his jumpin cayuse away from the mob which sputtered and spit angry shots after him bucks were runnin here and there and hastily mountin their ponies while an angry roar came to me punctuated by the poppin of the guns hollis and i reached the river and swam it half a mile ahead of the others and their yellin bunch of trailers so we were able to protect em in their crossin i could see from their actions that bennett and martin was both hurt and i judged the deal hadnt panned out exactly accordin to specifications the crows didnt attempt to cross in the teeth of our fire however being satisfied with what theyd done and the horses safely brought our three comrades drippin up the bank to where we lay takin potshots at every bunch of feathers that approached the opposite bank we got barretts arm into a sling and as martins hurt wasnt serious we lost no time in gettin away they simply beat us to it complained barrett as we rode south you all had jest started when young long hair grabs the sack and ducks through the crowd and the whole bunch turns loose on us at once we wasnt expectin anything so early in the game and they winged me the first clatter i thought sure it was oft with me when i got this bullet in the shoulder but i used the gun in my left hand and broke for the nearest pony they got me too before i saw what was up added martin but i tore out of there like a jackrabbit it was all done so cussed quick that the first thing i knew id straddled my horse and was makin tracks whod a thought them durned indians was dishonest enough fer a trick like that then donnelly spoke up and says boys as fur as the coin goes were out an injured we jest made a mexican standoff lost our money but saved our lives and mighty lucky at that from appearances what i want to know now is how were all goin to get home clean across the state of texas without a dollar in the outfit and no assets but our guns and the nags that was a sure tough proposition and we had left it teetotally out of calculations wed bet every bean on that race not seein how we could lose in them days there wasnt a railroad in that section ranches were scatterin and people werent givin pink teas to every stranger that rode up especially when they were as hardlookin as we were weve got to eat and sos the horses says hollis but no rancher is goin to welcome with open arms as disreputable an outfit as we are two men shot up and the rest of us without beddin grub money or explanations thems what we need explanations i dont exactly see how were goin to explain our fix to the honest haydiggers either everybodyll think some sheriff is after us and two to one theyll put some officer on our trail and well have more trouble i believe ive had all i want for awhile ill tell you how well work it i says one of usll be the sheriff of guadalupe county back home with three deputies bringin back a prisoner that weve chased across the state well ride up to a ranch an demand lodgin for ourselves and prisoner in the name of the state of texas and say that well pay with vouchers on the county in the morning no sir not fer me says martin im not goin in fer forgery its all right to practice a little mild deception on our red brothers as we figgered on doing but im not goin to try to flimflam the state of texas our troubles d only be startin if we began that game your plans all right kid says bennett to me you be the terrible desperado that im bringin home after a bloody fight where you wounded martin and me and most escaped youll have evry ranchers wife givin you flowers and weepin over your youth and kissin you goodbye in the mornin when were ready to go and im about to fix up the vouchers for our host you break away and ride like the devil well all tear off a few shots and foller in a hurry leavin the farmer hopin that the villain is recaptured and the girls tearfully prayin that the gallunt and misguided youth escapes it seemed to be about our only resort as the country was full of bad men and we were liable to get turned down cold if we didnt have some story so we decided to try it on we rode up to a ranch bout dark that night me between the others with my hands tied behind me and jim called the owner out i want a nights lodgin fer my deputies and our prisoner he says im the sheriff of guadalupe county and ill fix up the bill in the mornin come in come in the feller says callin a man for the horses glad to accommodate you whos your prisoner thats texas charlie that robbed the bank of euclid singlehanded answers jim he give us a long run clean across the state but we got him jest as he was settin over into the indian territory fought like a tiger it worked fine the feller whose name was morgan give us a good layout for the night and a bully breakfast next morning that desperado game was simply great the other fellers attended to the horses and i jest sat around lookin vicious and had my grub brought to me while the women acted sorrowful and fed me pie and watermelon pickles when we was ready to leave next morning jim says now mr morgan ill fix up them vouchers with you and givin me the wink i let out a yell and jabbin the spurs into black hawk we cleared the fence and was off like a puff of dust with the rest of em shootin and screamin after me like mad say it was lovely and when the boys overtook me out of sight of the house morgan would have been astonished to see the sheriff his posse and the terrible desperado doubled up in their saddles laughin fit to bust well sir we never had a hitch in the proceedings for five days and i was gettin to feel a sort of pride in my record as a bankrobber forger horsethief and murderer accordin to the way bennett presented it he certainly was the boss liar of the range he had a story framed up that painted me as the bloodiest young tough the lone star had ever produced and it never failed to get me all the attention there was in the house one night we came to the best lookin place wed seen and in answer to jims summons out walked an old man followed by two of the prettiest girls i ever saw who joined their father in invitin us in glad to be of assistance to you mr sheriff he said my name is purdy sir colonel purdy as you may have heard in the mexican war special mention three times for distinguished conduct these are my daughters sir annabel and marie as we went in he continued you say you had a hard time gettin your prisoner he looks young for a criminal whats he wanted for somehow when i saw those girls blushin and bowin behind their father i didnt care to have my crimes made out any blackern necessary and i tried to give jim the highsign to let me off easy just make it forgery or arson but he was lookin at the ladies and evidently believin in the strength of a good impression he said well yes hes young but they never was a old man with half his crimes hes wanted for a good many things in different places but i went after him for horsestealin and murder killed a rancher and his little daughter then set fire to the house and ran off a bunch o stock oh oh how dreadful shuddered the girls backin off with horrified glances at me i tried to get near jim to step on his foot but the old man was glarin at me somethin awful come to observe him closely he has a depraved face says he he looks the thorough criminal in every feature dead to every decent impulse i spose i could have showed him a live impulse that would have surprised him about then in those days i was considered a pretty handsome feller too and i knew i had jim beat before the draw on looks but he continues makin matters worse yes and hes desperate too one of the worst i ever see we had an awful fight with him up here on the line of the territory he shot martin and me before we got him ye see i wanted to take him alive and so i took chances on gettin hurt thank ye miss my arm does ache considerable of course if youd jest as soon dress it oh no im no bravern anybody else i guess nice of ye to say so anyhow and he went grinnin out into the kitchen with the girls to fix up his arm the old man insisted on havin my feet bound together and me fastened to a chair and said yes yes i know you can watch him but youre in my house now and i feel a share of the responsibility upon me ive had experience with desperate characters and im goin to be sure that this young reprobate dont escape his just punishment are you sure you dont need more help gettin him home ill go with you if thank ye interrupted hollis weve chased the scoundrel four hundred miles and i reckon now weve got him we can keep him at supper jim with his arm in a new sling sat between the two girls who cooed over him and took turns feedin him till it made me sick the old man had a nigger move my chair up to the foot of the table and bring me a plate of coarse grub after they all finished eatin he had tied my ankles to the lower rung of the chair himself and when i says to the nigger those cords have plum stopped my circulation just ease em up a little he went straight up dont you touch them knots sam he roared i know how to secure a man and dont you try any of your games in my house either you young fiend id never forgive myself if you escaped i ate everything i could reach which wasnt much and when i asked for the butter he glared at me and said butters too good for horsethieves eat whats before you every time id catch the eye of one of the girls and kind of grin and look enticing shed shiver and tell jim that the marks of my depravity stood out on my face like warts on a toad jim and the boys would all grin like idiots and invent a new crime for me on the square if id worked nights from the age of three i couldnt have done half they blamed me for they put it to the old man so strong that when he turned in he chained me to sam the crosseyed nigger that stood behind me at supper and made us sleep on the floor i told sam that i cut a mans throat once because he snored and that nigger never closed an eye all night i was tryin to get even with somebody after breakfast when it came time to leave donnelly untied my feet and led me out into the yard where the girls were hangin around the colonel and jim who was preparin to settle up as we rode up the evening before i had noticed that we turned in from the road through a lane and that the fence was too high to jump so when i threw my leg over black hawk i hit donnelly a swat in the neck and as he did a stagefall i swept through the gate and down the lane the old man cut the halter off one of his mexican warwhoops and broke through the house on the run appearin at the front door with his shotgun just as i checked up to make the turn onto the main road as i swung around doubled over the horses neck he let drive with his old blunderbuss and i caught two buckshot in my right arm where you see them marks i had sense enough to hang on and ride for my life because i knew the old fireeater would reckon it a pleasure to put an end to such a wretch as me if he got half a chance i heard him howl come on boys well get him yet and over my shoulder i saw him jump one of his loose horses standin in the yard and come tearin down the lane ahead of the befuddled sheriff and posse his white hair streamin and the shotgun wavin aloft as though chargin an army of greasers at the head of his regiment from the way he drew away from the boys i wouldnt have placed any money that he was wrong either ive always wondered how the old man ever got through that war with only three recommendations to the government he certainly kept good horses too for in five minutes wed left the posse behind and i saw him madly urgin his horse into range reloadin as he came as i threw the quirt into the mare with my good arm i allowed id had about all the horsestealin i wanted for a while the old devil finally saw he was losin ground in spite of his best efforts and let me have both barrels i heard the shot patter on the hard road behind me and hoped hed quit and go home but im blamed if he didnt chase me five miles further before turnin back in hopes id cast a shoe or something would happen to me i believe i was on the only horse in texas that could have outrun the colonel and his that mornin about noon i stopped at a blacksmiths shop half dead with pain and had my arm dressed and a big jolt of whiskey as the posse rode up to me sittin in the sun by the lathered flanks of my horse and nursin my arm jim yells out here he is surround him boys youre our prisoner no im blamed if i am i says youll have to get another desperado after this im the sheriff the thaw at sliscos the storm broke at salmon lake and we ran for sliscos roadhouse it whipped out from the mountains all tore into strips coming through the sawteeth lashing us off the glare ice and driving us up against the river banks among the willows cold well some my bottle of painkiller froze slushy like lemon punch theres nothing like a warm shack with a cache full of grub when the peaks smoke and the black snowclouds roar down the gulch other mushers were ahead of us at the roadhouse freighters from kougarok an outfit from teller going after booze the mailcarrier and who do you reckon annie black first time i had seen her since she was run out of dawson for claim jumping her and me hadnt been essential to one another since i won that suit over a water right on eldorado hello annie says i clawing the ice out of my whiskers finding plenty of claims down here to relocate shut up you perjured pup says she full of disappointing affabilities i dont want any dealings with a lying thieving hypocrite like you billy joyce annie lacks the sporting instinct she aint got the disposition for cupracing never knew her to win a case and yet shes the instigatress of more emotional activities than all the marked cards and home distilled liquor in alaska see here says i a prairie dog and a rattler can hole up together but humans has got to be congenial so seein as were all stuck to live in the same room till this blizzard blizzes out lets forget our troubles im as game a hibernian as the next but i dont hibernate till theres a blaze of mutual respect going blaze away says she though i leave it to the crowd if you dont look and act like a liar and a grave robber her speech is sure full of artless hostilities aint ever seen her lord i thought everybody knew annie black she drifted into camp one day tall slabsided ornery to the view and raising fifty or upwards disposition uncertain as frozen dynamite her ground plans and elevations looked like she was laid out for a man but the specifications hadnt been follered we aint consumed by curiosity regarding the etymology of every stranger that drifts in and as long as he totes his own pack does his assessments and writes his location notices proper it goes leastways it went till she hit town in a month she had the brotherly love of that camp gritting its teeth and throwing back twisters twas all legitimate too and there never was a pennyweight of scandal connected with her name no sir fars conduct goes shes always been the shinin female example of this country but them qualities let her out first move was to jump bat ruggless town lot he had four courses of logs laid for a cabin when scotty bell came in from the hills with in coarse gold that hed rocked out of a prospect shaft on bats mooses creek claim naturally bat made general proclamation of thirst and our town kinder dozed violently into a joyful three days reverie during which period of coma the recording time on bats lot ran out he returns from his hootchhunt to complete the shack and finds annie overseeing some siwashes put a pole roof on it of course he promotes a racewar immediate playing the white open and the red to lose so to speak when she up an spanks his face addressing expurgated motherly cusswords at him like hed been a bad boy and swallered his spoon or dug an eye out of the kitten bat realizes hes against a strange system and draws out of the game a week later she jumps no gold bottom because donnelly stuck a pick in his foot and couldnt stay to finish the assessment i cant throw her off or shoot her up says he or even cuss at her like i want to cause shes a lady and it appeared like thatd been her graft ever since presumin on her sex to make disturbances in six months we hated her like pizen there wasnt a stampede in a hundred miles where her bloomers wasnt leading for she had the endurance of a moose and between excitements she prospected for trouble in the manner of relocations ive heard of fellers speakin disrespectful to her and then wandering around dazed and loco after shed got through painting word pictures of em it goes without saying she was generally popular and petted and when the commissioner invited her to duck out down the river the community sighed turned over and had a peaceful rest first one since shed come in i hadnt seen her from that time till i blowed into sliscos on the bosom of this forty mile forty below blizzard setting around the fire that night i found that shed just lost another of her famous lawsuits claimed she owned a fraction longside of no buster creek and that the lund boys had changed their stakes so as to take in her ground during the winter theyd opened up a hundred and fifty feet of awful rich pay right next to her line and shed raised the devil injunctions hearings and appeals and now she was coming back swearing shed been jobbed the judge had been bought and the jury corrupted its the richest strike in the district says she theyve rocked out since snow flew and theres buckets of dirt on the dump they can bribe and bulldoze a decision through this court but ill have that fraction yet the robbers robbers be cussed speaks up the mail man youre the cause of the trouble yourself if you dont get a square deal its your own fault always looking for technicalities in the mining laws its been your game from the start to take advantage of your skirts what there is of em and jump jump jump nobody believes half you say youre a natural disturber and if you was a man youd have been hung long ago ive heard her oral formations and i looked for his epidermis to shrivel when she got her replications focused she just soared up and busted look out for the stick thinks i woman am i she says musical as a bum gramophone under the slow bell i take advantage of my skirts do i who are you you mangy malamoot to criticise a lady im more of a man than you you tinhorn i want no favours i do a mans work i live a mans life i am a man and im proud of it but you nomes full of your kind you need a woman to support you youre a protoplasm a polyp those swedes changed their stakes to cover my fraction i know it they know it and if it wasnt alaska god would know it but he wont be in again till spring and then the seasons only three months long ive worked like a man suffered like a man why dont ye lose like a man says he i will and ill fight like one too says she while her eyes burned like faggots theyve torn away the reward of years of work and agony and they forget i can hate like a man she was stretched up to high c where her voice drowned the howl of the storm and her seamed old face was a sight ive seen mild shrinky mouseshy women roused to hells own fury and i felt that night that here was a bad enemy for the swedes of buster creek she stopped listening whats that theres some one at the door nonsense says one of the freighters you do so much knocking you can hear the echo theres some one at that door says she if there was theyd come in says joe couldnt be this late in this storm i adds she came from behind the stove and we let her go to the door alone nobody ever seemed to do any favours for annie black shell be seein things next says joe winking whatd i tell you for gods sake close it youll freeze us annie opened the door and was hid to the waist in a cloud of steam that rolled in out of the blackness she peered out for a minute stooped and tugged at something in the dark i was at her side in a jump and we dragged him in snowcovered and senseless quick brandy says she slashing at his stiff mukluks joe bring in a tub of snow her voice was steel sharp well im danged says the mail man its only an injun you neednt go crazy like he was a white oh you fool says annie cant you see esquimaux dont travel alone theres white men behind and god help them if we dont bring him to she knew more about rescustications than us and we did what she said till at last he came out of it groaning just plumb wore out and numb talk to him joe you savvy their noise says i the poor devil showed his excitement dead as he was theres two men on the big cutoff joe translates lost on the portage there was only one robe between em so they rolled up in it and the boy came on in the dark says they cant last till morning that lets them out says the mail carrier too bad we cant reach them tonight what snaps annie reach em huh i said you were a jellyfish hurry up and get your things on boys have a little sense says joe you surely aint a darn fool out in this storm dark as the inside of a cow blowin forty mile and the quick froze cant be done i wonder who they are he kowtowed some more and at the answer of the chattering savage we looked at annie him called lund shivered the siwash i never see anybody harder hit than her i love a scrap but i thinks billy shes having a stiffer fight than you ever associated with finally she says kind of slow and quiet who knows where the cutoff starts nobody answers and up speaks the u s man again youve got your nerve to ask a man out on such a night if there was one here i wouldnt have to ask him theres people freezing within five miles of here and you hug the stove saying its stormy and well get cold of course it is if it wasnt stormy theyd be here too and its so cold youll probably freeze whats that got to do with it ever have your mother talk to you about duty thank heaven i travelled that portage once and i can find it again if somebody will go with me twas a blush raising talk but nobody upset any furniture getting dressed she continues so im the woman of this crowd and i hide behind my skirts mr mail man show what a glorious creature you are throw yourself get up and stretch and roar oh you barnyard bantam has it had its pap tonight ive a grand commercial enterprise ill take all of your bust measurements and send out to the states for a line of corsets aint there half a man among you she continued in this vein pollutin the air and having no means of defence we found ourselves follerin her out into a yelling storm that beat and roared over us like waves of flame swede luck had guided their shaft onto the richest paystreak in seven districts and swede luck now led us to the lund boys curled up in the drifted snow beside their dogs but it was the level head and cool judgment of a woman that steered us home in the grey whirl of the dawn during the deathly weariness of that night i saw past the calloused hide of that woman and sighted the splendid courage cached away beneath her bitter oratory and hosstyle syllogisms theres a story there thinks i an maybe a man moved in it though i cant imagine her softened by much affection it pleased some guy to state that womans the cause of all our troubles but i figger theyre like whisky all good though some a heap bettern others of course and when a frail little ninety pound woman gets to bucking and acting bad theres generally a two hundred pound man hid out in the brush that put the burr under the saddle during the next three days she dressed the wounds of them scowweegians and nursed them as tender as a mother the wind hadnt died away till along came the flying dutchman from dugans twenty miles up floatin on the skirts of the blizzard hello fellers howdy annie whats the matter here says he we had a woman at dugans too purty as a picture different from the nome bunch real sort of a lady who is she says i an whats she doin out here on the trail dunno but shes all right come clean from dawson with a dog team says shes looking for her mother i heard a pan clatter on the floor where annie was washing dishes and her face went a sickly grey she leaned across gripping the table and straining to ask something but the words wouldnt come while dutch continues somethin strange about it i think she says her mas over in the golden gate district workin a rich mine of course we all laughed at her and said there wasnt a woman in the whole layout ceptin some folks might misconstrue annie here into a kind of a female she stuck to it though much as to say we was liars shes comin on whats the matter annie you aint sore at me effeminatin you by the gentle name of female are you she had come to him and gripped his shoulder till her long bony fingers buried themselves in his mackinaw her mouth was twitching and she hadnt got shed of that firstaidtotheinjured look what name what name dutch what name she shook him like a rat bradshaw but you neednt run your nails through and clinch em ow lego my white meat you act like she was your long lost baby what dye think of that idea fellers aint that a pleasin conceit annie black and a baby ha ha thats a hit annie and a daughter a cowthief and a callalily dutch says i you aint agoin to make it through to lanes landing if you dont pull your freight and i drags the darn fool out and starts him off when i came in she was huddled onto a goods box shaking and sobbing like any woman while the boys sat around and champed their bits and stomped take me away billy she says for gods sake take me away before she sees me she slid down to the floor and cried something awful gents that was sure the real distress nothing soft and sloppy but hard wrenchy deep ones like you hear at a melodrayma twas only back in that i seen an awful crying match though both of the ladies had been drinking so i felt like i was useder to emotion than the balance of the boys and it was up to me to take a holt madam says i and somehow the word didnt seem out of place any more madam why do you want to avoid this party take me away she says its my daughter shes going to find me this way all rough and immodest and made fun of but thats the worst you can say isnt it im a square woman you know i am dont you boys and she looked at us fierce and pleadin sure says joe well boost you with the girl all right she thinks her fathers dead but he isnt he ran away with a show woman a year after we were married i never told her about it and ive tried to make a little lady of her we found out afterwards that she had put the girl in a boardingschool but couldnt seem to make enough for both of them and when the klondyke was struck thought she saw a chance she came north insulted by deck hands and laughed at by the officers at skagway she nursed a man through typhoid and when he could walk he robbed her the mounted police took everything else she had and mocked at her your kind always has money they said thats how it had been everywhere and thats why she was so hard and bitter shed worked and fought like a man but shed suffered like a woman ive lied and starved and stolen for her said annie to make her think i was doing well she said she was coming in to me but i knew winter would catch her at dawson and i thought i could head her off by spring now shes here but men as your mothers loved you save me from my little girl she buried her face and when i looked at the boys tears stood in joe sliscos eyes and the others breathed hard ole lund him that was froze worst about the hands spoke up someboady tak de corner dat blanket an blow may nose then we heard voices outside hello in there annie stood up clutching at her throat and stepped behind the corner of the bunks as the door opened framing the prettiest picture this old range rider ever saw twas a girl glowing pink and red where the cold had kissed her cheeks with yellow curlicues of hair wandering out under her yarn cap her little foxtrimmed parka quit at the knees showing the daintiest pair of i cant say it anyhow they wasnt they just looked like em only nicer she stood blinking at us coming from the bright light outside as cute as a new faro box then can you tell me where mrs bradshaw lives shes somewhere in this district im her daughter come all the way from the states to see her when she smiled i could hear the heartstrings of those ragged whiskered frostbit mushers bustin like banjo strings you know her dont you she says turning to me know her miss well i should snort there aint a prospector on the range that aint proud and honoured to call her a friend leastways if there is ill bust his block and i cast the bad eye on the boys to wise em up aint i right joe betcher dam life says joe sort of overstepping the conventions then tell me where her claim is its quite rich and you must know it says she appealing to him up against it say i seen the whites of his eyes show like he was drownding and he grinned joyful as a man kicked in the stummick er er i just bought in here and aint acquainted much says he have a drink and in his confusions he sets out the bottle of alkalies that he dignifies by the alias of booze then he continues with reglar human intelligence bill here he can tell you where the ground is and the whelp indicates me lord knows my finish but for ole lund he sits up in his bunk swaddled in annie blacks bandages and through slits between his frost bites he moults the follering rhetoric aye tole you vere de claim iss she own de nomber twenty fraction on buster creek longside may and may broder shes dam good fraction too i consider that a blamed white stunt for swedes paying for their lives with the mine they swindled her out of anyhow it knocked us galleywest id formulated a swell climax involving the discovery of the mother when the mail man spoke up him that had been her particular abomination a queer kind of a break in his voice come out of that mrs bradshaw moved out into the light and if im any judge the joy that showed in her face rubbed away the bitterness of the past years with an aching little cry the girl ran to her and hid in her arms like a quail we menfolks got accumulated up into a dark corner where we shook hands and swore soft and insincere and let our throats hurt for all the world like it was christmas or wed got mail from home bitter root billings arbiter billings rode in from the junction about dusk and ate his supper in silence hed been east for sixty days and although there lurked about him the hint of unwonted ventures etiquette forbade its mention you see in our country that which a man gives voluntarily is ofttimes later dissected in smoky bunkhouses or roughly handled round flickering camp fires but the privacies he guards are inviolate curiosity isnt exactly a lost art but its practice isnt popular nor hygenic later i found him meditatively whittling out on the porch and as the moment seemed propitious i inquired adroitly did you have a good time in chicago bitter root bully said he relapsing into weighty absorption whatd you do i inquired with almost the certainty of appearing insistent dont you never read the papers he inquired with such evident compassion that kink martin and the other boys snickered this from bitter root who scorns literature outside of the arkansas printing as he terms the illustrations guess ill have to show you my press notices and from a hip pocket he produced a fat bundle of clippings in a rubber band these he displayed jealously and i stared agape for they were front pages of great metropolitan dailies marred with red and black scare heads in which i glimpsed the words billings of montana bitter root on arbitration a lochinvar out of the west and other things as puzzling press notices echoed kink scornfully wouldnt that rope ye he talks like big ike that went with the wild west show when a puncher gets so lazy he cant earn a livin by the sweat of his pony he grows his hair goes on the stage bustin glass balls with shot catridges and talks about press notices lets see em billings you pinch em as close to your stummick as though you held cards in a strange poker game well i have set in a strange game amongst aliens said billings disregarding the request and ive held the high cards also ive drawed out with honours ive sailed the medium high seas with mutiny in the stokehold ive changed the laws of labour politics and municipal economies i went out of gods country right into the heart of the decayin east and by the application of a runnin noose in a hemp rope i strangled oppression and put eight thousand men to work he paused ponderously im an arbitrator the deuce you are indignantly cried reddy the cook who says so reddy isnt up in syntax and his unreasoning loyalty to billings is an established fact of such standing that his remarks afford no conjecture yes ive cut into the nations peril and the cryin evil good and strong walkin out from the stinks of the union stock yards of chicago into the limelight of publicity via the drunk and disorderly route you see i got those ten carloads of steers into the city all right but i was so blame busy splatterin through the trackedup wastes of the cow pens an inhalin the sewer gas of the west side that i never got to see a newspaper if id a read one heres what id a found namely the greatest stubbornest riotinest strike ever known which means a heap for chicago she being the wetnurse of labour trouble the whole river front was tied up nary a steamer had whistled inside the sixmile crib for two weeks and eight thousand men was out there was holdups and bloodsheddin and picketin which last is an alias for assault with intents and altogether it was a prime place for a cowman on a quiet vacation just homelike and natural it was at this point that i enters bustin out of the smoke of the stock yards all sweet and beautiful like the gentle heeroine in the play as she walks through the curtains at the back of the stage now you know theres a heap of difference between the stock yards and chicago its just like coming from arkansas over into the united states well soon as i sold the stock i hit for the lake front and began to ground sluice the coal dust off of my palate i was busy working my booze hydraulic when i see an arid appearin pilgrim longside lookin thirsty as an alkali flat get in says i and the way he obeyed orders looked like hed had military training i felt sort of drawed to him from the way he handled his licker took it straight and runnin over then sopped his hands on the bar and smelled of his fingers he seemed to just soak it up both ways reglar human blotter you lap it up like a man says i like a cowman full growed ever been west nope says he born here well im a stranger says i out absorbin such beauties of architecture and free lunch as offers along the line if i aint keepin you up id be glad of your company im your assistant lunch buster says he and in the course of things he further explained that he was a tugboat fireman out on a strike givin me the follerin information about the tieup it all come up over a dose of dyspepsia back up interrupted kink squirming are you plumb bug get together youre certainly the raving kid ye must have stone bruised your heel and got concession of the brain yes sir indigestion billings continued old man badrich of the badrich transportation company has it terrible it lands on his solar every morning about nine oclock gettin worse steady and reaches perihelion along about eleven he can tell the time of day by taste one morning when his mouth felt like about tenfortyfive in comes a committee from firemen engineers local no with a demand for more wages proddin him with the intimations that if he didnt ante theyd tie up all his boats i spose a teaspoonful of bakin soda assimilated internally around the environments of his appendix would have spared the strike and cheated me out of bein a hero as the poet might have said upon such slender pegs is this our greatness hung oh gawd exclaimed mulling piously anyhow the bitterness in the old mans inner tubes showed in the bile of his answer and he told em if they wanted more money hed give em a chance to earn it they could work nights as well as days he intimated further that theyd ought to be satisfied with their wages as theyd undoubtedly foller the same line of business in the next world and wouldnt get a cent for feedin the fires neither next mornin the strike was called and the guy that breathed treachery and walkouts was one oily heegan further submerged under the titles of president of the federation of fresh water firemen also chairman of the united waterfront workmen which last takes in everything doin business along the river except the wharfrats and typhoid germs and its with the disreputableness of this party that i infected myself to the detriment of labour and the triumph of the law d ohara heegan is an able man and inside of a week hed spread the strike till it was the cleanest dirtiest tieup ever known the hospitals and morgues was full of nonunion men but the river was empty all right yes he had a persuadin method of arbitration quite convincing to the most calloused involving the layin on of the lead pipe things got to be pretty fierce byeandbye for they had the police buffaloed and disturbances got plentyer than the casualties at a butchers picnic the strikers got hungry too finally because the principles of unionism is like a rash on your mechanic skin deep inside his gastrics works three shifts a day even if his outsides is idle and steaming with socialism oily fed em dray loads of eloquence but it didnt seem to be real fillin theyd leave the lectures and rob a bakery he was a wonder though just sat in his office and kept the ship owners waitin in line swearin bitter and refined cusswords about ignorant fiend and cussed pedagogue which last for kinks enlightenment means a kind of hebrew meetinhouse these here details my new friend give me ending with a eulogy on oily heegan the idol of the idle if he says starve we starve says he and if he says work we work see oh hes the goods he is lets go down by the river mebbe well see him so me and murdock hiked down water street where they keep mosquito netting over the bar fixtures and spit at the stove we found him a big mouthed shifty kind of man bout as cynical lookin in the face as a black bass and full of wind as a toad fish i exchanged drinks for principles of socialism and doin so happened to display my roll murdock slipped away and made talk with a friend then when heegan had left he steers me out the back way into an alley short cut says he to another and a better place i follers through a back room then as i steps out the door im grabbed by this new friend while murdock bathes my head with a gaspipe billy one of the regulation strike promotin kind like they use for decoyin members into the glorious ranks of labour i saw a burning of rome that was a dream and whole cloudbursts of shootin stars but i yanked mr enthusiastic stranger away from my surcingle and throwed him agin the wall in the shuffle murdock shifts my ballasts though and steams up the alley with my greenbacks convoyed by his friend wowow says i givin the distress signal so that the windows rattled and reachin for my holster id a got them both only the gun caught in my suspender you see not anticipatin any live bird shoot id put it inside my pantsband under my vest for appearances a fortyfive is like fresh air to a drownding man generally has to be drawed in haste and neither one shouldnt be mislaid i got her out at last and blazed away just a second after they dodged around the comer then i hit the trail after em lettin go a few skyshots and gettin a ghostdance holler off my stummick that had been troubling me the wallop on the head made me dizzy though and i zigzagged awful tackin out of the alley right into a policeman whee says i in joy for he had murdock safe by the bits buckin considerable stan aside and lemme lectrocute im says i i throwed the gun on him and the crowd dogged it into all the doorways and windows convenient but i was so weakminded in the knees i stumbled over the curb and fell down next thing i knew we was all bouncin over the cobblestones in a patrol wagon well in the morning i told my story to the judge plain and unvarnished then murdock takes the stand and busts into song claiming that he was comin through the alley toward clark street when i staggered out back of a saloon and commenced to shoot at him he saw i was drunk and fanned out me shootin at him with every jump he had proof he said and he called for the president of his union mr heegan at the name all the loafers and stewbums in the courtroom stomped and said hear hear while up steps this napoleon of the hoboes sure he knew mr murdock had known him for years and he was perfectly reliable and honest as to his robbing me it was preposterous because he himself was at the other end of the alley and saw the whole thing just as mr murdock related it i jumps up youre a liar heegan i was buyin booze for the two of you but a policeman nailed me chokin off my rhetorics mr heegan leans over and whispers to the judge while i got chilblains along my spine look here kind judge says i real winning and genteel this man is so good at explainin things away ask him to talk off this bump over my ear i surely didnt get a buggy spoke and laminate myself on the nut thatll do says the judge mr clerk ten dollars and costs charge drunk and disorderly next hold on there says i ignorant of the involutions of justice i guess ive got the bulge on you this time they beat you to me judge i aint got a cent you can go through me and be welcome to half you find ill mail you ten when i get home though honest at that the audience giggled and the judge says your humour doesnt appeal to me billings of course you have the privilege of working it out oh glory the privilege heegan nodded at this and i realized what i was against your honour says i with sarcastic refinements science tells us that a perfect vacuum aint possible but after watching you i know better and for you mr workingmans friend us to the floor and i run at heegan pshaw i never got started nor i didnt rightfully come to till i rested in the workhouse which last figger of speech is a pure and beautiful paradox i aint dwellin with glee on the next twentysix days ten dollars and costs at four bits a day but i left there saturated with such hatreds for heegan that my breath smelted of em i wanders down the river front hoping the fortunes of war would deliver him to me dead or alive when the thought hit me that id need money it was bound to take another ten and costs shortly after we met and probably more if i paid for what i got for i figgered on distendin myself with satisfaction and his features with uppercuts then i see a sign nonunion men wanted big wages in i goes and strains my langwidge through a wire net at the cashier i want them big wages says i what can you do anything to get the money says i what does it take to liquidate an assault on a labour leader there was a whitehaired man in the cage who began to sit up and take notice whats your trouble says he and i told him if we had a few more like you wed bust the strike says he kind of sizin me up ive got a notion to try it anyhow and he smites the desk collins what dye say if we tow the detroit out her crew has stayed with us so far and theyll stick now if well say the word the unions are hungry and scrapping among themselves and the men want to go back to work its just that devil of a heegan that holds em if they see weve got a tug crew thatll go theyll arbitrate and well kill the strike yes sir says collins but wheres the tug crew mr badrich right here we three and murphy the bookkeeper blast this idleness i want to fight ill take the same says i when i get the price thats all right youve put the spirit into me and ill see you through can you run an engine good ill take the wheel and the othersll fire its going to be risky work though you wont back out eh reddy interrupted billings here loudly with a snort of disgust while bitter root ran his fingers through his hair before continuing martin was listening intently the old man arranged to have a squad of cops on all the bridges and i begin anticipatin hilarities for next day the news got out of course through the secrecies of police headquarters and when we ran up the river for our tow it looked like every striker west of pittsburg had his family on the docks to see the barbecue accompanied by enough cobblestones and scrap iron to ballast a battleship all we got goin up was repartee but i figgered wed need armour gettin back we passed a hawser to the detroit and i turned the gas into the tug blowin for the wells street bridge then war began i leans out the door just in time to see the mob charge the bridge the cops clubbed em back while a roar went up from the docks and roof tops that was like a bad dream i couldnt see her move none though and old man badrich blowed again expurgatin himself of as nobby a line of cuss words as youll muster outside the cattle belt soak em i yells give em all the arbitration youve got handy if she dont open well jump her and i lets out another notch so that we went plowin and boilin towards the draw it looked like wed have to hurdle it sure enough but the police beat the crowd back just in time she wasnt clear open though and our barge caromed off the spiles it was like a nigger buttin a persimmon tree we rattled off a shower of missiles like an abnormal hail storm talk about your coast defence they heaved everything at us from bad names to railroad iron and we lost all our window glass the first clatter while the smoke stack looked like a pretzel with cramps when we scraped through i looked back with pity at the detroits crew she hadnt any wheel house and the helmsman was due to get all the attention that was comin to him theyd built up a barricade of potato sacks chicken coops and bicabrac around the wheel that protected em somewhat but even while i watched some polack filtered a brick through and laid out the quartermaster cold and he was drug off oh it was refined and esthetic well we run the gauntlet presented every block with stuff rangin in tensile strength from insults to asphalt pavements and noise say all the racket in the world was a whisper i caught a glimpse of the old man leanin out of the pilot house where a window had been his white hair bristly and his nostrils histed embellishin the air with surprisin flights of gleeful profanity hooray this is livin he yells spyin me shovelin the deck out from under the junk best scrap ive had in years and just then some baseball player throwed in from centre field catching him in the neck with a tomato gee that mans an honour to the faculty of speech i was doin bully till a cobblestone bounced into the engine room makin a billiard with my off knee then i got kind of peevish rush street bridge is the last one and theyd massed there on both sides like fleas on a razorback thinks i if we make it through here weve busted the strike and i glances back at the detroit just in time to see her crew pullin their captain into the deck house limp and bleedin the barricade was all knocked to pieces and theyd flunked absolute dont blame em much either as it was sure death to stand out in the open under the rain of stuff that come from the bridges of course with no steerin she commenced to swing off i jumps out the far side of the engine room and yells fit to bust my throat grab that wheel grab it quick well hit the bridge but it was like deef and dumb talk in a boiler shop while a wilder howl went up from the water front as they seen what theyd done and smelled victory theres an awfulness about the voice of a bloodmaddened clubswingin mob it lifts your scalp like a fright wig particularly if you are the clubee weve got one chance thinks i but if she strikes were gone theyll swamp us sure and all the police in cook county wont save enough for to hold services on then i throwed a look at the opening ahead and the pessimisms froze in me i forgot all about the resiliency of brickbats and the table manners of riots for there on top of a bunch of spiles cam masterful and bloated with perjuries was oily heegan dictatin the disposition of his forces the light of victory in his shifty little eyes ten dollars and costs i shrieks seein red lemme crawl up them spiles to you then inspiration seized me my soul riz up and grappled with the crisis for right under my mit coiled suggestive and pleadin was one of the tugs heavin lines bout a threeeighths size i slips a runnin knot in the end and divides the coils crouchin behind the deckhouse till we come abeam of him then i straightened give it a swinging heave and the noose sailed up and settled over him fine and daisy i jerked back and oily heegan did a high dive from rush street that was a geometrical joy he hit kind of amateurish doin what we used to call a bellybuster back home but quite satisfyin for a maiden effort and i reeled him in astern your chicago man aint a gamey fish he come up tame and squirting sewage like a dissolute porpoise while i played him out where hed get the thrash of the propeller help he yells im a drownding ten dollars and costs says i lettin him under again do you know who youre drinkin with this time hey i reckon the astonishment of the mob was equal to heegans anyhow im told that we was favoured with such quietness that my voice sounded four blocks simply achin with satisfactions then pandemonium tore loose but i was so engrosed in sweet converse i never heard it or noticed that the detroit had slid through the draw by a hair and we was bound for the blue and smilin lake for gods sake lemme up says heegan splashin along and lookin strangly i hauls him in where he wouldnt miss any of my ironies and says i just cant do it oily its wash day youre plumb nasty with boycotts and picketins and compulsory arbitrations im goin to clean you up and i sozzled him under like a wet shirt i drug him out again and continues this is chinamens work oily but i lost my pride in the bridewell thanks to you its tough on st louis to laundry you up stream this way but maybe the worst of your heresies ll be purified when they get that far you know the chicago river runs up hill out of lake michigan through the drainage canal and into the st louis waterworks sure it does most unnatural stream i ever see about direction and smells i was gettin a good deal of enjoyment and infections out of him when old man badrich ran back enamelled with blood and passe tomato juice the red in his white hair makin his top look like one of these fancy icecream drinks you get at a soda fountain here here youll kill him says he so i hauled him aboard drippin and clingy wringin him out good and thorough by the neck he made a fine mop these clippings continued bitter root fishing into his pocket tell in beautiful figgers how the last seen of oily heegan he was holystoning the deck of a sooty little tugboat under the admonishments and feet of bitter root billings of montana and they state how the strikers tried to get tugs for pursuit and couldnt and how all day long from the housetops was visible a tugboat madly cruisin about inside the outer cribs bustin the silence with joyful blasts of victory and theyll further state that about dark she steamed up the river tired and draggled with a bonylookin cowboy inhalin cigareets on the sternbits holding a threefoot knotted rope in his lap when a delegation of strikers met her inquirin about one d ohara heegan it says like this and billings read laboriously as follows then the bronzed and lanky man arose with a smile of rare contentment threw overboard his cigarette and approaching the boilerroom hatch called loudly come out of that and the president of the federation of fresh water firemen dragged himself wearily out into the flickering lights he was black and drenched and streaked with sweat also he shone with the grease and oils of the engines while the palms of his hands were covered with painful blisters from unwonted intimate contact with shovels and drawbars it was seen that he winced fearfully as the cowboy twirled the rope end hes got the makins of a fair fireman said the stranger all he wants is practice then as the delegation murmured angrily he held up his hand and in the ensuing silence said boys the strikes over mr heegan has arbitrated the shyness of shorty bailey smoked morosely as he scanned the dusty trail leading down across the bottom and away over the dry grey prairie toward the hazy mountains in the west from his backtilted chair on the veranda the road was visible for miles as well as the river trail from the south sneaking up through the cottonwoods and leprous sycamores he called gruffly into the silence of the house and his speech held the surliness of his attitude hot joy bar x outfit comin git supper a chinaman appeared in the door and gazed at the sixmule team descending the distant gully to the ford jesse one man hey all light and slid quietly back to the kitchen whatever might be said or rather whatever might be suspected of baileys roadhouse for people did not run to wordy conjecture in this country it was known that it boasted a good cook and this atoned for a catalogue of shortcomings so it waxed popular among the hands of the big cattle ranges nearbye those given to idle talk held that bailey acted strangely at times and rumour painted occasional black doings at the hacienda squatting vulturelike above the ford but it was nobodys business and he kept a good cook bailey did not recall the face that greeted him from above the three span as they swung in front of his corral but the brand on their flanks was the bar x so he nodded with as near an approach to hospitality as he permitted it was a large face strongfeatured and rugged balanced on wide square shoulders yet some oddness of posture held the gaze of the other till the stranger clambered over the wheel to the ground then bailey removed his brier and heaved tempestuously in the throes of great and silent mirth it was a dwarf the head of a titan the body of a whisky barrel rolling ludicrously on the tiny limbs of a bug presented so startling a sight that even hot joy appearing around the corner cackled shrilly his laughter rose to a shriek of dismay however as the little man made at him with the rush and roar of a cannon ball in baileys amazed eyes he seemed to bounce galvanically landing on joys back with such vicious suddenness that the breath fled from him in a squawk of terror then seizing his cue he kicked and belaboured the prostrate celestial in feverish silence he desisted and rolled across the porch to bailey staring truculently up et the landlord he spoke for the first time was i right in supposin that something amused you bailey gasped incredulously for the voice rumbled heavily an octave below his own bass either the look of the stocky catapult as he launched himself on the fleeing servant or the invidious servility of the innkeeper sobered the landlord and he answered gravely no sir i reckon youre mistaken i aint observed anything frivolous yet glad of it said the little man i dont like a feller to hog a joke all by himself some of the bar x boys took to absorbin humour out of my shape when i first went to work but theyre sort of educated out of it now i got an eye from one and a finger off of another the last one donated a ear bailey readily conceived this man as a bad antagonist for the heavy corded neck had split buttons from the blue shirt and he glimpsed a chest hairy and round as a drum while the brown arms showed knotty and hardened lets liquor he said and led the way into the big low room serving as bar diningand livingroom from the rear came vicious clatterings and slammings of pots mingled with oriental lamentations indicating an aching body rather than a chastened spirit dont see you often he continued with a touch of implied curiosity which grew as his guest with lingering fondness upended a glass brimful of the raw fiery spirits no the old man dont lemme get away much he knows that dwellin close to the ground as i do i pine for spiritual elevation with a melting glance at the bottles behind the bar doing much to explain the size of his first drink like it do ye questioned bailey indicating the shelf well not exactly booze is like air i need it it makes a new man out of me and usually ends by gettin both me and the new one laid off didnt hear nothing of the weddin over at los huecos did ye no whose weddin ross turney the new sheriff ye dont say him thats been elected on purpose to round up the tremper gang hey whos his antagonist old man millers gal hes celebratin his election by gettin spliced i been expectin of em across this way tonight but i guess they took the black butte trail you heard what he said didnt ye claims that inside of ninety days hell rid the county of the trempers and give the reward to his wife for a bridal present five thousand dollars on em you know bailey grinned evilly and continued say marsh tremperll ride up to his house some night and make him eat his own gun in front of his bride see if he dont then therell be cause for an inquest and an election he spoke with what struck the teamster as unnecessary heat dunno said the other turneys a brash young feller i hear but hes game taint any of my business though and i dont want none of his contrac im violently addicted to peace and quiet i am guess ill unhitch and he toddled out into the gathering dusk to his mules while the landlord peered uneasily down the darkening trail as the saddened joy lit candles in the front room there came the rattle of wheels without and a buckboard stopped in the bar of light from the door baileys anxiety was replaced by a mask of listless surprise as the voice of ross turney called to him hello there bailey are we in time for supper if not ill start an insurrection with that boxer of yours hes got to turn out the snortingest supper of the season tonight it isnt every day your shack is honoured by a bride mr bailey this is my wife since ten oclock a m he introduced a blushing happy girl evidently in the grasp of many emotions well stay all night i guess sure said bailey ill show ye a room and he led them up beneath the low roof where an unusual cleanliness betrayed the industry of joy the two men returned and drank to the bride turney with the reckless lightness that distinguished him bailey sullen and watchful got another outfit here havent you questioned the bridegroom who is it before answer could be made from the kitchen arose a tortured howl and the smashing of dishes mingled with stormy rumblings the door burst inward and an agonized joy fled flapping out into the night while behind him rolled the caricature from bar x i just stopped for a drink of water boomed the dwarf then paused at the twitching face of the sheriff he swelled ominously like a great pigeon purple and congested with rage strutting to the newcomer he glared insolently up into his smiling face what are ye laughin at ye shavetail his hands were clenched till his arms showed tense and rigid and the cords in his neck were thickly swollen lemme in on it im strong on humour what in ails ye he yelled in a fury as the tall young man gazed fixedly and the glasses rattled at the bellow from the barreledup lungs im not laughing at you said the sheriff oh aint ye mocked the man of peace well take care that ye dont ye big wart or ill trample them new clothes and browse around on some of your features ill take ye apart till ye look like cut feed guess ye dont know who i am do ye im who is this man ross came the anxious voice of the bride descending the stairs the little man spun like a dancer and spying the girl blushed to the colour of a prickly pear then stammered painfully while the sweat stood out under the labour of his discomfort just shorty miss he finally quavered plain shorty of the bar x er a miserable crawlin worm for disturbin of you he rolled his eyes helplessly at bailey while he sopped with his crumpled sombrero at the glistening perspiration why didnt ye tell me he whispered ferociously at the host and the volume of his query carried to joy hiding out in the night mr shorty said the sheriff gravely let me introduce my wife mrs turney the bride smiled sweetly at the tremulous little man who broke and fled to a high bench in the darkest corner where he dangled his short legs in a silent ecstasy of bashfulness i reckon ill have to rope that chink then blindfold and back him into the kitchen if we git any supper said bailey disappearing later the chinaman stole in to set the table but he worked with hectic and fitful energy a fearful eye always upon the dim bulk in the corner and at a fancied move he shook with an ague of apprehension backing and sidling he finally announced the meal prepared to stampede madly at notice during the supper shorty ate ravenously of whatever lay to his hand but asked no favours the agony of his shyness paralysed his huge vocal muscles till speech became a labour quite impossible to a pleasant remark of the bride he responded but no sound issued then breathing heavily into his larynx the reply roared upon them like a burst of thunder seriously threatening the gravity of the meal he retired abruptly into moist and selfconscious silence fearful of feasting his eyes on this disturbing loveliness as soon as compatible with decency he slipped back to his bunk in the shed behind and lay staring into the darkness picturing the amazing occurrences of the evening at the memory of her level glances he fell atremble and sighed ecstatically prickling with a new strange emotion he lay till far into the night wakeful and absorbed he was able to grasp the fact but dimly that all this dazzling perfection was for one man were it not manifestly impossible he supposed other men in other lands knew other ladies as beautiful and it furthermore grew upon him blackly in the thick gloom that in all this world of womanly sweetness and beauty no modicum of it was for the misshapen dwarf of the bar x outfit all his life he had fought furiously to uphold the empty shell of his dignity in the eyes of his comrades yet always morbidly conscious of the difference in his body whisky had been his solace his sweetheart it changed him raised and beatified him into the likeness of other men and now as he pondered he was aware of a consuming thirst engendered by the heat of his earlier emotions undoubtedly it must be quenched he rose and stole quietly out into the big front room perhaps the years of free life in the open had bred a suspicion of walls perhaps he felt his conduct would not brook discovery perhaps habit prompted him to take the two heavy colts from their holsters and thrust them inside his trousers band he slipped across the room silent and cavernlike its blackness broken by the window squares of starry sky till he felt the paucity of glassware behind the bar heres to her it burned delightfully heres to the groom it tingled more alluringly ill drink what i can and get back to the bunk before it works he thought and the darkness veiled the measure of his potations he started at a noise on the stairway his senses not yet dulled detected a stealthy tread not the careless step of a man unafraid but the cautious rustle and halt of a marauder every nerve bristled to keenest alertness as the faint occasional sounds approached passed the open end of the bar where he crouched leading on to the window then a match flared and the darkness rushed out as a candle wick sputtered shorty stretched on tiptoe brought his eye to the level of the bar and gazed upon the horrent head of bailey he sighed thankfully but watched with interest his strange behaviour bailey moved the light across the window from left to right three times paused then wigwagged some code out into the night hes signalling mused shorty hope he gets through quick im getting full the fumes of the liquor were beating at his senses and he knew that soon he would move with difficulty the man however showed no intention of leaving for his signals completed he blew out the light first listening for any sound from above then his figure loomed black and immobile against the dim starlight of the window oh lord i got to set down and the watcher squatted upon the floor bracing against the wall his dulling perceptions were sufficiently acute to detect shuffling footsteps on the porch and the cautious unbarring of the door gettin late for visitors he thought as he entered a blissful doze when theyre abed ill turn in it seemed much later that a shot startled him to his dizzy hearing came the sound of curses overhead the stamp and shift of feet the crashing fall of struggling men and what brought him unsteadily to his legs the agonized scream of a woman it echoed through the house chilling him and dwindled to an aching moan something was wrong he knew that but it was hard to tell just what he must think what hard work it was to think too hed never noticed before what a laborious process it was probably that sheriff had got into trouble he was a fresh guy anyhow and hed laughed when he first saw shorty that settled it he could get out of it himself evidently it was nothing serious for there was no more disturbance above only confused murmurings then a light showed in the stairs and again the shuffling of feet came as four strange men descended they were lighted by the sardonic bailey and they dragged a sixth between them bound and helpless it was the sheriff now what had he been doing to get into such a fix the prisoner stood against the wall white and defiant he strained at his bonds silently while his captors watched his futile struggles there was something terrible and menacing in the quietness with which they gloated a suggestion of some horror to come at last he desisted and burst forth youve got me all right you did this bailey you traitor hes never been a traitor as far as we know sneered one of the four in fact i might say hes been strictly on the square with us i didnt think you made war on women either marsh tremper but it seems youre everything from a dogthief down why couldnt you fight me alone in the daylight like a man you dont wait till a rattlers coiled before you stamp his head off said the former speaker its either you or us and i reckon its you so these were the tremper boys eh the worst desperadoes in the southwest and bailey was their ally the watcher eyed them mildly curious and it seemed to him that they were as bad a quartette as rumour had painted bad even for this country of bad men the sheriff was a fool for getting mixed up with such people shorty knew enough to mind his own business anyway if others didnt he was a peaceful man and didnt intend to get mixed up with outlaws his mellow meditations were interrupted by the hoarse speech of the sheriff who had broken down into his rage again and struggled madly while words ran from him let me go you let me free i want to fight the coward that struck my wife youve killed her who was it let me get at him shorty stiffened as though a douche of icewater had struck him killed her struck his wife my god not that sweet creature of his dreams who had talked and smiled at him without noting his deformity an awful anger rose in him and he moved out into the light hansup whatever of weakness may have dragged at his legs none sounded in the great bellowing command that flooded the room at the compelling volume of the sound every man whirled and eight empty hands shot skyward their startled eyes beheld a mans squat body weaving uncertainly on the limbs of an insect while in each hand shone a blueblack colt that waved and circled in maddening erratic orbits at the command marsh trempers mind had leaped to the fact that behind him was one man one against five and he took a gamblers chance as he whirled he drew and fired none but the dwarf of bar x could have lived for he was the deadliest hip shot in the territory his bullet crashed into the wall a hands breadth over shortys cowlick it was a clean heart shot the practised whirl and flip of the finished gun fighter but the roar of his explosion was echoed by another and the elder tremper spun unsteadily against the table with a broken shoulder too high moaned the big voice the liquor he swayed drunkenly but at the slightest shift of his quarry the aimless wanderings of a black muzzle stopped on the spot and the body behind the guns was congested with deadly menace face the wall he cried quick keep em up higher they sullenly obeyed their wounded leader reaching with his uninjured member to the complacent shorty it seemed that things were working nicely though he was disturbingly conscious of his alcoholic lack of balance and tortured by the fear that he might suddenly lose the iron grip of his faculties then for the second time that night from the stairs came the voice that threw him into the dreadful confusion of his modesty o ross it cried ive brought your gun and there on the steps dishevelled pallid and quivering was the bride and grasped in one trembling hand was her husbands weapon ah h sighed shorty seraphically as the vision beat in upon his misty conceptions she aint hurt in his mind there was no room for desperadoes contemporaneously with her then he became conscious of the ladys raiment and his brown cheeks flamed brickred while he dropped his eyes in his shrinking grovelling modesty he made for his dark corner one of those at bay familiar with this strange abashment seized the moment but at his motion the sheriff screamed look out the quick danger in the cry brought back with a surge the men against the wall and shorty swung instantly firing at the outstretched hand of bailey as it reached for trempers weapon the landlord straightened gazing affrightedly at his finger tips too low and shortys voice held aching tears ill never touch another drop its plumb ruined my aim cut these strings girlie said the sheriff as the little mans gaze again wavered threatening to leave his prisoners quick hes blushing again when they were manacled shorty stood in moist exudation trembling and speechless under the incoherent thanks of the bride and the silent admiration of her handsome husband she fluttered about him in a tremor of anxiety lest he be wounded caressing him here and there with solicitous pats till he felt his shamed and happy spirit would surely burst from its misshapen prison youve made a good thing tonight said turney clapping him heartily on his massive back you get the five thousand all right we were going to mexico city on that for a bridal trip when i rounded up the gang but ill see you get every cent of it old man if it wasnt for you id have been a heap farther south than that by now the open camaraderie and goodfellowship that rang in the mans voice affected shorty strangely accustomed as he was to the veiled contempt or open compassion of his fellows here was one who recognized him as a man an equal he spread his lips but the big voice squeaked dismally then inflating deeply he spoke so that the prisoners chained in the corral outside heard him plainly id rather she took it anyhow blushing violently no no they cried its yours well then half of it and for once shorty betrayed the strength of gibraltar even in the face of the lady and so it stood as the dawn spread over the dusty prairie tipping the westward mountains with silver caps and sucking the mist out of the cottonwood bottoms he bade them adieu no i got to get back to the bar x or the old manll swear i been drinking again and i dont want to dissipate no wrong impressions around he winked gravely then as the sheriff and his surly prisoners drove off he called mr turney take good care of them trempers i think a heap of em for outside of your wife theyre the only ones in this outfit that didnt laugh at me the test pierre feroce showed disapproval in his every attitude as plainly as disgust peered from the seams in his dark face it lurked in his scowl and in the curl of his long rawhide that bit among the sled dogs so at least thought willard as he clung to the swinging sledge they were skirting the coast keeping to the glare ice windswept and clean that lay outside the jumbled shore pack the team ran silently in the free gait of the grey wolf romping in harness from pure joy of motion and the intoxication of perfect life making the sled runners whine like the song of a cutlass this route is dangerous of course from hidden cracks in the floes and most travellers hug the bluffs but he who rides with pierre feroce takes chances it was this that had won him the name of wild pierre the most reckless tireless man of the trails a scoffer at peril bolting through danger with rush and frenzy overcoming sheerly by vigour those obstacles which destroy strong men in the north the power that pulsed within him gleamed from his eyes rang in his song showed in the aggressive thrust of his sensual face this particular morning however pierres distemper had crystallized into a great contempt for his companion of all trials the most detestable is to hit the trail with half a man a pale anemic weakling like this stranger though modest in the extent of his learning pierre gloated in a freedom of speech the which no man dared deny him he turned to eye his companion cynically for a second time and contempt was patent in his gaze willard appeared slender and pallid in his furs though his clearcut features spoke a certain strength and much refinement bah i tink you dam poor feller he said finally ow you goin stan thees trip eh shes need beeg mans not leetle runt like you amusement at this frankness glimmered in willards eyes youre like all ignorant people you think in order to stand hardship a man should be able to toss a sack of flour in his teeth or juggle a cask of salthorse sure ting grinned pierre thats right look at me mebbe you hear bout pierre feroce sometime eh oh yes everybody knows you knows youre a big bully ive seen you drink a quart of this wood alcohol they call whisky up here and then jump the bar from a stand but youre all animal you havent the refinement and the culture that makes real strength its the mind that makes us stand punishment ha ha ha laughed the canadian wat a fonny talk shell take the heducate man for stan the col eh mon dieu he roared again till the sled dogs turned fearful glances backward and bushy tails drooped under the weight of their fright great noise came oftenest with great rage from pierre and they had too frequently felt the both to forget yes you havent the mentality sometime youll use up your physical resources and go to pieces like a burned wick pierre was greatly amused his yellow teeth shone and he gave vent to violent mirth as following the thought he pictured a naked mind wandering over the hills with the quicksilver at sixty degrees did you ever see a sixday race of course not you barbarians havent sunk to the level of our dissolute east where we joy in roman spectacles but if you had youd see its will that wins its the man that eats his soul by inches the educated soldier stands the campaign best you run too much to muscle youre not balanced i tink mebbe youll ave chance for show im thees stout will of yours shes goin be long mush troo the mountains plentee snow plentee cold although pierres ridicule was galling willard felt the charm of the morning too strongly to admit of anger or to argue his pet theory the sun brilliant and cold lent a paradoxical cheerfulness to the desolation and though never a sign of life broke the stillness around them the beauty of the scintillant gleaming mountains distinct as cameos that guarded the bay appealed to him with the strange attraction of the arctics that attraction that calls and calls insistently till men forsake gods country for its mystery he breathed the biting air cleaned by leagues of lifeless barrens and voids of crackling frost till he ached with the exhilaration of a perfect morning on the circle also before him undulated the grandest string of dogs the coast had known seven there were tall and grey with tails like plumes whom none but pierre could lay hand upon fierce and fearless as their master he drove with the killing cruelty of a stampeder and they loved him you say you have grub cached at the old indian hut on the good hope questioned willard sure five poun bacon leetle flour and rice i cache one gumboot too ha good thing for make fire queeck eh you bet an old rubber boot comes handy when its too cold to make shavings leaving the coast they ascended a deep and tortuous river where the snow lay thick and soft one man on snowshoes broke trail for the dogs till they reached the foothills it was hard work but infinitely preferable to that which followed for now they came into a dangerous stretch of overflows the stream frozen to its bed clogged the passage of the spring water beneath forcing it up through cracks till it spread over the solid ice forming pools and sheets covered with treacherous iceskins wet feet are fatal to man and beast and they made laborious detours wallowing trails through tangled willows waist deep in the snow smother or clinging precariously to the overhanging bluffs as they reached the rivers source the sky blackened suddenly and great clouds of snow rushed over the bleak hills boiling down into the valley with a furious draught they flung up their flimsy tent only to have it flattened by the force of the gale that cut like wellhoned steel frozen spots leaped out white on their faces while their hands stiffened ere they could fasten the guy strings finally having lashed the tent bottom to the protruding willow tops by grace of heavy lifting they strained their flapping shelter up sufficiently to crawl within by gar shes blow hup ver queeck yelled pierre as he set the tenpound sheetiron stove its pipe swaying drunkenly with the heaving tent good ting she hit us in the brush he spoke as calmly as though danger was distant and a moment later the little box was roaring with its oilsoaked kindlings will this stove burn green willow tops cried willard sure shes good stove shell burn hicicles eef you get im start one times see im get red they rubbed the stiff spots from their cheeks then seizing the axe willard crawled forth into the storm and dug at the base of the gnarled bushes occasionally a shrub assumed the proportions of a mans wrist but rarely gathering an armful he bore them inside and twisting the tips into withes he fed the fire the frozen twigs sizzled and snapped threatening to fail utterly but with much blowing he sustained a blaze sufficient to melt a pot of snow boiling was out of the question but the tea leaves became soaked and the bacon cauterized pierre freed and fed the dogs each gulped its dried salmon and curling in the lee of the tent was quickly drifted over next he cut blocks from the solid bottom snow and built a barricade to windward then he accumulated a mow of willow tops without the tentfly all the time the wind drew down the valley like the breath of a giant bellows supper shouted willard and as pierre crawled into the candlelight he found him squatted furbundled over the stove which settled steadily into the snow melting its way downward toward a firmer foundation the heat was insufficient to thaw the frozen sweat in his clothes his eyes were bleary and wet from smoke and his nose needed continuous blowing but he spoke pleasantly a fact which pierre noted with approval well need a habeas corpus for this stove if you dont get something to hold her up and i might state if its worthy of mention that your nose is frozen again pierre brought an armful of stones from the creek edge distributing them beneath the stove on a bed of twisted willows then swallowing their scanty halfcooked food they crawled shivering into the deerskin sleepingbags that animal heat might dry their clammy garments four days the wind roared and the ice filings poured over their shelter while they huddled beneath when one travels on rations delay is dangerous each morning dragging themselves out into the maelstrom they took sticks and poked into the drifts for dogs each animal as found was exhumed given a fish and became straightway reburied in the whirling white that seethed down from the mountains on the fifth without warning the storm died and the air stilled to a perfect silence these dog bad froze said pierre swearing earnestly as he harnessed i don like eet much they goin play hout im fraid he knelt and chewed from between their toes the ice pellets that had accumulated a malamoot is hard pressed to let his feet mass and this added to the mens uneasiness as they mounted the great divide mountains rolled away on every hand barren desolate marblewhite always the whiteness always the listening silence that oppressed like a weight myriads of creek valleys radiated below in a bewildering maze of twisting seams those are the asss ears i suppose said willard gazing at two great fangs that bit deep into the skyline is it true that no man has ever reached them yes the hinjun say thats were hall the storm come from biccause wen the win blow troo the asss ear look out somebody goin ketch ell dogs feet wear quickly after freezing for crusted snow cuts like a knife spots of blood showed in their tracks growing more plentiful till every print was a crimson stain they limped pitifully on their raw pads and occasionally one whined at every stop they sank in track licking their lacerated paws rising only at the cost of much whipping on the second night faint and starved they reached the hut digging away the drifts they crawled inside to find it half full of snow snow which had sifted through the crevices pierre groped among the shadows and swore excitedly whats up said willard vocal effort of the simplest is exhausting when spent with hunger and these were the first words he had spoken for hours by gar shes gone somebody stole my grub willard felt a terrible sinking and his stomach cried for food how far is it to the crooked river road house one long day drive forty mile we must make it tomorrow or go hungry eh well this isnt the first dog fish i ever ate both men gnawed a mouldy dried salmon from their precious store as willard removed his footgear he groaned wats the mattaire i froze my foot two days ago snowshoe strap too tight he exhibited a heel from which in removing his inner sock the flesh and skin had come away thats all right grinned pierre you got the beeg will lef yet it take the heducate man for stan the col you know willard gritted his teeth they awoke to the whine of a grey windstorm that swept the cutting snow in swirling clouds and made travel a madness the next day was worse two days of hunger weigh heavy when the cold weakens and they grew gaunt and fell away in their features im glad weve got another feed for the dogs remarked willard we cant let them run hungry even if we do i tink shes be hall right tomor ventured pierre thees aint snow jus win bimeby all blow hout sacre ill can eat nuff for ole harmy for days both men had been cold and the sensation of complete warmth had come to seem strange and unreal while their faces cracked where the spots had been willard felt himself on the verge of collapse he recalled his words about strong men gazing the while at pierre the canadian evinced suffering only in the haggard droop of eye and mouth otherwise he looked strong and dogged willard felt his own features had shrunk to a mask of loosejawed suffering and he set his mental sinews muttering to himself he was dizzy and faint as he stretched himself in the still morning air upon waking and hobbled painfully but as his companion emerged from the darkened shelter into the crystalline brightness he forgot his own misery at sight of him the big man reeled as though struck when the dazzle from the hills reached him and he moaned shielding his sight snowblindness had found him in a night slowly they plodded out of the valley for hunger gnawed acutely and they left a trail of blood tracks from the dogs it took the combined efforts of both men to lash them to foot after each pause thus progress was slow and fraught with agony as they rose near the pass miles of arctic wastes bared themselves all about towered bald domes while everywhere stretched the monotonous white the endless snow unbroken by tree or shrub pallid and menacing maddening to the eye thank god the worsts over sighed willard flinging himself onto the sled well make it to the summit next time then shes down hill all the way to the road house pierre said nothing away to the northward glimmered the asss ears and as the speaker eyed them carelessly he noted gauzy shreds and streamers veiling their tops the phenomena interested him for he knew that here must be wind wind the terror of the bleak tundra the hopeless merciless master of the barrens however the distant range beneath the twin peaks showed clearcut and distinct against the sky and he did not mention the occurrence to the guide although he recalled the words of the indians beware of the wind through the asss ears again they laboured up the steep slope wallowing in the sliding snow straining silently at the load again they threw themselves exhausted upon it now as he eyed the panorama below it seemed to have suffered a subtle change indefinable and odd although but a few minutes had elapsed the coast mountains no longer loomed clear against the horizon and his visual range appeared foreshortened as though the utter distances had lengthened bringing closer the edge of things the twin peaks seemed endlessly distant and hazy while the air had thickened as though congested with possibilities lending a remoteness to the landscape if it blows up on us here were gone he thought for its miles to shelter and were right in the saddle of the hills pierre half blinded as he was arose uneasily and cast the air like a wild beast his great head thrown back his nostrils quivering i smell the win he cried mon dieu shes goin blow a volatile pennant floated out from a nearbye peak hanging about its crest like faint smoke then along the brow of the pass writhed a wisp of drifting twisting flakelets idling hither and yon astatic and aimless settling in a hollow they sensed a thrill and rustle to the air though never a breath had touched them then as they mounted higher a draught fanned them icy as interstellar space the view from the summit was grotesquely distorted and glancing upward they found the guardian peaks had gone asmoke with clouds of snow that whirled confusedly while an increasing breath sucked over the summit stronger each second dry snow began to rustle slothfully about their feet so swiftly were the changes wrought that before the mind had grasped their import the storm was on them roaring down from every side swooping out of the boiling sky a raging blast from the voids of sunless space pierres shouts as he slashed at the sled lashings were snatched from his lips in scattered scraps he dragged forth the whipping tent and threw himself upon it with the sleepingbags having cut loose the dogs willard crawled within his sack and they drew the flapping canvas over them the air was twilight and heavy with efflorescent granules that hurtled past in a drone they removed their outer garments that the fur might fold closer against them and lay exposed to the full hate of the gale they hoped to be drifted over but no snow could lodge in this hurricane and it sifted past dry and sharp eddying out a bare place wherein they lay thus the wind drove the chill to their bones bitterly an unnourished human body responds but weakly so vitiated by their fast and labours their suffering smote them with tenfold cruelty all night the north wind shouted and as the next day waned with its violence undiminished the frost crept in upon them till they rolled and tossed shivering twice they essayed to crawl out but were driven back to cower for endless hopeless hours it is in such black aimless times that thought becomes distorted willard felt his mind wandering through bleak dreams and tortured fancies always to find himself harping on his early argument with pierre its the mind that counts later he roused to the fact that his knees where they pressed against the bag were frozen also his feet were numb and senseless in his acquired consciousness he knew that along the course of his previous mental vagary lay madness and the need of action bore upon him imperatively he shouted to his mate but wild pierre seemed strangely apathetic weve got to run for it at daylight were freezing here hold on what are you doing wait for daylight pierre had scrambled stiffly out of his cover and his gabblings reached willard he raised a clenched fist into the darkness of the streaming night cursing horribly with words that appalled the other man man dont curse your god this is bad enough as it is cover up quick although apparently unmindful of his presence the other crawled back muttering as the dim morning greyed the smother they rose and fought their way downward toward the valley long since they had lost their griping hunger and now held only an apathetic indifference to food with a cringing dread of the cold and a stubborn sense of their extreme necessity they fell many times but gradually drew themselves more under control the exercise suscitating them as they staggered downward blinded and buffeted their only hope the roadhouse willard marvelled dully at the change in pierre his face had shrivelled to blackened freezes stretched upon a bony substructure and lighted by feverish glittering black black eyes it seemed to him that his own lagging body had long since failed and that his aching naked soul wandered stiffly through the endless day as night approached pierre stopped frequently propping himself with legs far apart sometimes he laughed invariably this horrible sound shocked willard into a keener sense of the surroundings and it grew to irritate him for the frenchmans mental wanderings increased with the darkness what made him rouse one with his awful laughter these spells of walking insensibility were pleasanter far at last the big man fell to willards mechanical endeavours to help he spoke sleepily but with the sanity of a man under great stress dat no good im goin freeze right ere freeze stiff as ell au revoir get up willard kicked him weakly then sat upon the prostrate man as his own faculties went wandering eventually he roused and digging into the snow buried the other first covering his face with the ample parka hood then he struck down the valley in one lucid spell he found he had followed a sled trail which was blown clear and distinct by the wind that had now almost died away occasionally his mind grew clear and his pains beat in upon him till he grew furious at the life in him which refused to end which forced him ever through this gauntlet of misery more often he was conscious only of a vague and terrible extremity outside of himself that goaded him forever forward anon he strained to recollect his destination his features had set in an implacable grimace of physical torture like a runner in the fury of a finish till the frost hardened them so at times he fell heavily face downward and at length upon the trail lying so till that omnipresent coercion that had frozen in his brain drove him forward he heard his own voice maundering through lifeless lips like that of a stranger the man that can eat his soul will win pierre sometimes he cried like a child and slaver ran from his open mouth freezing at his breast one of his hands was going dead he stripped the left mitten off and drew it laboriously over the right one he would save at least even though he lost the other he looked at the bare member dully and he could not tell that the cold had eased till the bitterness was nearly out of the air he laboured with the fitful spurts of a machine run down ten men and many dogs lay together in the crooked river road house through the storm at late bedtime of the last night came a scratching on the door somebodys left a dog outside said a teamster and rose to let him in he opened the door only to retreat affrightedly my god he said my god and the miners crowded forward a figure tottered over the portal swaying drunkenly they shuddered at the sight of its face as it crossed toward the fire it did not walk it shuffled haltingly with flexed knees and hanging shoulders the strides measuring inches only a grisly burlesque upon senility pausing in the circle it mumbled thickly with great effort as though gleaning words from infinite distance wild pierre frozen buried in snow hurry then he straightened and spoke strongly his voice flooding the room its the mind pierre ha ha ha the mind he cackled hideously and plunged forward into a miners arms it was many days before his delirium broke gradually he felt the pressure of many bandages upon him and the hunger of convalescence as he lay in his bunk the past came to him hazy and horrible then the hum of voices one loud insistent and familiar he turned weakly to behold pierre propped in a chair by the stove frostscarred and pale but aggressive even in recuperation he gesticulated fiercely with a bandaged hand hot in controversy with some biglimbed bearded strangers bah you fellers no good too beeg in the ches too leetle in the forehead shell tak the heducate mans for stan the ardsheep lak me an meestaire weelard north of fiftythree big george was drinking and the activities of the little arctic mining camp were paralysed events invariably ceased their progress and marked time when george became excessive and now nothing of public consequence stirred except the quicksilver which was retiring fearfully into its bulb at the song of the wind which came racing over the lonesome bitter northward waste of tundra he held the centre of the floor at the northern club and proclaimed his modest virtues in a voice as pleasant as the cough of a bullwalrus yes me little georgie i did it ive licked em all from herschel island to dutch harbour big uns and little uns when they didnt suit i made em over im the boss carpenter of the arctic and i own this camp dont i slim hey answer me he roared at the emaciated bearer of the title whose attention seemed wandering from the inventory of georges startling traits toward a card game sure ye do nervously smiled slim frightened out of a heartsolo as he returned to his surroundings well then listen to what im saying im the big chief of the village and when im stimulated and happy them fellers i dont like hides out and lets me and nature operate things aint that right he glared inquiringly at his friends red the proprietor explained over the bar in a whisper to captain the new man from dawson thats big george the whaler hes a squawman and sort of a bully see when hes sober hes on the level strickly an we all likes him fine but when he gets to fightin the painkiller he aint altogether a gentleman will he fight oh will he fight say hes there with chimes he is why doc millers made a grubstake rebuildin fellers thats had a lingerin doubt cached away about that an now when he gets the booze up his nose them patchedup guys oozes away an hibernates till the gas dies out in him afterwards hes sore on himself an apologizes to everybody dont get into no trouble with him cause hes two checks past the limit they dont make em as bad as him any more he busted the mould george turned and spying the newcomer approached eyeing him with critical disfavour captain saw a bearlike figure clad capapie in native fashion reindeer pants with the hair inside clothed legs like rock pillars while out of the loose squirrel parka a corded neck rose brown and strong above which darkly gleamed a rugged face seamed and scarred by the hate of arctic winters he had kicked off his deerskin socks and stood barefooted on the cold and draughty floor while the poison he had imbibed showed only in his heated face silently he extended a cracked and hardened hand which closed like the armoured claw of a crustacean and tightened on the crunching fingers of the other captains expression remained unchanged and gradually slackening his grip the sailor roughly inquired whered you come from just got in from dawson yesterday politely responded the stranger well whatre you goin to do now youre here he demanded stake some claims and go to prospecting i guess you see i wanted to get in early before the rush next spring oh i spose youre going to jump some of our ground hey well you aint we dont want no claim jumpers here disagreeably continued the seaman we wont stand for it this is my camp see i own it and these is my little children then as the other refused to debate with him he resumed groping for a new ground of attack say ill bet youre one of them eddicated dudes too aint you you talk like a feller that had been to college and as the other assented he scornfully called to his friends saying look here fellers pipe the jellyfish i never see one of these here animals that was worth a cuss they plays football an smokes cigareets at school then when theyre weaned they come off up here an jump our claims cause we cant write a location notice proper they aint no good i guess ill stop it captain moved toward the door but the whaler threw his bulky frame against it and scowlingly blocked the way no you dont you aint goin to run away till ive had the next dance mister eddication humph i aint begun to tell ye yet what a useless little barnacle you are red interfered saying look ere george this guy aint no playmate of yourn well all have a jolt of this disturbance promoter an call it off then as the others approached he winked at captain and jerked his head slightly toward the door the latter heeding the signal started out but george leaped after him and seizing an arm whirled him back roaring well of all the cussed impidence i ever see youre too hightoned to drink with us are you you dont get out of here now till you take a lickin like a man he reached over his head and grasping the hood of his fur shirt with one movement he stripped it from him exposing a massive naked body whose muscles swelled and knotted beneath a skin as clear as a maidens while a map of angry scars strayed across the heavy chest as the shirt sailed through the air red lightly vaulted to the bar and diving at georges naked middle tackled beautifully crying to captain get out quick well hold him others rushed forward and grasped the bulky sailor but captains voice replied i sort of like this place and i guess ill stay a while turn him loose why man hell kill ye excitedly cried slim get out the captive hurled his peacemakers from him and shaking off the clinging arms drove furiously at the insolent stranger in the cramped limits of the corner where he stood captain was unable to avoid the big man who swept him with a crash against the plank door at his back grasping hungrily at his throat as his shoulders struck however he dropped to his knees and before the raging george could seize him he avoided a blow which would have strained the rivets of a strengthtester and ducked under the others arms leaping to the cleared centre of the floor seldom had the big mans rush been avoided and whirling he swung a boomlike arm at the agile stranger before it landed captain stepped in to meet his adversary and with the weight of his body behind the blow drove a clenched and bony fist crashing into the others face the big head with its blazing shock of hair snapped backward and the whaler drooped to his knees at the others feet the drunken flush of victory swept over captain as he stood above the swaying figure then suddenly he felt the great bare arms close about his waist with a painful grip he struck at the bleeding face below him and wrenched at the circling bands which wheezed the breath from his lungs but the whaler squeezed him writhing to his breast and rising unsteadily wheeled across the floor and in a shiver of broken glass fell crashing against the bar and to the floor as the struggling men writhed upon the planks the door opened at the hurried entrance of an excited group which paused at the sight of the ruin then rushing forward tore the men apart the panting berserker strained at the arms about his glistening body while captain with sobbing sighs relieved his aching lungs and watched his enemy who frothed at the interference it was georges fault explained slim to the questions of the arrivals this feller tried to make a getaway but george had to have his amusement a newcomer addressed the squawman in a voice as cold as the wind cut this out george this is a friend of mine youre making this camp a regular hell for strangers and now im goin to tap your little snap cool off see joness reputation as a bad gunman went hand in hand with his name as a good gambler and his scanty remarks invariably evoked attentive answers so george explained i dont like him jones and i was jus makin him over to look like a man ill do it yet too he flashed wrathfully at his quiet antagonist pears to me like hes took a hand in the remodelling himself replied the gambler but if youre lookin for something to do heres your chance windy jim just drove in and says barton and kid sullivan are adrift on the ice whats that questioned eager voices and forgetting the recent trouble at the news the crowd pressed forward anxiously they was crossing the bay and got carried out by the offshore gale explained jones windy was follerin em when the ice ahead parted and begun movin out he tried to yell to em but they was too far away to hear in the storm he managed to get back to the land and follered the shore ice around hes over at hunters cabin now most dead face and hands froze pretty bad a torrent of questions followed and many suggestions as to the fate of the men theyll freeze before they can get ashore said one the icepackll break up in this wind added another and if they dont drown theyll freeze before the floe comes in close enough for them to land from the first announcement of his friends peril captain had been thinking rapidly his body sore from his long trip and aching from the hug of his recent encounter cried woefully for rest but his voice rose calm and clear weve got to get them off he said who will go with me three is enough the clamouring voices ceased and the men wheeled at the sound gazing incredulously at the speaker what in this storm youre crazy many voices said he gazed appealingly at the faces before him brave and adventurous men he knew them to be jesting with death and tempered to perils in this land where hardship rises with the dawn but they shook their ragged heads hopelessly we must save them resumed captain hotly barton and i played as children together and if theres not a man among you whos got the nerve to follow me ill go alone by heavens in the silence of the room he pulled the cap about his ears and tying it snugly under his chin drew on his huge fur mittens then with a scornful laugh he turned toward the door he paused as his eye caught the swollen face of big george blood had stiffened in the heavy creases of his face like rusted stringers in a ledge while his mashed and discoloured lips protruded thickly his hair gleamed red and the sweat had dried upon his naked shoulders streaked with dirt and flecked with spots of blood yet the battered features shone with the unconquered fearless light of a rough strong man captain strode to him with outstretched hand youre a man he said youve got the nerve george and youll go with me wont you what me questioned the sailor vaguely his wondering glance left captain and drifted round the circle of shamed and silent faces then he straightened stiffly and cried will i go with you certainly ill go to with you ready hands harnessed the dogs dragged from protected nooks where they sought cover from the storm which moaned and whistled round the low houses endless ragged folds of sleet whirled out of the north then writhed and twisted past vanishing into the grey veil which shrouded the landscape in a twilight gloom the fierce wind sank the cold into the aching flesh like a knife and stiffened the face to a whitening mask while a fusillade of frozen iceparticles beat against the eyeballs with blinding fury as captain emerged from his cabin furred and hooded he found a long train of crouching whining animals harnessed and waiting while muffled figures stocked the sled with robes and food and stimulants big george approached through the whirling white a great squat figure with fluttering squirrel tails blowing from his parka and at his heels there trailed a figure skinclad and dainty its my wife he explained briefly to captain she wont let me go alone they gravely bade farewell to all and the little crowd cheered lustily against the whine of the blizzard as with cracking whip and hoarse shouts they were wrapped in the cloudy winding sheet of snow arctic storms have an even sameness the intense cold the heartless wind which augments tenfold the chill of the temperature the air thick and dark with stinging flakes rushing by in an endless cloud a drifting freezing shifting eternity of snow driven by a ravening gale which sweeps the desolate bald wastes of the northland the little party toiled through the smother till they reached the egloos under the breast of the tall coast bluffs where coughing eskimos drilled patiently at ivory tusks and gambled the furs from their backs at studhorse poker to georges inquiries they answered that their largest canoe was the threeholed bidarka on the cache outside owing to the small circular openings in its deck this was capable of holding but three passengers and captain said well have to make two trips george two trips eh answered the other well be doin well if we last through one im thinking lashing the unwieldy burden upon the sled they fought their way along the coast again till george declared they were opposite the point where their friends went adrift they slid their light craft through the ragged wall of ice hummocks guarding the shore pack and dimly saw in the grey beyond them a stretch of angry waters mottled by drifting cakes and floes george spoke earnestly to his wife instructing her to keep the team in constant motion up and down the coast a rifleshot in either direction and to listen for a signal of the return then he picked her up as he would a babe and she kissed his stormbeaten face shes been a good squaw to me he said as they pushed their dancing craft out into the breath of the gale and ive always done the square thing by her i spose shell go back to her people now though the wind hurried them out from land while it drove the seawater in freezing spray over their backs and changed their fur garments into scaly armour as they worked through the ice cakes peering with strained eyes for a sign of their friends the sailor with deft strokes steered them between the grinding bergs raising his voice in lone signals like the weird cry of a siren twisting back and forth through the floes they held to their quest now floating with the wind now paddling desperately in a race with some drifting mass which dimly towered above them and splintered hungrily against its neighbour close in their wake captain emptied his sixshooter till his numbed fingers grew rigid as the trigger and always at his back swelled the deep shouts of the sailor who with practised eye and mighty strokes forced their way through the closing lanes between the jaws of the ice pack at last beaten and tossed they rested disheartened and hopeless then as they drifted a sound struggled to them against the wind a faint cry illusive and fleeting as a dream voice and still doubting they heard it again thank god well save em yet cried captain and they drove the canoe boiling toward the sound barton and sullivan had fought the cold and wind stoutly hour after hour till they found their great floe was breaking up in the heaving waters then the horror of it had struck the kid till he raved and cursed up and down their little island as it dwindled gradually to a small acre he had finally yielded to the weight of the cold which crushed resistance out of him and settled despairing and listless upon the ice barton dragged him to his feet and forced him round their rocking prison begging him to brace up to fight it out like a man till the other insisted on resting and dropped to his seat again the older man struck deliberately at the whitening face of his freezing companion who recognized the wellmeant insult and refused to be roused into activity then to their ears had come the faint cries of george and in answer to their screams through the gloom they beheld a long covered skin canoe and the anxious faces of their friends captain rose from his cramped seat and ripping his crackling garments from the boat where they had frozen he wriggled out of the hole in the deck and grasped the weeping barton come come old boy its all right now he said oh charlie charlie cried the other i might have known youd try to save us youre just in time though for the kids about all in sullivan apathetically nodded and sat down again hurry up there this aint no g a r encampment and you aint got no time to spare said george who had dragged the canoe out and with a paddle broke the sheets of ice which covered it itll be too dark to see anything in half an hour the night hastened by the storm was closing rapidly and they realized another need of haste for even as they spoke a crack had crawled through the icefloe where they stood and widening as it went left but a heaving cake supporting them george spoke quietly to captain while barton strove to animate the kid you and barton must take him ashore and hurry him down to the village hes most gone now but you questioned the other well have to come back for you as soon as we put him ashore never mind me roughly interrupted george its too late to get back here when you get ashore itll be dark besides sullivans freezing and youll have to rush him through quick ill stay here no no george cried the other as the meaning of it bore in upon him i got you into this thing and its my place to stay here you must go but the big man had hurried to sullivan and seizing him in his great hands shook the drowsy one like a rat cursing and beating a goodly share of warmth back into him then he dragged the listless burden to the canoe and forced him to a seat in the middle opening come come he cried to the others you cant spend all night here if you want to save the kid youve got to hurry you take the front seat there barton and as he did so george turned to the protesting captain shut up curse you and get in i wont do it rebelled the other i cant let you lay down your life in this way when i made you come george thrust a cold face within an inch of the others and grimly said if they hadnt stopped me id beat you into dogmeat this morning and if you dont quit this snivelling ill do it yet now get in there and paddle to beat or youll never make it back quick ill come back for you then george if i live to the shore captain cried while the other slid the burdened canoe into the icy waters as they drove the boat into the storm captain realized the difficulty of working their way against the gale on him fell the added burden of holding their course into the wind and avoiding the churning ice cakes the spray whipped into his face like shot and froze as it clung to his features he strained at his paddle till the sweat soaked out of him and the cold air filled his aching lungs unceasingly the merciless frost cut his face like a keen blade till he felt the numb paralysis which told him his features were hardening under the touch of the cold an arms length ahead the shoulders of the kid protruded from the deck hole where he had sunk again into the death sleep while barton in the forward seat leaned wearily on his iceclogged paddle moaning as he strove to shelter his face from the sting of the blizzard an endless time they battled with the storm slowly gaining foot by foot till in the darkness ahead they saw the wall of shore ice and swung into its partial shelter dragging the now unconscious sullivan from the boat captain rolled and threshed him while barton too weak and exhausted to assist feebly strove to warm his stiffened limbs in answer to their signals the team appeared maddened by the lash of the squaw then they wrapped sullivan in warm robes and forced scorching brandy down his throat till he coughed weakly and begged them to let him rest you must hurry him to the indian village directed captain hell only lose some fingers and toes now maybe but youve got to hurry arent you coming too queried barton well hire some eskimos to go after george ill pay em anything no im going back to him now hed freeze before we could send help and besides they wouldnt come out in the storm and the dark but you cant work that big canoe alone if you get out there and dont find him youll never get back charlie let me go too he said then apologized im afraid i wont last though im too weak the squaw who had questioned not at the absence of her lord now touched captains arm come she said i go with you then addressing barton you quick go indian house white man die mebbe quick i go big george ah charlie im afraid youll never make it cried barton and wringing his friends hand he staggered into the darkness behind the sled wherein lay the furbundled sullivan captain felt a horror of the starving waters rise up in him and a panic shook him fiercely till he saw the silent squaw waiting for him at the ice edge he shivered as the wind searched through his dampened parka and hardened the wet clothing next to his body but he took his place and dug the paddle fiercely into the water till the waves licked the hair of his gauntlets the memory of that scudding trip through the darkness was always cloudy and visioned periods of keen alertness alternated with moments when his weariness bore upon him till he stiffly bent to his work wondering what it all meant it was the womans sharpened ear which caught the first answering cry and her hands which steered the intricate course to the heaving berg where the sailor crouched for at their approach captain had yielded to the drowse of weariness and in his relief at the finding the blade floated from his listless hands he dreamed quaint dreams broken by the chilling lash of spray from the strokes of the others as they drove the craft back against the wind and he only partly awoke from his lethargy when george wrenched him from his seat and forced him down the rough trail toward warmth and safety soon however the stagnant blood tingled through his veins and under the shelter of the bluffs they reached the village where they found the anxious men waiting skilful natives had worked the frost from sullivans members and the stimulants in the sled had put new life into barton as well so as the three crawled wearily through the dogfilled tunnel of the egloo they were met by two weteyed and thankful men who silently wrung their hands or uttered broken words when they had been despoiled of their frozen furs and the welcome heat of whisky and fire had met in their blood captain approached the whaler who rested beside his mate george youre the bravest man i ever knew and your woman is worthy of you he said he continued slowly im sorry about the fight this morning too the big man rose and crushing the extended palm in his grasp said well just let that go double partner youre as game as i ever see then he added it was too bad them fellers interferred jest when they did but we can finish it up whenever you say and as the other smiling shook his head he continued well im glad of it cause youd sure beat me the next time where northern lights come down o nights the mission house at togiak stands forlornly on a windswept alaskan spit while huddled around it a swarm of dirtcovered igloos grovel in an ecstacy of abasement many natives crawled out of these and stared across the bay as down a gully came an arctic caravan men and dogs black against the deadly whiteness ahead swung the guide straddling awkwardly on his five foot webs while the straining pack pattered at his heels big george the driver urged them with strong words idioms of the northland and his long whip bit sharply at their legs his companion clinging to the sled stumbled now and then while his face splitting from the snap of the frost was smothered in a muffler sometimes he fell plunging into the snow rising painfully and groaning with the misery of snowblindness most there now cap keep up your grit im all right answered the afflicted man wearily dont mind me george too had suffered from the sheen of the unbroken whiteness and while his eyes had not wholly closed he saw but dimly his cheeks were greasesmeared and blackened with charred wood to break the snowglare but through his mask showed signs of suffering while his bloodshot eyes dripped scalding tears and throbbed distressfully for days he had not dared to lose sight of the guide once he had caught him sneaking the dogs away and he feared he had killed the man for a time now jaska broke trail ahead his sullen swollen features baleful in their injury down the steep bank they slid across the humped up sea ice at the river mouth and into the village at the greeting of their guide to his tribesmen george started twelve years of coast life had taught him the dialect from point barrow south and he glanced at captain to find whether he too had heard the message as jaska handed a talisman to the chief he strode to him and snatched it oho its father orloff is it d him he gazed at the token a white spruce chip with strange marks and carvings what does it mean george said the blind man its a long story charlie and black you should have known it before we started im a marked man in this coast country its orloffs work the renegade father he calls himself father to these devils he rules and robs for himself in the name of the church his hate is bitter and hed have my life if these waterylivered curs didnt dread the sound of my voice god help him when we meet he shook his hairy claws at the hostile circle then cried to the chief in the native tongue oh shaman we come bleeding and weary hunger grips us and our bones are stiff with frost the light is gone from my brothers eyes and we are sick open you the door to the mission house that the minoks may rest and grow strong the indians clustered before the portal with its rude cross above and stared malignantly while the chief spoke at the name of his enemy the unsightly eyes of george gleamed and he growled contemptuously advancing among them they scattered at the manner of his coming and he struck the padlocked door till it rattled stiffly then spying the cross overhead he lifted up and gripped the wood it came away ripping and with wails of rage and horror at the sacrilege they closed about him here cap bust her in quick he dragged captain before the entrance thrusting the weapon upon him then ran ferociously among the people he snatched them to him cuffing like a bear and trampling them into the snow those who came into the reach of his knotty arms crumpled up and twisted under his feet he whirled into the group roaring hoarsely his angry greaseblackened face hideous with rage the aborigine is not a fighting machine for him the sidestep and counter have no being they melted ahead of his blazing wrath and he whisked them fleeing by their garments so that they felt the stamp of his moccasined heels captain dragged the team within and george following blocked the shattered door were safe as long as we stay in the church said he right of sanctuary eh does it occur to you how were going to get out never mind well get out somehow said he and that night as charlie captain late university man and engineer lay with eyes swathed in steaming cloths the whaler spoke operosely and with the bitterness of great wrong it happened when we rocked the bars of forty mile before ever a chechako had crossed the chilcoot i went over to the headwaters of the tanana into the big valley i went and got lost in the flats tis a wild country rimmed by high mountains full of niggerheads and tundra with the river windin clean back to the source of the copper i run out of grub we always did them days and built a raft to float down to the yukon a race with starvation and a dead heat it near proved too though i had a shade the best of it i drifted out into the main river ravin mad my mukluks eat off and my moosehide gun cover inside of me a girl spied me from the village and twas her brought me ashore in her birchbark and tended me in her wickiup till reason came and the blood ran through me again i mind seein a white man stand around at times and hearin him beg her to leave me to the old squaws she didnt though she gave me bits of moose meat and berries and dried salmon and when i come to one day i saw she was little and brown and pleadin and her clothes all covered with beads her eyes was big and sad cap and dimples poked into her cheeks when she laughed twas then that orloff takes a hand the white man a priest he called himself breed russian maybe he was but a blacker hearted thief never wronged a child he wanted the girl metla and so did i when i asked her old man for her he said she was promised to the russian i laughed at him and a chief hates to be mocked you know what sway the church has over these indians well orloff is a strong man he held em like a rock he worked on em till one day the tribemen came to me in a body and said go give me the girl and i will says i orloff sneered she was mine for a month before ye came says he with the fiend showin back of his eyes do ye want her now for a minute i believed him i struck once to kill and he went down they closed on me as fast as i shook em off twas a beautiful sight for a ruction on the high banks over the river but i was like water from the sickness i fought to get at their priest where he lay to stamp out his grinning face before they downed me but i was beat back to the bluff and i battled with my heels over the edge i broke a pole from the fishrack and a good many went down then i heard metla calling softly from below jump she said big one jump she had loosed a canoe at the landing and now held it in the boiling current underneath paddling desperately as they ran out of the tents with their rifles i leaped a long drop and cold water but i hit feet first when i rose the little girl was alongside its a ticklish thing to crawl over the stern of a canoe in the spatter of slugs with the roar of muzzleloaders above its shakin to the nerves but the maid never flinched not even when a bullet split the gunnel she ripped a piece of her dress and plugged a hole under the water line while i paddled out of range the next winter at holy cross she ran to me shaking one day he is here he is here oh big man i am afraid whos here says i he is here father orloff and her eyes was round and scared so that i took her up and kissed her while she clung to me she was such a little girl he spoke to me at the waterhole i have come for you i ran very fast but he came behind where is george he said i went out of the cabin down to the mission and into the house of father barnum he was there orloff what do ye want i says father barnum speaks up hes known for a good man the length of the river george says he father orloff tells me you stole the girl metla from her tribe tis a shameful thing for a white to take a red girl for his wife but its a crime to live as you do what says i we cant sell you provisions nor allow you to stay in the village orloff grins you must go on he says or give her up no ill do neither and i shows the paper from the missionary at nulato statin that we were married shes my wife says i and too good for me shes left her people and her gods and ill care for her i saw how it hurt orloff and i laid my hand on his shoulder close to the neck i distrust ye and sure as fate yell die the shocking death if ever harm comes to the little one that was the winter of the famine though every winter was the same then and i went to anvik for grub took all the strong men and dogs in the village i was afraid when i left too for twas the time i should have been with her but there was no one else to go when you come back she said there will be another a little boy and he will grow mighty and strong like his father she hung her arms around me cap and i left with her kisses warm on my lips it was a terrible trip the river wet with overflows and the cutoffs drifted deep so i drove back into holy cross a week late with bleedin dogs and frozen indians strainin at the sled ropes i heard the wail of the old women before i come to the cabin and when metla had sobbed the story out in her weakness i went back into the dark and down to the mission i remember how the northern lights flared over the hills above and the little spruces on the summit looked to me like headstones black against the moon and i laughed when i saw the snow red in the night glare for it meant blood and death it was as lusty a babe as ever crowed but orloff had come to the sick bed and sent her squaws away baptism and such things he said hed do the little fellow died that night they say the mission door was locked and barred but i pushed through it like paper and came into father barnums house where they sat fifty below is bad for the naked flesh i broke in bareheaded mittenless and id froze some on the way down he saw murder in my eyes and tried to run but i got him as he went out of the room he tore his throat loose from my stiffened fingers and went into the church but i beat down the door with my naked fists mocking at his prayers inside and may i never be closer to death than orloff was that night then a squaw tugged at my parka she is dying anguk she said and i ran back up the hill with the cold bitin at my heart there was no death that night in holy cross though god knows one naked soul was due to walk out onto the snow at daylight when i came back for him he had fled down the river with the fastest dogs and to this day ive never seen his face though tis often ive felt his hate hes grown into the strongest missionary on the coast and he never lets a chance go by to harry me or the girl dye mind the time skagway bennet died we was pardners up norton sound way when he was killed they thought he suicided but i know i found a cariboo belt in the brush near camp the kind they make on the kuskokwim father orions country his men took the wrong one thats all im sorry i didnt tell ye this cap before we started for now were into the south country where he owns the natives he knows weve come as the bloodtoken of the guide showed he wants my life and theres great trouble comin up im hopin yell soon get your sight for by now theres a runner twenty miles into the hills with news that were blind in the church at togiak three days hell be goin and on the fifth yell hear the jangle of russian dogbells hell kill the fastest team in nushagak in the comin and god help us if were here george scraped a bit of frostlace from the lone window pane dark figures moved over the snow circling the chapel and he knew that each was armed only their reverence for the church held them from doing the task set by orloff and he sighed as he changed the bandages on his suffering mate they awoke the next morning to the moan of wind and the sift of snow clouds past their walls staring through his peephole george distinguished only a seethe of whirling flakes that greyed the view blotting even the neighbouring huts and when the early evening brought a rising note in the storm the trouble lifted from his face a threeday blizzard he rejoiced and the strongest team on the coast cant wallow through it under a week these onshore gales is beauts for three days the wind tore from off the sea into the open bight at whose head lay togiak and its violence wrecked the armour of shore ice in the bay till it beat and roared against the spit a threshing maelstrom of shattered bergs the waters piled into the inlet driven by the lash of the storm till they overflowed the river ice behind the village submerging and breaking it into ragged dangerous confusion on the third day with arctic vagary the wind gasped reluctantly and scurried over the range in its wake the surging ocean churned loudly and the backwater behind the town held by the dam of freezing slushice at the river mouth was skimmed by a thin icepaper pierced here and there by the upended piles from beneath this held the nights snow so that morning showed the village girt on three sides by a stream softcarpeted and safe to the eye but failing beneath the feet of a child youre eyes are comin along mighty slow worried george im hopin his reverence is up to his gills in drifts back yonder we must leave him a sled trail for a souvenir how can we with the place guarded hitch the dogs and run for it by night hell burn us out when he comes fine targets wed make on the snow by the light of a burning shack if ye can see to shoot well go tonight hello whats that outside came the howl of malamoots and the cry of men leaping to the window george rubbed it free and stared into the sunshine too late too late he said here he comes its time i killed him he spoke gratingly with the dull anger of years on the bright surface of the opposite hillside a sled bearing a muffled figure appeared silhouetted against the glisten of the crust its team maddened by the village scent poured down the incline toward the river bank and the guide swung onto the runners behind while the voice of the people rose to their priest in a whirl of soft snow they drove down onto the treachery of the ice the screams of the natives frenzied the pack and they rioted out onto the bending sheet while the long sledge borne by its momentum shot forward till the splitting cry of the ice sounded over the lamentations it slackened sagged and disappeared in a surge of congealing waters the wheel dogs were dragged into the opening and their mates ahead jerked backward onto them in a fighting tangle all settled into the swirl orloff leaped from the sinking sled but hindered by his fur swaddling crashed through and lunged heavily in his struggles to mount the edge of the film as he floundered onto the caving surface it let him back and the waters covered him time and again he pitched oddly about and for the first time they saw his eyes were bound tightly with bandages which he strove to loosen my god hes snowblind cried george and in a moment he appeared among the frantic mob fringing the shore the guide broke his way toward a hummock of old ice forming an islet near by and the priest half swam half scrambled behind till they crawled out upon this solid footing here the wintry wind searched them and their dripping clothes stiffened quickly orloff dragged the strips from his face and as the sun glitter pierced his eyes he writhed as though seared by the naked touch of hot steel he shouted affrightedly in his blindness but the mocking voice of big george answered him and he cowered at the malevolence in the words here i am orloff its help ye want is it ill shoot the man that tries to reach ye ha ha youre freezin eh georgie will talk to keep ye awake a dirty trick of the river to cheat me so ive fattened for years on the hope of stampin your life out and now its robbed me but ill stick till yere safe in hell the man cried piteously turning his bleared eyes toward the sound shoot why dont you and end it cant you see were freezing he stood up in his carapace of stiffened clothes shivering palsiedly the truest thing ye ever said cried george and he swung his colts into view itll favour you and ill keep my vow he raised the gun the splashing of the distant dogs broke the silence a native knelt stiffly george george captain had stumbled down among them and plucked at his arm peering dimly into his distorted face great god are you a murderer theyll be dead before we can save them save em said george while reason fought with his mania whose goin to save em he needs killin im hungry for his life hes a man george theyre both human and theyre dying in sight of us give him a chance fight like a man as he spoke the fury fell away from the whaler and he became the alert strong man of the frontier knowing the quick danger and meeting it he bellowed at the natives and they fled backward before his voice storming the cache where lay the big skin canoes they slid one down and seizing paddles crushed the ice around it till it floated then supported by the prow george stamped the ice into fragments ahead and they forced their way slowly along the channel he made soaked to the armpits he smashed a trail through which they reached the hummock where the others lay too listless for action at the shore they bore the priest to their shelter while the guide was snatched into a nearby hut they hacked off his brittle clothes and supported him to the bed as he walked his feet clattered on the board floor like the sound of wooden shoes they were white and solid as were his hands hes badly frozen whispered captain can we save him they rubbed and thawed for hours but the sluggish blood refused to flow into the extremities and captain felt that this man would die for lack of amputation through all the russian was silent gazing strangely at george tis no use finally said the big man despairingly ive seen too many of em weve done our best he disappeared and there sounded the jingle of harness as the dogs were hitched as he entered for the camp outfit orloff spoke george brace ive harmed you bitterly these many years and youre a good man to help me so its no use we have both fought the cold death and know when to quit i came here to kill you but you will go out across the mountains free while i rave in madness and the medicine men make charms over me when you come into bethel mission ill be dead goodbye good hell were takin ye to bethel and a doctor in ten minutes a weeks travel as the trail goes but well save a chunk of ye yet old man five days later a broken team crawled over the snow to the moravian mission urged by two men gaunt from the trail and blistered by the cold from the sledge came shrieks and throaty mutterings horrid gabblings of postfreezing madness and dr forrest lifting back the robe found orloff lashed into his couch five days from togiak two hundred miles in heavy trails explained george wearily as the cries of the maniac dimmed behind the log walls two hours later forrest spoke gravely as they nursed their frost bites in his room we have operated he will recover its a sad sad day mourned george it just takes the taste out of everything for me hes a cripple now eh yes helpless i did not know father orloff had many er friends hereabout continued the doctor he was thought to be hated by the whites im glad the report was wrong friends be damned said the other strongly whats a friend ye can get them any place but where can ye find another enemy like that man the scourge coming down coast from the kotzebue country they stumbled onto the little camp in the early winter and as there was food a plenty of its kind whereas they had subsisted for some days on puree of seal oil and short ribs of dog captain and big george decided to winter a maxim of the north teaches to cabin by a grubpile it was an odd village they beheld that first day instead of the clean mosschinked log shelters men were wont to build in this land they found the community housed like marmots in holes and burrows it seemed that the troop had landed fresh from the states a hundred and a quarter strong hot with the lust for gold yet shaken by the newspaper horrors of alaskas rigorous hardships and forbidding climate debouching in the early fall they had hastily prepared for an associated presspainted arctic winter had they been forced to winter in the mountains of idaho or among montanas passes they would have prepared simply and effectively here however in a mystic land surrounded by the unknown they grew panic stricken and lost their wits thus when the two old timers came upon them in the early winter they found them in bombproof hovels sunk into the muck banked with log walls and thatched over with dirt and sod where are your windows and ventilators they were asked and collectively the camp laughed at the question they knew how to keep snug and warm even if halfwitted sourdoughs didnt they werent taking any chances on freezing not on your tintype no outdoor work and exposure for them as the winter settled they snuggled back ate three meals and more daily of bacon beans and bakingpowder bread playing cribbage for an appetite they undertook no exercise more violent than sevenup while the woodcutting fell as a curse upon those unfortunates who lost at the game they giggled at captain and the big whaler who daily snow or blow hit the trail or wielded pick and shovel however as the two maintained their practice the camp grew to resent their industry and as is possible only in utterly idle communities there sprung up a virulence totally out of proportion and founded without reason most difficult to dispel before they knew it the two were disliked and distrusted their presence ignored their society shunned captain had talked to many in the camp youll get scurvy sure living in these dark houses theyre damp and dirty and you dont exercise besides there isnt a pound of fresh grub in camp figuratively the camps nose had tilted at this and it stated pompously that it were better to preserve its classic purity of features and pro rata of toes than to jeopardize these adjuncts through fear of a possible blood disease blood disease eh george snorted like a sealion wait till your legs get black and you spit your teeth out like plumpits mebbe youll listen then itll come see if it dont he was right yet when the plague did grip the camp and men died one in five they failed to rise to it instead of fighting manfully they lapsed into a frightened stubborn coma there was one and only one who did not klusky the jew klusky the pariah they said he worked just to be ornery and different from the rest he hated them so they enjoyed baiting him to witness his fury it sated that taint of roman cruelty inherent in the man of ignorance he was all the amusement they had for it wasnt policy to stir up the two others they might slop over and clean up the village so they continued to goad him as they had done since leaving frisco they gibed and jeered till he shunned them living alone in the fringe of the pines bitter and vicious as an outcast from the pack will grow whether human or lupine he frequented only the house of captain and george because they were exiles like himself the partners did not relish this overmuch for he was an odious being avaricious carping and dirty his face reminds me of a tool said george once nose an chin shuts up like calipers hes got the forehead of a salmon trout an his chin dont retreat it stampedes plumb down agin his apple look out for that droop of the mouth ive seen it before an his eyes is bad too theyve stirred him up an pickled all the good he ever had some day hell do a murder i wonder what he means by always saying hell have revenge before spring it makes me creep to hear him cackle and gloat i think hes going crazy cant tell this bunch would bust anybodys mental tugs an they make a mistake drivin him so say hows my gums look tonight george stretched his lips back showing his teeth while captain made careful examination all right how are mine red as a berry every day they searched thus for the symptoms looking for discolouration and anxiously watching bruises on limb or body men live in fear when their comrades vanish silently from their midst each night upon retiring they felt legs nervously punching here and there to see that the flesh retained its resiliency so insidious is the maladys approach that it may be detected only thus a lassitude perhaps a rheumatic laziness or pains and swelling at the joints mayhap one notes a puttylike softness of the lower limbs where he presses the finger mark remains filling up sluggishly no mental depression at first nor fever only a drooping ambition fatigue enlarging parts now gradual now sudden the grim humour of seeing grown men gravely poking their legs with rigid digits or grinning anxiously into handmirrors had struck some of the tenderfeet at first but the implacable progress of the disease its black merciless presence pausing destructively here and there had terrorized them into a hopeless fatalism till they cowered helplessly awaiting its touch one night captain announced to his partner im going over to the frenchmens i hear menard is down whats the use of buttin in where ye aint wanted as fer me them frogeaters can all die like salmon i wont go nigh em an ive told em so i give em good advice an whatd i get whatd that daffy doctor do poohpoohed at me an physiced them lord physic a man with scurvy might as well bleed a patient fer amputation george spoke with considerable heat captain pulled his parka hood well down so that the foxtails around the edge protected his features and stepped out into the evening he had made several such trips in the past few months to call on men smitten with the sickness but all to no effect being chechakos they were supreme in their conceit and refused to heed his advice returning at bed time he found his partner webbing a pair of snowshoes by the light of a stinking godevil consisting of a string suspended in a can of molten grease the camp had sold them grub but refused the luxury of candles noting his gravity george questioned well hows menard dead captain shook himself as though at the memory it was awful he died while i was talking to him dont say hows that i found him propped up in a chair he looked bad but said he was feeling fine thats the way they go ive seen it many a time feelin fine plumb to the last hed been telling me about a bet he had with promont promont was taken last week too you know same time menard bet him twenty dollars that hed outlast him im getting all right says he but poor promonts going to die ill get his twenty sure i turned to josh with the boy a bit an when i spoke to menard he didnt answer his jaw had sagged and hed settled in his chair promont saw it too and cackled hi ave win de bet hi ave win de bet thats all he just slid off gee it was horrible george put by his work and swore pacing the rough pole floor oh the cussed fools that makes six dead from the one cabin six from eighteen an promontll make seven tomorrow do ye mind how we begged em to quit that dugout an build a white mans house an drink spruce tea an work theyre too lazy they lie around in that hole breath bad air an rot and just to think if we only had a crate of potatoes in camp we could save every man jack of em lord they never even brought no citric acid nor lime juice nothin if we hadnt lost our grub when the whaleboat upset eh that tengallon keg of booze would help some say i got such a thirst i dont never expect to squench it proper he spoke plaintively klusky was here again while you was gone too i itch to choke that jew whenever he gets to ravin over these people hes sure losin his paystreak he gritted his teeth an foamed like a mad malamoot i never see a lowdowner lookin aspect than him when he gets mad ill make em come to me says he on their bellies beggin it aint time yet oh no wait till half of em is dead an the rest is rotten with scurvy then theyll crawl to me with their gums thick and black an their flesh like dough theyll kiss my feet an cry an ill stamp em into the snow youd ought a heard him laugh some day im goin to lay a hand on that man right in my own house as they prepared for bed captain remarked by the way speaking of potatoes i heard tonight that there was a crate in the frenchmens outfit somewhere put in by mistake perhaps but when they boated their stuff up river last fall it couldnt be found must have been lost it was some days later that returning from a gameless hunt captain staggered into camp weary from the drag of his snowshoes throwing himself into his bunk he rested while george prepared the meagre meal of brown beans fried salt pork and sourdough bread the excellence of this last due to the whalers years of practice did much to mitigate the unpleasantness of the milkless butterless sugarless menu captains fatigue prevented notice of the others bearing however when he had supped and the dishes were done george spoke quietly and without emotion well boy the big thing has come off what do you mean for reply he took the grease dip and holding it close bared his teeth with a cry captain leaped from his bunk and took his face between his hands great god george he pushed back the lips livid blotches met his gaze the gums swollen and discoloured he dropped back sick and pale staring at his bulky comrade dazed and uncomprehending carefully replacing the lamp george continued i felt it comin quite a while back pains in my knees an all that thought mebbe youd notice me hobblin about i cant git around good feel sort of stove up an spavined on my feet yes yes but weve lived clean and exercised and drank spruce tea and everything cried the other i know but ive had a touch before its in my blood i reckon too much salt grub too many winters on the coast she never took me so sudden an vicious though guess the stuffs off dont talk that way said captain sharply youre not going to die i wont let you vats the mattaire came a leering voice and turning they beheld klusky the renegade he had entered silently as usual and now darted shrewd inquiring glances at them george has the scurvy oi oi oi vat a peety he seemed about to say more but refrained coming forward rubbing his hands nervously it aint possible that a sour dough shall have the scoivy well he has it has it bad but ill cure him yes and ill save this whole camp whether they want it or not captain spoke strongly his jaws set with determination klusky regarded him narrowly through close shrunk eyes while speculation wrinkled his low forehead of course yes but how shall it be eh tell me that his eagerness was pronounced ill go to st michaels and bring back fresh grub you cant do it boy said george its too far an there aint a dog in camp you couldnt haul your outfit alone an long before youd sledded grub back id be wearin one of them gleamin orioles i believe thats what they call it on my head like the pictures of them little fat angelettes i aint got no ear for music so ill have to cut out the harp solos quit that talk will you said captain irritably of course one man cant haul an outfit that far but two can so im going to take klusky with me he spoke with finality and the jew started gazing queerly well go light and drive back a herd of reindeer by thunder id clean forgot the reindeer the government was aimin to start a post there last fall wasnt it say mebbe you can make it after all kid his features brightened hopefully what d ye say klusky the one addressed answered nervously almost with excitement it cant be done it aint possible and i aint strong enough to pull the sled vy dont you and george go together ill stay captain laid a heavy hand on his shoulder thatll do what are you talking about george wouldnt last two days and you know it now listen you dont have to go you infernal greasy dog there are others in camp and one of them will go if i walk him at the muzzle of a gun i gave you first chance because weve been good to you now get out he snatched him from his seat and hurled him at the door where he fell in a heap klusky arose and although his eyes snapped wildly and he trembled he spoke insidiously with oily modulation vait a meenute meestaire captain vait a meenute i didnt say i vouldnt go oi oi vat a man shoor ill go coitenly you have been good to me and they have been devils i hope they die he shook a bony fist in the direction of the camp while his voice took on its fanatical shrillness they shall be in h before i help them the pigs but you ah you have been my friends yes all right be here at daylight said captain gruffly anger came slowly to him and its trace was even slower in its leaving i dont like him said george when he had slunk out he aint on the level watch him close boy hes up to some devilment keep up your courage old man ill be back in twelve days captain said it with decision though his heart sank as he felt the uncertainties before him george looked squarely into his eyes god bless ye boy he said ive cabined with many a man but never one like you im a hard old nut an i aint worth what youre goin to suffer but mebbe you can save these other idiots thats what were put here for to help them as is too ornery to help theirselves he smiled at captain and the young man left him blindly he seldom smiled and to see it now made his partners breast heave achingly good old george he murmured as they pulled out upon the river good old george as they passed from the settlement an indian came to the door of the last hovel hello theres a siwash in your cabin said captain what is he doing there thats all right rejoined klusky i told him to stay and vatch tings rather strange thought the other i wonder what there is to watch theres never been any stealing around here to the unversed a march by sled would seem simplicity in reality there is no more discouraging test than to hit the trail dogless and by strength of back the human biped cannot drag across the snow for any distance more than its own weight hence equipment is of the simplest at that the sledge rope galls ones neck with a continual endless yielding drag resulting in back pains peculiar to itself it is this eternal maddening pull with the pitiful crawling gait that tells horses labour and a snails pace the toil begets a perspiration which the cold solidifies midway through the garments at every pause the clammy clothes grow chill forcing one forward onward with sweating body and freezing face in extreme cold snow pulverizes dryly till steel runners drag as though slid through sand occasional overflows bar the stream from bank to bank resulting in wet feet and quick changes by hasty fires to save numb toes now the air is dead under a smother of falling flakes that fluff up ankle deep knee deep till the sled plunges along behind half buried while the men wallow and invent ingenious oaths again the wind whirls it by in grotesque goblin shapes wonderful storm beings writhing whipping biting as they pass erasing bank and mountain yet always there is that aching steady tug of the shoulderrope stopping circulation till the arms depend numbly and always the weary effort of trail breaking captain felt that he had never worked with a more unsatisfying team mate not that klusky did not pull he evidently did his best but he never spoke while the other grew ever conscious of the beady glittering eyes boring into his back at camp the jew watched him furtively sullenly till he grew to feel oppressed as with a sense of treachery or some fell design hidden far back every morning he secured the ropes next the sled thus forcing captain to walk ahead he did not object to the added task of breaking trail for he had expected the brunt of the work but the feeling of suspicion increased till it was only by conscious effort that he drove himself to turn his back upon the other and take up the journey it was this oppression that warned him on the third day leaning as he did against the sled ropes he became aware of an added burden as though the man behind had eased to shift his harness when it did not cease he glanced over his shoulder keyed up as he was this nervous agility saved him klusky held a revolver close up to his back and though he had unconsciously failed to pull he mechanically stepped in the others tracks the courage to shoot had failed him momentarily but as captain turned it came and he pulled the trigger frozen gun oil has caused grave errors in calculation the hammer curled back wickedly and stuck waiting his chance he had carried the weapon in an outer pocket where the frost had stiffened the grease had it been warmed next his body the fatal check would not have occurred even so he pulled again and it exploded sharp and deafening in the rarefied morning air in that instants pause however captain had whirled so that the bullet tore through the loose fur beneath his arm he struck simultaneously with the report and the gun flew outward disappearing in the snow they grappled and fell rolling in a tangle of rope klusky fighting with ratlike fury whining odd broken curses the larger man crushed him in silence beating him into the snow bent on killing him with his hands illustration they grappled and fell rolling in a tangle of rope as the others struggles diminished he came to himself however and desisted i cant kill him he thought in panic i cant go on alone get up he kicked the bleeding figure till it arose lamely why did you do that his desire to strangle the life from him was overpowering the man gave no answer muttering only unintelligible jargon his eyes ablaze with hatred tell me he shook him by the throat but received no reply nor could he try as he pleased only a stubborn silence at last disgusted and baffled he bade him resume the rope it was necessary to use force for this but eventually they took up the journey differing now only in their order of precedence if you make a move ill knife you he cautioned grimly that goes for the whole trip too at evening he searched the grub kit breaking knives and forks and those articles which might be used as means of offence throwing the pieces into the snow dont stir during the night or i might kill you i wake easy and hereafter well sleep together placing the weapons within his shirt he bound the others wrists and rolled up beside him along the coast their going became difficult from the rough ice and soft snow and with despair captain felt the days going by klusky maintained his muteness and moreover to the anger of his captor began to shirk it became necessary to beat him this captain did relentlessly deriving a certain satisfaction from it yet marvelling the while at his own cruelty the jew feigned weariness and began to limp as though footsore captain halted him at last dont try that game he said it dont go i spared your life for a purpose the minute you stop pulling that minute ill sink this into your ribs he prodded him with his sheath knife get along now or ill make you haul it alone he kicked him into resentful motion again for he had come to look upon him as an animal and was heedless of his signs of torture so thus they marched master and slave hes putting it on he thought but abuse as he might the others efforts became weaker and his agony more marked as the days passed the morning came when he refused to arise get up klusky shook his head get up i say captain spoke fiercely and snatched him to foot but with a groan the man sank back then at last he talked i cant do it i cant do it my legs make like they vont vork you can kill me but i cant valk as he ceased captain leaned down and pushed back his lips the teeth were loose and the gums livid great heavens what have i done what have i done he muttered klusky had watched his face closely vats the mattaire vy do you make like that eh tell me his voice was sharp youve got it ive got it oi oi ive got it vat have i got he knew before the answer came but raved and cursed in frenzied denial his tongue started language flowed from him freely it aint that no no it is the rheumatissen yes it shall be so it makes like that from the hard vork always it is the cold the cold makes it like with despair captain realized that he could neither go on dragging the sick man and outfit nor could he stay here in idleness to sacrifice the precious days that remained to his partner each one he lost might mean life or death klusky broke in upon him you vont leave me mistaire captain please you vont go avay such frightened entreaty lay in his request that before thinking the other replied no i wont i made you come and ill do all i can for you maybe somebody will pass he said it only to cheer for no one travelled this miserable stretch save scattering halfstarved indians but the patient caught at it eagerly hugging the hope to his breast during the ensuing days that vigil beside the dying creature lived long in captains memory the bleak timberless shores of the bay their tiny tent crouched fearfully among the willow tops the silent nights when in the clear cold air the stars stared at him close and big like eyes of wolves beyond a camp fire the days of endless gabblings from the sinking man and the all pervading cold at last knowledge dawned upon the invalid and he called his companion to his side shivering there beneath the thin tent captain heard a story rambling at first filled with hatred and bitterness toward the men who had scoffed at him yet at the last he listened eagerly amazedly and upon its conclusion rose suddenly gazing at the dying man in horror my god klusky hell isnt black enough for you it cant be true it cant be youre raving do you mean to say that you let those poor devils die like rats while you had potatoes in your cabin fresh ones man man the juice of every potato was worth a life youre lying klusky i aint no i aint i hate them i said they should crawl on their bellies to me yes and i should wring the money out a hundred dollars for von potato i stole them all ha ha and i kept them varm oh yes alvays varm by the fire so they shall be good and fine for the day thats why you left the indian there when we came away eh to keep a fire shoor and i thought i shall kill you and go back alone so nobody shall make for the rescue then i should have the great laugh captain bared his head to the cold outside the tent he was dazed by the thought of it the man was crazed by abuse the camp had paid for its folly then a hope sprang up in him it was too late to go on and return with the deer that is too late for george and he thought only of him of the big brave man sitting alone in the cabin shunned by the others waiting quietly for his coming tracing the relentless daily march of the disease why didnt the jew die so he could flee back he had promised not to desert him and he could not break his word to a dying man even though the wretch deserved damnation but why couldnt he die what made him hang on so in his idle hours he arranged a pack for the start assembling his rations he could not be hampered by the sled this was to be a race he must travel long and fast the sick man saw the preparations and cried weakly the tears freezing on his cheeks and still he lingered lingered maddeningly till at last when captain had lost count of the days he passed without a twitch and before the body had cooled the northward bluffs hid the plodding snowshoed figure hurrying along the back trail he scarcely stopped for sleep or food but gnawed raw bacon and frozen bread swinging from shoe to shoe devouring distance with the steady rhythmic pace of a machine he made no fires as darkness settled rendering progress a peril he unrolled his robe and burrowed into some overhanging drift and the earliest hint of dawn found him miles onward though the weather was clear he grew numbed and careless under the strain of his fatigue so that the frost bit hungrily at his features he grew gaunt and his feet swelled from the snowshoe thongs till they puffed out his loose sealskin boots and every step in the morning hours brought forth a groan he was tortured by the thought that perhaps the indian had carelessly let go the fire in kluskys cabin if so the precious potatoes would freeze in a night then if the native rebuilt it he would arrive only to find a mushy putrifying mass worse than useless the uncertainty sickened him and at last as he sighted the little hamlet he paused bracing his legs apart weakly he searched fearfully for traces of smoke above kluskys cabin there were none somehow the lone shack seemed to stare malignantly at him as he staggered up the trail and he heard himself muttering there were no locks in this land so he entered unbidden the place was empty though warm from recent habitation with his remaining strength he scrambled up a rude ladder to the loft where he fumbled in the dark while his heart stopped then he cried hoarsely and ripping open the box stuffed them gloatingly into pockets and shirt front he dropped from the platform and fled out through the open door capless and mittenless out and on toward the village his pace slackened suddenly for he noted with a shock that like kluskys cabin no smoke drifted over the house toward which he ran and drawing near he saw that snow lay before the door clean white and untrodden he was too dazed to recall the light fall of the night previous but glared blankly at the idle pipe at the cold and desolate front too late he murmured brokenly too late and stumbled to the snowcushioned chopping block he dared not go in evidently the camp had let george die had never come near to lift a hand he was afraid of what lay within afraid to face it alone yet a dreadful need to know pulled him forward three times he approached the door retreating each time in panic at last he laid soft hands upon the latch and entered averting his eyes even so and despite the darkness inside he was conscious of it saw from his eye corners the big still bulk that sat wrapped and propped in the chair by the table he sensed it dazedly inductively and turned to flee then paused ye made it boy its the twelfth today georges voice came weakly and with a great cry captain sprang to him bout all in the other continued aint been on my feet for two days i knowed youd come today though its the twelfth captain made no reply for he had knelt his face buried in the big mans lap his shoulders heaving while he cried like a little boy
