nora roberts stars of mithra hidden star chapter cade parris wasnt having the best of days when the woman of his dreams walked into his office his secretary had quit the day beforenot that shed been much of a prize anyway being more vigilant about her manicure than maintaining the phone logs but he needed someone to keep track of things and shuffle papers into files even the raise he offered out of sheer desperation hadnt swayed her to give up her sudden determination to become a countryandwestern singing sensation so his secretary was heading off to nashville in a secondhand pickup and his office looked like the ten miles of bad road he sincerely hoped she traveled she hadnt exactly had her mind on her work the past month or two that impression had been more than confirmed when he fished a bologna sandwich out of the file drawer at least he thought the blob in the plastic bag was bologna and it had been filed under lfor lunch he didnt bother to swear nor did he bother to answer the phone that rang incessantly on the empty desk in his reception area he had reports to type up and as typing wasnt one of his finer skills he just wanted to get on with it parris investigations wasnt what some would call a thriving enterprise but it suited him just as the cluttered tworoom office squeezed into the top floor of a narrow brick building with bad plumbing in north west dc suited him he didnt need plush carpets or polished edges hed grown up with all that with the pomp and pretenses and had had his fill of it all by the time he reached the age of twenty now at thirty with one bad marriage behind him and a family who continued to be baffled by his pursuits he was by and large a contented man he had his investigators license a decent rep utation as a man who got the job done and enough income to keep his agency well above water though actual business income was a bit of a problem just then he was in what he liked to call a lull most of his caseload consisted of insurance and domestic worka few steps down from the thrills hed imagined when he set out to become a private investigator hed just cleaned up two cases both of them minor insurance frauds that hadnt taken much effort or innovation to close he had nothing else coming in his greedy bloodsucker of a landlord was bumping up his rent the engine in his car had been making unsettling noises lately his air conditioner was on the fritz and the roof was leaking again he took the spindly yellowleafed philodendron his doublecrossing secretary had left behind and set it on the uncarpeted floor under the steady drip hoping it might drown he could hear a voice droning into his answering machine it was his mothers voice lord he thought did a man ever really escape his mother cade dear i hope you havent forgotten the embassy ball you know youre to escort pamela lovett i had lunch with her aunt today and she tells me that pamela just looks marvelous after her little sojourn to monaco yeah yeah yeah he muttered and narrowed his eyes at the computer he and machines had poor and untrusting relationships he sat down and faced the screen as his mother continued to chatter have you had your tux cleaned do make time to get a haircut you looked so scraggly the last time i saw you and dont forget to wash behind the ears he thought sourly and tuned her out she was never going to accept that the parris lifestyle wasnt his lifestyle that he just didnt want to lunch at the club or squire bored former debutantes around washington and that his opinion wasnt going to change by dint of her persuasion hed wanted adventure and though struggling to type up a report on some poor slobs fake whiplash wasnt exactly sam spade territory he was doing the job mostly he didnt feel useless or bored or out of place he liked the sound of traffic outside his window even though the window was only open because the building and its scumsucking landlord didnt go in for central airconditioning and his unit was broken the heat was intense and the rain was coming in but with the window closed the offices would have been as airless and stifling as a tomb sweat rolled down his back making him itchy and irritable he was stripped down to a tshirt and jeans his long fingers fumbling a bit on the computer keys he had to shovel his hair out of his face several times which ticked him off his mother was right he needed a haircut so when it got in the way again he ignored it as he ignored the sweat the heat the buzz of traffic the steady drip from the ceiling he sat methodically punching a key at a time a remarkably handsome man with a scowl on his face hed inherited the parris looksthe clever green eyes that could go brokenbottle sharp or as soft as sea mist depending on his mood the hair that needed a trim was dark mink brown and tended to wave just now it curled at his neck over his ears and was beginning to annoy him his nose was straight aristocratic and a little long his mouth firm and quick to smile when he was amused and to sneer when he wasnt though his face had become more honed since the embarrassing cherubic period of his youth and early adolescence it still sported dimples he was looking forward to middle age when with luck theyd become manly creases hed wanted to be rugged and instead was stuck with the slick dreamy good looks of a gq coverfor one of which hed posed in his middle twenties under protest and great family pressure the phone rang again this time he heard his sisters voice haranguing him about missing some lame cocktail party in honor of some bigbellied senator she was endorsing he thought about just ripping the damn answering machine out of the wall and heaving it and his sisters nagging voice out the window into the traffic on wisconsin avenue then the rain that was only adding to the miserably thick heat began to drip on the top of his head the computer blinked off for no reason he could see other than sheer nastiness and the coffee hed forgotten he was heating boiled over with a spiteful hiss he leaped up burned his hand on the pot he swore viciously as the pot smashed shattering glass and spewing hot coffee in all directions he ripped open a drawer grabbed for a stack of napkins and sliced his thumb with the lethal edge of his formerand now thoroughly damned to perditionsecretarys nail file when the woman walked in he was still cursing and bleeding and had just tripped over the philodendron set in the middle of the floor and didnt even look up it was hardly a wonder she simply stood there damp from the rain her face pale as death and her eyes wide with shock excuse me her voice sounded rusty as if she hadnt used it in days i must have the wrong office she inched backward and those big wide brown eyes shifted to the name printed on the door she hesitated then looked back at him are you mr parris there was a moment one blinding moment when he couldnt seem to speak he knew he was staring at her couldnt help himself his heart simply stood still his knees went weak and the only thought that came to his mind was there you are finally what the hell took you so long and because that was so ridiculous he struggled to put a bland even cynical investigators expression on his face yeah he remembered the handkerchief in his pocket and wrapped it over his busily bleeding thumb just had a little accident here i see though she didnt appear to the way she continued to stare at his face ive come at a bad time i dont have an appointment i thought maybe looks like my calendars clear he wanted her to come in all the way in whatever that first absurd unprecedented reaction of his she was still a potential client and surely no dame who ever walked through sam spades hallowed door had ever been more perfect she was blond and beautiful and bewildered her hair was wet sleek down to her shoulders and straight as the rain her eyes were bourbon brown in a face thatthough it could have used some colorwas delicate as a fairys it was heartshaped the cheeks a gentle curve and the mouth was full unpainted and solemn shed ruined her suit and shoes in the rain he recognized both as topquality that quietly exclusive look found only in designer salons against the wet blue silk of her suit the canvas bag she clutched with both hands looked intriguingly out of place damsel in distress he mused and his lips curved just what the doctor ordered why dont you come in close the door miss her heart bumped twice hammerhard and she tightened her grip on the bag youre a private investigator thats what it says on the door cade smiled again ruthlessly using the dimples while he watched her gnaw that lovely lower lip damned if he wouldnt like to gnaw on it himself and that response he thought with a little relief was a lot more like it lust was a feeling he could understand lets go back to my office he surveyed the damagebroken glass potting soil pools of coffee i think im finished in here for now all right she took a deep breath stepped in then closed the door she supposed she had to start somewhere picking her way over the debris she followed him into the adjoining room it was furnished with little more than a desk and a couple of bargainbasement chairs well she couldnt be choosy about decor she reminded herself she waited until hed sat behind his desk tipped back in his chair and smiled at her again in that quick trustme way do youcould i she squeezed her eyes tight centered herself again do you have some credentials i could see more intrigued he took out his license handed it to her she wore two very lovely rings one on each hand he noticed one was a squarecut citrine in an antique setting the other a trio of col ored stones her earrings matched the second ring he noted when she tucked her hair behind her ear and studied his license as if weighing each printed word would you like to tell me what the problem is miss i think she handed him back his license then gripped the bag twohanded again i think id like to hire you her eyes were on his face again as intently as searchingly as they had been on the license do you handle missingpersons cases who did you lose sweetheart he wondered he hoped for her sake and for the sake of the nice little fantasy that was building in his head it wasnt a husband yeah i handle missing persons your ah rate twofifty a day plus expenses when she nodded he slid over a legal pad picked up a pencil who do you want me to find she took a long shuddering breath me i need you to find me watching her he tapped the pencil against the pad looks like i already have you want me to bill you or do you want to pay now no she could feel it cracking shed held on so longor at least it seemed so longbut now she could feel that branch shed gripped when the world dropped out from under her begin to crack i dont remember anything i dont her voice began to hitch she took her hands off the bag in her lap to press them to her face i dont know who i am i dont know who i am and then she was weeping the words into her hands i dont know who i am cade had a lot of experience with hysterical women hed grown up with females who used flowing tears and gulping sobs as the answer to anything from a broken nail to a broken marriage so he rose from his desk armed himself with a box of tissues and crouched in front of her here now sweetheart dont worry its going to be just fine with gentle expertise he mopped at her face as he spoke he patted her hand stroked her hair studied her swimming eyes im sorry i cant just cry it out he told her youll feel better for it rising he went into the closetsize bathroom and poured her a paper cup of water when she had a lapful of damp tissues and three crushed paper cups she let out a little jerky sigh im sorry thank you i do feel better her cheeks pinkened a bit with embarrassment as she gathered up the tissues and mangled cups cade took them from her dumped them in the wastebasket then rested a hip on the corner of his desk you want to tell me about it now she nodded then linked her fingers and began to twist them together ithere isnt that much to tell i just dont remember anything who i am what i do where im from friends family nothing her breath caught again and she released it slowly nothing she repeated it was a dream come true he thought the beautiful woman without a past coming out of the rain and into his office he flicked a glance at the bag she still held in her lap theyd get to that in a minute why dont you tell me the first thing you do remember i woke up in a rooma little hotel on sixteenth street letting her head rest back against the chair she closed her eyes and tried to bring things into focus even thats unclear i was curled up on the bed and there was a chair propped under the doorknob it was raining i could hear the rain i was groggy and disoriented but my heart was pounding so hard as if id wakened from a nightmare i still had my shoes on i remember wondering why id gone to bed with my shoes on the room was dim and stuffy all the windows were closed i was so tired logy so i went into the bathroom to splash water on my face now she opened her eyes looked into his i saw my face in the mirror this ugly little mirror with black splotches where it needed to be resilvered and it meant nothing to me the face she lifted a hand ran it over her cheek her jaw my face meant nothing to me i couldnt remember the name that went with the face or the thoughts or the plans or the past i didnt know how id gotten to that horrid room i looked through the drawers and the closet but there was nothing no clothes i was afraid to stay there but i didnt know where to go the bag was that all you had with you yes her hand clutched at the straps again no purse no wallet no keys this was in my pocket she reached into the pocket of her jacket and took out a small scrap of notepaper cade took it from her skimmed the quick scrawling writing bailey sat at right mj i dont know what it means i saw a newspaper todays friday mmm write it down cade said handing her a pad and pen what write down what it says on the note oh gnawing her lip again she complied though he didnt have to compare the two to come to his conclusions he took the pad from her set it and the note side by side well youre not mj so id say youre bailey she blinked swallowed what from the look of mjs writing he or shes a lefty youre righthanded youve got neat simple penmanship mjs got an impatient scrawl the note was in your pocket odds are youre bailey bailey she tried to absorb the name the hope of it the feel and taste of identity but it was dry and unfamiliar it doesnt mean anything it means we have something to call you and someplace to start tell me what you did next distracted she blinked at him oh i there was a phone book in the room i looked up detective agencies whyd you pick mine the name it sounded strong she managed her first smile and though it was weak it was there i started to call but then i thought i might get put off and if i just showed up so i waited in the room until it was office hours then i walked for a little while then i got a cab and here i am why didnt you go to a hospital call a doctor i thought about it she looked down at her hands i just didnt she was leaving out big chunks he mused going around his desk he opened a drawer pulled out a candy bar you didnt say anything about stopping for breakfast he watched her study the candy he offered with puzzlement and what appeared to be amusement thisll hold you until we can do better thank you with neat precise movements she unwrapped the chocolate bar maybe part of the fluttering in her stomach was hunger mr parris i may have people worried about me family friends i may have a child i dont know her eyes deepened fixed on a point over his shoulder i dont think i do i cant believe anyone could forget her own child but people may be worried wondering what happened to me why i didnt come home last night you could have gone to the police i didnt want to go to the police this time her voice was clipped definite not until no i dont want to involve the police she wiped her fingers on a fresh tissue then began to tear it into strips someone may be looking for me who isnt a friend who isnt family who isnt concerned with my wellbeing i dont know why i feel that way i only know im afraid its more than just not remembering but i cant understand anything any of it until i know who i am maybe it was those big soft moist eyes staring up at him or the damselindistress nerves of her restless hands either way he couldnt resist showing off just a little i can tell you a few things already youre an intelligent woman earlytomidtwenties you have a good eye for color and style and enough of a bankroll to indulge it with italian shoes and silk suits youre neat probably organized you prefer the understated to the obvious since you dont evade well id say youre an equally poor liar youve got a good head on your shoulders you think things through you dont panic easily and you like chocolate she balled the empty candy wrapper in her hand why do you assume all that you speak well even when youre frightened you thought about how you were going to handle this and went through all the steps logically you dress wellquality over flair you have a good manicure but no flashy polish your jewelry is unique interesting but not ornate and youve been holding back information since you walked through the door because you havent decided yet how much youre going to trust me how much should i trust you you came to me she acknowledged that rose and walked to his window the rain drummed underscoring the vague headache that hovered just behind her eyes i dont recognize the city she murmured yet i feel i should i know where i am because i saw a newspaper the washington post i know what the white house and the capitol look like i know the monumentsbut i could have seen them on television or in a book though it was wet from incoming rain she rested her hands on the sill appreciated the coolness there i feel as though i dropped out of nowhere into that ugly hotel room still i know how to read and write and walk and talk the cabdriver had the radio on and i recognized music i recognized trees i wasnt surprised that rain was wet i smelled burned coffee when i came in and it wasnt an unfamiliar odor i know your eyes are green and when the rain clears i know the sky will be blue she sighed once so i didnt drop out of nowhere there are things i know things im sure of but my own face means nothing to me and whats behind the face is blank i may have hurt someone done something i may be selfish and calculating even cruel i may have a husband i cheat on or neighbors ive alienated she turned back then and her face was tight and set a tough contrast to the fragility of lashes still wet from tears i dont know if im going to like who you find when you find me mr parris but i need to know she set the bag on his desk hesitated briefly then opened it i think i have enough to meet your fee he came from money the kind that aged and increased and propagated over generations but even with his background hed never seen so much in one place at one time the canvas bag was filled with wrapped stacks of hundreddollar billsall crisp and clean fascinated cade took out a stack flipped through yes indeed he mused every one of the bills had ben franklins homely and dignified face id have to guess about a million he murmured one million two hundred thousand bailey shuddered as she looked into the bag i counted the stacks i dont know where i got it or why i had it with me i may have stolen it tears began to swim again as she turned away it could be ransom money i could be involved in a kidnapping there could be a child somewhere being held and ive taken the ransom money i just lets add a vivid imagination to those other qualities it was the cool and casual tone of his voice that had her turning back theres a fortune in there a million two isnt much of a fortune these days he dropped the money back in the bag and im sorry bailey you just dont fit the cold calculating kidnapper type but you can check you can find out discreetly if theres been an abduction sure if the cops are involved i can get something and if theres been a murder struggling to stay calm she reached into the bag again this time she took out a a cautious man cade nudged the barrel aside took it from her it was a smith and wesson and at his quick check he discovered it was fully loaded howd this feel in your hand i dont understand howd it feel when you picked it up the weight the shape though she was baffled by the question she did her best to answer thoroughly not as heavy as i thought it should it seemed that something that had that kind of power would have more weight more substance i suppose it felt awkward the pen didnt this time she simply dragged her hands through her hair i dont know what youre talking about ive just shown you over a million dollars and a gun youre talking about pens when i handed you a pen to write it didnt feel awkward you didnt have to think about it you just took it and used it he smiled a little and slipped the gun into his pocket instead of the bag i think youre a lot more accustomed to holding a pen than a special there was some relief in that the simple logic of it but it didnt chase away all the clouds maybe youre right it doesnt mean i didnt use it no it doesnt and since youve obviously put your hands all over it we cant prove you didnt i can check and see if its registered and to whom her eyes lit with hope it could be mine she reached out took his hand squeezed it in a gesture that was thoughtless and natural wed have a name then id know my name then i didnt realize it could be so simple it may be simple youre right she released his hand began to pace her movements were smooth controlled im getting ahead of myself but it helps so much you see so much more than i imagined just to tell someone someone who knows how to figure things out i dont know if im very good at puzzles mr parris cade he said intrigued that he could find her economical movements so sexy lets keep it simple cade she drew in a breath let it out its nice to call someone by name youre the only person i know the only person i remember having a conversation with i cant tell you how odd that is and right now how comforting why dont we make me the first person you remember having a meal with one candy bar isnt much of a breakfast you look worn out bailey it was so odd to hear him use that name when he looked at her because it was all she had she struggled to respond to it im tired she admitted it doesnt feel as if ive slept very much i dont know when ive eaten last how do you feel about scrambled eggs the smile wisped around her mouth again i havent the faintest idea well lets find out he started to pick up the canvas bag but she laid a hand over his on the straps theres something else she didnt speak for a moment but kept her eyes on his as she had when she first walked in searching measuring deciding but there was she knew really no choice he was all she had before i show you i need to ask for a promise you hire me bailey i work for you i dont know if what im going to ask is completely ethical but i still need your word if during the course of your investigation you discover that ive committed a crime i need your word that youll find out everything you can all the circumstances all the facts before you turn me over to the police he angled his head you assume ill turn you in if ive broken the law ill expect you to turn me over to the police but i need all the reasons before you do i need to understand all the whys the hows the who will you give me your word on that sure he took the hand she held out it was delicate as porcelain steady as a rock and she he thought whoever she was was a fascinating combination of the fragile and the steely no cops until we know all of it you can trust me bailey youre trying to make me comfortable with the name again without thinking in a move that was as innate as the color of her eyes she kissed his cheek youre very kind kind enough she thought that he would hold her now if she asked and she so desperately wanted to be held soothed to be promised that her world would snap back into focus again at any moment but she needed to stand on her own she could only hope she was the kind of woman who stood on her own feet and faced her own problems theres one more thing she turned to the canvas bag again slid her hand deep inside felt for the thick velvet pouch the weight of what was snugged inside it i think its probably the most important thing she drew it out and very carefully with what he thought of as reverence untied the pouch and slid its contents into the cup of her palm the money had surprised him the gun had concerned him but this awed him the gleam of it the regal glint even in the raindarkened room held a stunning and sumptuous power the gem filled the palm of her hand its facets clean and sharp enough to catch even the faintest flicker of light and shoot it into the air in bright burning lances it belonged he thought on the crown of a mythical queen or lying heavily between the breasts of some ancient goddess ive never seen a sapphire that big it isnt a sapphire and when she passed it to his hand she would have sworn she felt the exchange of heat its a blue diamond somewhere around a hundred carats brilliantcut most likely from asia minor there are no inclusions visible to the naked eye and it is rare in both color and size id have to guess its market worth at easily three times the amount of money in the bag he wasnt looking at the gem any longer but at her when she lifted her eyes to his she shook her head i dont know how i know but i do just as i know its not all its not complete what do you mean i wish i knew but its too strong a feeling an almostrecognition i know the stone is only part of the whole just as i know it cant possibly belong to me it doesnt really belong to anyone any one she repeated separating the word into two i must have stolen it she pressed her lips together lifted her chin squared her shoulders i might have killed for it chapter cade took her home it was the best option he could think of tucking her away and he wanted that canvas bag and its contents in his safe as quickly as possible she hadnt argued when he led her out of the building had made no comment about the sleek little jag parked in the narrow spot on the cracked asphalt lot he preferred using his nondescript and welldented sedan for his work but until it was out of the shop he was stuck with the streamlined eyecatching jaguar but she said nothing not even when he drove into a lovely old neighborhood with graceful shade trees and tidy flowertrimmed lawns and into the driveway of a dignified federalstyle brick house hed been prepared to explain that hed inherited it from a greataunt who had a soft spot for himwhich was true enough and that he lived there because he liked the quiet and convenience of the established neighborhood in the heart of washington but she didnt ask it seemed to cade that shed simply run down whatever energy had pushed her into going out in the rain seeking his office and telling her story had drained out leaving her listless and fragile again he had to check the urge to simply gather her up and carry her inside he could imagine it clearlythe stalwart knight my ladys champion carrying her into the safety of the castle and away from any and all dragons that plagued her he really had to stop thinking things like that instead he hefted the canvas bag took her unresisting hand and led her through the graceful foyer down the hall and directly into the kitchen scrambled eggs he said pulling out a chair for her and nudging her down to sit at the pedestal table all right yes thank you she felt limp unfocused and terribly grateful to him he wasnt peppering her with questions nor had he looked particularly shocked or appalled by her story perhaps it was the nature of his business that made him take it all in stride but whatever the reason she was thankful for the time he was giving her to recoup now he was moving around the kitchen in a casual competent manner breaking brown eggs in a white bowl popping bread in a toaster that sat on a granitecolored counter she should offer to help she thought it seemed the right thing to do but she was so dreadfully tired and it was so pleasant to just sit in the big kitchen with rain drumming musically on the roof and watch him handle the simple task of making breakfast he was taking care of her and she was letting him bailey closed her eyes and wondered if she was the kind of woman who needed to be tended to by a man who enjoyed the role of the helpless female she hoped not almost fiercely hoped not then wondered why such a minor insignificant personality trait should matter so much when she couldnt be sure she wasnt a thief or murderer she caught herself studying her hands wondering about them short neat rounded nails coated in clear polish did that mean she was practical the hands were soft uncallused it was doubtful she worked with them pursued manual labor of any kind the rings very pretty not bold so much as unique at least it seemed they were she knew the stones that winked back at her garnet citrine amethyst how could she know the names of colored stones and not know the name of her closest friend did she have any friends was she a kind person or a catty one generous or a faultfinder did she laugh easily and cry at sad movies was there a man she loved who loved her had she stolen more than a million dollars and used that ugly little gun she jolted when cade set her plate in front of her then settled when he laid a hand on her shoulder you need to eat he went back to the stove brought the cup hed left there and i think teas a better bet than coffee yes thank you she picked up her fork scooped up some eggs tasted i like them she managed a smile again a hesitant shy smile that touched his heart thats something he sat across from her with his mug of coffee im known throughout the civilized world for my scrambled eggs her smile steadied bloomed i can see why the little dashes of dill and paprika are inspired wait till you taste my spanish omelets master of the egg she continued to eat comforted by the easy warmth she felt between them do you cook a lot she glanced around the kitchen stonecolored cabinets and warm light wood an uncurtained window over a double sink of white porcelain coffeemaker toaster jumbled sections of the morning paper the room was neat she observed but not obsessively so and it was a marked contrast to the clutter and mess of his office i never asked if you were married divorced and i cook when im tired of eating out i wonder what i doeat out or cook you recognized paprika and dill when you tasted them leaning back he sipped his coffee and studied her youre beautiful her gaze flicked up startled and he noted instantly wary just an observation bailey we have to work with what we know you are beautifulits quiet understated nothing that seems particularly contrived or enhanced you dont go for the flashy and you dont take a compliment on your looks casually in fact ive just made you very nervous she picked up her cup held it in both hands are you trying to no but its interesting and sweetthe way you blush and eye me suspiciously at the same time you can relax im not hitting on you but it was a thought he admitted a fascinating and arousing thought i dont think youre a pushover either he continued i doubt a man would get very far with you just by telling you that you have eyes like warm brandy and that the contrast between them and that cool cultured voice packs a hell of a sexual impact she lifted her cup and though it took an effort kept her gaze level with his it sounds very much like youre hitting on me his dimples flashed with charm when he grinned see not a pushover but polite very polite and well mannered theres new england in your voice bailey staring she lowered the cup again new england connecticut massachusettsim not sure but theres a whiff of yankee society upbringing in your voice especially when it turns cold new england she strained for a connection some small link it doesnt mean anything to me it gives me another piece to work with youve got class written all over you you were born with it or you developed it either way its there he rose took her plate and sos the exhaustion you need to sleep yes the thought of going back to that hotel room had her forcing back a shudder should i call your office set up another appointment i wrote down the number of the hotel and room where im staying you could call me if you find anything youre not going back there he had her hand again drew her to her feet and began to lead her out of the kitchen you can stay here theres plenty of room here i think its best if youre where i can keep an eye on you at least for the time being back in the foyer he led her up the stairs its a safe quiet neighborhood and until we figure out how you got your hands on a million two and a diamond as big as your fist i dont want you wandering the streets you dont know me neither do you thats something else were going to work on he opened the door to a room where the dim light flickered quietly through lace curtains onto a polished oak floor a little seating area of buttonback chairs and a piecrust table was arranged in front of a fireplace where a fern thrived in the hearth a weddingring quilt was spread over a graceful four poster plumped invitingly with pillows take a nap he advised theres a bath through there and ill dig up something for you to change into after youve rested she felt the tears backing up again scoring her throat with a mixture of fear and gratitude and outrageous fatigue do you invite all your clients into your home as houseguests no he touched her cheek and because he wanted to gather her close feel how her head would settle on his shoulder dropped his hand again just the ones who need it im going to be downstairs ive got some things to do cade she reached for his hand held it a moment thank you it looks like i picked the right name out of the phone book get some sleep let me do the worrying for a while i will dont close the door she said quickly when he stepped out into the hall he pushed it open again studied her standing there in the patterned light looking so delicate so lost ill be right downstairs she listened to his footsteps recede before sinking down on the padded bench at the foot of the bed it might be foolish to trust him to put her life in his hands as completely as she had but she did trust him not only because her world consisted only of him and what shed told him but because every instinct inside her told her this was a man she could depend on perhaps it was just blind faith and desperate hope but at the moment she didnt think she could survive another hour without both so her future depended on cade parris on his ability to handle her present and his skill in unearthing her past she slipped off her shoes took off her jacket and folded it on the bench almost dizzy with fatigue she climbed into bed and lay atop the quilt and was asleep the moment her cheek met the pillow downstairs cade lifted baileys prints from her teacup he had the connections to have them run quickly and discreetly if she had a record or had ever worked for the government hed have her ided easily hed check with missing persons see if anyone matching her description had been reported that too was easy the money and the diamond offered another route the theft of a gem of that size was bound to make news he needed to verify the facts bailey had given him on the stone then do some research he needed to check the registration on the gun tooand check his sources on recent homicides or shootings with a all those steps would be more effective if done in person but he didnt want to leave her on her own just yet she might panic and take off and he wasnt going to risk losing her it was just as possible that she would wake up from her nap remember who she was and go back to her own life before he had a chance to save her he very much wanted to save her while he locked the bag in his library safe booted up his computer scribbled his notes he reminded himself that she might have a husband six kids twenty jealous lovers or a criminal record as long as pennsylvania avenue but he just didnt care she was his damsel in distress and damn it he was keeping her he made his calls arranged to have the prints messengered over to his contact at the police station the little favor was going to cost him a bottle of unblended scotch but cade accepted that nothing was free by the way mick you got anything on a jewelry heist a big one cade could clearly imagine detective mick marshall pushing through his paperwork phone cocked at his ear to block out the noise of the bullpen his tie askew his wiry red hair sticking up in spikes from a face set in a permanent scowl you got something parris just a rumor cade said easily if something big went down i could use a link to the insurance company got to pay the rent mick hell i dont know why you dont buy the building in the first place then tear the rattrap down rich boy im eccentricthats what they call rich boys who pal around with people like you so what do you know havent heard a thing okay ive got a smith and wesson special cade rattled off the serial number as he turned the gun in his hand run it for me will you two bottles of scotch parris what are friends for hows doreen sassy as ever ever since you brought her over those damn tulips i havent heard the end of it like i got time to pluck posies before i go home every night i ought to make it three bottles of scotch you find out anything about an important gem going missing mick ill buy you a case ill be talking to you cade hung up the phone and stared malevolently at his computer man and machine were simply going to have to come to terms for this next bit of research it took him what he estimated was three times as long as it would the average twelveyearold to insert the cdrom search and find what he was after amnesia cade drank another cup of coffee and learned more about the human brain than hed ever wanted to know for a short uncomfortable time he feared bailey had a tumor that he might have one as well he experienced a deep personal concern for his brain stem then reconfirmed why he hadnt gone into medicine as his mother hoped the human body with all its tricks and licking time bombs was just too scary hed much rather face a loaded gun than the capriciousness of his own internal organs he finally concluded with some relief that it was unlikely bailey had a tumor all signs pointed to hysterical amnesia which could resolve itself within hours of the trauma or take weeks months even years which put them he thought solidly back at square one the handy medical cd that had come with his computer indicated that amnesia was a symptom rather than a disease and that treatment involved finding and removing the cause that was where he came in it seemed to cade that a detective was every bit as qualified as a doctor to deal with baileys problem turning back to his computer he laboriously typed up his notes questions and conclusions to date satisfied he went back upstairs to find her some clothes she didnt know if it was a dream or realityor even if it was her own dream or someone elses reality but it was familiar so oddly familiar the dark room the hard slant of the beam of light from the desk lamp the elephant how strangethe elephant seemed to be grinning at her its trunk lifted high for luck its glinting blue eyes gleaming with secret amusement female laughteragain familiar and so comforting friendly intimate laughter its got to be paris bailey were not going to spend two weeks with you digging in the dirt again what you need is romance passion sex what you need is paris a triangle gold and gleaming and a room filled with light bright blinding light a man whos not a man with a face so kind so wise so generous it thrills the soul and the golden triangle held in his open hands the offering of it the power of it stunning the impact of the rich blue of the stones nestled in each angle almost palpable and the stones shining and pulsing like heartbeats and seeming to leap into the air like stars shooting stars that scatter light the beauty of them sears the eyes and shes holding them in her hands and her hands are shaking anger such anger swirling inside her and fear and panic and fury the stones shoot out from her hands first one then two winging away like jeweled birds and the third is clutched to her heart by her open protective hand silver flashing bolts of silver flashing and the pounding of booming drums that shake the ground blood blood everywhere like a hideous river spilling my god its wet so red and wet and demondark running stumbling heart thudding its dark again the lights gone the stars are gone theres a corridor and her heels echo like the thunder that follows lightning its coming after her hunting her in the dark while the walls close in tighter and tighter she can hear the elephant trumpeting and the lightning flashes closer she crawls into the cave and hides like an animal shivering and whimpering like an animal as the lightning streaks by her come on sweetheart come on honey its just a bad dream she clawed her way out of the dark toward the calm steady voice burrowed her clammy face into the broad solid shoulder blood so much blood hit by lightning its coming its close no its gone now cade pressed his lips to her hair rocked her when he slipped in to leave her a robe shed been crying in her sleep now she was clinging to him trembling so he shifted her into his lap as if she were a child youre safe now i promise the stars three stars balanced between dream and reality she shifted restlessly in his arms ive got to go to paris you did im right here he tipped her head back to touch his lips to her temple right here he repeated waiting for her eyes to clear and focus relax now im right here dont go with a quick shudder she rested her head on his shoulder just as hed imagined the pull on his heart was immediate and devastating he supposed love at first sight was meant to be i wont ill take care of you that alone was enough to ease her trembling she relaxed against him let her eyes close again it was just a dream but it was so confusing so frightening i dont understand any of it tell me he listened as she struggled to remember the details put them in order there was so much emotion huge waves of emotions anger shock a sense of betrayal and fear then terror just sheer mindless terror that could explain the amnesia youre not ready to cope with it so you shut it off its a kind of conversion hysteria hysteria the term made her chin lift im hysterical in a manner of speaking he rubbed his knuckles absently over that lifted chin it looks good on you in a firm deliberate movement that made his brow quirk she pushed his hand from her face i dont care for the term im using it in a strictly medical sense you didnt get bopped on the head right her eyes were narrowed now not that i recall but then im hysterical after all cute what i mean is amnesia can result from a concussion he twirled her hair around his finger as he spoke just to feel the texture i always thought that was bull or hollywood stuff but it says so right in the medical book one of the other causes is a functional nervous disorder such asyoull excuse the termhysteria her teeth were gritted now i am not hysterical though im sure i could be if youd care for a demonstration ive had plenty of those i have sisters bailey he cupped her face in his hands in such a disarming gesture her narrowed eyes widened youre in trouble thats the bottom line and were going to fix it by holding me in your lap thats just a side benefit when her smile fluttered again and she started to shift away he tightened his grip i like it a lot she could see more than amusement in his eyes something that had her pulse jumping i dont think its wise for you to flirt with a woman who doesnt know who she is maybe not but its fun and itll give you something else to think about she found herself charmed utterly by the way his dimples flickered the way his mouth quirked at the corner just enough to make the smile crooked it would be a good mouth for a lover quick clever full of energy she could imagine too well just how it would fit against hers perhaps because she couldnt imagine any other couldnt remember another taste another texture and because that would make him somehow the first to kiss her the thrill of anticipation sprinted up her spine he dipped her head back slowly his gaze sliding from her eyes to her lips then back again he could imagine it perfectly and was all but sure there would be a swell of music to accompany that first meeting of lips want to try it need rich and full and shocking poured through her jittering nerves weakening limbs she was alone with him this stranger shed trusted her life to this man she knew more of than she knew of herself i cant she put a hand on his chest surprised that however calm his voice his heart was pounding as rapidly as hers because it was she could be honest im afraid to in my experience kissing isnt a scary business unless were talking about kissing grandmother parris and thats just plain terrifying it made her smile again and this time when she shifted he let her go better not to complicate things any more than they are with restless hands she scooped her hair back looked away from him id like to take a shower if thats all right clean up a little sure i brought you a robe and some jeans you can roll up the best i could come up with for a belt that would fit you was some clothesline itll hold them up and make a unique fashion statement youre very sweet cade thats what they all say he closed off the little pocket of lust within and rose can you handle being alone for an hour therere a couple of things i should see to yes ill be fine i need you to promise you wont leave the house bailey she lifted her hands where would i go he put his hands on her shoulders waited until her gaze lifted to his promise me you wont leave the house all right i promise i wont be long he walked to the door paused and bailey think about it she caught the gleam in his eyes before he turned that told her he didnt mean the circumstances that had brought her to him when she walked to the window watched him get in his car and drive away she was already thinking about it about him someone else was thinking about her thinking dark vengeful thoughts she had slipped through his fingers and with her the prize and the power he most coveted hed already exacted a price for incompetence but it was hardly enough she would be found and when she was shed pay a much higher price her life certainly but that was insignificant there would be pain first and great fear that would satisfy the money he had lost was nothing almost as insignificant as the life of one foolish woman but she had what he needed what was meant to belong to him and he would take back his own there were three individually they were priceless but together their value went beyond the imaginable already he had taken steps to recover the two she had foolishly attempted to hide from him it would take a little time naturally but he would have them back it was important to be careful to be cautious to be certain of the recovery and that whatever violence was necessary remained distant from him but soon two pieces of the triangle would be his two ancient stars with all their beauty and light and potency he sat in the room hed had built for his treasures those acquired stolen or taken with blood jewels and paintings statuary and precious pelts gleamed and sparkled in his aladdins cave of secrets the altarlike stand hed designed to hold his most coveted possession was empty and waiting but soon he would have the two and when he had the third he would be immortal and the woman would be dead chapter it was her body in the mirror bailey told herself and shed better start getting used to it in the glass fogged from her shower her skin looked pale and smooth selfconsciously she laid a hand against her breast long fingers short trimmed nails rather small breasts her arms were a little thin she noted with a frown maybe she should start thinking about working out to build them up there didnt seem to be any excess flab at the waist or hips so perhaps she got some exercise and there was some muscle tone in the thighs her skin was pale without tan lines what was sheabout fivefour she wished she were taller it seemed if a woman was going to begin her life at twentysomething she ought to be able to pick her body type fuller breasts and longer legs would have been nice amused at herself she turned twisted her head to study the rear view and her mouth dropped open there was a tattoo on her butt what in the world was she doing with a tattoo of awas that a unicornon her rear end was she crazy body decoration was one thing but on that particular part of the anatomy it meant that she had exposed that particular part of the anatomy to some needlewielding stranger did she drink too much faintly embarrassed she pulled on a towel and quickly left the misty bathroom she spent some time adjusting the jeans and shirt cade had left her to get the best fit hung up her suit neatly smoothed the quilt then she heaved a sigh and tunneled her fingers through her damp hair cade had asked her to stay in the house but he hadnt asked her to stay in her room she was going to be jittery again thinking about bags of money huge blue diamonds murder and tattoos if she didnt find a distraction she wandered out realizing she wasnt uncomfortable in the house alone she supposed it was a reflection of her feelings for cade he didnt make her uncomfortable from almost the first minute shed felt as though she could talk to him depend on him and she imagined that was because she hadnt talked to anyone else and had no one else to depend on nonetheless he was a kind considerate man a smart logical one she supposed or else he wouldnt be a private investigator he had a wonderful smile full of fun and eyes that paid attention he had strength in his arms and she thought in his character and dimples that made her fingers itch to trace along them his bedroom she gnawed on her lip as she stood in the doorway it was rude to pry she wondered if she were rude careless with the feelings and privacy of others but she needed something anything to fill all these blank spots and he had left his door open she stepped over the threshold it was a wonderfully large room and full of him jeans tossed over a chair socks on the floor she caught herself before she could pick them up and look for a hamper loose change and a couple of shirt buttons tossed on the dresser a gorgeous antique chest of drawers that undoubtedly held all sorts of pieces of him she didnt tug at the brass handles but she wanted to the bed was big unmade and framed by the clean lines of federal head and footboards the rumpled sheets were dark blue and she didnt quite resist running her fingers over them theyd probably smell of himthat faintly minty scent when she caught herself wondering if he slept naked heat stung her cheeks and she turned away there was a neat brick fireplace and a polished pine mantle a silly brass cow stood on the hearth and made her smile there were books messily tucked into a recessed shelf bailey studied the titles soberly wondering which she might have read he went heavy on mysteries and true crime but there were familiar names that made her feel better without thinking she picked up a used coffee mug and an empty beer bottle and carried them downstairs she hadnt paid much attention to the house when they came in it had all been so foggy so distorted in her mind but now she studied the simple and elegant lines the long lovely windows with their classic trim the gleaming antiques the contrast between the gracious home and the secondrate office struck her made her frown she rinsed the mug in the sink found the recycling bin for the bottle then took herself on a tour it took her less than ten minutes to come to her conclusion the man was loaded the house was full of treasuresmuseumquality of that she was undeniably sure she might not have understood the unicorn on her own rear end but she understood the value of a federal inlaid cherrywood slantfront desk she couldnt have said why she recognized waterford vases georgian silver the limoges china in the dining room display cabinet and she doubted very much if the turner landscape was a copy she peeked out a window welltended lawn majestic old trees roses in full bloom why would a man who could live in such a style choose to work in a crumbling building in a stuffy cramped office then she smiled it seemed cade parris was as much a puzzle as she was herself and that was a tremendous comfort she went back to the kitchen hoping to make herself useful by making some iced tea or putting something together for lunch when the phone rang she jumped like a scalded cat the answering machine clicked on and cades voice flowed out calming her again youve reached leave a message ill get back to you cade this is becoming very irritating the womans voice was tight with impatience ive left a half a dozen messages at your office this morning the least you can do is have the courtesy to return my calls i sincerely doubt youre so busy with what you loosely call your clients to speak to your own mother there was a sigh longsuffering and loud i know very well you havent contacted pamela about arrangements for this evening youve put me in a very awkward position im leaving for dodies for bridge you can reach me there until four dont embarrass me cade by the way muffys very annoyed with you there was a decisive click bailey found herself clearing her throat she felt very much as if shed received that cool deliberate tonguelashing herself and it made her wonder if she had a mother who nagged who expected obedience who was worried about her she filled the teakettle set it on the boil dug up a pitcher she was hunting up tea bags when the phone rang again well cade this is muffy mother tells me she still hasnt been able to reach you its obvious youre avoiding our calls because you dont want to face your own poor behavior you know very well camillas piano recital was last night the least the very least you could have done was put in an appearance and pretended to have some family loyalty not that i expected any better from you i certainly hope you have the decency to call camilla and apologize i refuse to speak to you again until you do click bailey blew out a breath rolled her eyes families she thought were obviously difficult and complex possessions then again perhaps she had a brother herself and was just as well bitchy as the wasptongued muffy she set the tea to steep then opened the refrigerator there were eggs and plenty of them that made her smile there was also a deli pack of honeybaked ham some swiss and when she discovered plump beefsteak tomatoes she decided she was in business she worried over the choice of mustard or mayo for a time and whether the tea should be sweetened or unsweetened every little detail was like a brick in the rebuilding of herself as she was carefully slicing tomatoes she heard the front door slam and her mood brightened but when she started to call out the words stuck in her throat what if it wasnt cade what if theyd found her come for her her hand tightened on the hilt of the knife as she edged toward the rear kitchen door fear deep and uncontrollable had sweat popping out in clammy pearls on her skin her heart flipped into her throat running running away from that sharp hacking lightning in the dark with her own breath screaming in her head blood everywhere her fingers tensed on the knob turned it as she prepared for flight or fight when cade stepped in a sob of relief burst out of her the knife clattered on the floor as she launched herself into his arms its you it is you sure it is he knew he should feel guilty that fear had catapulted her against him but he was only human she smelted fabulous i told you youre safe here bailey i know i felt safe but when i heard the door i panicked for a minute she clung wildly grateful to have him with her drawing her head back she stared up at him i wanted to run just run when i heard the door and thought it could be someone else i hate being such a coward and not knowing what i should do i cant seem to think she trailed off mesmerized he was stroking her cheek as she babbled his eyes intent on hers her arms were banded around his waist all but fused there the hand that had smoothed through her hair was cupped at the base of her neck now fingers gently kneading he waited saw the change in her eyes his lips curved just enough to have her heart quiver before he lowered his head and gently touched them to hers oh lovely that was her first thought it was lovely to be held so firmly to be tasted so tenderly this was a kiss this sweet meeting of lips that made the blood hum lazily and the soul sigh with a quiet murmur she slid her hands up his back rose on her toes to meet that patient demand when his tongue traced her lips slipped between them she shuddered with pleasure and opened to him as naturally as a rose opens to the sun hed known she would somehow hed known she would be both shy and generous that the taste of her would be fresh the scent of her airy it was impossible that hed only met her hours before it seemed the woman he held in his arms had been his forever and it was thrilling hotly arousing to know his was the first kiss she would remember that he was the only man in her mind and heart to hold her this way touch her this way he was the first to make her tremble his was the first name she murmured when needs swirled through her and when she murmured his name every other woman hed ever held vanished she was the first for him he deepened the kiss gradually aware of how easily he could bruise or frighten but she came so suddenly alive in his arms was so wildly responsive her mouth hungry and hot her body straining and pulsing against his she felt alive brilliantly alive aware of every frantic beat of her own heart her hands had streaked into his hair and were fisted there now as if she could pull him inside her he was filling all those empty places all those frightening blanks this was life this was real this mattered easy he could barely get the word out wished fervently he didnt feel obliged to he was trembling as much as she and he knew that if he didnt pull back gain some control he was going to take her exactly where they stood easy he said again and pressed her head to his shoulder so that he wouldnt be tempted to devour that ripe willing mouth she vibrated against him nerves and needs tangling the echoes of sensations thumping through her system i dont know if its ever been like that i just dont know that brought him back to earth a little too abruptly she didnt know he reminded himself he did it had never been like that for him dont worry he pulled away then rubbed his hands over her shoulders because they were tense again you know that wasnt ordinary bailey that ought to be enough for now but she bit her lip when he turned and wrenched open the fridge i madeim making iced tea i want a beer she winced at the brusque tone youre angry no he twisted off the cap downed three long swallows yes with myself a little i pushed the buttons after all he lowered the bottle studied her she was standing with her arms crossed tight at her waist his jeans bagged at her hips his shirt drooped at her shoulders her feet were bare her hair was tangled around her shoulders she looked absolutely defenseless lets just get this out okay he leaned back against the counter to keep his distance i felt the click the minute you walked into the office never happened to me before just click there she is i figured it was because you were a looker you were in trouble and youd come looking for me ive got a thing about people in trouble especially beautiful women he drank again slower this tune while she watched him soberly with great attention but thats not it bailey or at least not all of it i want to help you i want to find out everything about you as much as you do but i also want to make love with you slow really slow so that every seconds like an hour and when weve finished making love and youre naked and limp under me i want to start all over again she had her hands crossed over her breasts now to keep her bucking heart in place oh was all she could manage and thats what im going to do when youre a little steadier on your feet oh she said again well she cleared her throat cade i may be a criminal uhhuh calm again he inspected the sandwich makings on the counter so is this lunch her eyes narrowed what sort of response was that from a man whod just told her he wanted to make love with her until she was limp i may have stolen a great deal of money killed people kidnapped an innocent child right he piled some ham on bread yeah youre a real desperado sweetheart anybody can see that youve got that calculating killer gleam in the eye then chuckling he turned to her bailey for gods sake look at yourself youre a polite tidy woman with a conscience as wide as kansas i sincerely doubt you have so much as a parking ticket to your name or that youve done anything wilder than sing in the shower it stung she couldnt have said why but the bland and goodygoody description put her back up ive got a tattoo on my butt he set the rather sloppy sandwich hed put together down excuse me i have a tattoo on my butt she repeated with a combative gleam in her eye is that so he couldnt wait to see it well then ill have to turn you in now if you tell me youve got something other than your ears pierced ill have to get my gun im so pleased i could amuse you sweetheart you fascinate me he shifted to block her path before she could storm out temper thats a good sign baileys not a wimp she stepped to the right so did he she likes scrambled eggs with dill and paprika knows how to make iced tea cuts tomatoes in very precise slices and knows how to tie a shank knot what your belt he said with a careless gesture she was probably a girl scout or she likes to sail her voice gets icy when shes annoyed she has excellent taste in clothes bites her bottom lip when shes nervouswhich i should warn you instills wild lust in me for no sensible reason his dimples winked when she immediately stopped nibbling her lip and cleared her throat she keeps her nails at a practical length he continued and she can kiss a man blind an interesting woman our bailey he gave her hair a friendly tug now why dont we sit down eat lunch and ill tell you what else i found out do you want mustard or mayo i dont know still sulking she plopped down in a chair i go for mustard myself he brought it to the table along with the fixings for her sandwich so what is it she swiped mustard on bread what the tattoo what is it embarrassed now she slapped ham over mustard i hardly see that its an issue come on he grinned leaning over to tug on her hair again a butterfly a rosebud or are you really a biker chick in disguise with a skull and crossbones hiding under my jeans a unicorn she muttered he bit the tip of his tongue cute he watched her cut her sandwich into tidy and precise triangles but refrained from commenting because she wanted to squirm she changed the subject you were going to tell me what else youve found out since it didnt seem to do his blood pressure any good for him to paint mental images of unicorns he let her off the hook right the guns unregistered my source hasnt been able to trace it yet the clips full the clip the gun was fully loaded which means it either hadnt been fired recently or had been reloaded hadnt been fired she closed her eyes grasped desperately at relief i might not have used it at all id say its unlikely you did using current observations i cant picture you owning an unregistered handgun but if we get lucky and track it down we may have a clearer picture youve learned so much already he would have liked to bask in that warm admiration but he shrugged and took a hefty bite of his sandwich most of its negative information theres been no report of a robbery that involves a gem like the one youve been carrying or that amount of cash no kidnapping or hostage situations that the local police are involved in and no open homicides involving the type of weapon were dealing with in the last week he took another swallow of beer no one has reported a woman meeting your description missing in the last week either but how can that be she shoved her sandwich aside i have the gem i have the cash i am missing there are possibilities he kept his eyes on hers maybe someone doesnt want that information out bailey you said you thought the diamond was only part of a whole and when you were coming out of the nightmare you talked about three stars stars diamonds could be the same thing do you think there are three of those rocks stars she pressed her fingers to her temple as it started to ache did i talk about stars i dont remember anything about stars because it hurt to think about it she tried to concentrate on the reasonable three gems of that size and quality would be unbelievably rare as a set even if the others were inferior in clarity to the one i have theyd be beyond price you couldnt begin to assess her breath began to hitch to come in gasps as she fought for air i cant breathe okay he was up shifting her so that he could lower her head between her knees rub her back thats enough for now just relax dont force it he wondered as he stroked her back just what shed seen that put that kind of blind terror in her eyes im sorry she managed i want to help you are you will he eased her up again waiting as she pushed her hair back away from her pale cheeks hey its only day one remember okay because he didnt make her feel ashamed of the weakness she took a deep cleansing breath when i tried to think really think about what you were asking it was like a panic attack with all this guilt and horror and fear mixed together my head started to throb and my heart beat too fast i couldnt get air then well take it slow you dont get that panicky when we talk about the stone you have she closed her eyes a moment cautiously brought its image into her mind it was so beautiful so extraordinary there was concern and worry yes a layer of fear as well but it was more focused and somehow less debilitating no its not the same kind of reaction she shook her head opened her eyes i dont know why well work on that he scooted her plate back in front of her eat im planning a long evening and youre going to need fuel what sort of plans i went by the library on my travels ive got a stack of books on gemstechnical stuff pictures books on rare stones rare jewels the history of diamonds you name it we might find it the possibility cheered her enough to have her nibbling on her sandwich again if we could identify the stone we could trace the owner and then oh but you cant cant what work tonight you have to go somewhere with pamela i do hell he pressed his fingers to his eyes as he remembered im sorry i forgot to mention it your mother called i was in here so i heard the message shes upset that you havent returned her calls or contacted pamela about the arrangements for tonight shes going to be at dodies until four you can call her there also muffys very annoyed with you she called shortly after your mother and shes very unhappy that you missed camillas piano recital she isnt speaking to you until you apologize i should be so lucky he muttered and dropped his hands thats a pretty good rundown want a job when she only smiled he shook his head and rode on inspiration no im serious youre a hell of a lot more organized than my late unlamented secretary i could use some help around the office and you could use the busy work i dont even know if i can type i know i cant so youre already a step ahead you can answer a phone cant you of course but youd be doing me a big favor calculating her weaknesses he pressed his advantage it was the perfect way to keep her close keep her busy id rather not take the time to start advertising and interviewing secretaries right now if you could help me out a few hours a day id really appreciate it she thought of his office decided it didnt need a secretary so much as a bulldozer well perhaps she could be of some use after all id be glad to help great good look i picked up a few things for you while i was out things clothes and stuff she stared as he rose and began to clear the plates you bought me clothes nothing fancy i had to guess at the sizes but ive got a pretty good eye he caught her worrying her lip again and nearly sighed just a few basics bailey as cute as you look in my clothes you need your own and you cant wear one suit day after day no i suppose i cant she murmured touched that he should have thought of it thank you no problem its stopped raining you know what you could use a little fresh air lets take a walk clear your head i dont have any shoes she took the plates hed put on the counter and loaded them into the dishwasher i got you some sneakers six and a half with a half laugh she rewrapped the ham you tell me lets try mem on and see she slid the tray into the dishwasher closed the door cade you really have to call your mother his grin flashed uhuh i told you shes upset with you shes always upset with me im the black sheep be that as it may bailey dampened a dishrag and methodically wiped the counters shes your mother and shes waiting for your call no shes waiting so she can browbeat me into doing something i dont want to do and when i dont do it shell call muffy my evil sister and theyll have a grand old time ripping apart my character thats no way to speak about your familyand youve hurt camillas feelings i assume shes your niece there are rumors your sisters child no muffy doesnt have children she has creatures and camilla is a whiny pudgyfaced mutant she refused to smile rinsed out the cloth hung it neatly over the sink thats a deplorable way to speak about your niece even if you dont like children i do like children enjoying himself now he leaned on the counter and watched her tidy up im telling you camillas not human now my other sister doro shes got two and somehow the youngest escaped the parris curse hes a great kid likes baseball and bugs doro believes he needs therapy the chuckle escaped before she swallowed it youre making that up sweetheart believe me nothing i could invent about the parris clan would come close to the horrible truth theyre selfish selfimportant and selfindulgent are you going to mop the floor now she managed to close her mouth which had gaped at his careless condemnation of his own family distracted she glanced down at the glossy ivory tiles oh all right where bailey im kidding he grabbed her hand and tugged her out of the room just as the phone began to ring no he said before she could open her mouth im not answering it thats shameful its selfpreservation i never agreed to this pamela connection and im not going to be pressured into it cade i dont want you to upset your family and break a date on my account ill be fine i said i didnt make the date my mother did and now when i have to face the music i can use you as an excuse im grateful so grateful im going to knock a full day off your fee here he picked up one of the shopping bags hed dropped by the front door and pulled out a shoe box your glass slippers if they fit you get to go to the ball giving up she sat on the bottom landing and opened the box her brow cocked red sneakers i liked them theyre sexy sexy sneakers and she wondered as she undid the laces how she could be in such an enormous mess and find herself delighted over a silly pair of shoes they slid on like butter and for some reason made her want to laugh and weep at the same time perfect fit told you i had a good eye he smiled when she evened out the laces precisely tied them into careful and neat bows i was right very sexy he reached down to draw her to her feet in fact you make quite a package right now im sure i do when the only thing that fits are my shoes she started to rise to her toes to kiss his cheek then quickly changed her mind chicken he said maybe she held out her hand instead id really love to take a walk she stepped through the door he opened glanced up at him so is pamela pretty he considered decided the straight truth might be to his advantage gorgeous he closed the door behind them slipped an arm around baileys waist and she wants me the cool little hum of baileys response brought a satisfied smile to his lips chapter puzzles fascinated him locating pieces shuffling them around trying new angles until they slipped into place was a challenge that had always satisfied him it was one of the reasons cade had bucked family tradition and chosen his particular line of work there was enough rebel in him that he would have chosen almost any line of work that bucked family tradition but opening his own investigation agency had the added benefit of allowing him to call his own shots solve those puzzles and right a few wrongs along the way he had very definite opinions on right and wrong there were good guys and there were bad guys there was law and there was crime still he wasnt naive or simplistic enough not to understand and appreciate the shades of gray in fact he often visited gray areas appreciated them but there were certain lines that didnt get crossed he also had a logical mind that occasionally took recreational detours into the fanciful most of all he just loved figuring things out hed spent a good deal of time at the library after he left bailey that morning scanning reams of microfiche hunting for any snippet of news on a stolen blue diamond he hadnt had the heart to point out to her that they had no idea where she came from she might have traveled to dc from anywhere over the past few days the fact that she the diamond and the cash were here now didnt mean that was where they had started out neither of them had any idea just how long her memory had been blank hed studied up further on amnesia but he hadnt found anything particularly helpful as far as he could tell anything could trigger her memory or it could remain wiped clean with her new life beginning shortly before shed walked into his he had no doubt shed been through or witnessed something traumatic and though it might be considered one of those detours into the fanciful he was sometimes accused of having he was certain she was innocent of any wrongdoing how could a woman with eyes like hers have done anything criminal whatever the answers were he was dead set on one thinghe meant to protect her he was even ready to accept the simple fact that hed fallen for her the moment he saw her whoever and whatever bailey was she was the woman hed been waiting for so he not only meant to protect herhe meant to keep her hed chosen his first wife for all the logical and traditional reasons or he mused hed been fingeredcalculatinglyby his inlaws and also by his own family and that soulless merger had been a disaster in its very reasonableness since the divorcewhich had ruffled everyones feathers except those of the two people most involvedhed dodged and evaded commitment with a masters consummate skill at avoidance he believed the reason for all that was sitting crosslegged on the rug beside him peering myopically at a book on gemstones bailey you need glasses hmm she had all but pressed her nose into the page its just a wild guess but id say you usually wear reading glasses if your face gets any closer to that book youre going to be in it oh she blinked rubbed her eyes its just that the prints awfully small nope dont worry well take care of that tomorrow weve been at this a couple hours want a glass of wine i suppose chewing on her bottom lip she struggled to bring the text into focus the star of africa is the largest known cut diamond in existence at carats sounds like a whopper cade commented as he chose the bottle of sancerre hed been saving for the right occasion its set in the british royal scepter its too big and its not a blue diamond so far i havent found anything that matches our stone i wish i had a refractometer a what a refractometer she repeated pushing at her hair its an instrument that measures the characteristic property of a stone the refractive index her hand froze as he watched her how do i know that carrying two glasses he settled on the floor beside her again whats the refractive index its the relative ability to refract light diamonds are singly refracting cade i dont understand how i know that how do you know its not a sapphire he picked up the stone from where it sat like a paperweight on his notes it sure looks like one to me sapphires are doubly refracting she shuddered im a jewel thief that must be how i know or youre a jeweler a gem expert or a really rich babe who likes to play with baubles he handed her a glass dont jump to conclusions bailey thats how you miss details okay but she had an image of herself dressed all in black climbing in secondstory windows she drank deeply i just wish i could understand why i remember certain things refractometers the maltese falcon the maltese falcon the moviebogart mary astor you had the book in your room and the movie jumped right into my head and roses i know what they smell like but i dont know my favorite perfume i know what a unicorn is but i dont know why ive got a tattoo of one its a unicorn his lips curved up dimples flashing symbol of innocence she shrugged that off and drank down the rest of her wine quickly cade merely passed her his own glass and got up to refill and there was this tune playing around in my head while i was in the shower i dont know what it is but i couldnt get rid of it she sipped again frowned in concentration then began to hum beethovens ode to joy he told her beethoven bogart and a mythical beast you continue to fascinate me bailey and what kind of name is bailey she demanded gesturing expansively with her glass is it my last name or my first who would stick a child with a first name like bailey id rather be camilla he grinned again wondered if he should take the wine out of her reach no you wouldnt take my word for it she blew the hair out of her eyes and pouted tell me about diamonds theyre a girls best friend she chuckled then beamed at him did i make that up no honey you didnt gently he took the halfempty glass from her set it aside mental note he thoughtbaileys a onedrink wonder tell me what you know about diamonds they sparkle and shine they look cold even feel cold to the touch thats how you can easily identify glass trying to pass glass is warm diamonds are cold thats because theyre excellent heat conductors cold fire she lay on her back stretching like a cat and had saliva pooling in his mouth she closed her eyes its the hardest substance known with a value of ten on mohs hardness scale all good gem diamonds are white diamonds a yellowish or brown tinge is considered an imperfection my oh my she thought and sighed feeling her head spin blue green and red diamonds are very rare and highly prized the colors caused by the presence of minor elements other than pure carbon good he studied her face the curved lips closed eyes she might have been talking of a lover keep going in specific gravity diamonds range between and but the value for pure crystals is almost always you need brilliancy and fire she murmured stretching lazily again despite his good intentions his gaze shifted and he watched her small firm breasts press against the material of his shirt yeah i bet uncut diamonds have a greasy luster but when cut oh they shine she rolled over on her stomach bent her legs into the air and crossed her ankles this is characterized technically as adamantine the name diamond is derived from the greek word adamas meaning invincible theres such beauty in strength she opened her eyes again and they were heavy and clouded she shifted swinging her legs around until she was sitting all but in his lap youre awfully strong cade and so pretty when you kissed me it felt like you could gobble me right up and i couldnt do a thing about it she sighed wiggled a bit to get comfortable then confided i really liked it oh boy he felt the blood begin its slow leisurely journey from head to loins and cautiously covered both the hands she had laid on his chest better switch to coffee you want to kiss me again about as much as id like to take the next breath that mouth of hers was ripe and willing and close her eyes were dreamy and dark and she was plowed lets just hold off on that gently he started to ease her back but she was busily crawling the rest of the way into his lap in a smooth agile movement she wriggled down and hooked her legs around his waist i dont thinklisten for a damsel in distress she had some pretty clever moves he managed to catch her industrious hands again before she pulled his shirt off cut that out i mean it he did mean it he realized and accepted the new fact that he was insane do you think id be good in bed the question nearly had his eyes crossing and his tongue tied in knots she meanwhile simply sighed settled her head on his shoulder and murmured i hope im not frigid i dont think theres much chance of that cades blood pressure spiked while she nibbled delicately on his earlobe her hands snuck under his shirt and up his back with a light scraping of nails you taste so good she noted approvingly her lips moving down his throat im awfully hot are you hot with an oath he turned his head captured her mouth and devoured she was ripe with flavors pulsing with heat he let himself sink into her drown in that hot delicious mouth while the humming purrs that rippled from her throat pounded through his system like diamonds cased in velvet she was pliant almost fluid in surrender when she dipped her head back offering her throat no saint in heaven could have resisted it he scraped his teeth over that smooth white column listened to her moan felt her move sinuously against him in invitation he could have taken her simply laid her back on the books and papers and buried himself in her he could almost feel that glorious slippery friction the rhythm that would be theirs and only theirs and as much as he knew it would be right it would be perfect he knew it couldnt be either not then not there ive never wanted anyone as much as i want you he plunged his hand into her hair turning her head until their eyes met damn it focus for a minute look at me she couldnt see anything else she didnt want anything else her body felt light as air her mind empty of everything but him kiss me again cade its like a miracle when you do praying for strength he lowered his brow to hers until he could steady his breathing next time i kiss you youre going to know just whats going on he rose and lifted her into his arms my heads spinning giggling she let it fall back on his supporting arm whose isnt with what he considered really heroic control he laid her on the couch take a nap kay obediently she closed her eyes youll stay here i feel safe when youre here yeah ill be here he dragged his hands through his hair and watched her drift off they were going to laugh at this someday he thought maybe when they had grandchildren leaving her sleeping he went back to work she was digging in the dirt the sun was a torch in a sapphire sky the surrounding land was rocky and baked into muted shades of browns and reds and lavenders strong and pungent was the scent of sage from the pale green shrubs struggling out of cracks and crevices in the earth with spade and hammer she went about her work happily under the narrow shade of a boulder two women sat watching her her sense of contentment was strong and stronger yet when she looked over and smiled at them one had a short cap of hair that glowed like copper and a sharp foxy face and though her eyes were shielded by dark wraparound sunglasses bailey knew they were a deep deep green the other had ebony hair though it was tucked up now under a widebrimmed straw hat with silly red flowers around the crown loose the hair would fall past her shoulder blades thick and wavy to the waist it suited the magic of her face the creamy complexion and impossibly blue eyes bailey felt a wave of love just from looking at them a bond of trust and a sense of shared lives their voices were like music a distant song of which she could only catch snatches could go for a cold beer a cold anything how long do you think shell keep at it for the rest of our lives paris next summer definitely get her away from rocks long enough and the creeps definitely it made her smile that they were talking about her cared enough to talk about her shed go to paris with them but for now she chinked away at an interesting formation hoping to find something worthwhile something she could take back and study then fashion into something pretty for her friends it took patience and a good eye whatever she found today shed share with them then suddenly the blue stones all but tumbled into her hand three perfect blue diamonds of spectacular size and luster and it was with pleasure rather than shock that she examined them turned them in her palms then felt the jolt of power sing through her body the storm rolled in fast and mean blocking the flaming sun dark grasping shadows shooting out and covering the landscape now there was panic a great need to hurry hurry hurry a stone for each of them before it was too late before the lightning struck but it was already too late lightning stabbed the skin sharp as a knife and she was running running blindly alone and terrified with the walls closing in and the lightning stabbing at her heels she awoke with her breath heaving shooting straight up on the sofa what had she done dear god what had she done rocking herself her hands pressed to her mouth bailey waited for the shudders to pass the room was quiet there was no thunder no lightning no storm chasing her and she wasnt alone across the room under the slant of light from a globe lamp cade dozed in a chair he had a book open on his lap it calmed her just to see him there papers scattered at his feet a mug on the table beside him his legs were stretched out crossed comfortably at the ankles even in sleep he looked strong dependable he hadnt left her alone she had to block an urge to go over crawl into his lap and slide back to sleep cuddled with him he pulled her tugged at her emotions so strongly it didnt seem to matter that shed known him less than twentyfour hours after all shed hardly known herself much longer pushing at her hair she glanced at her watch it was just after three am a vulnerable time stretching out again she pillowed her head on her hands and watched him her memory of the evening was clear enough no breaks no jumps she knew shed thrown herself at him and it both embarrassed and amazed her hed been right to stop before matters got out of hand she knew he was right but oh she wished hed just taken her there on the floor taken her before she had all this time to think about the right and wrong of it the consequences some of this emptiness within her would be filled now some of those undefinable needs met sighing she rolled to her back and stared up at the ceiling but hed been right to stop she had to think she closed her eyes not to seek sleep but to welcome memory who were the women shed dreamed of and where were they now despite herself she drifted off cade woke the next morning stiff as a board bones popped as he stretched he rubbed his hands over his face and his palms made scratching sounds against the stubble the moment his eyes cleared he looked across the room the couch was empty he might have thought hed dreamed her if not for the books and papers heaped all over the floor the whole thing seemed like a dreamthe beautiful troubled woman with no past walking into his life and his heart at the same time in the morning light he wondered how much hed romanticized it this connection he felt with her love at first sight was a romantic notion under the best of circumstances and these were hardly the best she didnt need him mooning over her he reminded himself she needed his mind to be clear daydreaming about the way shed wrapped herself around him and asked him to make love with her simply wasnt conducive to logical thinking he needed coffee he rose and trying to roll the crick out of his neck headed for the kitchen and there she was pretty as a picture and neat as a pin her hair was smooth brushed to a golden luster and pulled back with a simple rubber band she was wearing the navyandwhite striped slacks hed bought her with a white camp shirt tucked into the waist with one hand resting on the counter the other holding a steaming mug she was staring out the window at his backyard where a rope hammock hung between twin maples and roses bloomed youre an early riser her hand shook in startled reaction to his voice and then she turned worked up a smile her heart continued to thud just a little too fast when she saw him rumpled from sleep i made coffee i hope you dont mind sweetheart i owe you my life he said in heartfelt tones as he reached for a mug it seems i know how to make it apparently some things just come naturally i didnt even have to think about it its a little strong i must like it strong he was already downing it reveling in the way it seared his mouth and jolted his system perfect good i didnt know if i should wake you i wasnt sure what time you leave for your office or how much time youd need its saturday and the long holiday weekend holiday fourth of july while the caffeine pumped through his system he topped off his mug fireworks potato salad marching bands oh she had a flash of a little girl sitting on a womans lap as lights exploded in the night sky of course youll be taking the weekend off you must have plans yeah i got plans i plan for us to toddle into the office about midmorning i can show you the ropes wont be able to do much legwork today with everything shut down but we can start putting things in order i dont want you to give up your weekend id be happy to go in and straighten up your office and you could bailey im in this with you she set her mug down linked her hands why because it feels right to me the way i see it what you cant figure out in your head you do on instinct those seamist eyes roamed over her face then met hers i like to think theres a reason you picked me for both of us im surprised you can say that after the way i acted last evening for all we know i go out cruising bars every night and pick up strange men he chuckled into his mug better to laugh hed decided than to groan bailey the way a single glass of wine affects you i doubt you spent much time in bars ive never seen anyone get bombed quite that fast i dont think thats anything to be proud of her voice had turned stiff and cool and it made him want to grin again its nothing to be ashamed of either and you didnt pick a strange man you picked me the amusement in his eyes flicked off we both know it was personal with or without the alcohol then why didnt you take advantage because thats just what it would have been i dont mind having the advantage but im not interested in taking it want breakfast she shook her head waited until hed gotten out a box of cereal and a bowl i appreciate your restraint do you not entirely good he felt the muscles of his ego expand and flex as he got milk out of the refrigerator he poured it on then added enough sugar to have baileys eyes widening that cant be healthy i live for risk he ate standing up later i thought wed drive downtown walk around with the tourists you may see something that jogs your memory all right she hesitated then took a chair i dont know anything about your work really your usual clientele but it seems to me youre taking all of this completely in stride i love a mystery then he shrugged and shoveled in more cereal youre my first amnesia case if thats what you mean my usual is insurance fraud and domestic work it has its moments have you been an investigator very long four years five if you count the year i trained as an operative with guardian theyre a big security firm here in dc real suitandtie stuff i like working on my own better have you ever had to shoot at someone no too bad really because im a damn good shot he caught her gnawing her lip and shook his head relax bailey cops and pis catch the bad guys all the time without drawing their weapon ive taken a few punches given a few but mostly its just legwork repetition and making calls your problems just another puzzle its just a matter of finding all the pieces and fitting them together she hoped he was right hoped it could be just that simple that ordinary that logical i had another dream there were two women i knew them im sure of it when he pulled out a chair and sat across from her she told him what she remembered it sounds like you were in the desert he said when she fell silent arizona maybe new mexico i dont know but i wasnt afraid i was happy really happy until the storm came there were three stones youre sure of that yes almost identical but not quite i had them and they were so beautiful so extraordinary but i couldnt keep them together that was very important she sighed i dont know how much was real and how much was jumbled and symbolic the way dreams are if one stones real there may be two more he took her hand if one womans real there may be two more we just have to find them it was after ten when they walked into his office the cramped and dingy work space struck her as more than odd now that shed seen how he lived but she listened carefully as he tried to explain how to work the computer to type up his notes how he thought the filing should be done how to handle the phone and intercom systems when he left her alone to close himself in his office bailey surveyed the area the philodendron lay on its side spilling dirt there was broken glass sticky splotches from old coffee and enough dust to shovel typing would just have to wait she decided no one could possibly concentrate in such a mess from behind his desk cade used the phone to do his initial legwork he tracked down his travel agent and on the pretext of planning a vacation asked her to locate any desert area where rockhounding was permitted he told her he was exploring a new hobby from his research the night before hed learned quite a bit about the hobby of unearthing crystals and gems the way bailey had described her dream he was certain that was just what shed been up to maybe she was from out west or maybe shed just visited there either way it was another road to explore he considered calling in a gem expert to examine the diamond but on the off chance that bailey had indeed come into its possession by illegal means he didnt want to risk it he took the photographs hed snapped the night before of the diamond and spread them out on his desk just how much would a gemologist be able to tell from pictures he wondered it might be worth a try tuesday when businesses were open again he mused he might take that road as well but he had a couple of other ideas to pursue there was another road an important one that had to be traveled first he picked up the phone again began making calls he pinned detective mick marshall down at home damn it cade its saturday ive got twenty starving people outside and burgers burning on the grill youre having a party and didnt invite me im crushed i dont have play cops at my barbecues now youve really hurt my feelings did you earn that scotch no match on those prints you sent me nothing popped cade felt twin tugs of relief and frustration okay still no word on a missing rock maybe if you told me what kind of rock a big glittery one youd know if it had been reported nothings been reported and i think the rocks are in your head parris now unless youre going to share ive got hungry mouths to feed ill get back to you on it and the scotch he hung up and spent some tune thinking lightning kept coming up in baileys dreams thered been thunderstorms the night before she came into his office it could be as simple as thatone of the last things she remembered was thunder and lightning maybe she had a phobia about storms she talked about the dark too thered been some power outages downtown that night hed already checked on that maybe the dark was literal rather than symbolic he guessed shed been inside she hadnt spoken of rain of getting wet inside a house an office building if whatever had happened to her had happened the night before she came to him then it almost certainly had to have occurred in the dc area but no gem had been reported missing three kept cropping up in her dreams as well three stones three stars three women a triangle symbolic or real he began to take notes again using two columns in one he listed her dream memories as literal memories in the other he explored the symbolism and the longer he worked the more he leaned toward the notion that it was a combination of both he made one last call and prepared to grovel his sister muffy had married into one of the oldest and most prestigious family businesses in the east westlake jewelers when cade stepped back into the outer office his ears were still ringing and his nerves were shot those were the usual results of a conversation with his sister but since hed wangled what he wanted he tried to take things in stride the shock of walking into a clean ordered room and seeing bailey efficiently rattling the keyboard on the computer went a long way toward brightening his mood youre a goddess he grabbed her hand kissed it lavishly a worker of miracles this place was filthy disgusting yeah it probably was her brows lowered there was food molding in the file cabinets i dont doubt it you know how to work a computer she frowned at the screen apparently it was like making the coffee this morning no thought if you know how to work it you know how to turn it off lets go downtown ill buy you an ice cream cone ive just gotten started it can wait he reached down to flick the switch and she slapped his hand away no i havent saved it muttering under her breath she hit a series of keys with such panache his heart swelled in admiration ill need several more hours to put things in order around here well come back weve got a couple hours to kick around then weve got some serious work to do what kind of work she demanded as he hauled her to her feet ive got you access to a refractometer he pulled her out the door what kind of ice cream do you want chapter your brotherinlaw owns westlake jewelers not personally its a family thing a family thing baileys head was still spinning somehow shed gone from cleaning molded sandwiches out of filing cabinets to eating strawberry ice cream on the steps of the lincoln memorial that was confusing enough but the way cade had whipped through traffic zipping around circles and through yellow lights had left her dizzy and disoriented yep he attacked his two scoops of rocky road since shed stated no preference hed gotten her strawberry he considered it a girl flavor they have branches all over the country but the flagship stores here muffy met ronald at a charity tennis tournament when she beaned him with a lob very romantic i see or she was trying to and he agreed to let us use the equipment muffy agreed ronald goes along with whatever muffy wants bailey licked her dripping cone watched the touriststhe families the childrenclamber up and down the steps i thought she was angry with you i talked her out of it well i bribed her camilla also takes ballet theres a recital next month so ill go watch camilla twirl around in a tutu which believe me is not a pretty sight bailey choked back a chuckle youre so mean hey ive seen camilla in a tutu you havent take my word im being generous he liked seeing her smile just strolling along with him eating strawberry ice cream and smiling then theres chip thats muffys other mutant he plays the piccolo im sure youre making this up i couldnt make it up my imagination has limits in a couple of weeks i have to sit front and center and listen to chip and his piccolo at a band concert he shuddered im buying earplugs lets sit down they settled on the smooth steps beneath the wise and melancholy president there was a faint breeze that helped stir the close summer air but it could do little about the moist heat that bounced hard as damp bricks up from the sidewalks bailey could see waves of it shimmer like desert mirages in the air there was something oddly familiar about all of it the crowds of people passing pushing strollers clicking cameras the mix of voices and accents the smells of sweat humanity and exhaust flowers blooming in their plots vendors hawking their wares i must have been here before she murmured but its just out of sync like someone elses dream its going to come back to you he tucked a stray strand of hair behind her ear pieces already are you know how to make coffee use a computer and you can organize an office maybe im a secretary he didnt think so the way she rattled off in formation on diamonds the evening before had given him a different idea but he wanted to weigh it awhile before sharing it if you are ill double your salary if you work for me keeping it light he rose and offered her a hand weve got some shopping to do we do you need reading glasses lets hit the stores it was another experience the sprawling shopping center packed with people looking for bargains the holiday sale was in full swing despite the heat winter coats were displayed and discounted twenty percent and fall fashions crowded out the picked over remains of summer wear cade deposited her at a store that promised glasses within an hour and filled out the necessary forms himself while she browsed the walls of frames available there was a quick warm glow that spread inside him when he listed her name as bailey parris and wrote his own address it looked right to him felt right and when she was led into the back for the examfree with the purchase of frameshe gave her a kiss on the cheek in less than two hours she was back in his car examining her pretty little wireframed glasses and the contents of a loaded shopping bag how did you have time to buy all of this with a purely feminine flutter she smoothed a hand over the smooth leather of a bone shoulderstrap envelope bag its all a matter of stategy and planning knowing what you want and not being distracted bailey peeked in a bag from a lingerie store and saw rich black silk gingerly she pulled the material out there wasnt a great deal of it she mused youve got to sleep in something cade told her it was on sale they were practically giving it away she might not have known who she was but she was pretty sure she knew sleepwear from seduceme wear she tucked the silk back in the bag digging deeper she discovered a bag of crystals oh theyre lovely they had one of those nature stores so i picked up some rocks he braked at a stop sign and shifted so that he could watch her picked out a few that appealed to me the smooth ones are what do you call it tumbling stones she murmured stroking them gently with a fingertip carnelian citrine sodalite jasper flushed with pleasure she unwrapped tissue tourmaline watermelon tourmalinesee the pinks and the greensand this is a lovely column of fluorite its one of my favorites i she trailed off pressed a hand to her temple he reached in himself took out a stone at random whats this alexandrite its a chrysoberyl a transparent stone its color changes with the light see its bluegreen now in daylight but in incandescent light it would be mauve or violet she swallowed hard because the knowledge was there just there in her mind its a multipurpose stone but scarce and expensive it was named for czar alexander i okay relax take a deep breath he made the turn headed down the treelined street you know your stones bailey apparently i do and they give you a lot of pleasure her face had lit up simply glowed when she studied his choices it scares me the more the information crowded inside my head the more it scared me he pulled into his driveway turned to her are you up to doing the rest of this today she could say no she realized he would take her inside then inside his house where shed be safe she could go up to the pretty bedroom close herself in she wouldnt have to face anything but her own cowardice i want to be i will be she added and let out a long breath i have to be okay reaching over he gave her hand a quick squeeze just sit here ill get the diamond westlake jewelers was housed in a magnificent old building with granite columns and long windows draped in satin it was not the place for bargains the only sign was a discreet and elegant brass plate beside the arched front entrance cade drove around the back theyre getting ready to close for the day he explained if i know muffy shell have ronald here waiting he may not be too thrilled with me so yeah theres his car cade shot his own into a space beside a sedate gray mercedes sedan you just play along with me all right play along she wrinkled her brow as he dumped stones into her new handbag what do you mean i had to spin a little story to talk her into this reaching over he opened baileys door just go along she got out walked with him to the rear entrance it might help if i knew what i was going along with dont worry he rang the buzzer ill handle it she shifted her now heavy bag on her shoulder if youve lied to your family i think i ought to she broke off when the heavy steel door opened cade ronald westlake nodded curtly cade had been right bailey thought instantly this was not a happy man he was average height trim and well presented in a dark blue suit with a muted striped tie so ruthlessly knotted she wondered how he could draw breath his face was tanned his carefully styled hair dark and discreetly threaded with glinting gray dignity emanated from him like light ronald good to see you cade said cheerily and as if ronalds greeting had been filled with warmth he pumped his hand enthusiastically hows the golf game muffy tells me youve been shaving that handicap as he spoke cade eased himself inside much bailey thought like a salesman with his foot propped in a door ronald continued to frown and back up this is bailey muffy might have told you a little about her in a proprietary move cade wrapped his arm around baileys shoulder and pulled her to his side yes how do you do ive been keeping her to myself cade added before bailey could speak i guess you can see why smoothly cade tipped baileys face up to his and kissed her i appreciate you letting us play with your equipment baileys thrilled sort of a busmans holiday for her showing me how she works with stones he shook her purse so that the stones inside rattled youve never shown any interest in gems before ronald pointed out i didnt know bailey before cade said easily now im fascinated and now that ive talked her into staying in the states shes going to have to think about setting up her own little boutique right sweetheart i englands loss is our gain he continued and if one of the royals wants another bauble theyll have to come here im not letting you get away he kissed her again deeply while ronald stood huffing and tugging at his tie cade tells me youve been designing jewelry for some time its quite an endorsement having the royal family select your work its sort of keeping it in the family too cade said with a wink with baileys mama being one of dis cousins was that third or fourth cousin honey oh well whats the difference third bailey said amazed at herself not only for answering but also for infusing her voice with the faintest of upperclass british accents theyre not terribly close cades making too much of it its simply that a few years ago a lapel pin id fashioned caught the eye of the princess of wales shes quite a keen shopper you know yes yes indeed the tony accent had a sizable effect on a man with ronalds social requirements his smile spread his voice warmed im delighted you could stop by i do wish i could stay show you around we dont want to keep you cade was already thumping ronald on the back muffy told me youre entertaining its terribly presumptuous of cade to interrupt your holiday i would so love a tour another time of course anytime anytime at all and you must try to drop by the house later this evening pumped up at the thought of entertaining even such a loose connection with royalty ronald began to usher them toward the jewelers work area were very select in our equipment as well as our stones the westlake reputation has been unimpeachable for generations ah yes her heart began to thud as she studied the equipment in the glasswalled room the worktables the saws the scales quite topoftheline we pride ourselves on offering our clientele only the best we often cut and shape our own gems here and employ our own lapidaries baileys hand shook lightly as she passed it over a wheel a lap she thought used to shape the stone she could see just how it was donethe stone cemented to the end of a wooden stick a dop held against the revolving lap wheel with the aid of a supporting block adjacent to the wheel she knew could hear the sounds of it feel the vibrations i enjoy lap work bailey said faintly the precision of it im afraid i only admire the craftsmen and artists thats a stunning ring may i ronald took her left hand examined the trio of stones arranged in a gentle curve and set in etched gold lovely your design yes it seemed the best answer i particularly enjoy working with colored stones you must see our stock sometime soon ronald glanced at his watch clucked his tongue im running quite late the security guard will let you back out when youre done please take all the time you want im afraid the showroom itself is locked timelocked and youll need the guard to open the rear door as it engages from inside and out he sent bailey a professionaltoprofessional smile youd understand how important security is in the business of course thank you so much for your time mr westlake ronald took baileys offered hand ronald please and its my pleasure you mustnt let cade be so selfish of you muffy is very much looking forward to meeting her future sisterinlaw be sure to drop by later bailey made a strangled sound easily covered by cades quick chatter as he all but shoved ronald out of the work area sisterinlaw bailey managed i had to tell them something all innocence cade spread his hands theyve been campaigning to get me married off again since the ink was dry on my divorce decree and you being royalty so to speak puts you several societal steps up from the women theyve been pushing on me poor cade having women shoved at him right and left ive suffered because there were dangerous glints in her eyes he tried his best smile you have no idea how ive suffered hold me she slapped his hand away is this all a big joke to you no but that part of it was fun he figured his hands would be safer in his pockets i guarantee my sisters been burning up the phone lines since i talked to her this morning and now that ronalds got a load of you you lied to your family yeah sometimes its fun sometimes its just necessary for survival he angled his head you slipped right into the stream sweetheart that accent was a nice touch i got caught up and im not proud of it you might make a good operative let me tell you lying quick and lying well is one of the top requirements of the job and the end justifies the means pretty much it was starting to irritate him the disapproving ice in her voice he had the feeling bailey wasnt nearly as comfortable in gray areas as he was were in arent we and ronald and muffy are going to have a rousing success with their little party so whats the problem i dont know i dont like it a lie the simple fact of a lie made her miserably uncomfortable one lie just leads to another and enough of them sometimes lead to the truth he took her bag opened it and pulled out the velvet pouch slid the diamond into his hand you want the truth bailey or do you just want honesty it doesnt seem like there should be a difference but she took the stone from him all right as you said were here what do you want me to do make sure its real of course its real she said impatiently i know its real he merely arched a brow prove it with a huffing breath she turned and headed for a microscope she employed the darkfield illuminator adjusting the focus on the binocular microscope with instinctive efficiency beautiful she said after a moment with a tint of reverence in her voice just beautiful what do you see the interior of the stone theres no doubt its of natural origin the inclusions are characteristic lets see he nudged her aside bent to the microscope himself could be anything no no there are no air bubbles there would be if it was paste or strass and the inclusions doesnt mean anything to me its blue and blue means sapphire oh for heavens sake sapphire is corundum do you think i cant tell the difference between carbon and corundum she snatched up the stone and marched to another instrument this is a polariscope it tests whether a gem is singly or doubly refracting as ive already told you sapphires are doubly refracting diamonds singly she went about her work muttering to herself putting her glasses on when she needed them slipping the eyepiece into the v of her blouse when she didnt every move competent habitual precise cade tucked his hands in his back pockets rocked back on his heels and watched here the refractometer she mumbled any idiot can see the refractive index of this stone says diamond not sapphire she turned holding up the stone this is a blue diamond brilliantcut weighing carats all you needs a lab coat he said quietly what you work with this stuff bailey i thought it might be a hobby but youre too precise too comfortable and too easily annoyed when questioned so my conclusions are that you work with stones with gems this type of equipment is as familiar to you as a coffee maker its just part of your me she lowered her hand and eased herself back onto a stool you didnt do all this go to all this trouble so we could identify the diamond did you lets just say that was a secondary benefit now we have to figure whether youre in the gem or jewelry trade thats how you got your hands on this he took the diamond from her studied it and this isnt the kind of thing you see for sale at westlake or any other jeweler its the kind of thing you find in a private collection or a museum weve got a really fine museum right here in town its called the smithsonian he lowered the stone you may have heard of it you think took it out of the smithsonian i think someone there might have heard of it he slipped the priceless gem casually into his pocket itll have to wait until tomorrow theyll be closed no hell tuesday he hissed between his teeth tomorrows the fourth and mondays a holiday what should we do until tuesday we can start with phone books i wonder how many gemologists are in the greater metropolitan area the reading glasses meant she could pore through all the books without risking a headache and pore through them she did it was bailey thought something like rereading wellloved fairy tales it was all familiar ground but she enjoyed traveling over it again she read about the history of intaglio cutting in mesopotamia the gems of the hellenistic period florentine engravings she read of famous diamonds of the vargas the jonker the great mogul which had disappeared centuries before of marie antoinette and the diamond necklace some said had cost her her head she read technical explanations on gem cutting on identification on optical properties and formations they were all perfectly clear to her and as smooth as the carnelian tumble stone she worried between her fingers how could it be she wondered that she remembered rocks and not people she could easily identify and discuss the properties of hundreds of crystals and gems but there was only one single person in the entire world she knew and even that wasnt herself she only knew cade cade parris with his quick often confusing mind cade with his gentle patient hands and gorgeous green eyes eyes that looked at her as though she could be the focus of his world yet his world was so huge compared to hers his was populated by people and memories places hed been things hed done moments hed shared with others the huge blank screen that was her past taunted her what people did she know whom had she loved or hated had anyone ever loved her whom had she hurt or been hurt by and where had she been what had she done was she scientist or thief lover or loner she wanted to be a lover cades lover it was terrifying how much she wanted that to sink into bed with him and let everything float away on that warm river of sensation she wanted him to touch her really touch her to feel his hands on her skimming over naked flesh heating it taking her to a place where the past meant nothing and the future was unimportant where there was only now the greedy glorious now and she could touch him feel the muscles bunch in his back and shoulders as he covered her his heart would pound against hers and she would arch up to meet him to take him in and then she jumped when the book slapped shut take a break cade ordered shifting the book across the table where shed settled to read your eyes are going to fall out of your head oh i good god she thought goggling at him she was all but trembling brutally aroused by her own fantasy her pulse was skidding along like skates on bumpy ice i was just look youre all flushed he turned to get the pitcher of iced tea from the refrigerator and she rolled her eyes at his back flushed she was flushed couldnt the man see she was a puddle just waiting to be lapped up he poured her a glass over ice popped the top on a beer for himself weve done enough for one day im thinking steaks on the grill well see if you can put a salad together hey he reached out to steady the glass hed handed her your hands are shaking youve been overdoing it no i she could hardly tell him shed just given serious thought to biting his neck carefully she removed her glasses folded them set them on the table maybe a little theres so much on my mind ive got the perfect antidote for overthinking he took her hand pulled her to the door and outside where the air was full of heat and the heady perfume of roses a half hour of lazy he took her glass set it on the little wroughtiron table beside the rope hammock put his beer beside it come on well watch the sky awhile he wanted her to lie down with him lie down cupped with him in that hammock while her insides were screaming for release i dont think i should sure you should to settle the matter he gave her a yank and tumbled into the hammock with her it rocked wildly making him laugh as she scrambled for balance just relax this is one of my favorite spots theres been a hammock here as long as i can remember my uncle used to nap in this redandwhite striped one when he was supposed to be puttering around the garden he slid his arm under her took one of her nervous hands in his nice and cozy you can see little pieces of sky through the leaves it was cool there shaded by the maples she could feel his heart beating steadily when he laid their joined bands on his chest i used to sneak over here a lot did a lot of dreaming and planning in this hammock it was always peaceful over here and when you were swinging in a hammock in the shade nothing seemed all that urgent its like being in a cradle i suppose she willed herself to relax shocked to the core at how much she wanted to roll on top of him and dive in things are simpler in a hammock he toyed with her fingers charmed by their grace and the glitter of rings he kissed them absently and made her heart turn over in her chest do you trust me bailey at that moment she was certain that whatever her past shed never trusted anyone more yes lets play a game her imagination whirled into several erotic corners aha game word association you empty your mind and ill say a word whatever pops into your head first you say it word association unsure whether to laugh or scream she closed her eyes you think itll jog my memory it cant hurt but lets just think of it as a lazy game to play in the shade ready she nodded kept her eyes closed and let herself be lulled by the swing of the hammock all right city crowded desert sun work satisfaction fire blue when she opened her eyes started to shift he snuggled her closer no dont stop and analyze just let it come ready love friends she let out a breath found herself relaxing again friends she repeated family mother she made a small sound and he soothed it away happy childhood diamond power lightning murder she let out a choked breath and turned to bury her face against his shoulder i cant do this i cant look there okay its all right thats enough he stroked her hair and though his hand was gentle his eyes were hot as they stared up through the shady canopy of leaves whoever had frightened her made her tremble with terror was going to pay while cade held bailey under the maple trees another stood on a stone terrace overlooking a vast estate of rolling hills tended gardens jetting fountains he was furious the woman had dropped off the face of the earth with his property and his forces were as scattered as the three stars it should have been simple hed all but had them in his hands but the bumbling fool had panicked or perhaps had simply become too greedy in either case hed let the woman escape and the diamonds had gone with her too much time had passed he thought tapping his small beautifully manicured hand on the stone railing one woman vanished the other on the run and the third unable to answer his questions it would have to be fixed and fixed soon the timetable was now destroyed there was only one person to blame for that he mused and stepped back into his lofty office picked up the phone bring him to me was all he said he replaced the receiver with the careless arrogance of a man used to having his orders obeyed chapter saturday night he took her dancing shed imagined hunkering down at the kitchen table with books and a pot of strong coffee as soon as dinner was over instead he swept her out of the house before shed finished wiping off the counters barely giving her enough time to run a brush through her hair she needed a distraction hed told her she needed music she needed to experience life it was certainly an experience shed never seen anything like it that she knew the noisy crowded club in the heart of georgetown vibrated with life shook from floor to ceiling with voices and busy feet the music was so loud she couldnt hear her own thoughts and the stingy little table cade managed to procure for them in the middle of it all was still sticky from the last patrons pitcher of beer it astonished her nobody seemed to know anyone else or they knew each other well enough to make love standing up in public surely the hot wiggling moves done body against body on the tiny dance floor were nothing less than a mating ritual he bought her club soda stuck to the same harmless drink himself and watched the show more he watched her watch the show lights flashed voices echoed and no one seemed to have a care in the world is this what you usually do on the weekend she had to shout into his ear and she still wasnt certain he would hear her over the crash and din of guitars and drums now and again hardly ever he thought studying the ebb and flow of the tide of singles at the bar certainly not a great deal since his college days the idea of bringing her here had been an impulse even an inspiration he thought she could hardly brood and worry under these conditions its a local group ive been duped she repeated doubtfully no no this band is a local group he chuckled scooted his chair closer to hers slid his arm around her shoulders downanddirty rock no country no soft crap no pap just kick ass what do you think she struggled to think to tune in to the hard pulsating and repetitive rhythm over the driving ocean of music the band was shouting about dirty deeds and doing them dirtcheap i dont know but it sure isnt the ode to joy he laughed at that long and loud before grabbing her hand come on dance with me instant panic her palm went damp her eyes grew huge i dont think i know how to hell bailey theres not enough room out there to do more than break a couple of commandments that doesnt take any practice yes but he was dragging her toward the dance floor snaking his way through tables bumping into people she lost count of the number of feet they must have trod on cade id rather just watch youre here to experience he yanked her into his arms gripped her hips in an intimate and possessive way that had her breath locking in her throat see one commandment down and suddenly his body was moving suggestively against hers the rest is easy i dont think ive ever done this the lights circling and flashing overhead made her dizzy giddy im sure id remember he thought she was probably right there was something entirely too innocent about the way she fumbled the way the color rushed to her cheeks he slid his hands over her bottom up to her waist its just dancing i dont think so ive probably danced before put your arms around me he levered her arms around his neck himself and kiss me what never mind his face was close and the music was filling her head the heat from his body from all the bodies pressed so close against them was like a furnace she couldnt breathe she couldnt think and when his mouth swooped down on hers she didnt care her head pounded with the backbeat it was unmercifully hot the air thick with smoke and body heat scented with sweat and liquor and clashing perfumes all of that faded away she swayed against him while her lips parted for his and the strong male essence of him filled her if wed stayed home wed be in bed he murmured it against her lips then skimmed his mouth to her ear she was wearing the perfume hed bought for her the scent of it was unreasonably intimate i want you in bed bailey i want to be inside you she closed her eyes burrowed against him surely no one had said such things to her before she couldnt have forgotten this wild thrill this wild fear her fingers slipped up into the untidy hair that waved over his collar before when i was in the kitchen i i know he flicked his tongue over her ear spread fire everywhere i could have had you did you think i couldnt see that to torment them both he skimmed his lips along her throat thats why were here instead of home youre not ready for what i need from you this doesnt make any sense she thought she murmured it but he heard her who the hell cares about sense this is now he caught her chin brought her face to his again were now and kissed her until her blood bubbled and burst in her head it can be hot he bit her bottom lip until she was ready to sink to the floor or sweet then laved it tenderly with his tongue it can be fun he spun her out then whipped her back into his arms with such casual grace that she blinked whatever you want her hands were braced on his shoulders her face was close to his lights revolved around them and music throbbed i think think wed be safer with the fun for the time being then lets have it he whipped her out again spun her in two fast circles his eyes lit with amusement when she laughed she caught her breath as her body rammed into his again youve had lessons sweetheart i may have hooked cotillion more times than i want to admit but some things stuck they were moving again somehow magically through the thick throng of dancers cotillion isnt that white gloves and bow ties something like that he skimmed his hands up her sides just brushed her breasts and nothing like this she missed a step rapped back solidly into what she first took for a steel beam when she glanced back she saw what appeared to be one massive muscle with a glossy bald head a silver nose ring and a gleaming smile i beg your pardon she began but found she had breath for nothing else as the muscle whirled her to the right she found herself jammed in the middle of a pack of dancers with enthusiastically jabbing elbows and bumping hips they hooted at her in such a friendly manner she tried to pick up the beat she was giggling when she was bumped back into cades arms it is fun elemental liberating nearly pagan im dancing the way her face glowed her voice rang with delighted laughter had a grin flashing on his face looks that way she waved a hand in front of her face in a useless attempt to fan away the heat i like it then well do it again the volume eased down the beat smoothed into a hum here comes a slow one now all you have to do is plaster yourself all over me i think i already am closer his leg slid intimately between hers his hands cruised low on her hips oh god her stomach filled with frantic butterflies that has to be another commandment one of my personal favorites the music was seductive sexy and sad her mood changed with it from giddiness to longing cade i dont think this is smart but shed risen to her toes so their faces were close lets be reckless just for one dance it cant last she murmured as her cheek pressed against his shh for as long as we want forever she thought and held tight im not an empty slate ive just been erased for a while neither of us might like whats written there when we find it he could smell her feel her taste her i know everything i need to know she shook her head but i dont she drew back looked into his eyes i dont she repeated and when she broke away and moved quickly through the crowd he let her go she hurried into the rest room she needed privacy she needed to get her breath back she needed to remember that however much she might want it her me had not begun when she walked into a cramped little office and saw cade parris for the first time the room was nearly as packed as the dance floor with women primping at the mirrors talking about men complaining about other women the room smelled thickly of hairspray perfume and sweat in one of the three narrow sinks bailey ran the water cold splashed it on her overheated face shed danced in a noisy nightclub and screamed with laughter shed let the man she wanted touch her intimately without a care for who saw it and she knew as she lifted her face and studied the reflection in the spotty mirror that none of those things were usual for her this was new just as cade parris was new and she didnt know how any of it would fit into the life that was hers it was happening so quickly she thought and dug into her purse for a brush the purse hed bought her the brush hed bought her she thought while emotion swamped her everything she had right now she owed to him was that what she felt for him a debt gratitude lust not one of the women crowded into the room with her was worried about things like that she thought not one of them was asking herself that kind of question about the man shed just danced with the man she wanted or who wanted her they would all go back out and dance again or go home they would make love tonight if the mood was right and tomorrow their lives would simply move on but she had to ask and how could she know the answer when she didnt know herself and how could she take him or give herself to him until she did know get yourself in order she told herself and methodically ran the brush through her tumbled hair tune to be sensible practical calm satisfied her hair was tidy again she slipped the brush back into her bag a redhead walked in all legs and attitude with shortcropped hair and wraparound shades son of a bitch grabbed my butt she said to no one in particular and strode into a stall slammed the door baileys vision grayed clammy waves of dizziness had her clutching the lip of the sink but her knees went so weak she had to lean over the bowl and gulp for air hey hey you okay someone patted her on the back and the voice was like bees buzzing in her head yes just a little dizzy im all right im fine using both hands she cupped cold water splashed it again and again on her face when she thought her legs would hold her she snatched paper towels and dried her dripping cheeks as wobbly as a drunk she staggered out of the rest room and back into the screaming cave that was the club she was bumped and jostled and never noticed someone offered to buy her a drink some bright soul offered boozily to buy her she passed through without seeing anything but blinding lights and faceless bodies when cade reached her she was sheet white asking no questions he simply picked her up to the cheering approval of nearby patrons and carried her outside im sorry i got dizzy it was a bad idea he was cursing himself viciously for taking her to a secondrate nightclub with rowdy regulars i shouldnt have brought you here no it was a wonderful idea im glad you brought me i just needed some air for the first time she realized he was carrying her and wavered between embarrassment and gratitude put me down cade im all right ill take you home no is there somewhere we can just sit just sit and get some air sure he set her on her feet but watched her carefully theres a cafe just down the street we can sit outside get some coffee good she held tightly on to his hand letting him lead the way the bass from the band inside the club all but shook the sidewalk the cafe a few doors down was nearly as crowded as the club had been with waiters scurrying to deliver espressos and lattes and iced fruit drinks i came on pretty strong he began as he pulled out a chair for her yes you did im flattered head cocked he sat across from her youre flattered yes i may not remember anything but i dont think im stupid the air however close and warm felt glorious youre an incredibly attractive man and i look around right here steadying herself she did just that scanning the little tables crammed together under a dark green awning beautiful women everywhere all over the city where we walked today inside that club right here in this cafe but you came on to me so im flattered thats not exactly the reaction i was looking for or that i expected but i guess itll do for now he glanced up at the waiter who hustled to their table cappuccino he asked bailey that would be perfect decaf or regular the waiter chirped real coffee cade told him and leaned closer to bailey your colors coming back i feel better a woman came in the ladies room did she hassle you no no touched by his immediate instinct to defend she laid a hand over his i was feeling a little shaky and then she walked in sort of swaggered in it made her lips curve and for a minute i thought i knew her he turned his hand over gripped hers you recognized her no not her precisely though i thought no it was the type i suppose youd say arrogant cocky striking a tall redhead in tight denim with a chip on her shoulder she closed her eyes a moment let out a long breath opened them again mj that was the name on the note in your pocket its there bailey murmured massaging her temples its there somewhere in my head and its important its vital but i cant focus on it but theres a woman and shes part of my life and cade somethings wrong do you think shes in trouble i dont know when i start to get a picturewhen i can almost see herits just this image of utter confidence and ability as if nothing could possibly be wrong but i know there is something wrong and its my fault it has to be my fault he shook his head blame wouldnt help it wasnt the angle they needed to pursue tell me what you see when you start to get that picture just try to relax and tell me short dark red hair sharp features green eyes but maybe those are yours but i think hers are green darker than yours i could almost draw her face if i knew how to draw maybe you do he took a pen and pad out of his pocket give it a try with her up caught between her teeth she tried to capture a sharp triangular face with a sigh she set the pen down as their coffee was served i think we can safely assume im not an artist so well get one he took the pad back smiled at the pathetic sketch even i could do better than this and i scraped by with a c my one dismal semester of art do you think you can describe her the features i can try i dont see it all clearly its like trying to focus a camera thats not working quite right police artists are good at putting things together she slopped coffee over the rim of her cup the police do we have to go to the police unofficial dont worry trust me i do but the word police rang in her head like alarm bells i will weve got something to go on we know mjs a woman a tall redhead with a chip on her shoulder mary jane martha june melissa jo you were with her in the desert she was in the dream sun and sky and rock contentment then fear three of us in the dream but it wont come clear well well see if we can put a likeness together then well have somewhere to start she stared down into her foamy coffee thinking her life was just that a cloud concealing the center you make it sound easy its just steps bailey you take the next step and see where that goes she nodded stared hard into her coffee why did you marry someone you didnt love surprised he leaned back blew out a breath well thats quite a change in topic im sorry i dont know why i asked that its none of my business i dont know under the circumstances it seems a fair enough question he drummed his fingers restlessly on the table you could say i got tired worn down by family pressure but thats a copout nobody held a gun to my head and i was over twentyone it annoyed him to admit that he realized to be honest with bailey was to face the truth without excuses we liked each other well enough or at least we did until we got married a couple of months of marriage fixed that friendship im sorry cade it was easy to see the discomfort on his face his unhappiness with the memory and though she envied him even that unhappiness she hated knowing shed helped put it there theres no need to go into it we were good in bed he went on ignoring her and kept his eyes on hers when she shrank back drew in and away from him right up until the end the sex was good the trouble was toward the end which was a little under two years from the beginning it was all heat and no heart we just didnt give a damn couldnt have cared less he remembered just two bored people stuck in the same house thats what it came down to there wasnt another man or another woman no passionate fights over money careers children dirty dishes we just didnt care and when we stopped caring altogether we got nasty then the lawyers came in and it got nastier then it was done did she love you no he answered immediately then frowned looked hard at nothing and again tried to be honest and the answer was sad and bruising no she didnt any more than i loved her and neither one of us worried about working too hard on that part of it he took money from his wallet dropped it on the table and rose lets go home cade she touched his arm you deserved better yeah he looked at the hand on his arm the delicate fingers the pretty rings so did she but its a little late for that he lifted her hand so that the ring gleamed between them you can forget a lot of things bailey but can you forget love dont hed be damned if hed back off suddenly his entire miserable failure of a marriage was slapped into his face hed be damned if a man put this on your finger a man you loved would you forget could you i dont know she wrenched away rushed down the sidewalk toward his car when he whirled her around her eyes were bright with anger and fears i dont know you wouldnt forget you couldnt if it mattered this matters he crushed his mouth to hers pressing her back against the car and battering them both with his frustration and needs gone was the patience the clever heat of seduction what was left was all the raw demand that had bubbled beneath it and he wanted her weak and clinging and as desperate as he for just that moment for just the now the panic came first a choke hold that snagged the air from her throat she couldnt answer this vivid violent need simply wasnt prepared or equipped to meet it and survive so she surrended abruptly completely thoughtlessly part of her trusting that he wouldnt hurt her another praying that he couldnt she yielded to the flash of staggering heat the stunning power of untethered lust rode high on it for one quivering moment and knew she might not survive even surrender she trembled infuriating him shaming him he was hurting her he almost wanted to for wouldnt she remember if he did wasnt pain easier to remember than kindness he knew if she forgot him it would kill him and if he hurt her he would have killed everything worthwhile inside him he let her go stepped back instantly she hugged her arms over her chest in a defensive move that slashed at him music and voices lifted in excitement and laughter flowed down the sidewalk behind him as he stared at her spotlighted like a deer caught in headlights im sorry cade he lifted his hands palms out his temper rarely flashed but he knew better than to reach for reason until it had settled again im sorry he repeated its my problem ill take you home and when he had when she was in her room and the lights were off he lay out in the ham mock where he could watch her window it wasnt so much examining his own life he realized that had set him off he knew the highs and lows of it the missteps and foolish mistakes it was the rings on her fingers and finally facing mat a man might have put one of them on her a man who might be waiting for her to remember and it wasnt about sex sex was easy she would have given herself to him that evening hed seen it when he walked into the kitchen while she was buried in a book hed known she was thinking of him wanting him now he thought hed been a fool for not taking what was there for him but he hadnt taken it because he wanted more a lot more he wanted love and it wasnt reasonable to want it she was adrift afraid in trouble neither of them could identify yet he wanted her to tumble into love with him as quickly and completely as hed tumbled into love with her it wasnt reasonable but he didnt give a damn about reason hed slay her dragon whatever the cost and once he had hed fight whoever stood in his way to keep her even if it was bailey herself who stood there when he slept he dreamed when he dreamed he dreamed of dragons and black nights and a damsel with golden hair who was locked in a high tower and spun straw into rich blue diamonds and when she slept she dreamed when she dreamed she dreamed of lightning and terror and of running through the dark with the power of gods clutched in her hands chapter despite the fact that shed slept poorly bailey was awake and out of bed by seven she concluded that she had some internal clock that started her day at an assigned time and couldnt decide if that made her boring or responsible in either case she dressed resisted the urge to go down the hall and peek into cades room and went down to make coffee she knew he was angry with her an icy simmering anger that she hadnt a clue how to melt or diffuse he hadnt said a word on the drive back from georgetown and the silence had been charged with temper and she was certain sexual frustration she wondered if she had ever caused sexual frustration in a man before and wished she didnt feel this inner wholly female pleasure at causing it in a man like cade but beyond that his rapid shift of moods left her baffled and upset she wondered if she knew any more about human nature than she did of her own past she wondered if she knew anything at all about the male of the species did men behave in this inexplicable manner all the time and if they did how did a smart woman handle it should she be cool and remote until hed explained himself or would it be better if she was friendly and casual as if nothing had happened as if he hadnt kissed her as if he could swallow her whole as if he hadnt touched her moved his hands over her as though he had a right to as though it were the most natural thing in the world for him to turn her body into a quivering mass of needs now her own mood shifted from timid to annoyed as she wrenched open the refrigerator for milk how the hell was she supposed to know how to behave she had no idea if shed ever been kissed that way before ever felt this way wanted this way just because she was lost was she supposed to meekly go in whichever direction cade parris pointed her and if he pointed her toward the bed was she supposed to hop in oh no she didnt think so she was a grown woman capable of making her own decisions she wasnt stupid and she wasnt helpless shed managed to hire herself a detective hadnt she damn it just because she had no precedents for her own behavior that didnt mean she couldnt start setting some here and now she would not be a doormat she would not be a fool she would not be a victim she slapped the milk carton down on the counter scowled out the window it was cades bad luck that she happened to spot him sleeping in the hammock just as her temper peaked he wouldnt have dozed so peacefully if he could have seen the way her eyes kindled the way her lips peeled back in a snarl fueled for battle bailey slammed out of the house and marched across the lawn she gave the hammock one hard shove who the hell do you think you are what he shot rudely awake gripping the sides of the hammock for balance his brain musty with sleep what dont you remember dont get smart with me she gave the hammock another shove as he struggled to sit up i make my own decisions i run my own lifesuch as it is i hired you to help me find out who i am and what happened to me im not paying you to sulk because i wont hop into bed with you when you have an itch okay he rubbed his eyes finally managed to focus on the stunning and furious face bent over him what the hell are you talking about im not sulking i dont tell me youre not sulking she shot back sleeping out in the backyard like a hobo its my yard it irritated him to have to point it out it irritated him more to be dragged out of sleep into an argument before his mind could engage taking me dancing she continued stalking away and back trying to seduce me on the dance floor then having a snit because a snit that stung listen sweetheart ive never had a snit in my life i say you did and dont call me sweetheart in that tone of voice now you dont like my tone his eyes narrowed dangerously to sharp green slits that threatened retaliation well lets try a brandnew tone and see how you he ended with an oath when she jerked the hammock and flipped him out on his face her first reaction was shock then an immediate urge to apologize but as the air turned blue around her she snapped herself back jerked her chin up in the air and marched off hed hit the ground with a thud and he was sure hed heard his own bones rattle but he was on his feet again quickly enough limping a little but fast enough to snag her before she reached the door he yanked her around to face him what bug got up your you deserved it the blood was roaring in her head her heart was pounding but she wasnt going to back down what the hell for for whatever well that sure covers it just get out of my way im going for a walk no he said precisely youre not you cant tell me what to do he estimated he was close to twice her weight and had a good eight inches in height on her his lips curved grimly yes i can youre hysterical that snapped it i certainly am not hysterical if i were hysterical id scratch that nasty smile off your face and poke those smug eyes out and to simplify matters he simply picked her up and carried her inside she wiggled sputtered kicked a little but he managed to drop her into a kitchen chair putting his hands on her shoulders his face close to hers he gave one pithy order stay if he didnt have coffee immediately he was going to die or kill someone youre fired fine great whoopee he let her fume while he poured coffee and downed it like water god what a way to start the day he grabbed a bottle of aspirin fought with the childproof cap while the headache that was brewing insidiously burst into fullblown misery im not going to tolerate having a woman yell at me before my eyes are open whatevers got you going sweetheart you just hold on to it until i he cursed again slamming the stubborn cap on the edge of the counter where it held firm his head was throbbing his knee wept where it had hit the ground and he could easily have chewed through the plastic to get to the aspirin swearing ripely he grabbed a butcher knife out of the wooden block on the counter and hacked at the bottle until hed decapitated it his face tight with fury he turned with the bottle in one hand the knife in the other his teeth were clenched now you listen he began baileys eyes rolled back in her head and she slid from the chair onto the floor in a dead faint before he could move sweet god the knife clattered on the floor and aspirin rolled everywhere as the mangled bottle hit the tiles he gathered her up and for lack of anything better laid her on the kitchen table while he dampened a cloth come on bailey come around sweetheart he bathed her face chafed her wrists and cursed himself how could he have shouted at her that way manhandled her like that when she was so fragile maybe hed go out and kick some puppies stomp on some kittens for his next act when she moaned and shifted he pressed her limp hand to his lips thats the way all the way back her eyes fluttered open while he stroked her hair its okay bailey take it easy hes going to kill me her eyes were open but blind she clutched at cades shirt as terror strangled her breath hes going to kill me no ones going to hurt you im right here hes going to kill me hes got a knife if he finds me hell kill me he wanted to gather her up soothe it all away but shed trusted him to help he kept his voice very calm uncurled her fingers from his shirt and held them whos got the knife bailey whos going to kill you he he she could see it almost see it the hand hacking down the knife flashing again and again theres blood everywhere blood everywhere i have to get away from the blood the knife the lightning i have to run he held her still kept his voice calm where are you tell me where you are in the dark lights are out hell kill me i have to run run where anywhere her breath was coming so fast the force of it scored her throat like nails anywhere away somewhere away if he finds me hes not going to find you i wont let him find you he cupped her face firmly in his hands so that her eyes met his slow down now just slow down if she kept panting like that she was going to hyperventilate and faint on him again he didnt think he could handle it youre safe here youre safe with me understand that yes yes she closed her eyes shuddered hard yes i need air please i need some air he picked her up again carried her outside he set her on the padded chaise on the patio sat beside her take it slow remember youre safe here youre safe yes all right with an effort she evened out the air that seemed to want to clog and burst in her lungs im all right far from it he thought she was sheet white clammy and shivering but the memory was close and he had to try to dislodge it no ones going to hurt you nothings going to touch you here you hang on to that and try to tell me everything you remember it comes in blips she struggled to breathe past the pressure in her chest when you had the knife fear clawed through her again with razored talons i scared you im sorry he took her hands held them i wouldnt hurt you i know she closed her eyes again let the sun beat hot on the lids there was a knife a long blade curved its beautiful the bone handle is deeply carved ive seen itmaybe ive used it where did you see it i dont know there were voices shouting i cant hear what theyre saying its like the ocean all sound roaring violent sound she pressed her hands to her ears as if she could block it out then theres blood everywhere theres blood all over the floor what kind of floor carpet gray carpet the lightning keeps flashing the knife keeps flashing is there a window do you see lightning through the window yes i think she shivered again and the scene fighting to form in her mind went blank its dark everything went dark and i have to get away i have to hide where do you hide its a little place hardly room and if he sees ill be trapped he has the knife i can see it his hand on the hilt its so close if he turns tell me about the hand cade said interrupting her gently what does the hand look like bailey its dark very dark but theres a light bouncing around it almost catches me hes holding the knife and his knuckles are white theres blood on them on his ring what kind of ring bailey his eyes stayed intent on her face but his voice remained calm and easy what does the ring look like its heavy gold thick band yellow gold the center stones a ruby cabochon on either side there are small diamonds brilliantcut initials t and in a stylized sweep the diamonds are red with blood hes so close so close i can smell it if he looks down if he looks down and sees me hell kill me slice me to pieces if he finds me he didnt unable to bear it any longer cade drew her up held her you got away how did you get away bailey i dont know the relief was so hugecades arms around her the sun warm at her back his cheek pressed to her hairshe could have wept i dont remember its all right thats enough maybe i killed him she drew back looked into cades face maybe i used the gun that was in the bag and shot him the gun was fully loaded bailey i could have replaced it sweetheart in my professional opinion you wouldnt know how but if i and if you did he took her shoulders now gave her a quick shake it was to protect yourself he was armed you were terrified and it sounds as if hed already killed someone whatever you did to survive was right she shifted away looked out over the yard past the flowers the leafy old trees the tidy fence line what kind of person am i theres a very real possibility i saw someone murdered i did nothing to stop it nothing to help be sensible bailey what could you have done something she murmured i didnt get to a phone call the police i just ran and if you hadnt youd be dead he knew by the way she winced that his tone had been harsh but it was what she needed instead youre alive and bit by bit were putting it together he rose paced away so that he wouldnt give in to the temptation just to cuddle her you were in a building of some sort in a room with gray carpet probably a window there was an argument and someone had a knife he used it his initials could be ts he came after you and it was dark more than likely it was a blackout and the building had lost power a section of north west dc lost power for two hours the night before you hired me so weve got somewhere to look you knew the building well enough to head for cover id say you belonged there you live or work there he turned back noting that she was watching him paying close attention her hands were steady in her lap again i can check if there was a knifing reported that night but ive been watching the papers and there hasnt been any press on it but it was days ago now someone must have foundfound a body if there was one not if it was a private home or an office that shut down for the long weekend if thered been someone else there other people in the building when it happened it would have been reported odds are you were alone it made his stomach crawl to think of itbailey alone in the dark with a killer the storm didnt hit until after ten it was logical and the simple movement from theory to fact calmed her what do we do now well drive around the area that lost power starting at the hotel where you ended up i dont remember getting to the hotel whether i walked or took a cab you either walked took a bus or the metro ive already checked on cabs none of the companies dropped off a fare within three blocks of the hotel that night were going to move on the assumption that you were on foot dazed too shaken to think of hopping a bus and since the metro only runs until midnight thats too close to call she nodded looked down at her hands im sorry i shouted at you before you didnt deserve it after everything youve done for me i deserved it he tucked his hands in his pockets i refuse to accept the term snit but ill allow the phrase out of sorts he enjoyed seeing her lips curve in one of her hesitant smiles as she lifted her head i suppose we both were did i hurt you when i knocked you down my egos going to be carrying a bruise for a while otherwise no he angled his head there was a quick cockiness in the movement and in the eyes that glinted at hers and i didnt try to seduce you on the dance floor bailey i did seduce you on the dance floor her pulse stuttered a bit he was so outrageously gorgeous standing there in the bright morning sun rumpled his dark hair thick and untidy the dimples denting his cheeks and his mouth arrogantly curved no woman alive bailey thought could have stopped her mouth from watering and she was certain he knew it your ego seems to function well enough bruised or not we can always stage a reenactment her stomach fluttered at the thought but she worked up a smile im glad youre not angry with me anymore i dont think i handle confrontations very well he rubbed his elbow where hed lost several layers of skin on impact you seemed to do well enough im going to clean up then well take ourselves a sunday drive there were so many kinds of buildings bailey thought as cade tooled around the city old ones new ones crumbling row houses and refurbished homes tall office buildings and squat storefronts had she ever really noticed the city before she wondered the sloping stone walls the trees rising up from the sidewalks belching buses with whining air brakes was it always so humid in july was the summer sky always the color of paper and were the flowers always so luscious in the public spaces tucked around statues and along the streets had she shopped in any of these stores eaten in any of these restaurants the trees took over again tall and stately lining both sides of the road so that it seemed they were driving through a park rather than the middle of a crowded city its like seeing everything for the first time she murmured im sorry doesnt matter something will either click or it wont they passed gracious old homes brick and granite then another strip of shops smart and trendy she made a small sound and though she was hardly aware of it herself cade slowed something click that boutique marguerites i dont know lets take a look he circled around backtracked then pulled into a narrow lot that fronted several upscale shops everythings closed but that doesnt mean we cant window shop leaning over he opened her door then climbed out his own maybe i just liked the dress in the window she murmured it was very lovely just a sweep of rosepetal silk with thin straps of glittery rhinestones that continued down to cross under the bodice the display was completed by a tiny silver evening bag and impossibly high heels in matching silver the way it made her smile cade wished the shop was open so that he could buy it for her its your style i dont know she cupped her hands to the glass peered through them for the simple delight of looking at pretty things thats a wonderful cocktail suit in navy linen oh and that red dress is just fabulous bound to make you feel powerful and accomplished i really should start wearing bolder colors but i always wimp out with pastels try this green bailey its got punch theres nothing more tiring than a clothes coward how long do i have to stand around while you two play with clothes im starving oh stop bitching youre not happy unless youre feeding your face or buying new jeans bailey not that tedious beige the green trust me she talked me into it bailey murmured i bought the green suit she was right she always is whos right bailey he didnt touch her afraid that even an encouraging hand on her shoulder would jar her is it mj no no not mj shes annoyed impatient hates to waste time shoppings such a waste of time oh her head hurt it was going to explode any moment simply burst off her shoulders but the need was greater the need to latch on to this one thing this one answer her stomach rolled threatened to heave and her skin went clammy with the effort of holding off nausea grace her voice broke on the name grace she said again as her knees buckled her names grace grace and mj tears sprang to her eyes rolled down her cheeks as she threw her arms around cades neck ive been here ive been to this shop i bought a green suit i remember good good job bailey he gave her a quick swing no but thats all she pressed a hand to her forehead the pain was screaming now thats all i remember just being in there with them buying a suit its so foolish why should i remember buying a suit you remember the people he smoothed his thumbs over her temples he could all but feel the headache raging inside theyre important to you it was a moment something shared a happy time but i cant remember them not really just feelings youre breaking through he pressed his lips to her brow drew her back toward the car and its happening quickly now he eased her down on the seat hooked her safety belt himself and it hurts you it doesnt matter i need to know it matters to me well get you something for that headache and some food then well start again arguments wouldnt sway him bailey had to admit that fighting cade and a blinding headache was a battle she was doomed to lose she let him prop her up in bed dutifully swallowed the aspirin he gave her obediently she closed her eyes as he instructed then opened them again when he brought up a bowl of chicken soup its out of a can he told her fussing with the pillows behind her back but it should do the job i could eat in the kitchen cade it was a headache not a tumor and its almost gone im going to work you hard later take the pampering while you can get it all right i will she spooned up soup its wonderful you added thyme for that little hint of france her smile faded paris she murmured something about paris the headache snuck back as she tried to concentrate let it go for now he sat beside her id say your subconscious is letting you know youre not all the way ready yet to remember a piece at a time will do i suppose itll have to she smiled again want some soup now that you mention it he leaned forward let her feed him and didnt take his eyes from hers not too shabby she took another spoonful herself tasted him marvelous as handy as you are in the kitchen im surprised your wife let you get away exwife and we had a cook oh she fed him again slowly taking turns ive been trying to figure out how to ask without seeming rude he slipped her hair behind her ear just ask well this lovely house the antiques the fancy sports car then theres your office his mouth twitched something wrong with my office no well nothing a bulldozer and a construction crew couldnt cure it just doesnt compute with the rest ive got a thing about my business paying for itself and that office is about all it can afford so far my investigative work pays the bills and just a little more on a personal level im rolling in it his eyes laughed into hers money that is if thats what youre asking i guess it was youre rich then depends on your definition or if you mean me personally or the entire family its shopping centers real estate that sort of thing a lot of doctors and lawyers and bankers down through the ages and me im the black sheep she finished for him thrilled that he was just that you didnt want to go into the family business you didnt want to be a doctor or a lawyer or a banker nope i wanted to be sam spade delighted she chuckled the maltese falcon im glad you didnt want to be a banker me too he took the hand shed laid on his cheek pressed his lips to it and felt her quiver of response im glad i found your name in the phone book her voice thickened im glad i found you so am i he took the tray from between them set it aside even if hed been blind he thought he would have understood what was in her eyes just then and his heart thrilled to it i could walk out of here and leave you alone now he trailed a finger across her collarbone then let it rest on the pulse that beat rabbitquick at her throat thats not what i want to do it was her decision she knew her choice her moment thats not what i want either when he cupped her face in his hands she closed her eyes cade i may have done something horrible his lips paused an inch from hers i dont care i may havei may be determined to face it she opened her eyes again there may be someone else his fingers tightened i dont give a damn she let out a long breath and took her moment neither do i she said and pulled him to her chapter this was what it felt like to be pressed under a mans body a mans hard needy body a man who wanted you above all else for that moment it was breathless and stunning exciting and fresh the way he combed his fingers through her hair as his lips covered hers thrilled her the fit of mouth against mouth as if the only thing lips and tongues were made for were to taste a lover and it was the taste of him that filled herstrong and male and real whatever had come before whatever came after this mattered now she stroked her hands over him and it was glorious the shape of his body the breadth of shoulders the length of back the narrowing of waist the muscles beneath so firm so tight and when her hands skimmed under his shirt the smooth warm flesh beneath fascinated oh ive wanted to touch you her lips raced over his face i was afraid i never would ive wanted you from the first moment you walked in the door he drew back only enough to see her eyes the deep melting brown of them before you walked in the door forever it doesnt make any sense we dont it doesnt matter only this his lips closed over hers again took the kiss deeper tangling their flavors together he wanted to go slowly draw out every moment it seemed hed waited for her all his life so now he could take all the time in the world to touch to taste to explore and exploit each shift of her body beneath his was a gift each sigh a treasure to have her like this with the sun streaming through the window with her hair flowing gold over the old quilt and her body both yielding and eager was sweeter than any dream they belonged it was all he had to know to see her to unfasten the simple shirt hed picked for her to open it inch by inch to pale smooth flesh was everything he wanted he skimmed his fingertips over the curve of her breast felt her skin quiver in response watched her eyes flicker dark then focus on his youre perfect he cupped her and she was small and firm and made for his palm he bent his head rubbed his lips where the lace of her bra met flesh then moved them up lazily up her throat over her jaw and back to nip at her mouth no one had kissed her like this before she knew it was impossible for anyone else to have taken such care with a soft sigh she poured herself into the kiss murmuring when he shifted her to slip the shirt away trembling when he slid the lace aside and bared her breasts to his hands and his mouth she moaned lost gloriously lost in a dark maze of sensations soft here then rough cool then searing each feeling bumped gently into the next then merged into simple pleasure whichever way she turned there was something new and thrilling when she tugged his shirt away there was the lovely slippery slide of his flesh against hers the intimacy of it heart to heart and her heart danced to the play of his lips the teasing nip of teeth the slow torture of tongue the air was like syrup thick and sweet as he slid her slacks over her hips she struggled to gulp it in but each breath was shallow and short he was touching her everywhere his hands slick and slow but relentlessly pushing her higher and stronger until the heat was immense it kindled inside her like a brush fire she moaned out his name clutching the quilt and dragging it into tangles as her body strained to reach for something just beyond her grasp as she arched desperately against him he watched her slid up her body again until his lips were close to hers and watched her watched her as with quick clever fingers he tore her free it was his name she called when the heat reached flash point and his body she clung to as her own shuddered that was what hed wanted his name was still vibrating on her lips when he crushed them with his when he rolled with her over the bed in a greedy quest to take and possess blind with need he tugged at his jeans trembling himself when she buried her mouth against his throat strained against him in quivering invitation she was more generous than any fantasy more generous than any wish more his than any dream with sunlight pouring over the tangled sheets she arched to him opened as if shed been waiting all her life for him his heart pounded in his head as he slipped inside her moved to fill her shock froze him for a dazed instant and every muscle tensed but she shook her head wrapped herself around him and took him in you was all she said only you he lay still listening to her heart thudding absorbing the quakes of her body with his only him he thought and closed his eyes shed been innocent untouched a miracle and his heart was tugged in opposing directions of guilt and pure selfish pleasure shed been innocent and hed taken her shed been untouched until he touched he wanted to beg her to forgive him he wanted to climb out on the roof and crow not certain either would suit the situation he gently tested the waters bailey hmm ah in my professional opinion as a licensed investigator i conclude its extremely unlikely youre married he felt the rumble of her laughter and lifted his head to grin down at her ill put it in my report you do that he brushed the hair from her cheek did i hurt you im sorry i never considered no she pressed her hand over his you didnt hurt me im happy giddy relieved her lips curved on a sigh i never considered either id say we were both surprised abruptly her stomach fluttered with nerves youre not disappointed if you im devastated i really hoped youd be married with six kids i really only enjoy making love with married women no i meant was itwas iwas everything all right bailey on a half laugh he rolled over so that she could settle on his chest youre perfect absolutely completely perfect i love you she went very still and her cheek stayed pressed to his heart you know i do he said quietly from the moment i saw you now she wanted to weep because it was everything she wanted to hear and nothing she could accept you dont know me neither do you she lifted her head shook it fiercely thats exactly the point joking about it doesnt change the truth heres the truth then he sat up took her firmly by the shoulders im in love with you in love with the woman im holding right now youre exactly what i want what i need and sweetheart he kissed her lightly im keeping you you know its not that simple im not asking for simple he slid his hands down gripped hers im asking you to marry me thats impossible panicked she tugged on her hands but he gripped them calmly and held her in place you know thats impossible i dont know where i come from what ive done i met you three days ago that all makes sense or would except for one thing he drew her against him and shot reason to hell with a kiss dont do this torn to pieces she wrapped her arms around his neck held tight dont do this cade whatever my life was right now its a mess i need to find the answers well find the answers i promise you that but theres one i want from you now he drew her head back hed expected the tears knew theyd be shimmering in her eyes and turning them deep gold tell me you love me bailey or tell me you dont i cant just one question he murmured you dont need a yesterday to answer it no she needed nothing but her own heart i cant tell you i dont love you because i cant lie to you she shook her head pressed her fingers to his lips before he could speak i wont tell you i do because it wouldnt be fair its an answer that has to wait until i know all the others until i know who the woman is wholl tell you give me time hed give her time he thought when her head was nestled on his shoulder again because nothing and no one was taking her from him whatever they found on the other side of her past cade liked to say that getting to a solution was just a matter of taking steps bailey wondered how many more there were left to climb she felt shed rushed up a very long staircase that day and when reaching the landing been just as lost as ever not entirely true she told herself as she settled down at the kitchen table with a notepad and pencil even the urge to make a list of what she knew indicated that she was an organized person and one who liked to review things in black and white who is bailey a woman who habitually rose at the same hour daily did that make her tedious and predictable or responsible she liked coffee black and strong scrambled eggs and her steaks medium rare fairly ordinary tastes her body was trim not particularly muscular and without tan lines so she wasnt a fitness fanatic or a sunworshiper perhaps she had a job that kept her indoors which meant she thought with some humor she wasnt a lumberjack or a lifeguard she was a righthanded browneyed blonde and was reasonably sure her hair color was natural or close to what shed been born with she knew a great deal about gemstones which could mean they were a hobby a career or just something she liked to wear she had possession of a diamond worth a fortune that shed either stolen boughthighly unlikely she thoughtor gained through an accident of some sort shed witnessed a violent attack possibly a murder and run away because that fact made her temple start to throb again she skipped over it she hummed classical music in the shower and liked to watch classic film noir on television and she couldnt figure out what that said about her personality or her background she liked attractive clothes good materials and shied away from strong colors unless pushed it worried her that she might be vain and frivolous but she had at least two female friends who shared part of her life grace and mj mj and grace bailey wrote the names on the pad over and over hoping that the simple repetition would strike a fresh spark they mattered to her she could feel that she was frightened for them and didnt know why her mind might be blank but her heart told her that they were special to her closer to her than anyone else in the world but she was afraid to trust her heart there was something else she knew that bailey didnt want to write down didnt want to review in black and white shed had no lover thered been no one she cared for enough or who cared for her enough for intimacy perhaps in the life she led shed been too judgmental too intolerant too selfabsorbed to accept a man into her bed or perhaps shed been too ordinary too boring too undesirable for a man to accept her into his in any case she had a lover now why hadnt the act of lovemaking seemed foreign to her or frightening as it seemed it would to the uninitiated instead with cade it had been as natural as breathing natural exciting and perfect he said he loved her but how could she believe it he knew only one small piece of her a fraction of the whole when her memory surfaced he might find her to be the very type of woman he disliked no she wouldnt hold him to what hed said to this bailey until she knew the whole woman and her feelings with a half laugh she set the pencil aside shed been drawn to him instantly trusted him completely the moment he took her hand and fallen in love with him while she watched him stand in this kitchen breaking brown eggs into a white bowl but her heart couldnt be trusted in this case either the closer they came to finding the truth the closer they came to the time when they might turn from each other and walk away however much she wished it they couldnt leave the canvas bag and its contents in his safe forget they existed and just be you forgot some things she jolted turned her head quickly and looked into his face how long she wondered had he been standing behind her reading her notes over her shoulder while she was thinking of him i thought it might help me to write down what i know always a good plan he walked to the fridge took out a beer poured her a glass of iced tea she sat feeling foolish and awkward her hands clutched in her lap had they really rolled naked on a sunwashed bed an hour before how was such intimacy handled in a tidy kitchen over cold drinks and puzzles he didnt seem to have a problem with it cade sat across from her propped his feet on an empty chair and scooted her pad over youre a worrier i am sure he flipped a page started a new list youre worrying right now what should you say to this guy now that youre lovers now that you know hes wildly in love with you wants to spend the rest of his life with you cade just stating the facts and if he stated them often enough he figured shed eventually accept them the sex was great and it was easy so you worry about that too why did you let this man youve known for a weekend take you to bed when youve never let another man get that close his eyes flicked up held hers the answers elementary youre just as wildly in love with me but youre afraid to face it she picked up her glass cooled her throat im a coward no bailey youre not a coward but youre constantly worried that you are youre a champion worrier and a woman i think who gives herself very little credit for her strengths and has very little tolerance for her weaknesses selfjudgmental he wrote that down as well while she frowned at the words on the page it seems to me someone in my situation has to try to judge herself practical logical he continued the column now leave the judging to me a moment youre compassionate responsible organized and a creature of habit id say you hold some sort of position that requires those traits as well as a good intellect your work habits are disciplined and precise you also have a fine aesthetic sense how can you be so sure bailey forgetting who you are doesnt change who you are thats your big flaw in reasoning here if you hated brussels sprouts before its likely youre still going to hate them if you were allergic to cats youre still going to sneeze if you pet a kitten and if you had a strong moral and caring heart its still beating inside you now let me finish up here she twisted her head struggling to read upside down what are you putting down youre a lousy drinker probably a metabolism thing and i think at this point we could have some wine later so i can take full advantage of that he grinned over at her and you blush its a sweet oldfashioned physical reaction youre tidy you hang up your towels after you shower you rinse off your dishes you make your bed every morning there were other details he thought she wiggled her foot when she was nervous her eyes went gold when she was aroused her voice turned chilly when she was annoyed youve had a good education probably up north from your speech pattern and accent id say you concentrated on your studies like a good girl and didnt date much otherwise you wouldnt have been a virgin up to a couple hours ago there you blushed again i really love when you do that i dont see the point in this theres that cool polite tone indulge me he added then sipped his beer youve got a slim body smooth skin you either take care of both or you were lucky genetically by the way i like your unicorn she cleared her throat thank you no thank you he said and chuckled anyway you have or make enough money to afford good clothes those classic italian pumps you were wearing go for about two hundred and fifty at departmentstore prices and you had silk underwear id say the silk undies and the unicorn follow the same pattern you like to be a little daring under the traditional front she was just managing to close her gaping mouth you went through my clothes my underwear what there was of them and all in the name of investigation great underwear he told her very sexy simple and pricey id say peach silk ought to look terrific on you she made a strangled sound fell back on silence there was really nothing to say i dont know the annual income of your average gemologist or jewelry designerbut ill lay odds youre one or the other im leaning toward the scientist as vocation and the designer as avocation thats a big leap cade no its not just another step the pieces are there wouldnt you think a diamond like the one in the safe would require the services of a gemologist its authenticity would have to be verified its value assessed just the way you verified and assessed it yesterday her hands trembled so she put them back in her lap if thats true then it ups the likelihood that i stole it no it doesnt impatient with her he tapped the pencil sharply against the pad look at the other facts why cant you see yourself you wouldnt steal a stick of gum doesnt the fact that youre riddled with guilt over the very thought you might have done something illegal give you a clue the fact is cade i have the stone yeah and hasnt it occurred to you in that logical responsible ordered mind of yours that you might have been protecting it protecting it from from whoever killed to get their hands on it from whoever would have killed you if he had found you thats what plays bailey thats what fits and if there are three stones then you might very well know where the others are as well you may be protecting all of them how he had some ideas on that as well but didnt think she was ready to hear them well work on that meanwhile ive made a few calls weve got a busy day ahead of us tomorrow the police artist will come over in the morning see if she can help you put images together and i managed to snag one of the undercurators or whatever theyre called at the smithsonian we have a oneoclock appointment tomorrow you got an appointment on a holiday thats where the parris name and fortune come in handy hint at funding and it opens a lot of musty old doors and well see if that boutique opens for the holiday sale hunters and find out if anyone remembers selling a green suit it doesnt seem like were doing enough sweetheart weve come a long way in a short time youre right she rose walked to the window there was a wood thrush in the maple tree singing its heart out i cant begin to tell you how grateful i am ill bill you for the professional services he said shortly and i dont want gratitude for the rest of it i have to give it whether or not you take it you made this bearable more than that i dont know how many times you made me smile or laugh or just forget it all for little spaces of time i think id have gone crazy without you cade im going to be there for you bailey youre not going to be able to shake me loose youre used to getting what you want she murmured i wonder if i am it doesnt feel as if thats true thats something you can change he was right that was a matter of patience perseverance control and perhaps wanting the right things she wanted him wanted to think that one day she could stand here listening to the wood thrush sing of summer while cade drowsed in the hammock it could be their house instead of his their life their family if it was the right thing and she could persevere im going to make you a promise she followed the impulse and turned letting her heart be reckless he was so much what she needed sitting there with his jeans torn at the knee his hair too long his feet bare if when this is over when all the steps have been taken all the pieces are in place to make the whole if i can and you still want me ill marry you his heart stuttered in his chest emotion rose up to fill his throat very carefully he set the bottle aside rose tell me you love me it was there in her heart begging to be said but she shook her head when its all over and you know everything if you still want me thats not the kind of promise that suits me no qualifications bailey no whens no ifs just you its all i can give you its all i have we can go into maryland on tuesday get a license be married in a matter of days he could see it the two of them giddy in love rousing some sleepyeyed country jp out of bed in the middle of the night holding hands in the living room while an old yellow dog slept on a braid rug the jps wife played the piano and he and the woman he loved exchanged vows and sliding the ring onto her finger feeling her slide one on his was the link that would bind them there are no blood tests in maryland he continued just a couple of forms and there you are he meant it it staggered her to see in those deep green eyes that he meant nothing less than he said he would take her exactly as she was he would love her just as she stood how could she let him and what name would i put on the form it doesnt matter youll have mine he gripped her arms drew her against him in all his life there had been no one he needed as much take mine just take she thought when his lips covered hers take what was offeredthe love the safety the promise let the past come as it would let the future drift and seize the moment you know it wouldnt be right she pressed her cheek to his you need to know as much as i do maybe he did however much the fantasy of a reckless elopement appealed creating a fake identity for bailey it wasnt the answer either one of them needed could be fun he struggled to lighten the mood like practice for the real thing he pulled her back to arms length studied her face delicate troubled lovely you want orange blossoms bailey a white dress and organ music because her heart sighed at the image she managed to smile i think i might i seem to be a traditional soul then i should buy you a traditional diamond cade just speculating he murmured and lifted her left hand no however traditional your soul your taste in jewelry is unique well find something that suits but i should probably take you to meet the family his eyes lifted to hers and he laughed god help you just a game she thought just pretend she smiled back at him id love to meet your family see camilla do pirouettes in her tutu if you can get through that and still want to marry me ill know youre hopelessly in love with me theyll put you through the gauntlet sweetheart a very sophisticated silkedged gauntlet where did you go to school what does your father do does your mother play bridge or tennis and by the way what clubs do you belong to and did i run into you on the slopes last season at st moritz instead of making her unhappy it made her laugh then id better find out the answers i like making them up i took a cop to muffys tenthanniversary bash couldnt get out of it we told everyone she was the niece of the italian prime minister educated in a swiss boarding school and interested in acquiring a piedaterre in dc her brows drew together oh really they all but drooled on her not nearly the reaction wed have gotten with the truth which was she was a uniformed cop who grew up in new yorks little italy and transferred to washington after her divorce from a guy who ran a pasta place off broadway was she pretty sure his grin flashed gorgeous then there was the lounge singer in chevy chase who i dont think i want to know she turned away picked up her empty glass and made a business out of rinsing it out youve dated a lot of women i suppose that depends on your definition of a lot i could probably run a list of names ages physical descriptions and last known addresses want to type it up for me no delighted he nuzzled the back of her neck ive only asked one woman to marry me two she corrected and set the now sparkling glass on the counter with a snap one i didnt ask carla that just sort of evolved and now shes happily marriedas far as i can tellto a corporate lawyer and the proud mama of a bouncing baby girl named eugenia so it hardly counts anyway she bit her up you didnt want children yes i did i do he turned her around kissed her gently but were not naming any kid of ours eugenia now what do you say we think about going out for dinner someplace quiet where we can neck at the table then we can watch the fireworks its too early for dinner thats why i said we should think about it he scooped her up first we have to go upstairs and make love again her pulse gave a pleasant little jump as she curled her arms around his neck we have to itll pass the time unless youd rather play gin rummy chuckling she traced a line of kisses up his neck well if those are my only choices tell you what we can play strip gin rummy we can both cheat and that wayhell he was halfway up the stairs with her and nicely aroused when the doorbell sounded hold that thought okay he set her down and went to answer one peek through the side panel of wavy glass framing the door had him groaning perfect timing as always with a hand on the knob he turned looked at bailey sweetheart the woman on the other side of this door is my mother i realize you expressed a mild interest in meeting my family but im giving you this chance because i love you i really do so im advising you to run hide and dont look back nerves fluttered but she straightened her shoulders stop being silly and open the door okay but i warned you bracing himself he pulled the door open and fixed a bright welcoming smile on his face mother as was expected he kissed her smooth polished cheek what a nice surprise i wouldnt have to surprise you if youd ever return my calls leona parris stepped into the foyer she was bailey realized with a stunned first glance a striking woman surely with three grown children and several grandchildren she had to be at least fifty she could have passed for a sleek thirtyfive her hair was a lush sable brown with hints of golden highlights and fashioned in a perfect and elegant french twist that complemented a face of ivory and cream with cool green eyes straight nose and sulky mouth she wore an elegant tailored bronzetoned suit that nipped at her narrow waist the topaz stones at her ears were squarecut and big as a womans thumb and earned baileys instant admiration ive been busy cade began a couple of cases and some personal business i certainly dont want to hear about your cases as you call them leona set her leather bag on the foyer table and whatever your personal business is its no excuse for neglecting your family duties you put me in a very awkward position with pamela i had to make your pathetic excuses you wouldnt have had to make excuses if you hadnt set it up in the first place he could feel the old arguments bubbling inside him and he struggled not to fall into the familiar toopredictable traps im sorry it put you in an awkward position do you want some coffee what i want cade is an explanation at muffys garden party yesterdaywhich you also failed to attendronald told me some wild tale about you being engaged to some woman ive never heard of with a connection to the princess of wales bailey because hed all but forgotten her cade turned offered an apologetic smile and held out a hand bailey come meet my mother oh good god was all that came into baileys head as she descended the stairs leona parris meet bailey my fiancee mrs parris baileys voice trembled a bit as she offered a hand how wonderful to meet you cade has told me so much about you really attractive certainly leona mused wellgroomed if a bit understated hes told me virtually nothing about you im afraid i dont believe i caught your full name baileys only been in the states for a few months cade barreled in all cheer and delight ive been keeping her to myself he slipped an arm around baileys shoulders squeezed possessively weve had a whirlwind courtship havent we sweetheart yes bailey said faintly a whirlwind you could say that and youre a jewelry designer lovely rings leona noted unique and attractive a distant cousin of the princess of wales bailey doesnt like to drop names cade said quickly sweetheart maybe you ought to make those calls remember the time difference in london where did you meet leona demanded bailey opened her mouth struggling to remember if theyd spun this part of the lie for ronald actually at the smithsonian cade said smoothly in front of the hope diamond i was researching a case and bailey was sketching designs she looked so intent and artistic it took me twenty minutes of fast talking and following her aroundremember how you threatened to call the security guard sweetheart but i finally charmed her into having a cup of coffee with me and speaking of coffee this is just ridiculous bailey said interrupting him absolutely ridiculous cade this is your mother and im just not having it she turned faced leona directly we did not meet in the smithsonian and the princess of wales is not my cousin at least i seriously doubt it i met cade on friday morning when i went to his office to hire him i needed a private investigator because i have amnesia a blue diamond and over a million dollars in cash leona waited ten humming seconds while her foot tapped then her lips firmed well i can see neither of you intends to tell the simple truth as you prefer to make up outrageous fabrications i can only presume that youre perfectly suited to one another she snatched up her bag and marched to the door with outraged dignity in every step cade ill wait to hear from you when you decide to grant me the courtesy of the simple truth while bailey simply stared cade grinned like a fool at the door his mother had closed with a snap i dont understand i did tell her the truth and now i know what they mean bythe truth shall set you free he let out a whooping laugh swung her back up into his arms shes so ticked off now shell leave me alone for a week maybe two he gave bailey an enthusiastic kiss as he headed for the stairs im crazy about you who would have thought telling her the real story would have gotten her off my back still laughing he carried her into the bedroom and dropped her on the mattress weve got to celebrate ive got some champagne chilled im going to get you drunk again pushing her hair out of her face she sat up cade shes your mother this is shameful no its survival he leaned over gave her a smacking kiss this time and sweetheart were both black sheep now i cant tell you how much more fun thats going to be for me i dont think i want to be a black sheep she called as he headed out again too late his laughter echoed back to her chapter they did make it out to dinner but they settled for grilled burgers and potatoes fried in peanut oil at a country fair in rural maryland hed thought about a romantic little restaurant then a fight through the teeming crowds downtown for the huge fireworks display then inspiration had struck ferris wheels and shooting galleries live music whirling lights the flash of fireflies in a nearby field with fireworks to top it off it was he thought the perfect first date when he told her just that while she clung to him with screams locked in her throat on the whizzing car of the tiltawhirl she laughed shut her eyes tight and hung on for her life he wanted to ride everything and he pulled her along from line to line as eager as any of the children tugging on an indulgent parents hand she was spun shaken twirled and zoomed until her head revolved and her stomach flopped then he tilted her face upward for inspection declared that since she wasnt turning green yet they could do it all again so they did now you need a prize he decided as she staggered off the octopus no more cotton candy im begging you i was thinking more of an elephant he hooked an arm around her waist and headed toward the shooting gallery that big purple one up there it was three feet tall with a turnedup trunk and toenails painted a bright pink an elephant the thought of elephants made her smile bloom brilliantly oh its wonderful she grinned fluttered her lashes at cade i want it then its my job to get it for you just stand back little lady he plunked down bills chose his weapon cheeryfaced rabbits and ducks rolled by with the occasional wolf or bear rearing up at odd moments to threaten cade sighted the air gun and fired bailey grinned then applauded then gaped as wildlife died in droves you didnt miss once she goggled at him not once her wideeyed admiration made him feel like a teenager showing off for the prom queen she wants the elephant he told the attendant then laughed when she launched herself into his arms thank you youre wonderful youre amazing since each statement was punctuated by eager kisses he thought she might like the floppyeared brown dog as well want another man youre killing me here the attendant muttered then sighed as cade pulled out more bills want to give it a try cade offered the rifle to bailey maybe she bit her lip and studied her prey it had looked simple enough when cade did it all right just sight through the little v at the end of the barrel he began stepping behind her to adjust her stance i see it she held her breath and pulled the trigger the little pop had her jolting but the ducks swam on and the rabbits continued to hop did i miss only by a mile or so and he was dead certain the woman had never held a gun in her life try again she tried again and again by the time shed managed to nip a few feathers and ruffle some fur cade had put twenty dollars back in the attendants grateful hands it looked so easy when you did it thats okay sweetheart you were getting the hang of it whatd she win the attendant perused his lowest row of prizes generally reserved for children under twelve and came up with a small plastic duck ill take it delighted she tucked it in the pocket of her slacks my first trophy with hands linked they strolled the midway listening to the screams the distant music of a bluegrass band the windy whirl of rides she loved the lights the carnival colors bright as jewels in the balmy night and the smells of frying oil of spun sugar and spiced sauces it seemed so easy as if there couldnt be any trouble in the worldonly lights and music and laughter i dont know if ive ever been to a country carnival before she told him but if i have this one is the best i still owe you a candlelight dinner she turned her head to smile at him ill settle for another ride on the ferris wheel sure youre up to it i want to go around again with you she stood in line flirted with a toddler who kept his head on his fathers shoulder and peeked at her with huge blue eyes she wondered if she was good with children if shed ever had a chance to be and laying her head on cades shoulder dreamed a little if this was just a normal night in normal lives they could be here together like this his hand would be in hers just like this and they wouldnt have a care in the world shed be afraid of nothing her life would be as full and rich and bright as a carnival what was wrong with pretending it was and could be for just one night she climbed into the rocking car beside him snuggled close and rose into the sky beneath people swarmed across the grass teenagers strutted older couples strolled children raced the scents rose up on the wind an evocative mix she could have breathed in forever the downward rush was fast and exciting making her hair fly out and her stomach race to catch up tilting her head upward she closed her eyes and prepared for the upward swing of course he kissed her shed wanted that too that sweet innocent meeting of lips as they circled over the high summer grass with the lights around them a rainbow gleam they circled again as the first fireworks spewed gold across a black sky its beautiful she settled her head on his shoulder like jewels tossed in the sea emeralds rubies sapphires the colors shot upward fountained and faded on a booming crash below people applauded and whistled filled the air with noise somewhere a baby wailed hes frightened she murmured it sounds like gunshots or thunder my father used to have an english setter whod hide under his bed every fourth cade toyed with her fingers as he watched the show trembled for hours once the fireworks got going its so loud scary if you dont know what it is a brilliant flash of gold and sparkling diamonds erupted as they topped the wheel in a rush her heart began to race her head to throb it was the noise that was all the noise and the sickening way the car rocked as the ferris wheel jerked to a halt to unload passengers bailey he drew her closer watching her face she was trembling now her cheeks white her eyes dark im all right just a little queasy well be off soon just a couple more cars im all right but the lights flashed again shattering the sky and the image rolled into her head like thunder he threw up his hands she managed a whisper she couldnt see the lights now the colored diamonds scattered across the sky the memory blinded her to everything else threw them up to try to grab the knife i couldnt scream i couldnt scream i couldnt move there was only the desk light just that one beam of light theyre like shadows and theyre screaming but i cant then the lightning flashed its so bright just that one instant so bright the rooms alight with it and he oh god his throat he slashed his throat she turned her face into cades shoulder i dont want to see that i cant bear to see that let it go just hold on to me and let it go were getting off now he lifted her out of the car all but carried her across the grass she was shuddering as if the air had turned icy and he could hear sobs choking her it cant hurt you now bailey youre not alone now he wound his way through the field where cars were parked swore each time a boom of gunpowder made her jerk she curled up in the seat rocking herself for comfort while he skirted the hood and got quickly behind the wheel cry it out he told her and turned the key scream if you want to just dont let it eat at you like this because he didnt make her feel ashamed she wept a little then rested her throbbing head against the seat as he drove down the winding road and back toward the city i keep seeing jewels she said at length her voice was raw but steady beautiful gemstones floods of them lapis and opals malachite and topaz all different shapes cut and uncut i can pick out each one i know what they are how they feel in my hand theres a long piece of chalcedony smooth to the touch and swordshaped it sits on a desk like a paperweight and this lovely rutilated quartz with silvery threads running through it like shooting stars i can see them theyre so familiar they make you happy comfortable yes i think they do when i think of them when they drift back into my head its pleasant soothing theres an elephant not this one she hugged the plush toy against her for comfort soapstone carved with a jeweled blanket over its back and bright blue eyes hes so regal and foolish she paused a moment tried to think past the headache pounding in her temples there are other stones all manner of others but they dont belong to me still they soothe it doesnt frighten me at all to think of them even the blue diamond its such a beautiful thing such a miracle of nature its amazing really that just the right elements the right minerals the right pressure and the right amount of time can join together to create something so special theyre arguing about them about it she continued squeezing her eyes shut to try to bring it back i can hear them and im angry and feeling righteous i can almost see myself marching toward that room where theyre arguing and im furious and satisfied its such an odd combination of feelings and im afraid a little ive done something i dont know she strained toward it fisting her hands something rash or impulsive or even foolish i go to the door its open and their voices echo outside i go to the door and im trembling inside its not all fear i dont think its just fear some of its temper i close my hand over the stone its in my pocket and i feel better with my hand on it the canvas bags there on the table by the door its open too and i can see the money inside i pick it up while they shout at each other the lights as they slipped from suburb to city made her eyes water she closed them again they dont know im there theyre so intent on each other they dont notice me then i see the knife in his hand the curved blade gleaming and the other one throws up his hands to grab it they struggle over it and theyre out of the light now struggling but i see blood and one of the shadows staggers the other moves in he doesnt stop just doesnt stop im frozen there clutching the bag watching the lights go off all at once and its totally dark then the lightning flashes fills the sky its suddenly so bright when he slices the knife again over his throat he sees me he sees me and i run okay try to relax the traffic was murder choked and impatient he couldnt take her hand draw her close comfort her dont push it now bailey well deal with this at home cade theyre the same person she murmured and let out a sound somewhere between a moan and a laugh theyre the same he cursed the clogged streets hunted for an opening and shot around a station wagon with inches to spare the same as what each other theyre the same person but that cant be i know that cant be because ones dead and one isnt im afraid im going crazy symbols again he wondered or truth how are they the same they have the same face she carried the stuffed elephant into the house clutching it to her as if it were a lifeline to reality her mind felt musty caught between dreams with a sly headache hovering at the corners waiting to pounce i want you to lie down ill make you some tea no ill make it ill feel better if im doing something anything im sorry it was such a wonderful evening in the kitchen she set the smiling elephant on the table until it was a wonderful evening and whatever helps jiggle more pieces in place is worth it it hurts you he took her shoulders and im sorry but you have to get through the rest of it to get where we want to be i know she lifted a hand to his squeezed briefly then turned to put the kettle on the stove im not going to fall apart cade but im afraid i may not be stable pressing her fingers to her eyes she laughed funny statement coming from someone who cant remember her own name youre remembering more all the time bailey and youre the most stable woman ive ever met then im worried about you too and your choice of women she set cups precisely on their saucers concentrating on the simple task tea bags spoons sugar bowl in the maple tree the wood thrush had given over to a whippoorwill and the song was like liquid silver she thought of honeysuckle burying a chainlink fence perfuming the evening air while the night bird called for his mate and a young girl weeping under a willow tree she shook herself a childhood memory perhaps bittersweet she thought those vignettes of the past would be coming more quickly now and she was afraid you have questions she set the tea on the table steadied herself and looked at him youre not asking them because youre afraid ill crumble but i wont i wish youd ask them cade its easier when you do lets sit down he pulled out a chair for her took his time stirring sugar into his tea the room has gray carpet a window a table by the door theres a desk lamp what does the desk look like its a satinwood library desk george iii she set her cup back down with a rattle oh that was clever i never expected you to ask about the desk so i didnt think and it was just there concentrate on the desk bailey describe it for me its a beautiful piece the top is crossbanded with rosewood thats inlaid with boxwood lines the sides even the kneehole are inlaid with ovals one side has a long drawer paneled with false fronts it opens to shelves its so clever the handles are brass and theyre kept well polished baffled she stared into her tea now i sound like an antique dealer no he thought just someone who loves beautiful things and knows that desk very well whats on the desk the lamp its brass too with a green glass shade and an oldfashioned chain pull and there are papers a neat stack of papers aligned with the corner of the desk a leather blotter is in the center and a briefke sits there a what a briefke a little cup of paper for carrying loose stones theyre emeralds grass green of varying cuts and carats theres a jewelers loupe and a small brass scale a glass baccarat crystal with ice melting in the whiskey and and the knife her breath was strangling but she forced it free the knife is there carved bone handle curved blade its old its beautiful is someone at the desk no the chairs empty easier to look away from the knife to look somewhere else its a dark pewtergray leather its back is to the window theres a storm her voice hitched theres a storm lightning lashing rain theyre shouting over the thunder where are they in front of the desk facing each other he pushed her cup aside so that he could take her hand what are they saying bailey i dont know something about a deposit take the deposit leave the country its a bad deal too dangerous his minds made up she could hear the voices the words were bouncing out of the static of sound harsh angry phrases doublecrossing son of a bitch you want to deal with him you go ahead im out of it both of us together no backing out you take the stones deal with him baileys suspicious not as stupid as you think youre not walking out with the money and leaving me twisting in the wind he shoves him back theyre fighting pushing shoving punching it frightens me how much they hate each other i dont know how they can despise each other so much because theyre the same he didnt want to take her through what had happened next he had the scene now the steps how are they the same the same face same eyes dark eyes dark hair everything mirror images even their voices the same pitch theyre the same man cade how can they be the same man unless it didnt happen that way at alland ive lost not only my memory but my mind youre not looking at the simple bailey at the simple and the obvious his smile was grim his eyes glowed twins twins brothers everything in her every part of her being was repelled she could only shake her head and continued to shake it until the movement was frantic no no no she couldnt accept that wouldnt thats not it that cant be it she pushed back from the table abruptly her chair scraping harshly on the tile i dont know what i saw desperate now to block it out she grabbed her cup slopping tea on the table before she carried it to the sink and dumped it down the drain it was dark i dont know what i saw didnt want to know what shed seen cade concluded wasnt ready to know and he wasnt willing to risk playing analyst until shed regrouped put it away for now its been a rough day you need some rest yes her mind was screaming for peace for oblivion but she was terrified of sleep and the dreams that would come with it she turned pressed herself against him make love with me i dont want to think i just want you to love me i do he met her seeking mouth with his i will he led her out of the kitchen stopping on the way to kiss to touch at the base of the stairs he unbuttoned her blouse skimmed his hands up her narrow rib cage then cupped her breasts on a broken gasp she clutched her hands in his hair and dragged his mouth down to hers hed wanted to be gentle tender but her lips were wild and desperate he understood that it was the wild and desperate she needed and let himself go he tore the bra aside watched the shock and arousal flare in her eyes when his hands possessed this time they were greedy and rough theres a lot i havent shown you he sought the delicate curve between neck and shoulder bit a lot no one had shown her he thought with a wild spurt of sheer lust you may not be ready show me her head fell back and her pulse scrambled like frightened birds and fear was suddenly liberating i want you to he dragged her slacks down her hips and plunged his fingers inside her her nails bit into his shoulders as she rocked on that swift stunning peak the whimper in her throat became a cry that was both fear and joy his breath hissed out as he watched her fly up fly over the dazed shock in her eyes brought him a dark thrill she was helpless now if he wanted her helpless and he did he peeled away layers of clothes his hands quick and sure when she was naked and quivering his lips curved he traced his thumbs over her nipples until her eyes fluttered closed you belong to me his voice was thick rough compelling i need to hear you say it for now you belong to me yes she would have told him anything promised her soul if that was what he asked of her this was no lazy river now but a flood of heaving sensations she wanted to drown in them more he gave more his mouth raced down her body then fixed greedily on the core of heat she swayed quaked exploded colors burst in her headcarnival lights and jewels stars and rainbows her back pressed into the railing and her hands gripped at it for balance while her world spun like a carousel gone mad then pleasure the sharp edge of it tipped toward pain at that point between glory and devastation her body simply shattered he pulled her into his arms darkly pleased that she was limp leaving her clothes where they lay cradling her he mounted the steps his bed this time he thought with a restless lustful need to claim her there he fell to the bed with her let the fire inside him rage it was unbearable glorious his hands his mouth destroyed her rebuilt her sweat dewed her skin slickening it and when hed dragged his clothes away slickening his her body arched and bucked straining for more moving eagerly against each new demand when he yanked her to her knees she wrapped herself around him eagerly bowing back when his head lowered once more to suckle her breast and when her head touched the mattress her body bridged he buried himself deep inside her her moan was low and throaty a mindless sound as he gripped her hips braced them with his own heart screaming in his chest he drove them both hard and fast no thoughts no doubts nothing but the hot frenzied joining there was moonlight on her face glinting in her hair glowing on her damp skin even as his vision grayed he fixed the picture of her in his mind locked it there as the dark pleasure peaked and he emptied himself into her he waited until he was sure she slept for a time he simply watched her bewitched by her and what theyd brought to each other no woman hed touched no woman who had touched him had ever reached so deep inside him held his heart so close and fast hed demanded that she tell him she belonged to him it was no less true that he belonged to her the miracle of it humbled him he touched his lips to her temple when he left her she was sprawled on her stomach one arm flung out where he had lain beside her he hoped exhaustion would tranquilize her dreams he left the door open so that he could hear if she cried out in sleep or called for him he took time to brew a pot of coffee and carried it with him into the library he gave his computer one grim sneer before booting it up the clock in the comer chimed midnight then bonged the half hour before he found his rhythm in hardly twice the time it would have taken a tenyearold hacker the information he was searching for flashed up on the screen gem experts the greater metropolitan area he scrolled through keeping his senses alert with caffeine fumbled for a moment in engaging the printer for hard copy boone and son kleigmore diamond consultants landis jewelry creations his computer provided him with more detailed information than the phone book for once he blessed technology he scanned the data names dates then continued to scroll salvini salvini his eyes narrowed as he skimmed the data appraisers and gemologists estate jewelry and antiquities a specialty established in by charles salvini now deceased certified and bonded consultants to museums and private collectors personalized designs repairs and remounting all work done on premises a chevy chase address he mused the location was close enough the firm was respected had earned a triplea rating owners thomas and timothy salvini ts he thought on a quick spurt of excitement brothers bingo chapter just take your time bailey took a deep breath and struggled to be as calm and precise as cade wanted her nose is sharper than that i think the police artists name was sara and she was young and patient skilled bailey had no doubt or cade wouldnt have called on her she sat at the kitchen table with her sketch pad and pencils a cup of steaming coffee at her elbow more like this with a few quick strokes sara honed down the nose yes i think so her eyes are bigger sort of tilted up almondshaped sara whisked the gum eraser over the pencil strokes adjusted for size and shape i suppose its hard to see it all in my head just give me impressions saras smile was easy and relaxed well go from there it seems the mouth is wide softer than the rest of the face everything else is angles quite a face cade commented as sara sketched interesting sexy as bailey continued to instruct he studied the image angular face carelessly short hair with long spiky bangs with dark dramatically arched eyebrows peeking through exotic and tough he decided and tried to hook a personality with the features thats very close to what i remember bailey took the sketch sara offered she knew this face she thought and looking at it brought competing urges to smile and to weep mj who was mj and what had they shared you want to take a break cade asked and lowered his hands to baileys shoulders to rub away the tension no id like to keep at it if you dont mind she said to sara hey i can do this all day long as you keep the coffee coming she held her empty mug up to cade with a quick smile that told bailey they knew each other well youah its interesting work bailey began sara tossed a long gingercolored braid behind her back her outfit was both cool and casual denim cutoffs and a plain white tank the combination straightup sexy its a living she told bailey computers are slowly putting me out of business its amazing what they can do with imaging but a lot of cops and pis still prefer sketches she took her refilled mug back from cade parris here hell do most anything to avoid a computer hey im getting the hang of it sara snickered when you do ill be making my living doing caricatures in bars she shrugged sipped then picked up a fresh pencil want to try for the other yes all right telling herself not to focus on just how well cade and sara knew each other bailey closed her eyes and concentrated grace she let the name cruise through her mind bring up the image soft she began theres a softness to her face its very beautiful almost unbelievably so its an oval face very classic her hairs ink black very long it sort of spills down her back in loose waves no bangs just a flow of dark thick silk her eyes are wide heavylidded and thickly lashed laserblue eyes the nose is short and straight think perfect im starting to hate her sara said lightly and made bailey smile it must be hard to be wildly beautiful dont you think people only look at the surface i think i could live with it how about the mouth lush full natch yes thats good excitement began to drum the sketch was coming together quickly the eyebrows are a little fuller and theres a mole beside the left one just here bailey said pointing to her own face now i really hate her sara muttered i dont want to know if shes got the body to match this face tell me shes got dumbo ears no im afraid not bailey smiled at the sketch and felt warm and weepy again shes just beautiful it startles the eye she looks familiar at saras careless comment bailey tensed does she really id swear ive seen this face before pursing her lips sara tapped her pencil against the sketch in a magazine maybe she looks like someone whod modelpricey perfume or face cream you got a milliondollar face youd be crazy not to use it a model bailey bit her lip fought to remember i just dont know sara tore off the sheet handed it to cade what do you think a heartstopper he said after a moment the gene fairy was in one hell of a good mood when she was born i cant place it though and thats a face no man with a pulse would forget her name is grace bailey told herself and shes more than beautiful shes not just a face good work sara cade laid the two sketches together on the counter got time for one more sara took a quick look at her watch ive got about a half hour to spare the man bailey cade crouched down until they were eye to eye you know what he looks like now i dont you do he said it firmly though his hands were gentle on her arms its important just tell sara how you see him it would hurt bailey realized her stomach muscles were already clenched at the thought of letting that face back into her head i dont want to see him again you want the answers you want it over this is a step youve got to take the steps she closed her eyes shifted her head began to throb as she put herself back in that room with the gray carpet and the stormlashed window hes dark she said quietly his face is long narrow its tight with anger his mouth is grim with temper its thin and strong and stubborn his nose is slightly hooked not unattractive but strong again its a very strong face his eyes are deepset dark dark eyes flashing with fury there was murder in them she shuddered hugged her elbows and fought to concentrate hollowed cheeks and high forehead his eyebrows are dark and straight sos his hair its well cut full at the top very precisely trimmed around the ears its a very handsome face the jaw spoils it a little its soft slightly weak is that him bailey cade put a hand on her shoulder again squeezed lightly in support braced she opened her eyes and looked at the sketch it wasnt precise it wasnt perfect the eyes should be a bit farther apart the mouth slightly fuller but it was enough to have her trembling yes its very like him mustering all her control she rose slowly excuse me she murmured and walked out of the room the ladys terrified sara commented sliding her pencils back in their case i know are you going to tell me what kind of trouble shes in im not sure cade dipped his hands in his pockets but im close to finding out you did good work sara i owe you ill bill you she gathered her tools and rose she kissed him lightly studied his face i dont think youre going to be calling me up for a night on the town anymore im in love with her he said simply yeah i got that she shouldered her bag then touched his cheek im going to miss you ill be around youll be around she agreed but those wild and wacky days are over for you parris i like her hope you work it out with a last wistful smile she turned i know the way out he walked her out anyway and closing the door realized he was indeed shutting off a part of his life the freedom of coming and going as he pleased with whom he pleased late nights in a club with the prospect of friendly unfettered sex to follow responsible to no one but himself he glanced up the stairs she was up there responsibility stability commitment one woman from now throughout the rest of his lifea troubled woman one who had yet to say the words he needed to hear to make the promises he needed made he could still walk away and she wouldnt blame him in fact he was sure that was exactly what shed expected it made him wonder who had left her before with a shake of his head he climbed the stairs to her without the slightest regret she was standing in the bedroom looking out the window her hands were clasped in front of her her back was to the door are you all right yes im sorry i was rude to your friend i didnt even thank her sara understands youve known her a long time a few years yeah bailey swallowed youve been together cade lifted a brow decided against moving to her yeah weve been together ive been with other women bailey women ive liked cared for knew she turned on the word and her eyes were fierce knew he agreed with a nod this is out of sync she dragged her hands through her hair you and me cade its out of sync with the rest of it it should never have happened it did happen he stuck his hands in his pockets because theyd tensed wanted to fist are you going to stand there and tell me youre upset because youve met a woman ive slept with because i didnt come to you the same way you came to me blank the word shot out of her like a bullet you didnt come to me blank you have family friends lovers a life i have nothing but pieces that dont fit i dont care if youve slept with a hundred women her voice snapped on that then whispered fiercely on the rest its that you remember them can remember them you want me to tell you they dont matter his temper began to inch up nudged by panic she was pulling back pulling away of course they mattered i cant blank out my past for you bailey i wouldnt want you to she covered her face with her hands for a moment as she fought for even a slippery grip on control shed made up her mind now she just had to be strong enough to follow through im sorry your private life before i came into it isnt my business or even the point the point is you had one cade so did you so did i she nodded thinking that was precisely what frightened her i never would have gotten this close to finding it without you but i realize i should have gone to the police straightaway ive only complicated things by not doing so but thats what im going to do now you dont trust me to finish this thats not the issue damn right its not he told her this isnt about going to the cops its about you and me you think you can walk out of here and away from whats between us his hands shot out of his pockets grabbed her arms think again someones dead im involved her teeth threatened to chatter as she fought to keep her eyes level with his and i shouldnt have involved you its too late for that now it was too late the minute you walked into my office youre not shaking me off when his mouth crushed down on hers the kiss tasted of frustration and fury he held her close blocking any choice ravaging her mouth until her hands went limp on his shoulders dont she managed when he lifted her off her feet but that too was too late she was pressed beneath him on the bed every sense scrambling and screaming as his hands streaked over her i dont give a damn what you forget eyes dark and reckless he dragged at her clothes youll remember this he spun her out of control out of time out of place there was a wildness and willfulness here that shed never experienced and couldnt resist his mouth closed over her breast stabbing pleasure through her even as she sucked in air to moan his fingers pierced her and drove her ruthlessly to peak she cried out not in alarm not in protest but with the staggered thrill of being plunged beyond reason her nails bit into his back her body moved like lightning under his she opened herself to him recklessly the only thought in her head was now now now he drove himself into her hard and deep felt her clutch convulsively around him as she flew over the new crest it was mindless desperate it was wrong it was irresistible he gripped her hands in his watched pleasure chase shock across her face the animal inside him had broken free and it clawed at both of them so his mouth was rough as it savaged hers and he pistoned himself inside her until she wept out his name and what was left of his mind shattered empty hollowed out he collapsed on her her body shuddered under his as a catchy whimper sounded in her throat her hands lay palm out and limp on the rumpled spread his mind began to clear enough for shame hed never taken a woman so roughly never given a woman so little choice he rolled away from her stared at the ceiling appalled by what hed found inside himself im sorry it was pathetic that phrase the uselessness of it scraped at him as he sat up rubbed his hands over his face i hurt you im sorry theres no excuse for it and finding none he rose and left her alone she managed to sit up one hand pressed to her speeding heart her body felt weak tingly and still pulsingly hot her mind remained fuzzy around the edges even as she patiently waited for it to clear the only thing she was certain of was that she had just been savaged overwhelmed by sensation by emotion by him it had been wonderful cade gave her time to compose herself and used the time to formulate his next steps it was so difficult to think around fury hed been angry before hurt before ashamed before but when she came down the stairs looking tidy and nervous those three emotions threatened to swamp him are you all right yes cade i youll do what you want he interrupted her in a voice that was both cool and clipped and so will i i apologize again for treating you that way she felt her stomach sink to her knees youre angry with me with both of us i can deal with myself but first i have to deal with you you want to walk out its not what i want there was a plea for understanding in her voice its whats right ive made you an accessory to god knows what you hired me she let out an impatient breath how could he be so blind and stubborn it hasnt been a professional relationship cade it barely started as one thats right its personal and youre not walking out on me out of some misguided sense of guilt you want to walk for other reasons well get into them after this is done i love you there was chilly fury over the words that only deepened the emotion behind them if you dont cant or wont love me ill have to live with it but walking out at this points just not an option i only want you want to go to the cops he paused a moment hooked his thumbs in his front pockets to keep his hands from reaching for her thats fine its your choice but meanwhile you hired me to do a job and im not finished whatever your personal feelings or mine i intend to finish get your purse she wasnt sure how to handle him now then again she realized had she ever known still this cold angry man standing in front of her was much more of a stranger than the one she had first seen in a cluttered messy office only days before the appointment at the smithsonian she began ive postponed it we have somewhere else to go first where get your purse he repeated were taking this next step my way he didnt speak on the drive she recognized some of the buildings theyd ridden past them before but when he drove out of dc and into maryland her nerves began to jump i wish youd tell me where were going the trees were too close to the road she thought panicky too green too big back he said sometimes youve just got to open the door and look at whats on the other side we need to talk to the curator at the museum her throat was closing shed have bartered her soul for a glass of water we should turn around and go back to the city you know where were going no the denial was sharp desperate no i dont he only flicked a glance at her out of sharp green eyes the pieces are there bailey he turned left off the main drag listening to her breathing coming short and labored ruthlessly he repressed his instinct to soothe she was stronger than hed pretended she was he could admit that and she would get through this hed help her get through it if the place was being watched he was bringing her out in the open he had to weigh the possibility of that against doing his job shed hired him to solve the puzzle he reminded himself and this he was sure was the last piece she couldnt continue to live in the safe little world hed provided for her it was time for both of them to move forward setting his jaw he pulled into the lot at salvini you know where we are her skin was clammy in long restless strokes she rubbed her damp palms over the knees of her slacks no i dont the building was brick two stories old rather lovely with tall display windows flanked by well established azaleas that would bloom beautifully in the spring there was an elegance to the place that shouldnt have made her shudder there was a single car in the lot a bmw sedan dark blue its finish gleamed in the sunlight the building stood alone taking up the corner while behind it across a vast parking lot a trendy strip mall seemed to be doing a brisk holiday business i dont want to be here bailey turned her head refusing to look at the sign that topped the building in large clear letters salvini theyre closed she continued theres no one here we should go theres a car in the lot cade pointed out it wont hurt to see no she snatched her hand away from his tried to bury herself in the corner of the seat im not going in there im not whats in there bailey i dont know terror just terror im not going in he would rather have cut out his heart than force her to do what he intended but thinking of her he got out of the car came around to her side opened the door ill be with you lets go i said im not going in there coward he said it with a sneer in his voice do you want to hide the rest of your life fury sparkled off the tears in her eyes as she ripped the seat belt free i hate you for this i know he murmured but took her arm firmly and led her to the buildings front entrance it was dark inside through the window he could see little but thick carpet and glass displays where gold and stones gleamed dully it was a small showroom again elegant with a few upholstered stools and countertop mirrors where customers might sit and admire their choices beside him bailey was shaking like a leaf lets try the back the rear faced the strip mall and boasted delivery and employee entrances cade studied the lock on the employee door and decided he could handle it from his pocket he took out a leather roll of tools what are you doing bailey stepped back as he chose a pick and bent to his work are you breaking in you cant do that i think i can manage it i practice picking locks at least four hours a week quiet a minute it took concentration a good touch and several sweaty minutes if the alarm was set he figured it would go off when he disengaged the first lock it didnt and he changed tools and started on the second a silent alarm wasnt out of the question he mused as he jiggled tumblers if the cops came he was going to have a lot of explaining to do this is insane bailey took another step in retreat youre breaking into a store in broad daylight you cant do this cade did it he said with some satisfaction as the last tumbler fell fastidiously he replaced his tools in the roll pocketed them an outfit like this ought to have a motion alarm in place as well he stepped through the door in the dim light he saw the alarm box beside the doorway disengaged he could almost hear another piece fall into place careless of them he murmured with the way crime pays he took baileys hand and pulled her inside nobodys going to hurt you while im around not even me i cant do this youre doing it keeping her hand firm in his he hit the lights it was a narrow room more of an entranceway with a worn wooden floor and plain white walls against the left wall were a watercooler and a brass coatrack a womans gray raincoat hung on one of the hooks it had called for thunderstorms the previous thursday he thought a practical woman such as bailey wouldnt have gone to work without her raincoat its yours isnt it i dont know coats your style quality expensive subtle he checked the pockets found a roll of breath mints a short grocery list a pack of tissues its your handwriting he said offering her the list i dont know she refused to look at it i dont remember he pocketed the list himself and led her into the next room it was a workroom a smaller version of the one at westlake he recognized the equipment now and deduced that if he took the time to pick the locks on the drawers of a tall wooden cabinet he would find loose stones the flood of gems bailey had described from her dreams stones that made her happy challenged her creativity soothed her soul the worktable was wiped spotlessly clean nothing not the thinnest chain of gold links was out of place it was he thought just like her someone keeps their area clean he said mildly her hand was icy in his as he turned there were stairs leading up lets see whats behind door number two she didnt protest this time she was too locked in terror to form the words she winced as he flooded the stairway with light and drew her up with him on the second level the floors were carpeted in pewter gray nausea swam in her stomach the hallway was wide enough for them to walk abreast and there were gleaming antique tables set at wellarranged spots red roses were fading in a silver vase and the scent of their dying sickened her he opened a door nudged it wider and knew at first glance that it was her office nothing was out of place the desk a pretty feminine queen anne gleamed with polish and care under the light coating of weekend dust on it was a long milky crystal jagged at one end like a broken blade of a sword shed called it chalcedony he remembered and the smooth multiangled rock nearby must be the rutilated quartz on the walls were dreamy watercolors in thin wooden frames there was a small table beside a love seat that was thickly upholstered in rosetoned fabric and set off with pale green pillows on the table stood a small glass vase with drooping violets and pictures framed in polished silver he picked up the first she was about ten he judged a little gangly and unformed but there was no mistaking those eyes and shed grown to closely resemble the woman who sat beside her in a porch glider smiling into the camera its your past bailey he picked up another photo three woman arms linked laughing you mj and grace your present he set the picture down picked up another the man was golden handsome his smile assured and warm her future he wondered hes dead the words choked out of her slicing her heart on the journey my father hes dead the plane went down in dorset hes dead im sorry cade set the photo down he never came home she was leaning against the desk her legs trembling her heart reeling as too many images crowded their way inside he left on a buying trip and never came back we used to eat ice cream on the porch hed show me all the treasures i wanted to learn lovely old things he smelled of pine soap and beeswax he liked to polish the pieces himself sometimes he had antiques cade said quietly it was a legacy his father to him my father to me time and again the shop time and again it was so full of beautiful things he died he died in england thousands of miles away my mother had to sell the business she had to sell it when take it slow and easy just let it come she got married again i was fourteen she was still young she was lonely she didnt know how to run a business thats what he said she didnt know how hed take care of things not to worry she staggered caught herself then her gaze landed on the soapstone elephant with the jeweled blanket on her desk mj she gave it to me for my birthday i like foolish things i collect elephants isnt that odd you picked an elephant for me at the carnival and i collect them she passed a hand over her eyes tried to hang on we laughed when i opened it just the three of us mj and grace and i just a few weeks ago my birthdays in june june nineteenth im twentyfive her head spun as she struggled to focus on cade im twentyfive im bailey james my names bailey anne james gently cade eased her into a chair laid his hand on hers nice to meet you chapter its mixed up in my head bailey pressed her fingers to her eyes visions were rocketing in zooming through overlapping and fading before she could gain a firm hold tell me about your father my father hes dead i know sweetheart tell me about him hehe bought and sold antiques it was a family business family was everything we lived in connecticut the business started there our house was there hehe expanded another branch in new york one in dc his father had established the first one then my father had expanded his name was matthew now she pressed her hand to her heart as it swelled and broke its like losing him all over again he was the center of the world to me he and my mother she couldnt have any more children i suppose they spoiled me i loved them so much we had a willow tree in the backyard thats where i went when my mother told me about the crash i went out and sat under the willow tree and tried to make him come back your mother came and found you he was guessing now prompting her gently through her grief yes she came out and we sat there together for a long time the sun went down and we just sat there together we were lost without him cade she tried she tried so hard to hold the business together to take care of me the house it was just too much she didnt know how she metshe met charles salvini this is his building it was she rubbed her mouth with the back of her hand he was a jeweler specialized in estate and antique pieces she consulted with him on some of our stock thats how it started she was lonely and he treated her very well he treated me very well i admired him i think he loved her very much i really do i dont know if she loved him but she needed him i suppose i did too she sold what was left of the antique business and married him was he good to you yes he was he was a kind man and like my father he was scrupulously honest honesty in business in personal matters was vital it was my mother he wanted but i came with the package and he was always good to me you loved him yes it was easy to love him to be grateful for what he did for me and my mother he was very proud of the business hed built up when i developed an interest in gems he encouraged it i apprenticed here in the summers and after school he sent me to college to study my mother died while i was away in college i wasnt here i was away when she died honey he gathered her close tried to soothe im sorry it was an accident it happened very fast a drunk driver crossed the center line hit her head on that was it grief was fresh again raw and fresh charles was devastated he never really recovered he was older than she by about fifteen years and when she died he lost interest in everything he retired went into seclusion he died less than a year later and you were all alone i had my brothers she shuddered gripped cades hands timothy and thomas charless sons my stepbrothers she let out a broken sob twins her hands jerked in his i want to go now i want to leave here tell me about your brothers he said calmly theyre older than you i want to go i have to get out they worked here cade continued they took over the business from your stepfather you worked here with them yes yes they took over the business i came to work here when i graduated from radcliffe were family theyre my brothers they were twenty when their father married my mother we lived in the same house were family one of them tried to kill you no no she covered her face again refused to see it its a mistake i told you theyre my brothers my family we lived together we work together our parents are dead and were all thats left theyre impatient or brusque sometimes but theyd never hurt me theyd never hurt one another they couldnt they have offices here in this building on this floor she shook her head but her gaze shifted to the left i want you to sit right here stay right here bailey where are you going i need to look he cupped her face kept his eyes level with hers you know i have to look stay here she let her head fall back against the cushion closed her eyes she would stay there was nothing she needed to see nothing she needed to know she knew her name now her family wasnt that enough but it played back in her head with an echoing crack of lightning that made her moan she hadnt moved when cade came back into the room but she opened her eyes and when she did she saw it on his face its thomas she said hollowly its thomas whos dead in his office down the hall he didnt wonder that she had blocked out what shed seen the attack had been vicious and violent to witness the cause of the effect in the room hed just left would have been horrifying but to watch from a few feet away knowing it was one brother savagely slaying another would have been unspeakable thomas she repeated and let tears fall poor thomas he wanted to be the best in everything he often was they were never unkind to me they ignored me a great deal of the time as older brothers would i suppose i know they resented that charles left me a part of the business but they tolerated it and me she paused looked down at her hands theres nothing we can do for him is there no ill get you out of here he took her hand helped her to her feet well call this in they planned to steal the three stars of mithra she stood her ground she could bear it she promised herself and she needed to say it all wed been commissioned to verify and assess the three diamonds or i had actually since thats my field i often do consults with the smithsonian the stars were going to be part of their gem display theyre originally from persia theyre very old and were once set in a triangle of gold held in the open hands of a statue of mithra she cleared her throat spoke calmly now focused practical he was the ancient persian god of light and wisdom mithraism became one of the major religions of the roman empire he was supposed to have slain the divine bull and from the bulls dying body sprang all the plants and animals you can tell me in the car he urged her to the door but she simply couldnt move until shed said it all the religion wasnt brought to rome until bc and it spread rapidly its similar to christianity in many respects the ideals of brotherly love her voice broke forced her to swallow the three stars were thought to be a myth a legend spawned by the trinity though some scholars believed firmly in their existence and described them as symbols of love knowledge and generosity its said if one possesses all three the combination of these elements will bring power and immortality you dont believe that i believe theyre powerful enough to bring about great love great hate great greed i found out what my brothers were doing i realized timothy was creating duplicates in the lab she scrubbed at her eyes maybe he could have hidden something like that from me if hed been more methodical more careful but he was always the more impatient of the two the more reckless now her shoulders slumped as she remembered hes been in trouble a few times for assault his temper is very quick he never hurt you no never he may have hurt my feelings from time to time she tried a smile but it faded quickly he seemed to feel that my mother had only married his father so that the two of us could be taken care of it was partially true i suppose so it was always important to me to prove myself you proved yourself here cade said not to him timothy was never one to praise but he was never overly harsh not really and i never thought he or thomas would be dishonest until we were commissioned to assess the stars and that was more than they could resist apparently the fakes wouldnt fool anyone for very long but by the time the stones were found out my brothers would have the money and be gone i dont know who was paying them but they were working for someone she stopped on the stairs stared down he chased me down here i was running it was pitchdark i nearly fell down these stairs i could hear him coming after me and i knew hed kill me wed shared christmas dinner every year of my life since i was fourteen and he would kill me the same horrible way hed killed thomas for money she clutched the railing as she slowly walked down to the lower level i loved him cade i loved both of them at the base of the steps she turned gestured to a narrow door theres a basement down there its very small and cramped theres where i ran theres a little nook under the steps with a lattice door i used to explore the building when i was young and i liked sitting in that nook where it was quiet id study the gem books charles gave me i dont suppose timothy knew it was there if hed known id be dead she walked into the sunlight i honestly dont remember how long i stayed in there in the dark waiting for him to find me and kill me i dont know how i got to the hotel i must have walked part of the way at least i dont drive to work i live only a few blocks from here he wanted to tell her it was done now but it wasnt he wanted to let her rest her head on his shoulder and put it behind her but he couldnt instead he took her hands turned her to face him bailey where are the other two stars the she went dead pale so quickly he grabbed her certain she would faint but her eyes stayed open wide and shocked oh my god oh my god cade what have i done he knows where they live he knows you gave them to mj and grace moving fast he wrenched open the car door the cops would have to wait tell me where i was so angry she told him as they sped through afternoon traffic i realized they were using me my name my knowledge my reputation to authenticate the gems then they would switch them and leave meleave the business my stepfather had builtholding the bag salvini would have been ruined after all charles had done to build it i owed him loyalty and damn it so did they so you beat them to it it was impulse i was going to face them down with it but i wanted the stars out of reach at least i thought they shouldnt all be in one place as long as they were they could be taken so i sent one to mj and one to grace by different overnight couriers dear lord bailey you put priceless diamonds in the mail she squeezed her eyes shut we use special couriers regularly for delivering gems her voice was prim vaguely insulted shed already told herself shed been unbelievably rash all i could think was that there were two people in the world i could trust with anything i didnt consider theyd be put in danger i never realized how far it could go i was certain that when i confronted my brothers told them id separated the diamonds for safekeeping and would be making arrangements to have the diamonds delivered to the museum that would have to be the end of it she hung onto the door as his tires spun around a corner its this building were on the third floor mj and i have apartments across from each other she was out of the car before hed fully stopped and racing toward the entrance cursing he snatched his keys out of the ignition and sprinted after her he caught her on the stairs stay behind me he ordered i mean it both the lock and the jamb on apartment were broken police tape was slashed across it mj was all she could manage as she pushed at cade and reached for the knob to mjs apartment there you are dearie a woman in pink stretch pants and fluffy slippers scuffed down the hall i was getting worried about you mrs weathers baileys knuckles turned white on the knob as she turned mj whats happened to mj such a hullabaloo mrs weathers fluffed her helmet of blond hair and gave cade a measuring smile you dont expect such things in a nice neighborhood like this the world is going to hell in a handbasket i swear wheres mj last i saw she was running off with some man clattering down the steps swearing at each other that was after all the commotion glass breaking furniture smashing gunshots she nodded briskly several times like a bird bobbing for juicy worms shot was mj shot didnt look shot to me mad as a wet hen and fired up my brother was she with my brother no indeed hadnt even seen this young man before ida remembered i can tell you he was one tall drink of water had his hair back in one of those cute little ponytails and had eyes like steel dent in his chin just like a movie star i got a good look at him seeing as he nearly knocked me over when did this happen mrs weathers she fastened her gaze on cades face at the question beamed and offered a hand i dont believe weve been introduced im cade a friend of baileys he flashed a grin back at her while impatience twisted his stomach weve been away for a few days and wanted to catch up with mj well i havent seen hide nor hair of her since saturday when she went running out left the door of her apartment wide openor i thought she had till i saw it was broken so i peeked in her place was a wreck i know shes not the housekeeper you are bailey but it was upside down and sideways and she paused dramatically there was a man laid out cold on the floor big bruiser of a man too so i skedaddled back to my apartment and called the police what else could i do i guess hed come to and cleared out by the time they got here lord knows i didnt put a toe out the door until the cops came knocking and they said he was gone cade slipped an arm around baileys waist she was starting to tremble mrs weathers i wonder if you might have an extra key to baileys apartment she left it back at my place and we need to pick up a few things oh is that the way of it she smiled slyly fluffed her hair again and admonished bailey and high time too holing yourself up here night after night now lets see i just watered mr hollisters begonias so ive got my keys right here here you are i dont remember giving you my key of course you did dearie last year when you and the girls went off to arizona i made a copy just in case humming to herself she unlocked baileys door before she could push it open and scoot in cade outmaneuvered her thanks a lot no trouble cant imagine where that girl got off to she said craning her neck to see through the crack in the door of baileys apartment i told the police how she was running off on her own steam oh and now that i think about it bailey i did see your brother timothy bailey whispered cant say which one for sure they look like clones to me he came by lets see she tapped a finger on her front teeth as if to jiggle the thought free must have been saturday night i told him i hadnt seen you that i thought you might have taken a holiday he looked a little perturbed let himself right in then closed the door in my face i didnt realize he had a key either bailey murmured then realized shed left her purse behind when she ran she wondered how foolishly useless it would be to change her locks thank you mrs weathers if i miss mj again will you tell her im looking for her of course dearie now if you she frowned as cade gave her a quick wink slid bailey inside and shut the door in her face it was just as well he had one glance around told him his tidy bailey didnt usually leave her apartment with cushions ripped open and drawers spilled out apparently salvini hadnt been content to search the place hed wanted to destroy it messy amateur cade murmured running a hand up and down her back it was the same madness she realized the same violent loss of control shed seen when he grabbed the antique knife thomas used for a letter opener off the desk when he used it these were only things she reminded herself no matter how dear and cherished they were only things shed seen for herself just what timothy could do to people i have to call grace shed have gone to grace if she could did you recognize who mj was with from the description no i dont know anyone like that and i know most of mjs friends she waded through the destruction of her living room and reached the phone her message light was blinking but she ignored it and hastily punched in numbers its her machine bailey murmured and strained while the throaty voice recited the announcement then grace if youre there pick up its urgent im in trouble mjs in trouble i dont know where she is i want you to go to the police give them the package i sent you call me right away give her my number cade instructed i dont know it he took the phone himself recited it then handed the receiver back to bailey it was a calculated risk revealing baileys whereabouts but the diamond was going into safekeeping and he didnt want to put up any impediments to grace being able to reach them its lifeanddeath grace dont stay in the house alone get to the police dont talk to my brother whatever you do dont let him in the house call me please please call me where does she live in potomac bailey told him when he gently took the receiver away and hung it up she may not be there at all she has a place up in the country western maryland thats where i sent the package theres no phone there and only a few people know she goes there other times she just gets in the car and drives until she sees someplace that suits her she could be anywhere how long does she usually stay out of touch no more than a few days shed call me or mj with an oath she pounced on the message machine the first voice to flow out was graces bailey what are you up to is this thing real are we giving smuggling a try look you know how i hate these machines ill be in touch four oclock on saturday bailey hung on to that she was all right at four oclock on saturday according to the machine we dont know where she called from no but she was all right on saturday she punched to get the next message this time it was mj bailey listen up i dont know what the hells going on but were in trouble dont stay there he might come back im in a phone booth outside some dive near there was swearing a rattle hands off you son of a and a dial tone sunday two am what have i done cade saying nothing he punched in the next message it was a mans voice this time little bitch if you hear this ill find you i want whats mine there was a sob choked off he cut my face he had them slice up my face because of what you did im going to do the same to you its timothy she murmured i figured as much hes lost his mind cade i could see it that night something snapped in him he didnt doubt it not after what hed seen in thomas salvinis office is there anything you need from here when she only looked around blankly he took her hand well worry about that later lets go where a quiet spot where you can sit down and tell me everything else then well make a call the park was shady and green somehow the little bench under the spreading trees seemed to block out the punch of the oppressive july heat it hadnt rained in days and humidity hung like a cloud of wasps in the air you need to have yourself under control when we go to the cops cade told her you have to have your mind clear yes youre right and i need to explain everything to you im putting the pieces together well enough thats what i do yeah she looked down at her hands felt useless thats what you do you lost your father when you were ten your mother did her best but didnt have a head for business she struggled to keep a house raise a daughter alone and run an antique business then she met a man an older man successful competent financially solvent and attractive who wanted her and was willing to accept her daughter into his family she let out an unsteady breath i suppose thats it cutting to the bottom line the child wants a family and accepts the stepfather and stepbrothers as such thats it too isnt it yes i missed my father charles didnt replace him but he filled a need he was good to me cade and the stepbrothers noses were a little out of joint at the addition of a little sister a pretty bright willingtoplease little sister she opened her mouth to deny it then closed it again it was time to face what shed tried to ignore for years yes i suppose i stayed out of their way i didnt want to make waves they were both in college when our parents married and when they came back and were living at home again i was off i cant say we were close but it seemedi always felt we were a blended family they never teased or abused me they never made me feel unwelcome or welcome she shook her head there wasnt any real friction until my mother died when charles withdrew into himself pulled back from life so much they took over it seemed only natural the business was theirs i felt id always have a job with the company but i never expected any percentage there was a scene when charles announced id have twenty percent he was giving them forty each but that didnt seem to be the point to them they hassled you some then she sighed they were furious she admitted with their father with me thomas backed off fairly quickly though he was more interested in the salesandaccounting end than the creative work and he knew that was my area of expertise we got along well enough timothy was less content with the arrangement but he claimed id get tired of the routine find some rich husband and leave it all up to them anyway it still hurt to remember that the way hed sneered at her the money charles left me is in trust it dribbles out to me until i reach thirty its not a great deal but more than enough more than necessary he put me through college he gave me a home he gave me a career i love and when he sent me to college he gave me mj and grace thats where i met them we were in the same dorm the first semester by the second we were rooming together it was as if wed known each other all our lives theyre the best friends ive ever had oh god what have i done tell me about them she steadied herself and tried mjs restless she changed her major as often as some women change hairstyles took all sorts of obscure courses shed bomb tests or ace them depending on her mood shes athletic impatient generous fun toughminded she tended bar her last year at college for a lark claimed she was so good at it shed have to have her own place she bought one two years ago mjs its a pub off georgia avenue near the district line ive missed it its kind of a neighborhood bar regulars some irish music on the weekends if things get rowdy she takes care of it herself most of the time if she cant intimidate or outyell someone she can dropkick them around the block shes got a black belt in karate remind me not to cross her shed like you she can take care of herself thats what i keep telling myself no one can take care of herself better than m j oleary and grace shes beautiful you saw that from the sketch thats what most people see and they dont see anything else she uses that when she likesdespises it but uses it watching pigeons flutter and strut bailey let the memories come she was orphaned young younger than i and was raised by an aunt in virginia she was expected to behave to be a certain way a certain thing a virginia fontaine fontaine department stores yes money lots of old money at least old enough to have that luster a century or so of prestige provides because she was beautiful wealthy and from a fine family it was expected that she would be properly educated associate with the right people and marry well grace had other ideas didnt she pose for he trailed off cleared his throat bailey simply lifted a brow for a centerfold yes while she was still in college the ivy league miss april she did it without blinking an eye with the idea of scandalizing her family and as she put it exploiting the exploiters she came into her own money when she was twentyone so she didnt give a damn what her proper family thought i never saw the picture cade said wondering if he should be feeling regret or gratitude under the circumstances but it created quite a stir thats just what she was after baileys lips curved again grace liked creating stirs she modeled for a while because it amused her but it didnt satisfy her i think shes still looking for what will satisfy her she works very hard for charities travels on whims she calls herself the last of the dilettantes but its not true she does amazing work for underprivileged children but wont have it publicized she has tremendous compassion and generosity for the wounded the bartender the socialite and the gemologist an unlikely trio it made her smile i suppose it sounds that way wei dont want to sound odd but we recognized each other it was that simple i dont expect you to understand whod understand better he murmured i recognized you she looked up then met his eyes knowing who i am hasnt solved anything my life is a mess ive put my friends in terrible danger and i dont know how to help them i dont know how to stop what ive started by taking the next step he lifted her hand brushed a kiss over the knuckles we go back to the house get the canvas bag and contact a pal of mine on the force well find your friends bailey he glanced up at the sky as clouds rolled over the sun looks like were finally going to get that rain timothy salvini swallowed another painkiller his face throbbed so deeply it was difficult to think but thinking was just what he had to do the man who had ordered his face maimed then ordered it tended by his personal physician had given him one last chance if he didnt find bailey and at least one of the diamonds by nightfall there was nowhere on earth he could hide and fear was a deeper throb than pain he didnt know how it could have gone so horribly wrong hed planned it out hadnt he handled the details when thomas buried his head in the sand he was the one whod been contacted approached because he was the one with the brains he reminded himself he was the one who knew how to play the games and he was the one whod made the deal thomas had jumped at it at first half of ten million dollars would have set his twin up nicely and would have satisfied his own craving for real wealth not the dribs and drabs of their business income however successful the business but real money money to dream on then thomas had gotten cold feet hed waited until the eleventh hour when everything was falling into place and hed been planning to doublecross his own flesh and blood oh hed been furious to see that thomas had planned on taking the millionplus deposit and leaving the country leaving all the risk and the responsibility of pulling everything off on him because he was afraid salvini thought now because he was worried about bailey and what she knew grasping little bitch had always been in the way but hed have handled her hed have taken care of everything if only thomas hadnt threatened to ruin everything the argument had simply gotten out of control he thought rubbing a hand over his mouth everything had gotten out of control the shouting the rage the flashing storm and somehow the knife had just been there in his hand gripped in his hand and already slicked with blood before he realized it he hadnt been able to stop himself simply hadnt been able to stop hed gone a little mad for a moment he admitted but it had been all the stress the sense of betrayal the fury at being duped by his own brother and shed been there staring at him with those huge eyes staring at him out of the dark if not for the storm if not for the dark hed have found her taken care of her shed been lucky that was all just lucky he was the one with the brains it wasnt his fault none of it was his fault but he was taking the blame for all of it his life was on the line because of his brothers cowardice and the schemes of a woman hed resented for years he was certain shed shipped off at least one of the stones hed found the receipt for the courier in the purse shed left in her office when she fled from him thought she was clever he mused shed always thought she was the clever one little miss perfect ingratiating herself with his father coming back from her fancy college years with honors and awards honors and awards meant nothing in business shrewdness did guts did canniness did and timothy salvini had all three he would have had five million dollars too if his brother hadnt bumbled and alerted bailey then lost his nerve and tried to doublecross their client client he thought gingerly touching his bandaged cheek it was more like master now but that would change too he would get the money and the stone find the others and then he would run far and he would run fast because timothy salvini had looked the devil in the eye and was smart enough to know that once the stones were in the devils hand his minion would be of no more use so he was a dead man unless he was smart hed been smart enough to wait to spend hours waiting outside that apartment building for bailey to come home hed known she would she was a creature of habit predictable as the sunrise and she hadnt disappointed him who would have thought that someone so ordinary could have ruined all his plans separating the stones shipping them off in different directions oh that had been unexpectedly clever of her and extremely inconvenient for him but his job now was to concentrate on bailey others were concentrating on the other women he would deal with that in time but for now his patience had paid off it had been so easy really the fancy car had pulled up bailey had leaped out and the man had followed in too much of a hurry to lock the car door salvini had located the registration in the glove box noted the address now he was breaking the window on the rear door of the empty house and letting himself inside the knife hed used to kill his brother was tucked securely in his belt much quieter than a gun and just as effective he knew chapter micks a good cop cade told bailey as he pulled into the drive hell listen and hell clear away the red tape to get to the answers if id gone straight to them you wouldnt be any farther along than you are now cade said interrupting her maybe not as far you needed time what youd been through bailey it sickened him to think about it give yourself a break he hissed through his teeth as he remembered how ruthlessly hed pulled her through the building where it had all happened im sorry i was so hard on you if you hadnt pushed me i might have kept backing away from it avoiding everything i wanted to it was catching up with you it was hurting you he turned cupped her face but if you hadnt blocked it out you might have gone straight back to your apartment like a homing pigeon calling in your friends he would have found you all of you hed have killed me i didnt want to face that couldnt i suppose ive thought of him as my brother for over ten years even defended him and thomas to mj and grace but he would have killed me and them when she shuddered he nodded the best thing you did for all three of you was to get lost for a while no one would look for you here why would they i hope youre right i am right now the next step is to bring in the cops get them to put out an apb on salvini hes scared hes hurting and hes desperate it wont take them long hell tell them who hired him bailey relaxed a little he isnt strong enough to do otherwise if he thinks he can make some sort of deal with the authorities hell do it and grace and mj will be fine im looking forward to meeting them he leaned over opened her door thunder rumbled making her look up anxiously and he squeezed her hand well all go to the pub toss back a few its a date brightening by the image she got out reached for his hand when this is over maybe you can get to know me sweetheart how many times do i have to tell you i knew you the minute you walked in my door he jingled his keys stuck one in the lock it was blind instinct and his innate need to protect that saved his life the movement was a blur at the corner of his eye cade twisted toward it shoving bailey back the quick jerk of his body had the knife glancing down his arm instead of plunging into his back the pain was immediate and fierce blood soaked through his shirt dripped onto his wrist before he managed to strike out there was only one thought in his mindbailey get out he shouted at her as he dodged the next thrust of the knife run but she was frozen shocked by the blood numbed by the horrid replay of another attack it all happened so quickly she was certain shed no more than taken a breath but she saw her brothers face both cheeks bandaged with gauze a gouge over his left brow murder in his eyes again he lunged at cade cade pivoted gripped timothys knife hand at the wrist they strained against each other their faces close as lovers the smell of sweat and blood and violence fouling the air for a moment they were only shadows in the dim foyer their breath coming harsh and fast as thunder bellowed she saw the knife inch closer to cades face until the point was nearly under his chin while they swayed together on the bloody wood of the foyer like obscene dancers her brother would kill again and she would stand and watch she lunged it was a mindless animal movement she leaped onto his back tore at his hair sobbing cursing him the sudden jolt sent cade stumbling backward his hand slipping his vision graying around the edges with a howl of pain as she dug her fingers into his wounded face salvini threw her off her head rapped hard on the banister sent stars circling in her head flashing like lightning but then she was up and back at him like vengeance it was cade who pulled her away threw her back out of the path of the knife that whistled by her face then the force of cades leap sent both him and his quarry crashing into a table they grappled on the floor panting like dogs the uppermost thought in cades mind was to live long enough to keep bailey safe but his hands were slippery with blood and wouldnt keep a firm hold using all his strength he managed to twist timothys knife hand veering the blade away from his own heart then pushed away when he rolled weakly upright he knew it was over bailey was crawling to him sobbing his name he saw her face the bruise just blooming on her cheekbone he managed to lift a hand to it youre supposed to leave the heroics to me his voice sounded thready faraway to his own ears how bad are you hurt oh god youre bleeding so much she was doing something with the fire in his arm but it didnt seem to matter turn ing his head he looked into salvinis face the eyes were on him dimming but still aware cade coughed his throat clear who hired you you bastard salvini smiled slowly it ended in a grimace his face was bloody the bandages torn aside his breathing thin the devil was all he said well say hello to him in hell cade struggled to focus on bailey again her brows were drawn together in concentration you need your glasses for close work honey quiet let me stop the bleeding before i call for an ambulance im supposed to tell you its just a flesh wound but the truth is it hurts like hell im sorry so sorry she wanted to lay her head on his shoulder and weep just weep but she continued to make a thick pad out of what shed torn from his shirt and pressed it firmly against the long deep gash ill call for an ambulance as soon as i finish bandaging this youre going to be fine call detective mick marshall be sure to ask for him use my name i will be quiet i will what in the world is going on here the voice made him wince tell me im hallucinating he murmured tell me and im begging you tell me thats not my mother good god cade what have you done is this blood he closed his eyes dimly he heard bailey in a firm nononsense voice order his mother to call an ambulance and gratefully he passed out he came to in the ambulance with bailey holding his hand rain pattering briskly on the roof and again in the er with lights shining in his eyes and people shouting pain was like a greedy beast biting hunks out of his arm could i have some drugs here he asked as politely as possible and went out again the next time he surfaced he was in a bed he remained still eyes closed until he tested the level of pain and consciousness he gave the pain a six on a scale of ten but he seemed to be fully awake this time he opened his eyes and saw bailey hi i was hoping youd be the first thing id see she got up from the chair beside the bed to take his hand twentysix stitches no muscle damage you lost a lot of blood but they pumped more into you then she sat on the edge of the bed and indulged in a good cry she hadnt shed a tear since she fought to stop the bleeding as he lay on the floor not during the ambulance ride speeding through the wet streets while lightning and thunder strode across the sky or during the time she spent pacing the hospital corridors or during the headachy ordeal of dealing with his parents not even when she struggled to tell the police what had happened but now she let it all out sorry she said when shed finished rough day huh as days go it was one of the worst salvini she looked away toward the window where the rain ran wet hes dead i called the police i asked for detective marshall hes outside waiting for you to wake up and for the doctors to clear him in she stood straightened the sheets i tried to tell him everything to make it clear im not sure how well i did but he took notes asked questions hes worried about you we go back some well straighten it out bailey he told her and reached for her hand again can you hold up a little longer yes as long as it takes tell mick to get me out of here thats ridiculous youve been admitted for observation ive got stitches in my arm not a brain tumor im going home drinking a beer and dumping this on mick she angled her chin your mother said youd start whining im not whining im he trailed off narrowed his eyes as he sat up what do you mean my mother wasnt i hallucinating no she came over to give you a chance to apologize which apparently you never do great take her side im not taking her side bailey caught herself shook her head could they actually be having this conversation at such a time she was terrified cade when she realized what had happened that you were hurt she and your father my father i thought he was off flyfishing in montana he just got home this morning theyre in the waiting room right now worried to death about you bailey if you have one single ounce of affection for me make them go away i certainly will not and you should be ashamed of yourself ill be ashamed later ive got stitches it wasnt going to work he could see that plainly enough all right heres the deal you can send my parents in and ill square things with them then i want to see the doctor and get sprung well talk to mick at home and square things there bailey folded her arms she said you always expect to have your own way with that she turned and marched to the door it took a lot of charm arguments and stubbornness but in just over three hours cade was sinking onto his own sofa it took another two with the distraction of bailey fussing over him to fill mick in on the events since thursday night youve been a busy boy parris hey private work isnt eating doughnuts and drinking coffee pal mick grunted speaking of coffee he glanced toward bailey i dont mean to put you out miss james oh she got to her feet ill make a fresh pot she took his empty mug and hurried off smooth mick very smooth listen mick leaned closer the lieutenants not going to be happy with two corpses and two missing diamonds buchanans never happy he doesnt like play cops like you on principle but theres a lot of bad angles on this one your lady friend waiting four days to report a murders just one of them she didnt remember shed blocked it out yeah she says and me i believe her but the lieutenant buchanan has any trouble with it you send him my way incensed cade pushed himself up and ignored the throbbing in his arm good god mick she watched one of her brothers murder the other then turn on her you go to the scene look at what she looked at then tell me youd expect a civilian to handle it okay mick held up a hand shipping off the diamonds she was protecting them theyd be gone now if she hadnt done something youve got her statement and mine you know exactly how it went down shes been trying to complete the circle since she came to me thats how i see it mick said after a moment and glanced down at the canvas bag by his chair shes turned everything over theres no question here about selfdefense he broke a pane out in the back door walked in waited for you mick threaded a hand through his wiry hair he knew how easily it could have gone down another way how easily he could have lost a friend thought i told you to put in an alarm cade shrugged maybe i will now that ive got something worth protecting mick glanced toward the kitchen shes ah choice shes certainly mine we need to find mj oleary and grace fontaine mick and fast we im not going to sit on my butt mick nodded again all weve got on oleary is there was a disturbance in her apartment what looks like a whale of a fight and her running off with some guy wearing a pony tail looks like shes gone to ground or is being held there cade murmured casting a glance over his shoulder to make certain bailey was still out of earshot i told you about the message on baileys recorder yeah no way to trace a message but well put a flag out on her as for fontaine ive got men checking her house in potomac and were hunting down her place up in the mountains i should know something in a couple hours he rose hefted the bag grinned meanwhile i get to dump this on buchanan watch him tap dance with the brass from the smithsonian he had to chuckle knowing just how much his lieutenant hated playing diplomat with suits how much you figure the rocks are worth so far at least two lives bailey said as she carried in a tray of coffee mick cleared his throat im sorry for your loss miss james so am i but she would live with it the three stars of mithra dont have a price detective naturally for insurance purposes and so forth the smithsonian required a professional assessment of market value but whatever dollar value i can put on them as a gemologist is useless really love knowledge and generosity there is no price not quite sure of his moves mick shifted his feet yes maam she worked up a smile for him youre very kind and very patient im ready to go whenever you are go to the station you have to arrest me dont you mick scratched his head shifted his feet again it was the first time in his twentyyear career that hed had a woman serve him coffee then politely ask to be arrested id have a hard time coming up with the charge not that i dont want you to stay available but i figure cades got that handled and i imagine the museums going to want to have a long talk with you im not going to jail now she goes pale sit down bailey to ensure that she did cade took her hand with his good one and tugged i assumed until the diamonds were recovered i responsible your brothers were responsible cade corrected i have to go with that mick agreed im going to take a rain check on the coffee i may need to talk to you again miss james my friends were on it he gave cade a quick salute and left timothy cant hurt them now she murmured but whoever hired him only wants the diamonds not your friends odds are grace is up in her mountain hideaway and mj is out busting some guys chops it almost made her smile youre right well hear from them soon im sure of it id know if something had happened to them id feel it she poured a cup of coffee then left it sitting untouched theyre the only family i have left i suppose theyre the only family ive had for a long time i just pretended otherwise youre not alone bailey you know that no she wasnt alone he was there waiting you should lie down cade come with me she turned caught the fresh cockiness of his grin and rest im not tired her smile faded and her eyes went dark and serious you saved my me he thought of the way shed leaped onto salvinis back biting and scratching like a wildcat id say it was a tossup as to who saved whom you saved my life she said again slowly the minute i walked into yours id have been lost without you today you shielded me fought for me risked your life to protect mine ive always wanted to slay the dragon for the damsel you gave me the chance its not white knights or sam spade her voice went rough with emotion it was real blood pouring out of you my brother who turned a knife on you and you he reminded her youre not responsible for what he did and youre too smart to believe you are im trying to be she turned away for a moment until she had her courage in place if it had gone the other way if it had been you who died who else could i blame i came to you i brought this to you its my job he rose winced only a little are you going to have a problem with that what i do for a living the risks involved with it i havent thought that far she turned back faced him what youve done for me comes first ill never be able to repay you for a moment of it in an impatient movement he scooped the hair out of his face youre going to tick me off here bailey no im going to say what i have to say you believed me right from the first you took me into your home you bought me a hairbrush something so simple hundreds of others would have overlooked it you listened to me and promised to help you kept your promise and today it almost killed you his eyes went sharp do you want me to tell you id die for you i suppose i would would i kill for you without question youre not a fantasy to me bailey youre what made reality snap into place her heart fluttered into her throat and swelled he was angry with her again she noted his eyes were impatient in his bruised face his arm was bandaged from elbow to shoulder and had to be painful and he was hers without question for the taking i guess im trying to figure out why you want to be reasonable where reason doesnt fit its not a piece of the puzzle bailey its the whole puzzle frustrated he dragged a hand through his hair again love was the first star wasnt it and so is this that simple she realized that powerful pressing her lips together she took a step toward him im bailey james she began im twentyfive and live in washington dc im a gemologist im single she had to stop pace herself before she babbled im neat one of my closest friends says neatness is a religion to me and im afraid she may be right i like everything in its place i like to cook but dont often as i live alone i like old movies especially film noir he was grinning at her now but she shook her head there had to be more to her than that let me think she muttered impatient with herself i have a weakness for italian shoes id rather do without lunch for a month than a nice pair of pumps i like good clothes and antiques i prefer buying one good thing than several inferior ones that same friend calls me a retail snob and its true id rather go rockhounding than visit paris though i wouldnt mind doing both ill take you but she shook her head again im not finished i have flaws a lot of flaws sometimes i read very late into the night and fall asleep with the light on and the tv going well well have to fix that he stepped toward her but she stepped back held up a hand please i squint without my reading glasses and i hate wearing them because im vain so i squint quite a lot i didnt date much in college because i was shy and studious and boring my only sexual experience has come about recently is that so if youd shut up you could have another sexual experience im not done she said it sharply like a teacher chastising a rowdy student im good at my work i designed these rings ive always admired them youre so pretty when youre serious bailey ive got to get my hands on you im not without ambition she continued sidestepping his grab for her i intend to be successful in what i do and i like the idea of making a name for myself if youre going to make me chase you around the sofa at least give me a handicap ive got stitches i want to be important to someone i want to know i matter i want to have children and cook thanksgiving dinner i want you to understand that ive tried to be sensible about this because thats the way i am im precise and im practical and i can be very tedious ive never spent such a boring weekend in my entire life he said dryly i could barely keep my eyes open when she chuckled he outmaneuvered her and pulled her into his arms and swore as pain radiated straight up to his shoulder cade if youve opened those stitches youre so precise and practical you can sew me back up he lifted her chin with his fingers smiled are you finished yet no my life isnt going to be settled until mj and grace are back and i know theyre safe and the three stars are in the museum ill worry until then im very good at worrying but i believe you already know that ill write it down in case it slips my mind again now why dont you take me upstairs and play doctor theres one more thing when he rolled his eyes she drew in a breath i love you very much he went very still and the fingers on her chin tightened emotions poured through him sweet and potent as wine there might not be stars in her eyes he thought but her heart was in them and it belonged to him took you long enough to get to it i thought it was the best place to finish he kissed her for a long gentle time its a better place to start he murmured i love you cade she repeated and touched her lips to his again life starts now epilogue one star was out of his reach for the time being hed known the moment it was placed in the hands of the authorities he hadnt raged or cursed the gods he was after all a civilized man he had only sent his quivering messenger away with a single icy stare now he sat in his treasure room gliding his finger over the stem of a golden goblet filled with wine music poured liquidly through the air soothing him he adored mozart and gently followed the strains of the music with his hand the woman had caused him a great deal of trouble salvini had underestimated her had claimed she was nothing more than a token a pet of his late fathers with some brains of course and undeniable skill but no courage a quiet mouse of a woman hed been told who closed herself off with her rocks and minded her own business the mistake had been to trust salvinis estimation of bailey james but he wouldnt make that mistake again he chuckled to himself he wouldnt be required to as ms james and her protector had dealt so finally with timothy salvini and with that convenience there was nothing to link him with the stones with the deaths and nothing to stop him from completing his planwith some adjustments of course he could be flexible when it was necessary two stars were still free still lost or wandering he could see them if he closed his eyes pulsing with light waiting for him to take them unite them with the third embrace their power he would have them soon enough whoever stood in his way would be removed it was a pity really there had been no need for violence no need for a single drop of blood to be spilled but now that it had well he smiled to himself and drank deep of warm red wine blood he thought would have blood three women three stones three stars it was almost poetic he could appreciate the irony of it and when the golden triangle was complete when the three stars of mithra were his alone and he could stroke them as they sat on the altar he would think of the women whod tried to turn his destiny aside he would remember them with some fondness even admiration he hoped he could arrange for them all to die poetically the end
