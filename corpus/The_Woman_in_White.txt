the woman in white this is the story of what a womans patience can endure and what a mans resolution can achieve if the machinery of the law could be depended on to fathom every case of suspicion and to conduct every process of inquiry with moderate assistance only from the lubricating influences of oil of gold the events which fill these pages might have claimed their share of the public attention in a court of justice but the law is still in certain inevitable cases the preengaged servant of the long purse and the story is left to be told for the first time in this place as the judge might once have heard it so the reader shall hear it now no circumstance of importance from the beginning to the end of the disclosure shall be related on hearsay evidence when the writer of these introductory lines walter hartright by name happens to be more closely connected than others with the incidents to be recorded he will describe them in his own person when his experience fails he will retire from the position of narrator and his task will be continued from the point at which he has left it off by other persons who can speak to the circumstances under notice from their own knowledge just as clearly and positively as he has spoken before them thus the story here presented will be told by more than one pen as the story of an offence against the laws is told in court by more than one witness with the same object in both cases to present the truth always in its most direct and most intelligible aspect and to trace the course of one complete series of events by making the persons who have been most closely connected with them at each successive stage relate their own experience word for word let walter hartright teacher of drawing aged twentyeight years be heard first ii it was the last day of july the long hot summer was drawing to a close and we the weary pilgrims of the london pavement were beginning to think of the cloudshadows on the cornfields and the autumn breezes on the seashore for my own poor part the fading summer left me out of health out of spirits and if the truth must be told out of money as well during the past year i had not managed my professional resources as carefully as usual and my extravagance now limited me to the prospect of spending the autumn economically between my mothers cottage at hampstead and my own chambers in town the evening i remember was still and cloudy the london air was at its heaviest the distant hum of the streettraffic was at its faintest the small pulse of the life within me and the great heart of the city around me seemed to be sinking in unison languidly and more languidly with the sinking sun i roused myself from the book which i was dreaming over rather than reading and left my chambers to meet the cool night air in the suburbs it was one of the two evenings in every week which i was accustomed to spend with my mother and my sister so i turned my steps northward in the direction of hampstead events which i have yet to relate make it necessary to mention in this place that my father had been dead some years at the period of which i am now writing and that my sister sarah and i were the sole survivors of a family of five children my father was a drawingmaster before me his exertions had made him highly successful in his profession and his affectionate anxiety to provide for the future of those who were dependent on his labours had impelled him from the time of his marriage to devote to the insuring of his life a much larger portion of his income than most men consider it necessary to set aside for that purpose thanks to his admirable prudence and selfdenial my mother and sister were left after his death as independent of the world as they had been during his lifetime i succeeded to his connection and had every reason to feel grateful for the prospect that awaited me at my starting in life the quiet twilight was still trembling on the topmost ridges of the heath and the view of london below me had sunk into a black gulf in the shadow of the cloudy night when i stood before the gate of my mothers cottage i had hardly rung the bell before the house door was opened violently my worthy italian friend professor pesca appeared in the servants place and darted out joyously to receive me with a shrill foreign parody on an english cheer on his own account and i must be allowed to add on mine also the professor merits the honour of a formal introduction accident has made him the startingpoint of the strange family story which it is the purpose of these pages to unfold i had first become acquainted with my italian friend by meeting him at certain great houses where he taught his own language and i taught drawing all i then knew of the history of his life was that he had once held a situation in the university of padua that he had left italy for political reasons the nature of which he uniformly declined to mention to any one and that he had been for many years respectably established in london as a teacher of languages without being actually a dwarf for he was perfectly well proportioned from head to foot pesca was i think the smallest human being i ever saw out of a showroom remarkable anywhere by his personal appearance he was still further distinguished among the rank and file of mankind by the harmless eccentricity of his character the ruling idea of his life appeared to be that he was bound to show his gratitude to the country which had afforded him an asylum and a means of subsistence by doing his utmost to turn himself into an englishman not content with paying the nation in general the compliment of invariably carrying an umbrella and invariably wearing gaiters and a white hat the professor further aspired to become an englishman in his habits and amusements as well as in his personal appearance finding us distinguished as a nation by our love of athletic exercises the little man in the innocence of his heart devoted himself impromptu to all our english sports and pastimes whenever he had the opportunity of joining them firmly persuaded that he could adopt our national amusements of the field by an effort of will precisely as he had adopted our national gaiters and our national white hat i had seen him risk his limbs blindly at a foxhunt and in a cricketfield and soon afterwards i saw him risk his life just as blindly in the sea at brighton we had met there accidentally and were bathing together if we had been engaged in any exercise peculiar to my own nation i should of course have looked after pesca carefully but as foreigners are generally quite as well able to take care of themselves in the water as englishmen it never occurred to me that the art of swimming might merely add one more to the list of manly exercises which the professor believed that he could learn impromptu soon after we had both struck out from shore i stopped finding my friend did not gain on me and turned round to look for him to my horror and amazement i saw nothing between me and the beach but two little white arms which struggled for an instant above the surface of the water and then disappeared from view when i dived for him the poor little man was lying quietly coiled up at the bottom in a hollow of shingle looking by many degrees smaller than i had ever seen him look before during the few minutes that elapsed while i was taking him in the air revived him and he ascended the steps of the machine with my assistance with the partial recovery of his animation came the return of his wonderful delusion on the subject of swimming as soon as his chattering teeth would let him speak he smiled vacantly and said he thought it must have been the cramp when he had thoroughly recovered himself and had joined me on the beach his warm southern nature broke through all artificial english restraints in a moment he overwhelmed me with the wildest expressions of affection exclaimed passionately in his exaggerated italian way that he would hold his life henceforth at my disposal and declared that he should never be happy again until he had found an opportunity of proving his gratitude by rendering me some service which i might remember on my side to the end of my days i did my best to stop the torrent of his tears and protestations by persisting in treating the whole adventure as a good subject for a joke and succeeded at last as i imagined in lessening pescas overwhelming sense of obligation to me little did i think then little did i think afterwards when our pleasant holiday had drawn to an end that the opportunity of serving me for which my grateful companion so ardently longed was soon to come that he was eagerly to seize it on the instant and that by so doing he was to turn the whole current of my existence into a new channel and to alter me to myself almost past recognition yet so it was if i had not dived for professor pesca when he lay under water on his shingle bed i should in all human probability never have been connected with the story which these pages will relate i should never perhaps have heard even the name of the woman who has lived in all my thoughts who has possessed herself of all my energies who has become the one guiding influence that now directs the purpose of my life iii pescas face and manner on the evening when we confronted each other at my mothers gate were more than sufficient to inform me that something extraordinary had happened it was quite useless however to ask him for an immediate explanation i could only conjecture while he was dragging me in by both hands that knowing my habits he had come to the cottage to make sure of meeting me that night and that he had some news to tell of an unusually agreeable kind we both bounced into the parlour in a highly abrupt and undignified manner my mother sat by the open window laughing and fanning herself pesca was one of her especial favourites and his wildest eccentricities were always pardonable in her eyes poor dear soul from the first moment when she found out that the little professor was deeply and gratefully attached to her son she opened her heart to him unreservedly and took all his puzzling foreign peculiarities for granted without so much as attempting to understand any one of them my sister sarah with all the advantages of youth was strangely enough less pliable she did full justice to pescas excellent qualities of heart but she could not accept him implicitly as my mother accepted him for my sake her insular notions of propriety rose in perpetual revolt against pescas constitutional contempt for appearances and she was always more or less undisguisedly astonished at her mothers familiarity with the eccentric little foreigner i have observed not only in my sisters case but in the instances of others that we of the young generation are nothing like so hearty and so impulsive as some of our elders i constantly see old people flushed and excited by the prospect of some anticipated pleasure which altogether fails to ruffle the tranquillity of their serene grandchildren are we i wonder quite such genuine boys and girls now as our seniors were in their time has the great advance in education taken rather too long a stride and are we in these modern days just the least trifle in the world too well brought up without attempting to answer those questions decisively i may at least record that i never saw my mother and my sister together in pescas society without finding my mother much the younger woman of the two on this occasion for example while the old lady was laughing heartily over the boyish manner in which we tumbled into the parlour sarah was perturbedly picking up the broken pieces of a teacup which the professor had knocked off the table in his precipitate advance to meet me at the door i dont know what would have happened walter said my mother if you had delayed much longer pesca has been half mad with impatience and i have been half mad with curiosity the professor has brought some wonderful news with him in which he says you are concerned and he has cruelly refused to give us the smallest hint of it till his friend walter appeared very provoking it spoils the set murmured sarah to herself mournfully absorbed over the ruins of the broken cup while these words were being spoken pesca happily and fussily unconscious of the irreparable wrong which the crockery had suffered at his hands was dragging a large armchair to the opposite end of the room so as to command us all three in the character of a public speaker addressing an audience having turned the chair with its back towards us he jumped into it on his knees and excitedly addressed his small congregation of three from an impromptu pulpit now my good dears began pesca who always said good dears when he meant worthy friends listen to me the time has come i recite my good news i speak at last hear hear said my mother humouring the joke the next thing he will break mamma whispered sarah will be the back of the best armchair i go back into my life and i address myself to the noblest of created beings continued pesca vehemently apostrophising my unworthy self over the top rail of the chair who found me dead at the bottom of the sea through cramp and who pulled me up to the top and what did i say when i got into my own life and my own clothes again much more than was at all necessary i answered as doggedly as possible for the least encouragement in connection with this subject invariably let loose the professors emotions in a flood of tears i said persisted pesca that my life belonged to my dear friend walter for the rest of my days and so it does i said that i should never be happy again till i had found the opportunity of doing a good something for walter and i have never been contented with myself till this most blessed day now cried the enthusiastic little man at the top of his voice the overflowing happiness bursts out of me at every pore of my skin like a perspiration for on my faith and soul and honour the something is done at last and the only word to say now is right allright it may be necessary to explain here that pesca prided himself on being a perfect englishman in his language as well as in his dress manners and amusements having picked up a few of our most familiar colloquial expressions he scattered them about over his conversation whenever they happened to occur to him turning them in his high relish for their sound and his general ignorance of their sense into compound words and repetitions of his own and always running them into each other as if they consisted of one long syllable among the fine london houses where i teach the language of my native country said the professor rushing into his long deferred explanation without another word of preface there is one mighty fine in the big place called portland you all know where that is yes yes courseofcourse the fine house my good dears has got inside it a fine family a mamma fair and fat three young misses fair and fat two young misters fair and fat and a papa the fairest and the fattest of all who is a mighty merchant up to his eyes in gold a fine man once but seeing that he has got a naked head and two chins fine no longer at the present time now mind i teach the sublime dante to the young misses and ah mysoulblessmysoul it is not in human language to say how the sublime dante puzzles the pretty heads of all three no matter all in good time and the more lessons the better for me now mind imagine to yourselves that i am teaching the young misses today as usual we are all four of us down together in the hell of dante at the seventh circle but no matter for that all the circles are alike to the three young misses fair and fat at the seventh circle nevertheless my pupils are sticking fast and i to set them going again recite explain and blow myself up redhot with useless enthusiasm when a creak of boots in the passage outside and in comes the golden papa the mighty merchant with the naked head and the two chins ha my good dears i am closer than you think for to the business now have you been patient so far or have you said to yourselves deucewhatthedeuce pesca is longwinded tonight we declared that we were deeply interested the professor went on in his hand the golden papa has a letter and after he has made his excuse for disturbing us in our infernal region with the common mortal business of the house he addresses himself to the three young misses and begins as you english begin everything in this blessed world that you have to say with a great o o my dears says the mighty merchant i have got here a letter from my friend mrthe name has slipped out of my mind but no matter we shall come back to that yes yes rightallright so the papa says i have got a letter from my friend the mister and he wants a recommend from me of a drawingmaster to go down to his house in the country mysoulblessmysoul when i heard the golden papa say those words if i had been big enough to reach up to him i should have put my arms round his neck and pressed him to my bosom in a long and grateful hug as it was i only bounced upon my chair my seat was on thorns and my soul was on fire to speak but i held my tongue and let papa go on perhaps you know says this good man of money twiddling his friends letter this way and that in his golden fingers and thumbs perhaps you know my dears of a drawingmaster that i can recommend the three young misses all look at each other and then say with the indispensable great o to begin o dear no papa but here is mr pesca at the mention of myself i can hold no longer the thought of you my good dears mounts like blood to my head i start from my seat as if a spike had grown up from the ground through the bottom of my chair i address myself to the mighty merchant and i say english phrase dear sir i have the man the first and foremost drawingmaster of the world recommend him by the post tonight and send him off bag and baggage english phrase again ha send him off bag and baggage by the train tomorrow stop stop says papa is he a foreigner or an englishman english to the bone of his back i answer respectable says papa sir i say for this last question of his outrages me and i have done being familiar with him sir the immortal fire of genius burns in this englishmans bosom and what is more his father had it before him never mind says the golden barbarian of a papa never mind about his genius mr pesca we dont want genius in this country unless it is accompanied by respectability and then we are very glad to have it very glad indeed can your friend produce testimonials letters that speak to his character i wave my hand negligently letters i say ha mysoulblessmysoul i should think so indeed volumes of letters and portfolios of testimonials if you like one or two will do says this man of phlegm and money let him send them to me with his name and address and stop stop mr pesca before you go to your friend you had better take a note banknote i say indignantly no banknote if you please till my brave englishman has earned it first bank note says papa in a great surprise who talked of banknote i mean a note of the terms a memorandum of what he is expected to do go on with your lesson mr pesca and i will give you the necessary extract from my friends letter down sits the man of merchandise and money to his pen ink and paper and down i go once again into the hell of dante with my three young misses after me in ten minutes time the note is written and the boots of papa are creaking themselves away in the passage outside from that moment on my faith and soul and honour i know nothing more the glorious thought that i have caught my opportunity at last and that my grateful service for my dearest friend in the world is as good as done already flies up into my head and makes me drunk how i pull my young misses and myself out of our infernal region again how my other business is done afterwards how my little bit of dinner slides itself down my throat i know no more than a man in the moon enough for me that here i am with the mighty merchants note in my hand as large as life as hot as fire and as happy as a king ha ha ha rightright rightallright here the professor waved the memorandum of terms over his head and ended his long and voluble narrative with his shrill italian parody on an english cheer my mother rose the moment he had done with flushed cheeks and brightened eyes she caught the little man warmly by both hands my dear good pesca she said i never doubted your true affection for walter but i am more than ever persuaded of it now i am sure we are very much obliged to professor pesca for walters sake added sarah she half rose while she spoke as if to approach the armchair in her turn but observing that pesca was rapturously kissing my mothers hands looked serious and resumed her seat if the familiar little man treats my mother in that way how will he treat me faces sometimes tell truth and that was unquestionably the thought in sarahs mind as she sat down again although i myself was gratefully sensible of the kindness of pescas motives my spirits were hardly so much elevated as they ought to have been by the prospect of future employment now placed before me when the professor had quite done with my mothers hand and when i had warmly thanked him for his interference on my behalf i asked to be allowed to look at the note of terms which his respectable patron had drawn up for my inspection pesca handed me the paper with a triumphant flourish of the hand read said the little man majestically i promise you my friend the writing of the golden papa speaks with a tongue of trumpets for itself the note of terms was plain straightforward and comprehensive at any rate it informed me first that frederick fairlie esquire of limmeridge house cumberland wanted to engage the services of a thoroughly competent drawingmaster for a period of four months certain secondly that the duties which the master was expected to perform would be of a twofold kind he was to superintend the instruction of two young ladies in the art of painting in watercolours and he was to devote his leisure time afterwards to the business of repairing and mounting a valuable collection of drawings which had been suffered to fall into a condition of total neglect thirdly that the terms offered to the person who should undertake and properly perform these duties were four guineas a week that he was to reside at limmeridge house and that he was to be treated there on the footing of a gentleman fourthly and lastly that no person need think of applying for this situation unless he could furnish the most unexceptionable references to character and abilities the references were to be sent to mr fairlies friend in london who was empowered to conclude all necessary arrangements these instructions were followed by the name and address of pescas employer in portland place and there the note or memorandum ended the prospect which this offer of an engagement held out was certainly an attractive one the employment was likely to be both easy and agreeable it was proposed to me at the autumn time of the year when i was least occupied and the terms judging by my personal experience in my profession were surprisingly liberal i knew this i knew that i ought to consider myself very fortunate if i succeeded in securing the offered employment and yet no sooner had i read the memorandum than i felt an inexplicable unwillingness within me to stir in the matter i had never in the whole of my previous experience found my duty and my inclination so painfully and so unaccountably at variance as i found them now oh walter your father never had such a chance as this said my mother when she had read the note of terms and had handed it back to me such distinguished people to know remarked sarah straightening herself in the chair and on such gratifying terms of equality too yes yes the terms in every sense are tempting enough i replied impatiently but before i send in my testimonials i should like a little time to consider consider exclaimed my mother why walter what is the matter with you consider echoed my sister what a very extraordinary thing to say under the circumstances consider chimed in the professor what is there to consider about answer me this have you not been complaining of your health and have you not been longing for what you call a smack of the country breeze well there in your hand is the paper that offers you perpetual choking mouthfuls of country breeze for four months time is it not so ha again you want money well is four golden guineas a week nothing mysoulblessmysoul only give it to me and my boots shall creak like the golden papas with a sense of the overpowering richness of the man who walks in them four guineas a week and more than that the charming society of two young misses and more than that your bed your breakfast your dinner your gorging english teas and lunches and drinks of foaming beer all for nothing why walter my dear good friend deucewhatthedeuce for the first time in my life i have not eyes enough in my head to look and wonder at you neither my mothers evident astonishment at my behaviour nor pescas fervid enumeration of the advantages offered to me by the new employment had any effect in shaking my unreasonable disinclination to go to limmeridge house after starting all the petty objections that i could think of to going to cumberland and after hearing them answered one after another to my own complete discomfiture i tried to set up a last obstacle by asking what was to become of my pupils in london while i was teaching mr fairlies young ladies to sketch from nature the obvious answer to this was that the greater part of them would be away on their autumn travels and that the few who remained at home might be confided to the care of one of my brother drawingmasters whose pupils i had once taken off his hands under similar circumstances my sister reminded me that this gentleman had expressly placed his services at my disposal during the present season in case i wished to leave town my mother seriously appealed to me not to let an idle caprice stand in the way of my own interests and my own health and pesca piteously entreated that i would not wound him to the heart by rejecting the first grateful offer of service that he had been able to make to the friend who had saved his life the evident sincerity and affection which inspired these remonstrances would have influenced any man with an atom of good feeling in his composition though i could not conquer my own unaccountable perversity i had at least virtue enough to be heartily ashamed of it and to end the discussion pleasantly by giving way and promising to do all that was wanted of me the rest of the evening passed merrily enough in humorous anticipations of my coming life with the two young ladies in cumberland pesca inspired by our national grog which appeared to get into his head in the most marvellous manner five minutes after it had gone down his throat asserted his claims to be considered a complete englishman by making a series of speeches in rapid succession proposing my mothers health my sisters health my health and the healths in mass of mr fairlie and the two young misses pathetically returning thanks himself immediately afterwards for the whole party a secret walter said my little friend confidentially as we walked home together i am flushed by the recollection of my own eloquence my soul bursts itself with ambition one of these days i go into your noble parliament it is the dream of my whole life to be honourable pesca mp the next morning i sent my testimonials to the professors employer in portland place three days passed and i concluded with secret satisfaction that my papers had not been found sufficiently explicit on the fourth day however an answer came it announced that mr fairlie accepted my services and requested me to start for cumberland immediately all the necessary instructions for my journey were carefully and clearly added in a postscript i made my arrangements unwillingly enough for leaving london early the next day towards evening pesca looked in on his way to a dinnerparty to bid me goodbye i shall dry my tears in your absence said the professor gaily with this glorious thought it is my auspicious hand that has given the first push to your fortune in the world go my friend when your sun shines in cumberland english proverb in the name of heaven make your hay marry one of the two young misses become honourable hartright mp and when you are on the top of the ladder remember that pesca at the bottom has done it all i tried to laugh with my little friend over his parting jest but my spirits were not to be commanded something jarred in me almost painfully while he was speaking his light farewell words when i was left alone again nothing remained to be done but to walk to the hampstead cottage and bid my mother and sarah good bye iv the heat had been painfully oppressive all day and it was now a close and sultry night my mother and sister had spoken so many last words and had begged me to wait another five minutes so many times that it was nearly midnight when the servant locked the gardengate behind me i walked forward a few paces on the shortest way back to london then stopped and hesitated the moon was full and broad in the dark blue starless sky and the broken ground of the heath looked wild enough in the mysterious light to be hundreds of miles away from the great city that lay beneath it the idea of descending any sooner than i could help into the heat and gloom of london repelled me the prospect of going to bed in my airless chambers and the prospect of gradual suffocation seemed in my present restless frame of mind and body to be one and the same thing i determined to stroll home in the purer air by the most roundabout way i could take to follow the white winding paths across the lonely heath and to approach london through its most open suburb by striking into the finchley road and so getting back in the cool of the new morning by the western side of the regents park i wound my way down slowly over the heath enjoying the divine stillness of the scene and admiring the soft alternations of light and shade as they followed each other over the broken ground on every side of me so long as i was proceeding through this first and prettiest part of my night walk my mind remained passively open to the impressions produced by the view and i thought but little on any subject indeed so far as my own sensations were concerned i can hardly say that i thought at all but when i had left the heath and had turned into the byroad where there was less to see the ideas naturally engendered by the approaching change in my habits and occupations gradually drew more and more of my attention exclusively to themselves by the time i had arrived at the end of the road i had become completely absorbed in my own fanciful visions of limmeridge house of mr fairlie and of the two ladies whose practice in the art of water colour painting i was so soon to superintend i had now arrived at that particular point of my walk where four roads met the road to hampstead along which i had returned the road to finchley the road to west end and the road back to london i had mechanically turned in this latter direction and was strolling along the lonely highroad idly wondering i remember what the cumberland young ladies would look like when in one moment every drop of blood in my body was brought to a stop by the touch of a hand laid lightly and suddenly on my shoulder from behind me i turned on the instant with my fingers tightening round the handle of my stick there in the middle of the broad bright highroad there as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven stood the figure of a solitary woman dressed from head to foot in white garments her face bent in grave inquiry on mine her hand pointing to the dark cloud over london as i faced her i was far too seriously startled by the suddenness with which this extraordinary apparition stood before me in the dead of night and in that lonely place to ask what she wanted the strange woman spoke first is that the road to london she said i looked attentively at her as she put that singular question to me it was then nearly one oclock all i could discern distinctly by the moonlight was a colourless youthful face meagre and sharp to look at about the cheeks and chin large grave wistfully attentive eyes nervous uncertain lips and light hair of a pale brownishyellow hue there was nothing wild nothing immodest in her manner it was quiet and self controlled a little melancholy and a little touched by suspicion not exactly the manner of a lady and at the same time not the manner of a woman in the humblest rank of life the voice little as i had yet heard of it had something curiously still and mechanical in its tones and the utterance was remarkably rapid she held a small bag in her hand and her dress bonnet shawl and gown all of white was so far as i could guess certainly not composed of very delicate or very expensive materials her figure was slight and rather above the average height her gait and actions free from the slightest approach to extravagance this was all that i could observe of her in the dim light and under the perplexingly strange circumstances of our meeting what sort of a woman she was and how she came to be out alone in the highroad an hour after midnight i altogether failed to guess the one thing of which i felt certain was that the grossest of mankind could not have misconstrued her motive in speaking even at that suspiciously late hour and in that suspiciously lonely place did you hear me she said still quietly and rapidly and without the least fretfulness or impatience i asked if that was the way to london yes i replied that is the way it leads to st johns wood and the regents park you must excuse my not answering you before i was rather startled by your sudden appearance in the road and i am even now quite unable to account for it you dont suspect me of doing anything wrong do you have done nothing wrong i have met with an accident i am very unfortunate in being here alone so late why do you suspect me of doing wrong she spoke with unnecessary earnestness and agitation and shrank back from me several paces i did my best to reassure her pray dont suppose that i have any idea of suspecting you i said or any other wish than to be of assistance to you if i can i only wondered at your appearance in the road because it seemed to me to be empty the instant before i saw you she turned and pointed back to a place at the junction of the road to london and the road to hampstead where there was a gap in the hedge i heard you coming she said and hid there to see what sort of man you were before i risked speaking i doubted and feared about it till you passed and then i was obliged to steal after you and touch you steal after me and touch me why not call to me strange to say the least of it may i trust you she asked you dont think the worse of me because i have met with an accident she stopped in confusion shifted her bag from one hand to the other and sighed bitterly the loneliness and helplessness of the woman touched me the natural impulse to assist her and to spare her got the better of the judgment the caution the worldly tact which an older wiser and colder man might have summoned to help him in this strange emergency you may trust me for any harmless purpose i said if it troubles you to explain your strange situation to me dont think of returning to the subject again i have no right to ask you for any explanations tell me how i can help you and if i can i will you are very kind and i am very very thankful to have met you the first touch of womanly tenderness that i had heard from her trembled in her voice as she said the words but no tears glistened in those large wistfully attentive eyes of hers which were still fixed on me i have only been in london once before she went on more and more rapidly and i know nothing about that side of it yonder can i get a fly or a carriage of any kind is it too late i dont know if you could show me where to get a fly and if you will only promise not to interfere with me and to let me leave you when and how i please i have a friend in london who will be glad to receive me i want nothing else will you promise she looked anxiously up and down the road shifted her bag again from one hand to the other repeated the words will you promise and looked hard in my face with a pleading fear and confusion that it troubled me to see what could i do here was a stranger utterly and helplessly at my mercy and that stranger a forlorn woman no house was near no one was passing whom i could consult and no earthly right existed on my part to give me a power of control over her even if i had known how to exercise it i trace these lines self distrustfully with the shadows of afterevents darkening the very paper i write on and still i say what could i do what i did do was to try and gain time by questioning her are you sure that your friend in london will receive you at such a late hour as this i said quite sure only say you will let me leave you when and how i please only say you wont interfere with me will you promise as she repeated the words for the third time she came close to me and laid her hand with a sudden gentle stealthiness on my bosom a thin hand a cold hand when i removed it with mine even on that sultry night remember that i was young remember that the hand which touched me was a womans will you promise yes one word the little familiar word that is on everybodys lips every hour in the day oh me and i tremble now when i write it we set our faces towards london and walked on together in the first still hour of the new day i and this woman whose name whose character whose story whose objects in life whose very presence by my side at that moment were fathomless mysteries to me it was like a dream was i walter hartright was this the wellknown uneventful road where holiday people strolled on sundays had i really left little more than an hour since the quiet decent conventionally domestic atmosphere of my mothers cottage i was too bewildered too conscious also of a vague sense of something like selfreproach to speak to my strange companion for some minutes it was her voice again that first broke the silence between us i want to ask you something she said suddenly do you know many people in london yes a great many many men of rank and title there was an unmistakable tone of suspicion in the strange question i hesitated about answering it some i said after a moments silence many she came to a full stop and looked me searchingly in the face many men of the rank of baronet too much astonished to reply i questioned her in my turn why do you ask because i hope for my own sake there is one baronet that you dont know will you tell me his name i cant i darent i forget myself when i mention it she spoke loudly and almost fiercely raised her clenched hand in the air and shook it passionately then on a sudden controlled herself again and added in tones lowered to a whisper tell me which of them you know i could hardly refuse to humour her in such a trifle and i mentioned three names two the names of fathers of families whose daughters i taught one the name of a bachelor who had once taken me a cruise in his yacht to make sketches for him ah you dont know him she said with a sigh of relief are you a man of rank and title yourself far from it i am only a drawingmaster as the reply passed my lips a little bitterly perhaps she took my arm with the abruptness which characterised all her actions not a man of rank and title she repeated to herself thank god i may trust him i had hitherto contrived to master my curiosity out of consideration for my companion but it got the better of me now i am afraid you have serious reason to complain of some man of rank and title i said i am afraid the baronet whose name you are unwilling to mention to me has done you some grievous wrong is he the cause of your being out here at this strange time of night dont ask me dont make me talk of it she answered im not fit now i have been cruelly used and cruelly wronged you will be kinder than ever if you will walk on fast and not speak to me i sadly want to quiet myself if i can we moved forward again at a quick pace and for half an hour at least not a word passed on either side from time to time being forbidden to make any more inquiries i stole a look at her face it was always the same the lips close shut the brow frowning the eyes looking straight forward eagerly and yet absently we had reached the first houses and were close on the new wesleyan college before her set features relaxed and she spoke once more do you live in london she said yes as i answered it struck me that she might have formed some intention of appealing to me for assistance or advice and that i ought to spare her a possible disappointment by warning her of my approaching absence from home so i added but tomorrow i shall be away from london for some time i am going into the country where she asked north or south north to cumberland cumberland she repeated the word tenderly ah wish i was going there too i was once happy in cumberland i tried again to lift the veil that hung between this woman and me perhaps you were born i said in the beautiful lake country no she answered i was born in hampshire but i once went to school for a little while in cumberland lakes i dont remember any lakes its limmeridge village and limmeridge house i should like to see again it was my turn now to stop suddenly in the excited state of my curiosity at that moment the chance reference to mr fairlies place of residence on the lips of my strange companion staggered me with astonishment did you hear anybody calling after us she asked looking up and down the road affrightedly the instant i stopped no no i was only struck by the name of limmeridge house i heard it mentioned by some cumberland people a few days since ah not my people mrs fairlie is dead and her husband is dead and their little girl may be married and gone away by this time i cant say who lives at limmeridge now if any more are left there of that name i only know i love them for mrs fairlies sake she seemed about to say more but while she was speaking we came within view of the turnpike at the top of the avenue road her hand tightened round my arm and she looked anxiously at the gate before us is the turnpike man looking out she asked he was not looking out no one else was near the place when we passed through the gate the sight of the gaslamps and houses seemed to agitate her and to make her impatient this is london she said do you see any carriage i can get i am tired and frightened i want to shut myself in and be driven away i explained to her that we must walk a little further to get to a cabstand unless we were fortunate enough to meet with an empty vehicle and then tried to resume the subject of cumberland it was useless that idea of shutting herself in and being driven away had now got full possession of her mind she could think and talk of nothing else we had hardly proceeded a third of the way down the avenue road when i saw a cab draw up at a house a few doors below us on the opposite side of the way a gentleman got out and let himself in at the garden door i hailed the cab as the driver mounted the box again when we crossed the road my companions impatience increased to such an extent that she almost forced me to run its so late she said i am only in a hurry because its so late i cant take you sir if youre not going towards tottenham court road said the driver civilly when i opened the cab door my horse is dead beat and i cant get him no further than the stable yes yes that will do for me im going that way im going that way she spoke with breathless eagerness and pressed by me into the cab i had assured myself that the man was sober as well as civil before i let her enter the vehicle and now when she was seated inside i entreated her to let me see her set down safely at her destination no no no she said vehemently im quite safe and quite happy now if you are a gentleman remember your promise let him drive on till i stop him thank you oh thank you thank you my hand was on the cab door she caught it in hers kissed it and pushed it away the cab drove off at the same moment i started into the road with some vague idea of stopping it again i hardly knew why hesitated from dread of frightening and distressing her called at last but not loudly enough to attract the drivers attention the sound of the wheels grew fainter in the distance the cab melted into the black shadows on the road the woman in white was gone ten minutes or more had passed i was still on the same side of the way now mechanically walking forward a few paces now stopping again absently at one moment i found myself doubting the reality of my own adventure at another i was perplexed and distressed by an uneasy sense of having done wrong which yet left me confusedly ignorant of how i could have done right i hardly knew where i was going or what i meant to do next i was conscious of nothing but the confusion of my own thoughts when i was abruptly recalled to myself awakened i might almost say by the sound of rapidly approaching wheels close behind me i was on the dark side of the road in the thick shadow of some garden trees when i stopped to look round on the opposite and lighter side of the way a short distance below me a policeman was strolling along in the direction of the regents park the carriage passed me an open chaise driven by two men stop cried one theres a policeman lets ask him the horse was instantly pulled up a few yards beyond the dark place where i stood policeman cried the first speaker have you seen a woman pass this way what sort of woman sir a woman in a lavendercoloured gown no no interposed the second man the clothes we gave her were found on her bed she must have gone away in the clothes she wore when she came to us in white policeman a woman in white i havent seen her sir if you or any of your men meet with the woman stop her and send her in careful keeping to that address ill pay all expenses and a fair reward into the bargain the policeman looked at the card that was handed down to him why are we to stop her sir what has she done done she has escaped from my asylum dont forget a woman in white drive on v she has escaped from my asylum i cannot say with truth that the terrible inference which those words suggested flashed upon me like a new revelation some of the strange questions put to me by the woman in white after my illconsidered promise to leave her free to act as she pleased had suggested the conclusion either that she was naturally flighty and unsettled or that some recent shock of terror had disturbed the balance of her faculties but the idea of absolute insanity which we all associate with the very name of an asylum had i can honestly declare never occurred to me in connection with her i had seen nothing in her language or her actions to justify it at the time and even with the new light thrown on her by the words which the stranger had addressed to the policeman i could see nothing to justify it now what had i done assisted the victim of the most horrible of all false imprisonments to escape or cast loose on the wide world of london an unfortunate creature whose actions it was my duty and every mans duty mercifully to control i turned sick at heart when the question occurred to me and when i felt self reproachfully that it was asked too late in the disturbed state of my mind it was useless to think of going to bed when i at last got back to my chambers in clements inn before many hours elapsed it would be necessary to start on my journey to cumberland i sat down and tried first to sketch then to read but the woman in white got between me and my pencil between me and my book had the forlorn creature come to any harm that was my first thought though i shrank selfishly from confronting it other thoughts followed on which it was less harrowing to dwell where had she stopped the cab what had become of her now had she been traced and captured by the men in the chaise or was she still capable of controlling her own actions and were we two following our widely parted roads towards one point in the mysterious future at which we were to meet once more it was a relief when the hour came to lock my door to bid farewell to london pursuits london pupils and london friends and to be in movement again towards new interests and a new life even the bustle and confusion at the railway terminus so wearisome and bewildering at other times roused me and did me good my travelling instructions directed me to go to carlisle and then to diverge by a branch railway which ran in the direction of the coast as a misfortune to begin with our engine broke down between lancaster and carlisle the delay occasioned by this accident caused me to be too late for the branch train by which i was to have gone on immediately i had to wait some hours and when a later train finally deposited me at the nearest station to limmeridge house it was past ten and the night was so dark that i could hardly see my way to the ponychaise which mr fairlie had ordered to be in waiting for me the driver was evidently discomposed by the lateness of my arrival he was in that state of highly respectful sulkiness which is peculiar to english servants we drove away slowly through the darkness in perfect silence the roads were bad and the dense obscurity of the night increased the difficulty of getting over the ground quickly it was by my watch nearly an hour and a half from the time of our leaving the station before i heard the sound of the sea in the distance and the crunch of our wheels on a smooth gravel drive we had passed one gate before entering the drive and we passed another before we drew up at the house i was received by a solemn manservant out of livery was informed that the family had retired for the night and was then led into a large and lofty room where my supper was awaiting me in a forlorn manner at one extremity of a lonesome mahogany wilderness of diningtable i was too tired and out of spirits to eat or drink much especially with the solemn servant waiting on me as elaborately as if a small dinner party had arrived at the house instead of a solitary man in a quarter of an hour i was ready to be taken up to my bedchamber the solemn servant conducted me into a prettily furnished room said breakfast at nine oclock sir looked all round him to see that everything was in its proper place and noiselessly withdrew what shall i see in my dreams tonight i thought to myself as i put out the candle the woman in white or the unknown inhabitants of this cumberland mansion it was a strange sensation to be sleeping in the house like a friend of the family and yet not to know one of the inmates even by sight vi when i rose the next morning and drew up my blind the sea opened before me joyously under the broad august sunlight and the distant coast of scotland fringed the horizon with its lines of melting blue the view was such a surprise and such a change to me after my weary london experience of brick and mortar landscape that i seemed to burst into a new life and a new set of thoughts the moment i looked at it a confused sensation of having suddenly lost my familiarity with the past without acquiring any additional clearness of idea in reference to the present or the future took possession of my mind circumstances that were but a few days old faded back in my memory as if they had happened months and months since pescas quaint announcement of the means by which he had procured me my present employment the farewell evening i had passed with my mother and sister even my mysterious adventure on the way home from hampstead had all become like events which might have occurred at some former epoch of my existence although the woman in white was still in my mind the image of her seemed to have grown dull and faint already a little before nine oclock i descended to the groundfloor of the house the solemn manservant of the night before met me wandering among the passages and compassionately showed me the way to the breakfastroom my first glance round me as the man opened the door disclosed a wellfurnished breakfasttable standing in the middle of a long room with many windows in it i looked from the table to the window farthest from me and saw a lady standing at it with her back turned towards me the instant my eyes rested on her i was struck by the rare beauty of her form and by the unaffected grace of her attitude her figure was tall yet not too tall comely and welldeveloped yet not fat her head set on her shoulders with an easy pliant firmness her waist perfection in the eyes of a man for it occupied its natural place it filled out its natural circle it was visibly and delightfully undeformed by stays she had not heard my entrance into the room and i allowed myself the luxury of admiring her for a few moments before i moved one of the chairs near me as the least embarrassing means of attracting her attention she turned towards me immediately the easy elegance of every movement of her limbs and body as soon as she began to advance from the far end of the room set me in a flutter of expectation to see her face clearly she left the window and i said to myself the lady is dark she moved forward a few steps and i said to myself the lady is young she approached nearer and i said to myself with a sense of surprise which words fail me to express the lady is ugly never was the old conventional maxim that nature cannot err more flatly contradicted never was the fair promise of a lovely figure more strangely and startlingly belied by the face and head that crowned it the ladys complexion was almost swarthy and the dark down on her upper lip was almost a moustache she had a large firm masculine mouth and jaw prominent piercing resolute brown eyes and thick coalblack hair growing unusually low down on her forehead her expression bright frank and intelligent appeared while she was silent to be altogether wanting in those feminine attractions of gentleness and pliability without which the beauty of the handsomest woman alive is beauty incomplete to see such a face as this set on shoulders that a sculptor would have longed to model to be charmed by the modest graces of action through which the symmetrical limbs betrayed their beauty when they moved and then to be almost repelled by the masculine form and masculine look of the features in which the perfectly shaped figure ended was to feel a sensation oddly akin to the helpless discomfort familiar to us all in sleep when we recognise yet cannot reconcile the anomalies and contradictions of a dream mr hartright said the lady interrogatively her dark face lighting up with a smile and softening and growing womanly the moment she began to speak we resigned all hope of you last night and went to bed as usual accept my apologies for our apparent want of attention and allow me to introduce myself as one of your pupils shall we shake hands i suppose we must come to it sooner or later and why not sooner these odd words of welcome were spoken in a clear ringing pleasant voice the offered hand rather large but beautifully formed was given to me with the easy unaffected selfreliance of a highlybred woman we sat down together at the breakfasttable in as cordial and customary a manner as if we had known each other for years and had met at limmeridge house to talk over old times by previous appointment i hope you come here goodhumouredly determined to make the best of your position continued the lady you will have to begin this morning by putting up with no other company at breakfast than mine my sister is in her own room nursing that essentially feminine malady a slight headache and her old governness mrs vesey is charitably attending on her with restorative tea my uncle mr fairlie never joins us at any of our meals he is an invalid and keeps bachelor state in his own apartments there is nobody else in the house but me two young ladies have been staying here but they went away yesterday in despair and no wonder all through their visit in consequence of mr fairlies invalid condition we produced no such convenience in the house as a flirtable danceable smalltalkable creature of the male sex and the consequence was we did nothing but quarrel especially at dinnertime how can you expect four women to dine together alone every day and not quarrel we are such fools we cant entertain each other at table you see i dont think much of my own sex mr hartright which will you have tea or coffee no woman does think much of her own sex although few of them confess it as freely as i do dear me you look puzzled why are you wondering what you will have for breakfast or are you surprised at my careless way of talking in the first case i advise you as a friend to have nothing to do with that cold ham at your elbow and to wait till the omelette comes in in the second case i will give you some tea to compose your spirits and do all a woman can which is very little bythebye to hold my tongue she handed me my cup of tea laughing gaily her light flow of talk and her lively familiarity of manner with a total stranger were accompanied by an unaffected naturalness and an easy inborn confidence in herself and her position which would have secured her the respect of the most audacious man breathing while it was impossible to be formal and reserved in her company it was more than impossible to take the faintest vestige of a liberty with her even in thought i felt this instinctively even while i caught the infection of her own bright gaiety of spirits even while i did my best to answer her in her own frank lively way yes yes she said when i had suggested the only explanation i could offer to account for my perplexed looks i understand you are such a perfect stranger in the house that you are puzzled by my familiar references to the worthy inhabitants natural enough i ought to have thought of it before at any rate i can set it right now suppose i begin with myself so as to get done with that part of the subject as soon as possible my name is marian halcombe and i am as inaccurate as women usually are in calling mr fairlie my uncle and miss fairlie my sister my mother was twice married the first time to mr halcombe my father the second time to mr fairlie my halfsisters father except that we are both orphans we are in every respect as unlike each other as possible my father was a poor man and miss fairlies father was a rich man i have got nothing and she has a fortune i am dark and ugly and she is fair and pretty everybody thinks me crabbed and odd with perfect justice and everybody thinks her sweettempered and charming with more justice still in short she is an angel and i am try some of that marmalade mr hartright and finish the sentence in the name of female propriety for yourself what am i to tell you about mr fairlie upon my honour i hardly know he is sure to send for you after breakfast and you can study him for yourself in the meantime i may inform you first that he is the late mr fairlies younger brother secondly that he is a single man and thirdly that he is miss fairlies guardian i wont live without her and she cant live without me and that is how i come to be at limmeridge house my sister and i are honestly fond of each other which you will say is perfectly unaccountable under the circumstances and i quite agree with you but so it is you must please both of us mr hartright or please neither of us and what is still more trying you will be thrown entirely upon our society mrs vesey is an excellent person who possesses all the cardinal virtues and counts for nothing and mr fairlie is too great an invalid to be a companion for anybody i dont know what is the matter with him and the doctors dont know what is the matter with him and he doesnt know himself what is the matter with him we all say its on the nerves and we none of us know what we mean when we say it however i advise you to humour his little peculiarities when you see him today admire his collection of coins prints and watercolour drawings and you will win his heart upon my word if you can be contented with a quiet country life i dont see why you should not get on very well here from breakfast to lunch mr fairlies drawings will occupy you after lunch miss fairlie and i shoulder our sketch books and go out to misrepresent nature under your directions drawing is her favourite whim mind not mine women cant draw their minds are too flighty and their eyes are too inattentive no matter my sister likes it so i waste paint and spoil paper for her sake as composedly as any woman in england as for the evenings i think we can help you through them miss fairlie plays delightfully for my own poor part i dont know one note of music from the other but i can match you at chess backgammon ecarte and with the inevitable female drawbacks even at billiards as well what do you think of the programme can you reconcile yourself to our quiet regular life or do you mean to be restless and secretly thirst for change and adventure in the humdrum atmosphere of limmeridge house she had run on thus far in her gracefully bantering way with no other interruptions on my part than the unimportant replies which politeness required of me the turn of the expression however in her last question or rather the one chance word adventure lightly as it fell from her lips recalled my thoughts to my meeting with the woman in white and urged me to discover the connection which the strangers own reference to mrs fairlie informed me must once have existed between the nameless fugitive from the asylum and the former mistress of limmeridge house even if i were the most restless of mankind i said i should be in no danger of thirsting after adventures for some time to come the very night before i arrived at this house i met with an adventure and the wonder and excitement of it i can assure you miss halcombe will last me for the whole term of my stay in cumberland if not for a much longer period you dont say so mr hartright may i hear it you have a claim to hear it the chief person in the adventure was a total stranger to me and may perhaps be a total stranger to you but she certainly mentioned the name of the late mrs fairlie in terms of the sincerest gratitude and regard mentioned my mothers name you interest me indescribably pray go on i at once related the circumstances under which i had met the woman in white exactly as they had occurred and i repeated what she had said to me about mrs fairlie and limmeridge house word for word miss halcombes bright resolute eyes looked eagerly into mine from the beginning of the narrative to the end her face expressed vivid interest and astonishment but nothing more she was evidently as far from knowing of any clue to the mystery as i was myself are you quite sure of those words referring to my mother she asked quite sure i replied whoever she may be the woman was once at school in the village of limmeridge was treated with especial kindness by mrs fairlie and in grateful remembrance of that kindness feels an affectionate interest in all surviving members of the family she knew that mrs fairlie and her husband were both dead and she spoke of miss fairlie as if they had known each other when they were children you said i think that she denied belonging to this place yes she told me she came from hampshire and you entirely failed to find out her name entirely very strange i think you were quite justified mr hartright in giving the poor creature her liberty for she seems to have done nothing in your presence to show herself unfit to enjoy it but i wish you had been a little more resolute about finding out her name we must really clear up this mystery in some way you had better not speak of it yet to mr fairlie or to my sister they are both of them i am certain quite as ignorant of who the woman is and of what her past history in connection with us can be as i am myself but they are also in widely different ways rather nervous and sensitive and you would only fidget one and alarm the other to no purpose as for myself i am all aflame with curiosity and i devote my whole energies to the business of discovery from this moment when my mother came here after her second marriage she certainly established the village school just as it exists at the present time but the old teachers are all dead or gone elsewhere and no enlightenment is to be hoped for from that quarter the only other alternative i can think of at this point we were interrupted by the entrance of the servant with a message from mr fairlie intimating that he would be glad to see me as soon as i had done breakfast wait in the hall said miss halcombe answering the servant for me in her quick ready way mr hartright will come out directly i was about to say she went on addressing me again that my sister and i have a large collection of my mothers letters addressed to my father and to hers in the absence of any other means of getting information i will pass the morning in looking over my mothers correspondence with mr fairlie he was fond of london and was constantly away from his country home and she was accustomed at such times to write and report to him how things went on at limmeridge her letters are full of references to the school in which she took so strong an interest and i think it more than likely that i may have discovered something when we meet again the luncheon hour is two mr hartright i shall have the pleasure of introducing you to my sister by that time and we will occupy the afternoon in driving round the neighbourhood and showing you all our pet points of view till two oclock then farewell she nodded to me with the lively grace the delightful refinement of familiarity which characterised all that she did and all that she said and disappeared by a door at the lower end of the room as soon as she had left me i turned my steps towards the hall and followed the servant on my way for the first time to the presence of mr fairlie vii my conductor led me upstairs into a passage which took us back to the bedchamber in which i had slept during the past night and opening the door next to it begged me to look in i have my masters orders to show you your own sittingroom sir said the man and to inquire if you approve of the situation and the light i must have been hard to please indeed if i had not approved of the room and of everything about it the bowwindow looked out on the same lovely view which i had admired in the morning from my bedroom the furniture was the perfection of luxury and beauty the table in the centre was bright with gaily bound books elegant conveniences for writing and beautiful flowers the second table near the window was covered with all the necessary materials for mounting watercolour drawings and had a little easel attached to it which i could expand or fold up at will the walls were hung with gaily tinted chintz and the floor was spread with indian matting in maizecolour and red it was the prettiest and most luxurious little sittingroom i had ever seen and i admired it with the warmest enthusiasm the solemn servant was far too highly trained to betray the slightest satisfaction he bowed with icy deference when my terms of eulogy were all exhausted and silently opened the door for me to go out into the passage again we turned a corner and entered a long second passage ascended a short flight of stairs at the end crossed a small circular upper hall and stopped in front of a door covered with dark baize the servant opened this door and led me on a few yards to a second opened that also and disclosed two curtains of pale seagreen silk hanging before us raised one of them noiselessly softly uttered the words mr hartright and left me i found myself in a large lofty room with a magnificent carved ceiling and with a carpet over the floor so thick and soft that it felt like piles of velvet under my feet one side of the room was occupied by a long bookcase of some rare inlaid wood that was quite new to me it was not more than six feet high and the top was adorned with statuettes in marble ranged at regular distances one from the other on the opposite side stood two antique cabinets and between them and above them hung a picture of the virgin and child protected by glass and bearing raphaels name on the gilt tablet at the bottom of the frame on my right hand and on my left as i stood inside the door were chiffoniers and little stands in buhl and marquetterie loaded with figures in dresden china with rare vases ivory ornaments and toys and curiosities that sparkled at all points with gold silver and precious stones at the lower end of the room opposite to me the windows were concealed and the sunlight was tempered by large blinds of the same pale seagreen colour as the curtains over the door the light thus produced was deliciously soft mysterious and subdued it fell equally upon all the objects in the room it helped to intensify the deep silence and the air of profound seclusion that possessed the place and it surrounded with an appropriate halo of repose the solitary figure of the master of the house leaning back listlessly composed in a large easy chair with a readingeasel fastened on one of its arms and a little table on the other if a mans personal appearance when he is out of his dressing room and when he has passed forty can be accepted as a safe guide to his time of life which is more than doubtful mr fairlies age when i saw him might have been reasonably computed at over fifty and under sixty years his beardless face was thin worn and transparently pale but not wrinkled his nose was high and hooked his eyes were of a dim greyish blue large prominent and rather red round the rims of the eyelids his hair was scanty soft to look at and of that light sandy colour which is the last to disclose its own changes towards grey he was dressed in a dark frockcoat of some substance much thinner than cloth and in waistcoat and trousers of spotless white his feet were effeminately small and were clad in buffcoloured silk stockings and little womanish bronzeleather slippers two rings adorned his white delicate hands the value of which even my inexperienced observation detected to be all but priceless upon the whole he had a frail languidlyfretful overrefined look something singularly and unpleasantly delicate in its association with a man and at the same time something which could by no possibility have looked natural and appropriate if it had been transferred to the personal appearance of a woman my mornings experience of miss halcombe had predisposed me to be pleased with everybody in the house but my sympathies shut themselves up resolutely at the first sight of mr fairlie on approaching nearer to him i discovered that he was not so entirely without occupation as i had at first supposed placed amid the other rare and beautiful objects on a large round table near him was a dwarf cabinet in ebony and silver containing coins of all shapes and sizes set out in little drawers lined with dark purple velvet one of these drawers lay on the small table attached to his chair and near it were some tiny jewellers brushes a washleather stump and a little bottle of liquid all waiting to be used in various ways for the removal of any accidental impurities which might be discovered on the coins his frail white fingers were listlessly toying with something which looked to my uninstructed eyes like a dirty pewter medal with ragged edges when i advanced within a respectful distance of his chair and stopped to make my bow so glad to possess you at limmeridge mr hartright he said in a querulous croaking voice which combined in anything but an agreeable manner a discordantly high tone with a drowsily languid utterance pray sit down and dont trouble yourself to move the chair please in the wretched state of my nerves movement of any kind is exquisitely painful to me have you seen your studio will it do i have just come from seeing the room mr fairlie and i assure you he stopped me in the middle of the sentence by closing his eyes and holding up one of his white hands imploringly i paused in astonishment and the croaking voice honoured me with this explanation pray excuse me but could you contrive to speak in a lower key in the wretched state of my nerves loud sound of any kind is indescribable torture to me you will pardon an invalid i only say to you what the lamentable state of my health obliges me to say to everybody yes and you really like the room i could wish for nothing prettier and nothing more comfortable i answered dropping my voice and beginning to discover already that mr fairlies selfish affectation and mr fairlies wretched nerves meant one and the same thing so glad you will find your position here mr hartright properly recognised there is none of the horrid english barbarity of feeling about the social position of an artist in this house so much of my early life has been passed abroad that i have quite cast my insular skin in that respect i wish i could say the same of the gentry detestable word but i suppose i must use it of the gentry in the neighbourhood they are sad goths in art mr hartright people i do assure you who would have opened their eyes in astonishment if they had seen charles the fifth pick up titians brush for him do you mind putting this tray of coins back in the cabinet and giving me the next one to it in the wretched state of my nerves exertion of any kind is unspeakably disagreeable to me yes thank you as a practical commentary on the liberal social theory which he had just favoured me by illustrating mr fairlies cool request rather amused me i put back one drawer and gave him the other with all possible politeness he began trifling with the new set of coins and the little brushes immediately languidly looking at them and admiring them all the time he was speaking to me a thousand thanks and a thousand excuses do you like coins yes so glad we have another taste in common besides our taste for art now about the pecuniary arrangements between us do tell me are they satisfactory most satisfactory mr fairlie so glad and what next ah i remember yes in reference to the consideration which you are good enough to accept for giving me the benefit of your accomplishments in art my steward will wait on you at the end of the first week to ascertain your wishes and what next curious is it not i had a great deal more to say and i appear to have quite forgotten it do you mind touching the bell in that corner yes thank you i rang and a new servant noiselessly made his appearance a foreigner with a set smile and perfectly brushed hair a valet every inch of him louis said mr fairlie dreamily dusting the tips of his fingers with one of the tiny brushes for the coins i made some entries in my tablettes this morning find my tablettes a thousand pardons mr hartright im afraid i bore you as he wearily closed his eyes again before i could answer and as he did most assuredly bore me i sat silent and looked up at the madonna and child by raphael in the meantime the valet left the room and returned shortly with a little ivory book mr fairlie after first relieving himself by a gentle sigh let the book drop open with one hand and held up the tiny brush with the other as a sign to the servant to wait for further orders yes just so said mr fairlie consulting the tablettes louis take down that portfolio he pointed as he spoke to several portfolios placed near the window on mahogany stands no not the one with the green back that contains my rembrandt etchings mr hartright do you like etchings yes so glad we have another taste in common the portfolio with the red back louis dont drop it you have no idea of the tortures i should suffer mr hartright if louis dropped that portfolio is it safe on the chair do you think it safe mr hartright yes so glad will you oblige me by looking at the drawings if you really think they are quite safe louis go away what an ass you are dont you see me holding the tablettes do you suppose i want to hold them then why not relieve me of the tablettes without being told a thousand pardons mr hartright servants are such asses are they not do tell me what do you think of the drawings they have come from a sale in a shocking state i thought they smelt of horrid dealers and brokers fingers when i looked at them last can you undertake them although my nerves were not delicate enough to detect the odour of plebeian fingers which had offended mr fairlies nostrils my taste was sufficiently educated to enable me to appreciate the value of the drawings while i turned them over they were for the most part really fine specimens of english watercolour art and they had deserved much better treatment at the hands of their former possessor than they appeared to have received the drawings i answered require careful straining and mounting and in my opinion they are well worth i beg your pardon interposed mr fairlie do you mind my closing my eyes while you speak even this light is too much for them yes i was about to say that the drawings are well worth all the time and trouble mr fairlie suddenly opened his eyes again and rolled them with an expression of helpless alarm in the direction of the window i entreat you to excuse me mr hartright he said in a feeble flutter but surely i hear some horrid children in the garden my private garden below i cant say mr fairlie i heard nothing myself oblige me you have been so very good in humouring my poor nerves oblige me by lifting up a corner of the blind dont let the sun in on me mr hartright have you got the blind up yes then will you be so very kind as to look into the garden and make quite sure i complied with this new request the garden was carefully walled in all round not a human creature large or small appeared in any part of the sacred seclusion i reported that gratifying fact to mr fairlie a thousand thanks my fancy i suppose there are no children thank heaven in the house but the servants persons born without nerves will encourage the children from the village such brats oh dear me such brats shall i confess it mr hartright i sadly want a reform in the construction of children natures only idea seems to be to make them machines for the production of incessant noise surely our delightful raffaellos conception is infinitely preferable he pointed to the picture of the madonna the upper part of which represented the conventional cherubs of italian art celestially provided with sitting accommodation for their chins on balloons of buffcoloured cloud quite a model family said mr fairlie leering at the cherubs such nice round faces and such nice soft wings and nothing else no dirty little legs to run about on and no noisy little lungs to scream with how immeasurably superior to the existing construction i will close my eyes again if you will allow me and you really can manage the drawings so glad is there anything else to settle if there is i think i have forgotten it shall we ring for louis again being by this time quite as anxious on my side as mr fairlie evidently was on his to bring the interview to a speedy conclusion i thought i would try to render the summoning of the servant unnecessary by offering the requisite suggestion on my own responsibility the only point mr fairlie that remains to be discussed i said refers i think to the instruction in sketching which i am engaged to communicate to the two young ladies ah just so said mr fairlie i wish i felt strong enough to go into that part of the arrangement but i dont the ladies who profit by your kind services mr hartright must settle and decide and so on for themselves my niece is fond of your charming art she knows just enough about it to be conscious of her own sad defects please take pains with her yes is there anything else no we quite understand each other dont we i have no right to detain you any longer from your delightful pursuit have i so pleasant to have settled everything such a sensible relief to have done business do you mind ringing for louis to carry the portfolio to your own room i will carry it there myself mr fairlie if you will allow me will you really are you strong enough how nice to be so strong are you sure you wont drop it so glad to possess you at limmeridge mr hartright i am such a sufferer that i hardly dare hope to enjoy much of your society would you mind taking great pains not to let the doors bang and not to drop the portfolio thank you gently with the curtains please the slightest noise from them goes through me like a knife yes good morning when the seagreen curtains were closed and when the two baize doors were shut behind me i stopped for a moment in the little circular hall beyond and drew a long luxurious breath of relief it was like coming to the surface of the water after deep diving to find myself once more on the outside of mr fairlies room as soon as i was comfortably established for the morning in my pretty little studio the first resolution at which i arrived was to turn my steps no more in the direction of the apartments occupied by the master of the house except in the very improbable event of his honouring me with a special invitation to pay him another visit having settled this satisfactory plan of future conduct in reference to mr fairlie i soon recovered the serenity of temper of which my employers haughty familiarity and impudent politeness had for the moment deprived me the remaining hours of the morning passed away pleasantly enough in looking over the drawings arranging them in sets trimming their ragged edges and accomplishing the other necessary preparations in anticipation of the business of mounting them i ought perhaps to have made more progress than this but as the luncheontime drew near i grew restless and unsettled and felt unable to fix my attention on work even though that work was only of the humble manual kind at two oclock i descended again to the breakfastroom a little anxiously expectations of some interest were connected with my approaching reappearance in that part of the house my introduction to miss fairlie was now close at hand and if miss halcombes search through her mothers letters had produced the result which she anticipated the time had come for clearing up the mystery of the woman in white viii when i entered the room i found miss halcombe and an elderly lady seated at the luncheontable the elderly lady when i was presented to her proved to be miss fairlies former governess mrs vesey who had been briefly described to me by my lively companion at the breakfasttable as possessed of all the cardinal virtues and counting for nothing i can do little more than offer my humble testimony to the truthfulness of miss halcombes sketch of the old ladys character mrs vesey looked the personification of human composure and female amiability a calm enjoyment of a calm existence beamed in drowsy smiles on her plump placid face some of us rush through life and some of us saunter through life mrs vesey sat through life sat in the house early and late sat in the garden sat in unexpected windowseats in passages sat on a campstool when her friends tried to take her out walking sat before she looked at anything before she talked of anything before she answered yes or no to the commonest question always with the same serene smile on her lips the same vacantly attentive turn of the head the same snuglycomfortable position of her hands and arms under every possible change of domestic circumstances a mild a compliant an unutterably tranquil and harmless old lady who never by any chance suggested the idea that she had been actually alive since the hour of her birth nature has so much to do in this world and is engaged in generating such a vast variety of coexistent productions that she must surely be now and then too flurried and confused to distinguish between the different processes that she is carrying on at the same time starting from this point of view it will always remain my private persuasion that nature was absorbed in making cabbages when mrs vesey was born and that the good lady suffered the consequences of a vegetable preoccupation in the mind of the mother of us all now mrs vesey said miss halcombe looking brighter sharper and readier than ever by contrast with the undemonstrative old lady at her side what will you have a cutlet mrs vesey crossed her dimpled hands on the edge of the table smiled placidly and said yes dear what is that opposite mr hartright boiled chicken is it not i thought you liked boiled chicken better than cutlet mrs vesey mrs vesey took her dimpled hands off the edge of the table and crossed them on her lap instead nodded contemplatively at the boiled chicken and said yes dear well but which will you have today shall mr hartright give you some chicken or shall i give you some cutlet mrs vesey put one of her dimpled hands back again on the edge of the table hesitated drowsily and said which you please dear mercy on me its a question for your taste my good lady not for mine suppose you have a little of both and suppose you begin with the chicken because mr hartright looks devoured by anxiety to carve for you mrs vesey put the other dimpled hand back on the edge of the table brightened dimly one moment went out again the next bowed obediently and said if you please sir surely a mild a compliant an unutterably tranquil and harmless old lady but enough perhaps for the present of mrs vesey all this time there were no signs of miss fairlie we finished our luncheon and still she never appeared miss halcombe whose quick eye nothing escaped noticed the looks that i cast from time to time in the direction of the door i understand you mr hartright she said you are wondering what has become of your other pupil she has been downstairs and has got over her headache but has not sufficiently recovered her appetite to join us at lunch if you will put yourself under my charge i think i can undertake to find her somewhere in the garden she took up a parasol lying on a chair near her and led the way out by a long window at the bottom of the room which opened on to the lawn it is almost unnecessary to say that we left mrs vesey still seated at the table with her dimpled hands still crossed on the edge of it apparently settled in that position for the rest of the afternoon as we crossed the lawn miss halcombe looked at me significantly and shook her head that mysterious adventure of yours she said still remains involved in its own appropriate midnight darkness i have been all the morning looking over my mothers letters and i have made no discoveries yet however dont despair mr hartright this is a matter of curiosity and you have got a woman for your ally under such conditions success is certain sooner or later the letters are not exhausted i have three packets still left and you may confidently rely on my spending the whole evening over them here then was one of my anticipations of the morning still unfulfilled i began to wonder next whether my introduction to miss fairlie would disappoint the expectations that i had been forming of her since breakfasttime and how did you get on with mr fairlie inquired miss halcombe as we left the lawn and turned into a shrubbery was he particularly nervous this morning never mind considering about your answer mr hartright the mere fact of your being obliged to consider is enough for me i see in your face that he was particularly nervous and as i am amiably unwilling to throw you into the same condition i ask no more we turned off into a winding path while she was speaking and approached a pretty summerhouse built of wood in the form of a miniature swiss chalet the one room of the summerhouse as we ascended the steps of the door was occupied by a young lady she was standing near a rustic table looking out at the inland view of moor and hill presented by a gap in the trees and absently turning over the leaves of a little sketchbook that lay at her side this was miss fairlie how can i describe her how can i separate her from my own sensations and from all that has happened in the later time how can i see her again as she looked when my eyes first rested on her as she should look now to the eyes that are about to see her in these pages the watercolour drawing that i made of laura fairlie at an after period in the place and attitude in which i first saw her lies on my desk while i write i look at it and there dawns upon me brightly from the dark greenishbrown background of the summer house a light youthful figure clothed in a simple muslin dress the pattern of it formed by broad alternate stripes of delicate blue and white a scarf of the same material sits crisply and closely round her shoulders and a little straw hat of the natural colour plainly and sparingly trimmed with ribbon to match the gown covers her head and throws its soft pearly shadow over the upper part of her face her hair is of so faint and pale a brown not flaxen and yet almost as light not golden and yet almost as glossy that it nearly melts here and there into the shadow of the hat it is plainly parted and drawn back over her ears and the line of it ripples naturally as it crosses her forehead the eyebrows are rather darker than the hair and the eyes are of that soft limpid turquoise blue so often sung by the poets so seldom seen in real life lovely eyes in colour lovely eyes in form large and tender and quietly thoughtful but beautiful above all things in the clear truthfulness of look that dwells in their inmost depths and shines through all their changes of expression with the light of a purer and a better world the charm most gently and yet most distinctly expressed which they shed over the whole face so covers and transforms its little natural human blemishes elsewhere that it is difficult to estimate the relative merits and defects of the other features it is hard to see that the lower part of the face is too delicately refined away towards the chin to be in full and fair proportion with the upper part that the nose in escaping the aquiline bend always hard and cruel in a woman no matter how abstractedly perfect it may be has erred a little in the other extreme and has missed the ideal straightness of line and that the sweet sensitive lips are subject to a slight nervous contraction when she smiles which draws them upward a little at one corner towards the cheek it might be possible to note these blemishes in another womans face but it is not easy to dwell on them in hers so subtly are they connected with all that is individual and characteristic in her expression and so closely does the expression depend for its full play and life in every other feature on the moving impulse of the eyes does my poor portrait of her my fond patient labour of long and happy days show me these things ah how few of them are in the dim mechanical drawing and how many in the mind with which i regard it a fair delicate girl in a pretty light dress trifling with the leaves of a sketchbook while she looks up from it with truthful innocent blue eyes that is all the drawing can say all perhaps that even the deeper reach of thought and pen can say in their language either the woman who first gives life light and form to our shadowy conceptions of beauty fills a void in our spiritual nature that has remained unknown to us till she appeared sympathies that lie too deep for words too deep almost for thoughts are touched at such times by other charms than those which the senses feel and which the resources of expression can realise the mystery which underlies the beauty of women is never raised above the reach of all expression until it has claimed kindred with the deeper mystery in our own souls then and then only has it passed beyond the narrow region on which light falls in this world from the pencil and the pen think of her as you thought of the first woman who quickened the pulses within you that the rest of her sex had no art to stir let the kind candid blue eyes meet yours as they met mine with the one matchless look which we both remember so well let her voice speak the music that you once loved best attuned as sweetly to your ear as to mine let her footstep as she comes and goes in these pages be like that other footstep to whose airy fall your own heart once beat time take her as the visionary nursling of your own fancy and she will grow upon you all the more clearly as the living woman who dwells in mine among the sensations that crowded on me when my eyes first looked upon her familiar sensations which we all know which spring to life in most of our hearts die again in so many and renew their bright existence in so few there was one that troubled and perplexed me one that seemed strangely inconsistent and unaccountably out of place in miss fairlies presence mingling with the vivid impression produced by the charm of her fair face and head her sweet expression and her winning simplicity of manner was another impression which in a shadowy way suggested to me the idea of something wanting at one time it seemed like something wanting in her at another like something wanting in myself which hindered me from understanding her as i ought the impression was always strongest in the most contradictory manner when she looked at me or in other words when i was most conscious of the harmony and charm of her face and yet at the same time most troubled by the sense of an incompleteness which it was impossible to discover something wanting something wanting and where it was and what it was i could not say the effect of this curious caprice of fancy as i thought it then was not of a nature to set me at my ease during a first interview with miss fairlie the few kind words of welcome which she spoke found me hardly selfpossessed enough to thank her in the customary phrases of reply observing my hesitation and no doubt attributing it naturally enough to some momentary shyness on my part miss halcombe took the business of talking as easily and readily as usual into her own hands look there mr hartright she said pointing to the sketchbook on the table and to the little delicate wandering hand that was still trifling with it surely you will acknowledge that your model pupil is found at last the moment she hears that you are in the house she seizes her inestimable sketchbook looks universal nature straight in the face and longs to begin miss fairlie laughed with a ready goodhumour which broke out as brightly as if it had been part of the sunshine above us over her lovely face i must not take credit to myself where no credit is due she said her clear truthful blue eyes looking alternately at miss halcombe and at me fond as i am of drawing i am so conscious of my own ignorance that i am more afraid than anxious to begin now i know you are here mr hartright i find myself looking over my sketches as i used to look over my lessons when i was a little girl and when i was sadly afraid that i should turn out not fit to be heard she made the confession very prettily and simply and with quaint childish earnestness drew the sketchbook away close to her own side of the table miss halcombe cut the knot of the little embarrassment forthwith in her resolute downright way good bad or indifferent she said the pupils sketches must pass through the fiery ordeal of the masters judgment and theres an end of it suppose we take them with us in the carriage laura and let mr hartright see them for the first time under circumstances of perpetual jolting and interruption if we can only confuse him all through the drive between nature as it is when he looks up at the view and nature as it is not when he looks down again at our sketchbooks we shall drive him into the last desperate refuge of paying us compliments and shall slip through his professional fingers with our pet feathers of vanity all unruffled i hope mr hartright will pay me no compliments said miss fairlie as we all left the summerhouse may i venture to inquire why you express that hope i asked because i shall believe all that you say to me she answered simply in those few words she unconsciously gave me the key to her whole character to that generous trust in others which in her nature grew innocently out of the sense of her own truth i only knew it intuitively then i know it by experience now we merely waited to rouse good mrs vesey from the place which she still occupied at the deserted luncheontable before we entered the open carriage for our promised drive the old lady and miss halcombe occupied the back seat and miss fairlie and i sat together in front with the sketchbook open between us fairly exhibited at last to my professional eyes all serious criticism on the drawings even if i had been disposed to volunteer it was rendered impossible by miss halcombes lively resolution to see nothing but the ridiculous side of the fine arts as practised by herself her sister and ladies in general i can remember the conversation that passed far more easily than the sketches that i mechanically looked over that part of the talk especially in which miss fairlie took any share is still as vividly impressed on my memory as if i had heard it only a few hours ago yes let me acknowledge that on this first day i let the charm of her presence lure me from the recollection of myself and my position the most trifling of the questions that she put to me on the subject of using her pencil and mixing her colours the slightest alterations of expression in the lovely eyes that looked into mine with such an earnest desire to learn all that i could teach and to discover all that i could show attracted more of my attention than the finest view we passed through or the grandest changes of light and shade as they flowed into each other over the waving moorland and the level beach at any time and under any circumstances of human interest is it not strange to see how little real hold the objects of the natural world amid which we live can gain on our hearts and minds we go to nature for comfort in trouble and sympathy in joy only in books admiration of those beauties of the inanimate world which modern poetry so largely and so eloquently describes is not even in the best of us one of the original instincts of our nature as children we none of us possess it no uninstructed man or woman possesses it those whose lives are most exclusively passed amid the ever changing wonders of sea and land are also those who are most universally insensible to every aspect of nature not directly associated with the human interest of their calling our capacity of appreciating the beauties of the earth we live on is in truth one of the civilised accomplishments which we all learn as an art and more that very capacity is rarely practised by any of us except when our minds are most indolent and most unoccupied how much share have the attractions of nature ever had in the pleasurable or painful interests and emotions of ourselves or our friends what space do they ever occupy in the thousand little narratives of personal experience which pass every day by word of mouth from one of us to the other all that our minds can compass all that our hearts can learn can be accomplished with equal certainty equal profit and equal satisfaction to ourselves in the poorest as in the richest prospect that the face of the earth can show there is surely a reason for this want of inborn sympathy between the creature and the creation around it a reason which may perhaps be found in the widelydiffering destinies of man and his earthly sphere the grandest mountain prospect that the eye can range over is appointed to annihilation the smallest human interest that the pure heart can feel is appointed to immortality we had been out nearly three hours when the carriage again passed through the gates of limmeridge house on our way back i had let the ladies settle for themselves the first point of view which they were to sketch under my instructions on the afternoon of the next day when they withdrew to dress for dinner and when i was alone again in my little sittingroom my spirits seemed to leave me on a sudden i felt ill at ease and dissatisfied with myself i hardly knew why perhaps i was now conscious for the first time of having enjoyed our drive too much in the character of a guest and too little in the character of a drawingmaster perhaps that strange sense of something wanting either in miss fairlie or in myself which had perplexed me when i was first introduced to her haunted me still anyhow it was a relief to my spirits when the dinnerhour called me out of my solitude and took me back to the society of the ladies of the house i was struck on entering the drawingroom by the curious contrast rather in material than in colour of the dresses which they now wore while mrs vesey and miss halcombe were richly clad each in the manner most becoming to her age the first in silvergrey and the second in that delicate primroseyellow colour which matches so well with a dark complexion and black hair miss fairlie was unpretendingly and almost poorly dressed in plain white muslin it was spotlessly pure it was beautifully put on but still it was the sort of dress which the wife or daughter of a poor man might have worn and it made her so far as externals went look less affluent in circumstances than her own governess at a later period when i learnt to know more of miss fairlies character i discovered that this curious contrast on the wrong side was due to her natural delicacy of feeling and natural intensity of aversion to the slightest personal display of her own wealth neither mrs vesey nor miss halcombe could ever induce her to let the advantage in dress desert the two ladies who were poor to lean to the side of the one lady who was rich when the dinner was over we returned together to the drawingroom although mr fairlie emulating the magnificent condescension of the monarch who had picked up titians brush for him had instructed his butler to consult my wishes in relation to the wine that i might prefer after dinner i was resolute enough to resist the temptation of sitting in solitary grandeur among bottles of my own choosing and sensible enough to ask the ladies permission to leave the table with them habitually on the civilised foreign plan during the period of my residence at limmeridge house the drawingroom to which we had now withdrawn for the rest of the evening was on the groundfloor and was of the same shape and size as the breakfastroom large glass doors at the lower end opened on to a terrace beautifully ornamented along its whole length with a profusion of flowers the soft hazy twilight was just shading leaf and blossom alike into harmony with its own sober hues as we entered the room and the sweet evening scent of the flowers met us with its fragrant welcome through the open glass doors good mrs vesey always the first of the party to sit down took possession of an armchair in a corner and dozed off comfortably to sleep at my request miss fairlie placed herself at the piano as i followed her to a seat near the instrument i saw miss halcombe retire into a recess of one of the side windows to proceed with the search through her mothers letters by the last quiet rays of the evening light how vividly that peaceful homepicture of the drawingroom comes back to me while i write from the place where i sat i could see miss halcombes graceful figure half of it in soft light half in mysterious shadow bending intently over the letters in her lap while nearer to me the fair profile of the player at the piano was just delicately defined against the faintlydeepening background of the inner wall of the room outside on the terrace the clustering flowers and long grasses and creepers waved so gently in the light evening air that the sound of their rustling never reached us the sky was without a cloud and the dawning mystery of moonlight began to tremble already in the region of the eastern heaven the sense of peace and seclusion soothed all thought and feeling into a rapt unearthly repose and the balmy quiet that deepened ever with the deepening light seemed to hover over us with a gentler influence still when there stole upon it from the piano the heavenly tenderness of the music of mozart it was an evening of sights and sounds never to forget we all sat silent in the places we had chosen mrs vesey still sleeping miss fairlie still playing miss halcombe still reading till the light failed us by this time the moon had stolen round to the terrace and soft mysterious rays of light were slanting already across the lower end of the room the change from the twilight obscurity was so beautiful that we banished the lamps by common consent when the servant brought them in and kept the large room unlighted except by the glimmer of the two candles at the piano for half an hour more the music still went on after that the beauty of the moonlight view on the terrace tempted miss fairlie out to look at it and i followed her when the candles at the piano had been lighted miss halcombe had changed her place so as to continue her examination of the letters by their assistance we left her on a low chair at one side of the instrument so absorbed over her reading that she did not seem to notice when we moved we had been out on the terrace together just in front of the glass doors hardly so long as five minutes i should think and miss fairlie was by my advice just tying her white handkerchief over her head as a precaution against the night air when i heard miss halcombes voice low eager and altered from its natural lively tone pronounce my name mr hartright she said will you come here for a minute i want to speak to you i entered the room again immediately the piano stood about half way down along the inner wall on the side of the instrument farthest from the terrace miss halcombe was sitting with the letters scattered on her lap and with one in her hand selected from them and held close to the candle on the side nearest to the terrace there stood a low ottoman on which i took my place in this position i was not far from the glass doors and i could see miss fairlie plainly as she passed and repassed the opening on to the terrace walking slowly from end to end of it in the full radiance of the moon i want you to listen while i read the concluding passages in this letter said miss halcombe tell me if you think they throw any light upon your strange adventure on the road to london the letter is addressed by my mother to her second husband mr fairlie and the date refers to a period of between eleven and twelve years since at that time mr and mrs fairlie and my halfsister laura had been living for years in this house and i was away from them completing my education at a school in paris she looked and spoke earnestly and as i thought a little uneasily as well at the moment when she raised the letter to the candle before beginning to read it miss fairlie passed us on the terrace looked in for a moment and seeing that we were engaged slowly walked on miss halcombe began to read as follows you will be tired my dear philip of hearing perpetually about my schools and my scholars lay the blame pray on the dull uniformity of life at limmeridge and not on me besides this time i have something really interesting to tell you about a new scholar you know old mrs kempe at the village shop well after years of ailing the doctor has at last given her up and she is dying slowly day by day her only living relation a sister arrived last week to take care of her this sister comes all the way from hampshire her name is mrs catherick four days ago mrs catherick came here to see me and brought her only child with her a sweet little girl about a year older than our darling laura as the last sentence fell from the readers lips miss fairlie passed us on the terrace once more she was softly singing to herself one of the melodies which she had been playing earlier in the evening miss halcombe waited till she had passed out of sight again and then went on with the letter mrs catherick is a decent wellbehaved respectable woman middleaged and with the remains of having been moderately only moderately nicelooking there is something in her manner and in her appearance however which i cant make out she is reserved about herself to the point of downright secrecy and there is a look in her face i cant describe it which suggests to me that she has something on her mind she is altogether what you would call a walking mystery her errand at limmeridge house however was simple enough when she left hampshire to nurse her sister mrs kempe through her last illness she had been obliged to bring her daughter with her through having no one at home to take care of the little girl mrs kempe may die in a weeks time or may linger on for months and mrs cathericks object was to ask me to let her daughter anne have the benefit of attending my school subject to the condition of her being removed from it to go home again with her mother after mrs kempes death i consented at once and when laura and i went out for our walk we took the little girl who is just eleven years old to the school that very day once more miss fairlies figure bright and soft in its snowy muslin dress her face prettily framed by the white folds of the handkerchief which she had tied under her chin passed by us in the moonlight once more miss halcombe waited till she was out of sight and then went on i have taken a violent fancy philip to my new scholar for a reason which i mean to keep till the last for the sake of surprising you her mother having told me as little about the child as she told me of herself i was left to discover which i did on the first day when we tried her at lessons that the poor little things intellect is not developed as it ought to be at her age seeing this i had her up to the house the next day and privately arranged with the doctor to come and watch her and question her and tell me what he thought his opinion is that she will grow out of it but he says her careful bringingup at school is a matter of great importance just now because her unusual slowness in acquiring ideas implies an unusual tenacity in keeping them when they are once received into her mind now my love you must not imagine in your offhand way that i have been attaching myself to an idiot this poor little anne catherick is a sweet affectionate grateful girl and says the quaintest prettiest things as you shall judge by an instance in the most oddly sudden surprised halffrightened way although she is dressed very neatly her clothes show a sad want of taste in colour and pattern so i arranged yesterday that some of our darling lauras old white frocks and white hats should be altered for anne catherick explaining to her that little girls of her complexion looked neater and better all in white than in anything else she hesitated and seemed puzzled for a minute then flushed up and appeared to understand her little hand clasped mine suddenly she kissed it philip and said oh so earnestly i will always wear white as long as i live it will help me to remember you maam and to think that i am pleasing you still when i go away and see you no more this is only one specimen of the quaint things she says so prettily poor little soul she shall have a stock of white frocks made with good deep tucks to let out for her as she grows miss halcombe paused and looked at me across the piano did the forlorn woman whom you met in the highroad seem young she asked young enough to be two or threeandtwenty yes miss halcombe as young as that and she was strangely dressed from head to foot all in white all in white while the answer was passing my lips miss fairlie glided into view on the terrace for the third time instead of proceeding on her walk she stopped with her back turned towards us and leaning on the balustrade of the terrace looked down into the garden beyond my eyes fixed upon the white gleam of her muslin gown and headdress in the moonlight and a sensation for which i can find no name a sensation that quickened my pulse and raised a fluttering at my heart began to steal over me all in white miss halcombe repeated the most important sentences in the letter mr hartright are those at the end which i will read to you immediately but i cant help dwelling a little upon the coincidence of the white costume of the woman you met and the white frocks which produced that strange answer from my mothers little scholar the doctor may have been wrong when he discovered the childs defects of intellect and predicted that she would grow out of them she may never have grown out of them and the old grateful fancy about dressing in white which was a serious feeling to the girl may be a serious feeling to the woman still i said a few words in answer i hardly know what all my attention was concentrated on the white gleam of miss fairlies muslin dress listen to the last sentences of the letter said miss halcombe i think they will surprise you as she raised the letter to the light of the candle miss fairlie turned from the balustrade looked doubtfully up and down the terrace advanced a step towards the glass doors and then stopped facing us meanwhile miss halcombe read me the last sentences to which she had referred and now my love seeing that i am at the end of my paper now for the real reason the surprising reason for my fondness for little anne catherick my dear philip although she is not half so pretty she is nevertheless by one of those extraordinary caprices of accidental resemblance which one sometimes sees the living likeness in her hair her complexion the colour of her eyes and the shape of her face i started up from the ottoman before miss halcombe could pronounce the next words a thrill of the same feeling which ran through me when the touch was laid upon my shoulder on the lonely highroad chilled me again there stood miss fairlie a white figure alone in the moonlight in her attitude in the turn of her head in her complexion in the shape of her face the living image at that distance and under those circumstances of the woman in white the doubt which had troubled my mind for hours and hours past flashed into conviction in an instant that something wanting was my own recognition of the ominous likeness between the fugitive from the asylum and my pupil at limmeridge house you see it said miss halcombe she dropped the useless letter and her eyes flashed as they met mine you see it now as my mother saw it eleven years since i see it more unwillingly than i can say to associate that forlorn friendless lost woman even by an accidental likeness only with miss fairlie seems like casting a shadow on the future of the bright creature who stands looking at us now let me lose the impression again as soon as possible call her in out of the dreary moonlight pray call her in mr hartright you surprise me whatever women may be i thought that men in the nineteenth century were above superstition pray call her in hush hush she is coming of her own accord say nothing in her presence let this discovery of the likeness be kept a secret between you and me come in laura come in and wake mrs vesey with the piano mr hartright is petitioning for some more music and he wants it this time of the lightest and liveliest kind ix so ended my eventful first day at limmeridge house miss halcombe and i kept our secret after the discovery of the likeness no fresh light seemed destined to break over the mystery of the woman in white at the first safe opportunity miss halcombe cautiously led her halfsister to speak of their mother of old times and of anne catherick miss fairlies recollections of the little scholar at limmeridge were however only of the most vague and general kind she remembered the likeness between herself and her mothers favourite pupil as something which had been supposed to exist in past times but she did not refer to the gift of the white dresses or to the singular form of words in which the child had artlessly expressed her gratitude for them she remembered that anne had remained at limmeridge for a few months only and had then left it to go back to her home in hampshire but she could not say whether the mother and daughter had ever returned or had ever been heard of afterwards no further search on miss halcombes part through the few letters of mrs fairlies writing which she had left unread assisted in clearing up the uncertainties still left to perplex us we had identified the unhappy woman whom i had met in the nighttime with anne catherick we had made some advance at least towards connecting the probably defective condition of the poor creatures intellect with the peculiarity of her being dressed all in white and with the continuance in her maturer years of her childish gratitude towards mrs fairlie and there so far as we knew at that time our discoveries had ended the days passed on the weeks passed on and the track of the golden autumn wound its bright way visibly through the green summer of the trees peaceful fastflowing happy time my story glides by you now as swiftly as you once glided by me of all the treasures of enjoyment that you poured so freely into my heart how much is left me that has purpose and value enough to be written on this page nothing but the saddest of all confessions that a man can make the confession of his own folly the secret which that confession discloses should be told with little effort for it has indirectly escaped me already the poor weak words which have failed to describe miss fairlie have succeeded in betraying the sensations she awakened in me it is so with us all our words are giants when they do us an injury and dwarfs when they do us a service i loved her ah how well i know all the sadness and all the mockery that is contained in those three words i can sigh over my mournful confession with the tenderest woman who reads it and pities me i can laugh at it as bitterly as the hardest man who tosses it from him in contempt i loved her feel for me or despise me i confess it with the same immovable resolution to own the truth was there no excuse for me there was some excuse to be found surely in the conditions under which my term of hired service was passed at limmeridge house my morning hours succeeded each other calmly in the quiet and seclusion of my own room i had just work enough to do in mounting my employers drawings to keep my hands and eyes pleasurably employed while my mind was left free to enjoy the dangerous luxury of its own unbridled thoughts a perilous solitude for it lasted long enough to enervate not long enough to fortify me a perilous solitude for it was followed by afternoons and evenings spent day after day and week after week alone in the society of two women one of whom possessed all the accomplishments of grace wit and highbreeding the other all the charms of beauty gentleness and simple truth that can purify and subdue the heart of man not a day passed in that dangerous intimacy of teacher and pupil in which my hand was not close to miss fairlies my cheek as we bent together over her sketchbook almost touching hers the more attentively she watched every movement of my brush the more closely i was breathing the perfume of her hair and the warm fragrance of her breath it was part of my service to live in the very light of her eyes at one time to be bending over her so close to her bosom as to tremble at the thought of touching it at another to feel her bending over me bending so close to see what i was about that her voice sank low when she spoke to me and her ribbons brushed my cheek in the wind before she could draw them back the evenings which followed the sketching excursions of the afternoon varied rather than checked these innocent these inevitable familiarities my natural fondness for the music which she played with such tender feeling such delicate womanly taste and her natural enjoyment of giving me back by the practice of her art the pleasure which i had offered to her by the practice of mine only wove another tie which drew us closer and closer to one another the accidents of conversation the simple habits which regulated even such a little thing as the position of our places at table the play of miss halcombes everready raillery always directed against my anxiety as teacher while it sparkled over her enthusiasm as pupil the harmless expression of poor mrs veseys drowsy approval which connected miss fairlie and me as two model young people who never disturbed her every one of these trifles and many more combined to fold us together in the same domestic atmosphere and to lead us both insensibly to the same hopeless end i should have remembered my position and have put myself secretly on my guard i did so but not till it was too late all the discretion all the experience which had availed me with other women and secured me against other temptations failed me with her it had been my profession for years past to be in this close contact with young girls of all ages and of all orders of beauty i had accepted the position as part of my calling in life i had trained myself to leave all the sympathies natural to my age in my employers outer hall as coolly as i left my umbrella there before i went upstairs i had long since learnt to understand composedly and as a matter of course that my situation in life was considered a guarantee against any of my female pupils feeling more than the most ordinary interest in me and that i was admitted among beautiful and captivating women much as a harmless domestic animal is admitted among them this guardian experience i had gained early this guardian experience had sternly and strictly guided me straight along my own poor narrow path without once letting me stray aside to the right hand or to the left and now i and my trusty talisman were parted for the first time yes my hardlyearned selfcontrol was as completely lost to me as if i had never possessed it lost to me as it is lost every day to other men in other critical situations where women are concerned i know now that i should have questioned myself from the first i should have asked why any room in the house was better than home to me when she entered it and barren as a desert when she went out again why i always noticed and remembered the little changes in her dress that i had noticed and remembered in no other womans before why i saw her heard her and touched her when we shook hands at night and morning as i had never seen heard and touched any other woman in my life i should have looked into my own heart and found this new growth springing up there and plucked it out while it was young why was this easiest simplest work of selfculture always too much for me the explanation has been written already in the three words that were many enough and plain enough for my confession i loved her the days passed the weeks passed it was approaching the third month of my stay in cumberland the delicious monotony of life in our calm seclusion flowed on with me like a smooth stream with a swimmer who glides down the current all memory of the past all thought of the future all sense of the falseness and hopelessness of my own position lay hushed within me into deceitful rest lulled by the syrensong that my own heart sung to me with eyes shut to all sight and ears closed to all sound of danger i drifted nearer and nearer to the fatal rocks the warning that aroused me at last and startled me into sudden selfaccusing consciousness of my own weakness was the plainest the truest the kindest of all warnings for it came silently from her we had parted one night as usual no word had fallen from my lips at that time or at any time before it that could betray me or startle her into sudden knowledge of the truth but when we met again in the morning a change had come over her a change that told me all i shrank then i shrink still from invading the innermost sanctuary of her heart and laying it open to others as i have laid open my own let it be enough to say that the time when she first surprised my secret was i firmly believe the time when she first surprised her own and the time also when she changed towards me in the interval of one night her nature too truthful to deceive others was too noble to deceive itself when the doubt that i had hushed asleep first laid its weary weight on her heart the true face owned all and said in its own frank simple language i am sorry for him i am sorry for myself it said this and more which i could not then interpret i understood but too well the change in her manner to greater kindness and quicker readiness in interpreting all my wishes before others to constraint and sadness and nervous anxiety to absorb herself in the first occupation she could seize on whenever we happened to be left together alone i understood why the sweet sensitive lips smiled so rarely and so restrainedly now and why the clear blue eyes looked at me sometimes with the pity of an angel sometimes with the innocent perplexity of a child but the change meant more than this there was a coldness in her hand there was an unnatural immobility in her face there was in all her movements the mute expression of constant fear and clinging selfreproach the sensations that i could trace to herself and to me the unacknowledged sensations that we were feeling in common were not these there were certain elements of the change in her that were still secretly drawing us together and others that were as secretly beginning to drive us apart in my doubt and perplexity in my vague suspicion of something hidden which i was left to find by my own unaided efforts i examined miss halcombes looks and manner for enlightenment living in such intimacy as ours no serious alteration could take place in any one of us which did not sympathetically affect the others the change in miss fairlie was reflected in her half sister although not a word escaped miss halcombe which hinted at an altered state of feeling towards myself her penetrating eyes had contracted a new habit of always watching me sometimes the look was like suppressed anger sometimes like suppressed dread sometimes like neither like nothing in short which i could understand a week elapsed leaving us all three still in this position of secret constraint towards one another my situation aggravated by the sense of my own miserable weakness and forgetfulness of myself now too late awakened in me was becoming intolerable i felt that i must cast off the oppression under which i was living at once and for ever yet how to act for the best or what to say first was more than i could tell from this position of helplessness and humiliation i was rescued by miss halcombe her lips told me the bitter the necessary the unexpected truth her hearty kindness sustained me under the shock of hearing it her sense and courage turned to its right use an event which threatened the worst that could happen to me and to others in limmeridge house x it was on a thursday in the week and nearly at the end of the third month of my sojourn in cumberland in the morning when i went down into the breakfastroom at the usual hour miss halcombe for the first time since i had known her was absent from her customary place at the table miss fairlie was out on the lawn she bowed to me but did not come in not a word had dropped from my lips or from hers that could unsettle either of us and yet the same unacknowledged sense of embarrassment made us shrink alike from meeting one another alone she waited on the lawn and i waited in the breakfast room till mrs vesey or miss halcombe came in how quickly i should have joined her how readily we should have shaken hands and glided into our customary talk only a fortnight ago in a few minutes miss halcombe entered she had a preoccupied look and she made her apologies for being late rather absently i have been detained she said by a consultation with mr fairlie on a domestic matter which he wished to speak to me about miss fairlie came in from the garden and the usual morning greeting passed between us her hand struck colder to mine than ever she did not look at me and she was very pale even mrs vesey noticed it when she entered the room a moment after i suppose it is the change in the wind said the old lady the winter is coming ah my love the winter is coming soon in her heart and in mine it had come already our morning meal once so full of pleasant goodhumoured discussion of the plans for the day was short and silent miss fairlie seemed to feel the oppression of the long pauses in the conversation and looked appealingly to her sister to fill them up miss halcombe after once or twice hesitating and checking herself in a most uncharacteristic manner spoke at last i have seen your uncle this morning laura she said he thinks the purple room is the one that ought to be got ready and he confirms what i told you monday is the day not tuesday while these words were being spoken miss fairlie looked down at the table beneath her her fingers moved nervously among the crumbs that were scattered on the cloth the paleness on her cheeks spread to her lips and the lips themselves trembled visibly i was not the only person present who noticed this miss halcombe saw it too and at once set us the example of rising from table mrs vesey and miss fairlie left the room together the kind sorrowful blue eyes looked at me for a moment with the prescient sadness of a coming and a long farewell i felt the answering pang in my own heart the pang that told me i must lose her soon and love her the more unchangeably for the loss i turned towards the garden when the door had closed on her miss halcombe was standing with her hat in her hand and her shawl over her arm by the large window that led out to the lawn and was looking at me attentively have you any leisure time to spare she asked before you begin to work in your own room certainly miss halcombe i have always time at your service i want to say a word to you in private mr hartright get your hat and come out into the garden we are not likely to be disturbed there at this hour in the morning as we stepped out on to the lawn one of the undergardeners a mere lad passed us on his way to the house with a letter in his hand miss halcombe stopped him is that letter for me she asked nay miss its just said to be for miss fairlie answered the lad holding out the letter as he spoke miss halcombe took it from him and looked at the address a strange handwriting she said to herself who can lauras correspondent be where did you get this she continued addressing the gardener well miss said the lad i just got it from a woman what woman a woman well stricken in age oh an old woman any one you knew i canna tak it on mysel to say that she was other than a stranger to me which way did she go that gate said the undergardener turning with great deliberation towards the south and embracing the whole of that part of england with one comprehensive sweep of his arm curious said miss halcombe i suppose it must be a begging letter there she added handing the letter back to the lad take it to the house and give it to one of the servants and now mr hartright if you have no objection let us walk this way she led me across the lawn along the same path by which i had followed her on the day after my arrival at limmeridge at the little summerhouse in which laura fairlie and i had first seen each other she stopped and broke the silence which she had steadily maintained while we were walking together what i have to say to you i can say here with those words she entered the summerhouse took one of the chairs at the little round table inside and signed to me to take the other i suspected what was coming when she spoke to me in the breakfastroom i felt certain of it now mr hartright she said i am going to begin by making a frank avowal to you i am going to say without phrasemaking which i detest or paying compliments which i heartily despise that i have come in the course of your residence with us to feel a strong friendly regard for you i was predisposed in your favour when you first told me of your conduct towards that unhappy woman whom you met under such remarkable circumstances your management of the affair might not have been prudent but it showed the self control the delicacy and the compassion of a man who was naturally a gentleman it made me expect good things from you and you have not disappointed my expectations she paused but held up her hand at the same time as a sign that she awaited no answer from me before she proceeded when i entered the summerhouse no thought was in me of the woman in white but now miss halcombes own words had put the memory of my adventure back in my mind it remained there throughout the interview remained and not without a result as your friend she proceeded i am going to tell you at once in my own plain blunt downright language that i have discovered your secret without help or hint mind from any one else mr hartright you have thoughtlessly allowed yourself to form an attachment a serious and devoted attachment i am afraid to my sister laura i dont put you to the pain of confessing it in so many words because i see and know that you are too honest to deny it i dont even blame you i pity you for opening your heart to a hopeless affection you have not attempted to take any underhand advantage you have not spoken to my sister in secret you are guilty of weakness and want of attention to your own best interests but of nothing worse if you had acted in any single respect less delicately and less modestly i should have told you to leave the house without an instants notice or an instants consultation of anybody as it is i blame the misfortune of your years and your position i dont blame you shake hands i have given you pain i am going to give you more but there is no help for it shake hands with your friend marian halcombe first the sudden kindness the warm highminded fearless sympathy which met me on such mercifully equal terms which appealed with such delicate and generous abruptness straight to my heart my honour and my courage overcame me in an instant i tried to look at her when she took my hand but my eves were dim i tried to thank her but my voice failed me listen to me she said considerately avoiding all notice of my loss of selfcontrol listen to me and let us get it over at once it is a real true relief to me that i am not obliged in what i have now to say to enter into the question the hard and cruel question as i think it of social inequalities circumstances which will try you to the quick spare me the ungracious necessity of paining a man who has lived in friendly intimacy under the same roof with myself by any humiliating reference to matters of rank and station you must leave limmeridge house mr hartright before more harm is done it is my duty to say that to you and it would be equally my duty to say it under precisely the same serious necessity if you were the representative of the oldest and wealthiest family in england you must leave us not because you are a teacher of drawing she waited a moment turned her face full on me and reaching across the table laid her hand firmly on my arm not because you are a teacher of drawing she repeated but because laura fairlie is engaged to be married the last word went like a bullet to my heart my arm lost all sensation of the hand that grasped it i never moved and never spoke the sharp autumn breeze that scattered the dead leaves at our feet came as cold to me on a sudden as if my own mad hopes were dead leaves too whirled away by the wind like the rest hopes betrothed or not betrothed she was equally far from me would other men have remembered that in my place not if they had loved her as i did the pang passed and nothing but the dull numbing pain of it remained i felt miss halcombes hand again tightening its hold on my arm i raised my head and looked at her her large black eyes were rooted on me watching the white change on my face which i felt and which she saw crush it she said here where you first saw her crush it dont shrink under it like a woman tear it out trample it under foot like a man the suppressed vehemence with which she spoke the strength which her will concentrated in the look she fixed on me and in the hold on my arm that she had not yet relinquished communicated to mine steadied me we both waited for a minute in silence at the end of that time i had justified her generous faith in my manhood i had outwardly at least recovered my selfcontrol are you yourself again enough myself miss halcombe to ask your pardon and hers enough myself to be guided by your advice and to prove my gratitude in that way if i can prove it in no other you have proved it already she answered by those words mr hartright concealment is at an end between us i cannot affect to hide from you what my sister has unconsciously shown to me you must leave us for her sake as well as for your own your presence here your necessary intimacy with us harmless as it has been god knows in all other respects has unsteadied her and made her wretched i who love her better than my own life i who have learnt to believe in that pure noble innocent nature as i believe in my religion know but too well the secret misery of selfreproach that she has been suffering since the first shadow of a feeling disloyal to her marriage engagement entered her heart in spite of her i dont say it would be useless to attempt to say it after what has happened that her engagement has ever had a strong hold on her affections it is an engagement of honour not of love her father sanctioned it on his deathbed two years since she herself neither welcomed it nor shrank from it she was content to make it till you came here she was in the position of hundreds of other women who marry men without being greatly attracted to them or greatly repelled by them and who learn to love them when they dont learn to hate after marriage instead of before i hope more earnestly than words can say and you should have the selfsacrificing courage to hope too that the new thoughts and feelings which have disturbed the old calmness and the old content have not taken root too deeply to be ever removed your absence if i had less belief in your honour and your courage and your sense i should not trust to them as i am trusting now your absence will help my efforts and time will help us all three it is something to know that my first confidence in you was not all misplaced it is something to know that you will not be less honest less manly less considerate towards the pupil whose relation to yourself you have had the misfortune to forget than towards the stranger and the outcast whose appeal to you was not made in vain again the chance reference to the woman in white was there no possibility of speaking of miss fairlie and of me without raising the memory of anne catherick and setting her between us like a fatality that it was hopeless to avoid tell me what apology i can make to mr fairlie for breaking my engagement i said tell me when to go after that apology is accepted i promise implicit obedience to you and to your advice time is every way of importance she answered you heard me refer this morning to monday next and to the necessity of setting the purple room in order the visitor whom we expect on monday i could not wait for her to be more explicit knowing what i knew now the memory of miss fairlies look and manner at the breakfasttable told me that the expected visitor at limmeridge house was her future husband i tried to force it back but something rose within me at that moment stronger than my own will and i interrupted miss halcombe let me go today i said bitterly the sooner the better no not today she replied the only reason you can assign to mr fairlie for your departure before the end of your engagement must be that an unforeseen necessity compels you to ask his permission to return at once to london you must wait till to morrow to tell him that at the time when the post comes in because he will then understand the sudden change in your plans by associating it with the arrival of a letter from london it is miserable and sickening to descend to deceit even of the most harmless kind but i know mr fairlie and if you once excite his suspicions that you are trifling with him he will refuse to release you speak to him on friday morning occupy yourself afterwards for the sake of your own interests with your employer in leaving your unfinished work in as little confusion as possible and quit this place on saturday it will be time enough then mr hartright for you and for all of us before i could assure her that she might depend on my acting in the strictest accordance with her wishes we were both startled by advancing footsteps in the shrubbery some one was coming from the house to seek for us i felt the blood rush into my cheeks and then leave them again could the third person who was fast approaching us at such a time and under such circumstances be miss fairlie it was a relief so sadly so hopelessly was my position towards her changed already it was absolutely a relief to me when the person who had disturbed us appeared at the entrance of the summerhouse and proved to be only miss fairlies maid could i speak to you for a moment miss said the girl in rather a flurried unsettled manner miss halcombe descended the steps into the shrubbery and walked aside a few paces with the maid left by myself my mind reverted with a sense of forlorn wretchedness which it is not in any words that i can find to describe to my approaching return to the solitude and the despair of my lonely london home thoughts of my kind old mother and of my sister who had rejoiced with her so innocently over my prospects in cumberland thoughts whose long banishment from my heart it was now my shame and my reproach to realise for the first time came back to me with the loving mournfulness of old neglected friends my mother and my sister what would they feel when i returned to them from my broken engagement with the confession of my miserable secret they who had parted from me so hopefully on that last happy night in the hampstead cottage anne catherick again even the memory of the farewell evening with my mother and my sister could not return to me now unconnected with that other memory of the moonlight walk back to london what did it mean were that woman and i to meet once more it was possible at the least did she know that i lived in london yes i had told her so either before or after that strange question of hers when she had asked me so distrustfully if i knew many men of the rank of baronet either before or after my mind was not calm enough then to remember which a few minutes elapsed before miss halcombe dismissed the maid and came back to me she too looked flurried and unsettled now we have arranged all that is necessary mr hartright she said we have understood each other as friends should and we may go back at once to the house to tell you the truth i am uneasy about laura she has sent to say she wants to see me directly and the maid reports that her mistress is apparently very much agitated by a letter that she has received this morning the same letter no doubt which i sent on to the house before we came here we retraced our steps together hastily along the shrubbery path although miss halcombe had ended all that she thought it necessary to say on her side i had not ended all that i wanted to say on mine from the moment when i had discovered that the expected visitor at limmeridge was miss fairlies future husband i had felt a bitter curiosity a burning envious eagerness to know who he was it was possible that a future opportunity of putting the question might not easily offer so i risked asking it on our way back to the house now that you are kind enough to tell me we have understood each other miss halcombe i said now that you are sure of my gratitude for your forbearance and my obedience to your wishes may i venture to ask who i hesitated i had forced myself to think of him but it was harder still to speak of him as her promised husband who the gentleman engaged to miss fairlie is her mind was evidently occupied with the message she had received from her sister she answered in a hasty absent way a gentleman of large property in hampshire hampshire anne cathericks native place again and yet again the woman in white there was a fatality in it and his name i said as quietly and indifferently as i could sir percival glyde sir sir percival anne cathericks question that suspicious question about the men of the rank of baronet whom i might happen to know had hardly been dismissed from my mind by miss halcombes return to me in the summerhouse before it was recalled again by her own answer i stopped suddenly and looked at her sir percival glyde she repeated imagining that i had not heard her former reply knight or baronet i asked with an agitation that i could hide no longer she paused for a moment and then answered rather coldly baronet of course xi not a word more was said on either side as we walked back to the house miss halcombe hastened immediately to her sisters room and i withdrew to my studio to set in order all of mr fairlies drawings that i had not yet mounted and restored before i resigned them to the care of other hands thoughts that i had hitherto restrained thoughts that made my position harder than ever to endure crowded on me now that i was alone she was engaged to be married and her future husband was sir percival glyde a man of the rank of baronet and the owner of property in hampshire there were hundreds of baronets in england and dozens of landowners in hampshire judging by the ordinary rules of evidence i had not the shadow of a reason thus far for connecting sir percival glyde with the suspicious words of inquiry that had been spoken to me by the woman in white and yet i did connect him with them was it because he had now become associated in my mind with miss fairlie miss fairlie being in her turn associated with anne catherick since the night when i had discovered the ominous likeness between them had the events of the morning so unnerved me already that i was at the mercy of any delusion which common chances and common coincidences might suggest to my imagination impossible to say i could only feel that what had passed between miss halcombe and myself on our way from the summerhouse had affected me very strangely the foreboding of some undiscoverable danger lying hid from us all in the darkness of the future was strong on me the doubt whether i was not linked already to a chain of events which even my approaching departure from cumberland would be powerless to snap asunder the doubt whether we any of us saw the end as the end would really be gathered more and more darkly over my mind poignant as it was the sense of suffering caused by the miserable end of my brief presumptuous love seemed to be blunted and deadened by the still stronger sense of something obscurely impending something invisibly threatening that time was holding over our heads i had been engaged with the drawings little more than half an hour when there was a knock at the door it opened on my answering and to my surprise miss halcombe entered the room her manner was angry and agitated she caught up a chair for herself before i could give her one and sat down in it close at my side mr hartright she said i had hoped that all painful subjects of conversation were exhausted between us for today at least but it is not to be so there is some underhand villainy at work to frighten my sister about her approaching marriage you saw me send the gardener on to the house with a letter addressed in a strange handwriting to miss fairlie certainly the letter is an anonymous letter a vile attempt to injure sir percival glyde in my sisters estimation it has so agitated and alarmed her that i have had the greatest possible difficulty in composing her spirits sufficiently to allow me to leave her room and come here i know this is a family matter on which i ought not to consult you and in which you can feel no concern or interest i beg your pardon miss halcombe i feel the strongest possible concern and interest in anything that affects miss fairlies happiness or yours i am glad to hear you say so you are the only person in the house or out of it who can advise me mr fairlie in his state of health and with his horror of difficulties and mysteries of all kinds is not to be thought of the clergyman is a good weak man who knows nothing out of the routine of his duties and our neighbours are just the sort of comfortable jogtrot acquaintances whom one cannot disturb in times of trouble and danger what i want to know is this ought i at once to take such steps as i can to discover the writer of the letter or ought i to wait and apply to mr fairlies legal adviser tomorrow it is a question perhaps a very important one of gaining or losing a day tell me what you think mr hartright if necessity had not already obliged me to take you into my confidence under very delicate circumstances even my helpless situation would perhaps be no excuse for me but as things are i cannot surely be wrong after all that has passed between us in forgetting that you are a friend of only three months standing she gave me the letter it began abruptly without any preliminary form of address as follows do you believe in dreams i hope for your own sake that you do see what scripture says about dreams and their fulfilment genesis xl xli daniel iv and take the warning i send you before it is too late last night i dreamed about you miss fairlie i dreamed that i was standing inside the communion rails of a church i on one side of the altartable and the clergyman with his surplice and his prayerbook on the other after a time there walked towards us down the aisle of the church a man and a woman coming to be married you were the woman you looked so pretty and innocent in your beautiful white silk dress and your long white lace veil that my heart felt for you and the tears came into my eyes they were tears of pity young lady that heaven blesses and instead of falling from my eyes like the everyday tears that we all of us shed they turned into two rays of light which slanted nearer and nearer to the man standing at the altar with you till they touched his breast the two rays sprang ill arches like two rainbows between me and him i looked along them and i saw down into his inmost heart the outside of the man you were marrying was fair enough to see he was neither tall nor short he was a little below the middle size a light active highspirited man about fiveandforty years old to look at he had a pale face and was bald over the forehead but had dark hair on the rest of his head his beard was shaven on his chin but was let to grow of a fine rich brown on his cheeks and his upper lip his eyes were brown too and very bright his nose straight and handsome and delicate enough to have done for a womans his hands the same he was troubled from time to time with a dry hacking cough and when he put up his white right hand to his mouth he showed the red scar of an old wound across the back of it have i dreamt of the right man you know best miss fairlie and you can say if i was deceived or not read next what i saw beneath the outside i entreat you read and profit i looked along the two rays of light and i saw down into his inmost heart it was black as night and on it were written in the red flaming letters which are the handwriting of the fallen angel without pity and without remorse he has strewn with misery the paths of others and he will live to strew with misery the path of this woman by his side i read that and then the rays of light shifted and pointed over his shoulder and there behind him stood a fiend laughing and the rays of light shifted once more and pointed over your shoulder and there behind you stood an angel weeping and the rays of light shifted for the third time and pointed straight between you and that man they widened and widened thrusting you both asunder one from the other and the clergyman looked for the marriageservice in vain it was gone out of the book and he shut up the leaves and put it from him in despair and i woke with my eyes full of tears and my heart beating for i believe in dreams believe too miss fairlie i beg of you for your own sake believe as i do joseph and daniel and others in scripture believed in dreams inquire into the past life of that man with the scar on his hand before you say the words that make you his miserable wife i dont give you this warning on my account but on yours i have an interest in your wellbeing that will live as long as i draw breath your mothers daughter has a tender place in my heart for your mother was my first my best my only friend there the extraordinary letter ended without signature of any sort the handwriting afforded no prospect of a clue it was traced on ruled lines in the cramped conventional copybook character technically termed small hand it was feeble and faint and defaced by blots but had otherwise nothing to distinguish it that is not an illiterate letter said miss halcombe and at the same time it is surely too incoherent to be the letter of an educated person in the higher ranks of life the reference to the bridal dress and veil and other little expressions seem to point to it as the production of some woman what do you think mr hartright i think so too it seems to me to be not only the letter of a woman but of a woman whose mind must be deranged suggested miss halcombe it struck me in that light too i did not answer while i was speaking my eyes rested on the last sentence of the letter your mothers daughter has a tender place in my heart for your mother was my first my best my only friend those words and the doubt which had just escaped me as to the sanity of the writer of the letter acting together on my mind suggested an idea which i was literally afraid to express openly or even to encourage secretly i began to doubt whether my own faculties were not in danger of losing their balance it seemed almost like a monomania to be tracing back everything strange that happened everything unexpected that was said always to the same hidden source and the same sinister influence i resolved this time in defence of my own courage and my own sense to come to no decision that plain fact did not warrant and to turn my back resolutely on everything that tempted me in the shape of surmise if we have any chance of tracing the person who has written this i said returning the letter to miss halcombe there can be no harm in seizing our opportunity the moment it offers i think we ought to speak to the gardener again about the elderly woman who gave him the letter and then to continue our inquiries in the village but first let me ask a question you mentioned just now the alternative of consulting mr fairlies legal adviser tomorrow is there no possibility of communicating with him earlier why not today i can only explain replied miss halcombe by entering into certain particulars connected with my sisters marriage engagement which i did not think it necessary or desirable to mention to you this morning one of sir percival glydes objects in coming here on monday is to fix the period of his marriage which has hitherto been left quite unsettled he is anxious that the event should take place before the end of the year does miss fairlie know of that wish i asked eagerly she has no suspicion of it and after what has happened i shall not take the responsibility upon myself of enlightening her sir percival has only mentioned his views to mr fairlie who has told me himself that he is ready and anxious as lauras guardian to forward them he has written to london to the family solicitor mr gilmore mr gilmore happens to be away in glasgow on business and he has replied by proposing to stop at limmeridge house on his way back to town he will arrive tomorrow and will stay with us a few days so as to allow sir percival time to plead his own cause if he succeeds mr gilmore will then return to london taking with him his instructions for my sisters marriage settlement you understand now mr hartright why i speak of waiting to take legal advice until tomorrow mr gilmore is the old and tried friend of two generations of fairlies and we can trust him as we could trust no one else the marriagesettlement the mere hearing of those two words stung me with a jealous despair that was poison to my higher and better instincts i began to think it is hard to confess this but i must suppress nothing from beginning to end of the terrible story that i now stand committed to reveal i began to think with a hateful eagerness of hope of the vague charges against sir percival glyde which the anonymous letter contained what if those wild accusations rested on a foundation of truth what if their truth could be proved before the fatal words of consent were spoken and the marriagesettlement was drawn i have tried to think since that the feeling which then animated me began and ended in pure devotion to miss fairlies interests but i have never succeeded in deceiving myself into believing it and i must not now attempt to deceive others the feeling began and ended in reckless vindictive hopeless hatred of the man who was to marry her if we are to find out anything i said speaking under the new influence which was now directing me we had better not let another minute slip by us unemployed i can only suggest once more the propriety of questioning the gardener a second time and of inquiring in the village immediately afterwards i think i may be of help to you in both cases said miss halcombe rising let us go mr hartright at once and do the best we can together i had the door in my hand to open it for her but i stopped on a sudden to ask an important question before we set forth one of the paragraphs of the anonymous letter i said contains some sentences of minute personal description sir percival glydes name is not mentioned i know but does that description at all resemble him accurately even in stating his age to be fortyfive fortyfive and she was not yet twentyone men of his age married wives of her age every day and experience had shown those marriages to be often the happiest ones i knew that and yet even the mention of his age when i contrasted it with hers added to my blind hatred and distrust of him accurately miss halcombe continued even to the scar on his right hand which is the scar of a wound that he received years since when he was travelling in italy there can be no doubt that every peculiarity of his personal appearance is thoroughly well known to the writer of the letter even a cough that he is troubled with is mentioned if i remember right yes and mentioned correctly he treats it lightly himself though it sometimes makes his friends anxious about him i suppose no whispers have ever been heard against his character mr hartright i hope you are not unjust enough to let that infamous letter influence you i felt the blood rush into my cheeks for i knew that it had influenced me i hope not i answered confusedly perhaps i had no right to ask the question i am not sorry you asked it she said for it enables me to do justice to sir percivals reputation not a whisper mr hartright has ever reached me or my family against him he has fought successfully two contested elections and has come out of the ordeal unscathed a man who can do that in england is a man whose character is established i opened the door for her in silence and followed her out she had not convinced me if the recording angel had come down from heaven to confirm her and had opened his book to my mortal eyes the recording angel would not have convinced me we found the gardener at work as usual no amount of questioning could extract a single answer of any importance from the lads impenetrable stupidity the woman who had given him the letter was an elderly woman she had not spoken a word to him and she had gone away towards the south in a great hurry that was all the gardener could tell us the village lay southward of the house so to the village we went next xii our inquiries at limmeridge were patiently pursued in all directions and among all sorts and conditions of people but nothing came of them three of the villagers did certainly assure us that they had seen the woman but as they were quite unable to describe her and quite incapable of agreeing about the exact direction in which she was proceeding when they last saw her these three bright exceptions to the general rule of total ignorance afforded no more real assistance to us than the mass of their unhelpful and unobservant neighbours the course of our useless investigations brought us in time to the end of the village at which the schools established by mrs fairlie were situated as we passed the side of the building appropriated to the use of the boys i suggested the propriety of making a last inquiry of the schoolmaster whom we might presume to be in virtue of his office the most intelligent man in the place i am afraid the schoolmaster must have been occupied with his scholars said miss halcombe just at the time when the woman passed through the village and returned again however we can but try we entered the playground enclosure and walked by the schoolroom window to get round to the door which was situated at the back of the building i stopped for a moment at the window and looked in the schoolmaster was sitting at his high desk with his back to me apparently haranguing the pupils who were all gathered together in front of him with one exception the one exception was a sturdy whiteheaded boy standing apart from all the rest on a stool in a corner a forlorn little crusoe isolated in his own desert island of solitary penal disgrace the door when we got round to it was ajar and the school masters voice reached us plainly as we both stopped for a minute under the porch now boys said the voice mind what i tell you if i hear another word spoken about ghosts in this school it will be the worse for all of you there are no such things as ghosts and therefore any boy who believes in ghosts believes in what cant possibly be and a boy who belongs to limmeridge school and believes in what cant possibly be sets up his back against reason and discipline and must be punished accordingly you all see jacob postlethwaite standing up on the stool there in disgrace he has been punished not because he said he saw a ghost last night but because he is too impudent and too obstinate to listen to reason and because he persists in saying he saw the ghost after i have told him that no such thing can possibly be if nothing else will do i mean to cane the ghost out of jacob postlethwaite and if the thing spreads among any of the rest of you i mean to go a step farther and cane the ghost out of the whole school we seem to have chosen an awkward moment for our visit said miss halcombe pushing open the door at the end of the schoolmasters address and leading the way in our appearance produced a strong sensation among the boys they appeared to think that we had arrived for the express purpose of seeing jacob postlethwaite caned go home all of you to dinner said the schoolmaster except jacob jacob must stop where he is and the ghost may bring him his dinner if the ghost pleases jacobs fortitude deserted him at the double disappearance of his schoolfellows and his prospect of dinner he took his hands out of his pockets looked hard at his knuckles raised them with great deliberation to his eyes and when they got there ground them round and round slowly accompanying the action by short spasms of sniffing which followed each other at regular intervals the nasal minute guns of juvenile distress we came here to ask you a question mr dempster said miss halcombe addressing the schoolmaster and we little expected to find you occupied in exorcising a ghost what does it all mean what has really happened that wicked boy has been frightening the whole school miss halcombe by declaring that he saw a ghost yesterday evening answered the master and he still persists in his absurd story in spite of all that i can say to him most extraordinary said miss halcombe i should not have thought it possible that any of the boys had imagination enough to see a ghost this is a new accession indeed to the hard labour of forming the youthful mind at limmeridge and i heartily wish you well through it mr dempster in the meantime let me explain why you see me here and what it is i want she then put the same question to the schoolmaster which we had asked already of almost every one else in the village it was met by the same discouraging answer mr dempster had not set eyes on the stranger of whom we were in search we may as well return to the house mr hartright said miss halcombe the information we want is evidently not to be found she had bowed to mr dempster and was about to leave the schoolroom when the forlorn position of jacob postlethwaite piteously sniffing on the stool of penitence attracted her attention as she passed him and made her stop goodhumouredly to speak a word to the little prisoner before she opened the door you foolish boy she said why dont you beg mr dempsters pardon and hold your tongue about the ghost eh but i saw t ghaist persisted jacob postlethwaite with a stare of terror and a burst of tears stuff and nonsense you saw nothing of the kind ghost indeed what ghost i beg your pardon miss halcombe interposed the schoolmaster a little uneasily but i think you had better not question the boy the obstinate folly of his story is beyond all belief and you might lead him into ignorantly ignorantly what inquired miss halcombe sharply ignorantly shocking your feelings said mr dempster looking very much discomposed upon my word mr dempster you pay my feelings a great compliment in thinking them weak enough to be shocked by such an urchin as that she turned with an air of satirical defiance to little jacob and began to question him directly come she said i mean to know all about this you naughty boy when did you see the ghost yestereen at the gloaming replied jacob oh you saw it yesterday evening in the twilight and what was it like arl in white as a ghaist should be answered the ghostseer with a confidence beyond his years and where was it away yander in t kirkyard where a ghaist ought to be as a ghaist should be where a ghaist ought to be why you little fool you talk as if the manners and customs of ghosts had been familiar to you from your infancy you have got your story at your fingers ends at any rate i suppose i shall hear next that you can actually tell me whose ghost it was eh but i just can replied jacob nodding his head with an air of gloomy triumph mr dempster had already tried several times to speak while miss halcombe was examining his pupil and he now interposed resolutely enough to make himself heard excuse me miss halcombe he said if i venture to say that you are only encouraging the boy by asking him these questions i will merely ask one more mr dempster and then i shall be quite satisfied well she continued turning to the boy and whose ghost was it t ghaist of mistress fairlie answered jacob in a whisper the effect which this extraordinary reply produced on miss halcombe fully justified the anxiety which the schoolmaster had shown to prevent her from hearing it her face crimsoned with indignation she turned upon little jacob with an angry suddenness which terrified him into a fresh burst of tears opened her lips to speak to him then controlled herself and addressed the master instead of the boy it is useless she said to hold such a child as that responsible for what he says i have little doubt that the idea has been put into his head by others if there are people in this village mr dempster who have forgotten the respect and gratitude due from every soul in it to my mothers memory i will find them out and if i have any influence with mr fairlie they shall suffer for it i hope indeed i am sure miss halcombe that you are mistaken said the schoolmaster the matter begins and ends with the boys own perversity and folly he saw or thought he saw a woman in white yesterday evening as he was passing the churchyard and the figure real or fancied was standing by the marble cross which he and every one else in limmeridge knows to be the monument over mrs fairlies grave these two circumstances are surely sufficient to have suggested to the boy himself the answer which has so naturally shocked you although miss halcombe did not seem to be convinced she evidently felt that the schoolmasters statement of the case was too sensible to be openly combated she merely replied by thanking him for his attention and by promising to see him again when her doubts were satisfied this said she bowed and led the way out of the schoolroom throughout the whole of this strange scene i had stood apart listening attentively and drawing my own conclusions as soon as we were alone again miss halcombe asked me if i had formed any opinion on what i had heard a very strong opinion i answered the boys story as i believe has a foundation in fact i confess i am anxious to see the monument over mrs fairlies grave and to examine the ground about it you shall see the grave she paused after making that reply and reflected a little as we walked on what has happened in the schoolroom she resumed has so completely distracted my attention from the subject of the letter that i feel a little bewildered when i try to return to it must we give up all idea of making any further inquiries and wait to place the thing in mr gilmores hands tomorrow by no means miss halcombe what has happened in the schoolroom encourages me to persevere in the investigation why does it encourage you because it strengthens a suspicion i felt when you gave me the letter to read i suppose you had your reasons mr hartright for concealing that suspicion from me till this moment i was afraid to encourage it in myself i thought it was utterly preposterous i distrusted it as the result of some perversity in my own imagination but i can do so no longer not only the boys own answers to your questions but even a chance expression that dropped from the schoolmasters lips in explaining his story have forced the idea back into my mind events may yet prove that idea to be a delusion miss halcombe but the belief is strong in me at this moment that the fancied ghost in the churchyard and the writer of the anonymous letter are one and the same person she stopped turned pale and looked me eagerly in the face what person the schoolmaster unconsciously told you when he spoke of the figure that the boy saw in the churchyard he called it a woman in white not anne catherick yes anne catherick she put her hand through my arm and leaned on it heavily i dont know why she said in low tones but there is something in this suspicion of yours that seems to startle and unnerve me i feel she stopped and tried to laugh it off mr hartright she went on i will show you the grave and then go back at once to the house i had better not leave laura too long alone i had better go back and sit with her we were close to the churchyard when she spoke the church a dreary building of grey stone was situated in a little valley so as to be sheltered from the bleak winds blowing over the moorland all round it the burialground advanced from the side of the church a little way up the slope of the hill it was surrounded by a rough low stone wall and was bare and open to the sky except at one extremity where a brook trickled down the stony hillside and a clump of dwarf trees threw their narrow shadows over the short meagre grass just beyond the brook and the trees and not far from one of the three stone stiles which afforded entrance at various points to the churchyard rose the white marble cross that distinguished mrs fairlies grave from the humbler monuments scattered about it i need go no farther with you said miss halcombe pointing to the grave you will let me know if you find anything to confirm the idea you have just mentioned to me let us meet again at the house she left me i descended at once to the churchyard and crossed the stile which led directly to mrs fairlies grave the grass about it was too short and the ground too hard to show any marks of footsteps disappointed thus far i next looked attentively at the cross and at the square block of marble below it on which the inscription was cut the natural whiteness of the cross was a little clouded here and there by weather stains and rather more than one half of the square block beneath it on the side which bore the inscription was in the same condition the other half however attracted my attention at once by its singular freedom from stain or impurity of any kind i looked closer and saw that it had been cleaned recently cleaned in a downward direction from top to bottom the boundary line between the part that had been cleaned and the part that had not was traceable wherever the inscription left a blank space of marble sharply traceable as a line that had been produced by artificial means who had begun the cleansing of the marble and who had left it unfinished i looked about me wondering how the question was to be solved no sign of a habitation could be discerned from the point at which i was standing the burialground was left in the lonely possession of the dead i returned to the church and walked round it till i came to the back of the building then crossed the boundary wall beyond by another of the stone stiles and found myself at the head of a path leading down into a deserted stone quarry against one side of the quarry a little tworoom cottage was built and just outside the door an old woman was engaged in washing i walked up to her and entered into conversation about the church and burialground she was ready enough to talk and almost the first words she said informed me that her husband filled the two offices of clerk and sexton i said a few words next in praise of mrs fairlies monument the old woman shook her head and told me i had not seen it at its best it was her husbands business to look after it but he had been so ailing and weak for months and months past that he had hardly been able to crawl into church on sundays to do his duty and the monument had been neglected in consequence he was getting a little better now and in a week or ten days time he hoped to be strong enough to set to work and clean it this information extracted from a long rambling answer in the broadest cumberland dialect told me all that i most wanted to know i gave the poor woman a trifle and returned at once to limmeridge house the partial cleansing of the monument had evidently been accomplished by a strange hand connecting what i had discovered thus far with what i had suspected after hearing the story of the ghost seen at twilight i wanted nothing more to confirm my resolution to watch mrs fairlies grave in secret that evening returning to it at sunset and waiting within sight of it till the night fell the work of cleansing the monument had been left unfinished and the person by whom it had been begun might return to complete it on getting back to the house i informed miss halcombe of what i intended to do she looked surprised and uneasy while i was explaining my purpose but she made no positive objection to the execution of it she only said i hope it may end well just as she was leaving me again i stopped her to inquire as calmly as i could after miss fairlies health she was in better spirits and miss halcombe hoped she might be induced to take a little walking exercise while the afternoon sun lasted i returned to my own room to resume setting the drawings in order it was necessary to do this and doubly necessary to keep my mind employed on anything that would help to distract my attention from myself and from the hopeless future that lay before me from time to time i paused in my work to look out of window and watch the sky as the sun sank nearer and nearer to the horizon on one of those occasions i saw a figure on the broad gravel walk under my window it was miss fairlie i had not seen her since the morning and i had hardly spoken to her then another day at limmeridge was all that remained to me and after that day my eyes might never look on her again this thought was enough to hold me at the window i had sufficient consideration for her to arrange the blind so that she might not see me if she looked up but i had no strength to resist the temptation of letting my eyes at least follow her as far as they could on her walk she was dressed in a brown cloak with a plain black silk gown under it on her head was the same simple straw hat which she had worn on the morning when we first met a veil was attached to it now which hid her face from me by her side trotted a little italian greyhound the pet companion of all her walks smartly dressed in a scarlet cloth wrapper to keep the sharp air from his delicate skin she did not seem to notice the dog she walked straight forward with her head drooping a little and her arms folded in her cloak the dead leaves which had whirled in the wind before me when i had heard of her marriage engagement in the morning whirled in the wind before her and rose and fell and scattered themselves at her feet as she walked on in the pale waning sunlight the dog shivered and trembled and pressed against her dress impatiently for notice and encouragement but she never heeded him she walked on farther and farther away from me with the dead leaves whirling about her on the path walked on till my aching eyes could see her no more and i was left alone again with my own heavy heart in another hours time i had done my work and the sunset was at hand i got my hat and coat in the hall and slipped out of the house without meeting any one the clouds were wild in the western heaven and the wind blew chill from the sea far as the shore was the sound of the surf swept over the intervening moorland and beat drearily in my ears when i entered the churchyard not a living creature was in sight the place looked lonelier than ever as i chose my position and waited and watched with my eyes on the white cross that rose over mrs fairlies grave xiii the exposed situation of the churchyard had obliged me to be cautious in choosing the position that i was to occupy the main entrance to the church was on the side next to the burialground and the door was screened by a porch walled in on either side after some little hesitation caused by natural reluctance to conceal myself indispensable as that concealment was to the object in view i had resolved on entering the porch a loophole window was pierced in each of its side walls through one of these windows i could see mrs fairlies grave the other looked towards the stone quarry in which the sextons cottage was built before me fronting the porch entrance was a patch of bare burialground a line of low stone wall and a strip of lonely brown hill with the sunset clouds sailing heavily over it before the strong steady wind no living creature was visible or audible no bird flew by me no dog barked from the sextons cottage the pauses in the dull beating of the surf were filled up by the dreary rustling of the dwarf trees near the grave and the cold faint bubble of the brook over its stony bed a dreary scene and a dreary hour my spirits sank fast as i counted out the minutes of the evening in my hidingplace under the church porch it was not twilight yet the light of the setting sun still lingered in the heavens and little more than the first halfhour of my solitary watch had elapsed when i heard footsteps and a voice the footsteps were approaching from the other side of the church and the voice was a womans dont you fret my dear about the letter said the voice i gave it to the lad quite safe and the lad he took it from me without a word he went his way and i went mine and not a living soul followed me afterwards that ill warrant these words strung up my attention to a pitch of expectation that was almost painful there was a pause of silence but the footsteps still advanced in another moment two persons both women passed within my range of view from the porch window they were walking straight towards the grave and therefore they had their backs turned towards me one of the women was dressed in a bonnet and shawl the other wore a long travellingcloak of a darkblue colour with the hood drawn over her head a few inches of her gown were visible below the cloak my heart beat fast as i noted the colour it was white after advancing about halfway between the church and the grave they stopped and the woman in the cloak turned her head towards her companion but her side face which a bonnet might now have allowed me to see was hidden by the heavy projecting edge of the hood mind you keep that comfortable warm cloak on said the same voice which i had already heard the voice of the woman in the shawl mrs todd is right about your looking too particular yesterday all in white ill walk about a little while youre here churchyards being not at all in my way whatever they may be in yours finish what you want to do before i come back and let us be sure and get home again before night with those words she turned about and retracing her steps advanced with her face towards me it was the face of an elderly woman brown rugged and healthy with nothing dishonest or suspicious in the look of it close to the church she stopped to pull her shawl closer round her queer she said to herself always queer with her whims and her ways ever since i can remember her harmless though as harmless poor soul as a little child she sighed looked about the burialground nervously shook her head as if the dreary prospect by no means pleased her and disappeared round the corner of the church i doubted for a moment whether i ought to follow and speak to her or not my intense anxiety to find myself face to face with her companion helped me to decide in the negative i could ensure seeing the woman in the shawl by waiting near the churchyard until she came back although it seemed more than doubtful whether she could give me the information of which i was in search the person who had delivered the letter was of little consequence the person who had written it was the one centre of interest and the one source of information and that person i now felt convinced was before me in the churchyard while these ideas were passing through my mind i saw the woman in the cloak approach close to the grave and stand looking at it for a little while she then glanced all round her and taking a white linen cloth or handkerchief from under her cloak turned aside towards the brook the little stream ran into the churchyard under a tiny archway in the bottom of the wall and ran out again after a winding course of a few dozen yards under a similar opening she dipped the cloth in the water and returned to the grave i saw her kiss the white cross then kneel down before the inscription and apply her wet cloth to the cleansing of it after considering how i could show myself with the least possible chance of frightening her i resolved to cross the wall before me to skirt round it outside and to enter the churchyard again by the stile near the grave in order that she might see me as i approached she was so absorbed over her employment that she did not hear me coming until i had stepped over the stile then she looked up started to her feet with a faint cry and stood facing me in speechless and motionless terror dont be frightened i said surely you remember me i stopped while i spoke then advanced a few steps gently then stopped again and so approached by little and little till i was close to her if there had been any doubt still left in my mind it must have been now set at rest there speaking affrightedly for itself there was the same face confronting me over mrs fairlies grave which had first looked into mine on the highroad by night you remember me i said we met very late and i helped you to find the way to london surely you have not forgotten that her features relaxed and she drew a heavy breath of relief i saw the new life of recognition stirring slowly under the death like stillness which fear had set on her face dont attempt to speak to me just yet i went on take time to recover yourself take time to feel quite certain that i am a friend you are very kind to me she murmured as kind now as you were then she stopped and i kept silence on my side i was not granting time for composure to her only i was gaining time also for myself under the wan wild evening light that woman and i were met together again a grave between us the dead about us the lonesome hills closing us round on every side the time the place the circumstances under which we now stood face to face in the evening stillness of that dreary valley the lifelong interests which might hang suspended on the next chance words that passed between us the sense that for aught i knew to the contrary the whole future of laura fairlies life might be determined for good or for evil by my winning or losing the confidence of the forlorn creature who stood trembling by her mothers grave all threatened to shake the steadiness and the selfcontrol on which every inch of the progress i might yet make now depended i tried hard as i felt this to possess myself of all my resources i did my utmost to turn the few moments for reflection to the best account are you calmer now i said as soon as i thought it time to speak again can you talk to me without feeling frightened and without forgetting that i am a friend how did you come here she asked without noticing what i had just said to her dont you remember my telling you when we last met that i was going to cumberland i have been in cumberland ever since i have been staying all the time at limmeridge house at limmeridge house her pale face brightened as she repeated the words her wandering eyes fixed on me with a sudden interest ah how happy you must have been she said looking at me eagerly without a shadow of its former distrust left in her expression i took advantage of her newlyaroused confidence in me to observe her face with an attention and a curiosity which i had hitherto restrained myself from showing for cautions sake i looked at her with my mind full of that other lovely face which had so ominously recalled her to my memory on the terrace by moonlight i had seen anne cathericks likeness in miss fairlie i now saw miss fairlies likeness in anne catherick saw it all the more clearly because the points of dissimilarity between the two were presented to me as well as the points of resemblance in the general outline of the countenance and general proportion of the features in the colour of the hair and in the little nervous uncertainty about the lips in the height and size of the figure and the carriage of the head and body the likeness appeared even more startling than i had ever felt it to be yet but there the resemblance ended and the dissimilarity in details began the delicate beauty of miss fairlies complexion the transparent clearness of her eyes the smooth purity of her skin the tender bloom of colour on her lips were all missing from the worn weary face that was now turned towards mine although i hated myself even for thinking such a thing still while i looked at the woman before me the idea would force itself into my mind that one sad change in the future was all that was wanting to make the likeness complete which i now saw to be so imperfect in detail if ever sorrow and suffering set their profaning marks on the youth and beauty of miss fairlies face then and then only anne catherick and she would be the twinsisters of chance resemblance the living reflections of one another i shuddered at the thought there was something horrible in the blind unreasoning distrust of the future which the mere passage of it through my mind seemed to imply it was a welcome interruption to be roused by feeling anne cathericks hand laid on my shoulder the touch was as stealthy and as sudden as that other touch which had petrified me from head to foot on the night when we first met you are looking at me and you are thinking of something she said with her strange breathless rapidity of utterance what is it nothing extraordinary i answered i was only wondering how you came here i came with a friend who is very good to me i have only been here two days and you found your way to this place yesterday how do you know that i only guessed it she turned from me and knelt down before the inscription once more where should i go if not here she said the friend who was better than a mother to me is the only friend i have to visit at limmeridge oh it makes my heart ache to see a stain on her tomb it ought to be kept white as snow for her sake i was tempted to begin cleaning it yesterday and i cant help coming back to go on with it today is there anything wrong in that i hope not surely nothing can be wrong that i do for mrs fairlies sake the old grateful sense of her benefactresss kindness was evidently the ruling idea still in the poor creatures mind the narrow mind which had but too plainly opened to no other lasting impression since that first impression of her younger and happier days i saw that my best chance of winning her confidence lay in encouraging her to proceed with the artless employment which she had come into the burialground to pursue she resumed it at once on my telling her she might do so touching the hard marble as tenderly as if it had been a sentient thing and whispering the words of the inscription to herself over and over again as if the lost days of her girlhood had returned and she was patiently learning her lesson once more at mrs fairlies knees should you wonder very much i said preparing the way as cautiously as i could for the questions that were to come if i owned that it is a satisfaction to me as well as a surprise to see you here i felt very uneasy about you after you left me in the cab she looked up quickly and suspiciously uneasy she repeated why a strange thing happened after we parted that night two men overtook me in a chaise they did not see where i was standing but they stopped near me and spoke to a policeman on the other side of the way she instantly suspended her employment the hand holding the damp cloth with which she had been cleaning the inscription dropped to her side the other hand grasped the marble cross at the head of the grave her face turned towards me slowly with the blank look of terror set rigidly on it once more i went on at all hazards it was too late now to draw back the two men spoke to the policeman i said and asked him if he had seen you he had not seen you and then one of the men spoke again and said you had escaped from his asylum she sprang to her feet as if my last words had set the pursuers on her track stop and hear the end i cried stop and you shall know how i befriended you a word from me would have told the men which way you had gone and i never spoke that word i helped your escape i made it safe and certain think try to think try to understand what i tell you my manner seemed to influence her more than my words she made an effort to grasp the new idea her hands shifted the damp cloth hesitatingly from one to the other exactly as they had shifted the little travellingbag on the night when i first saw her slowly the purpose of my words seemed to force its way through the confusion and agitation of her mind slowly her features relaxed and her eyes looked at me with their expression gaining in curiosity what it was fast losing in fear you dont think i ought to be back in the asylum do you she said certainly not i am glad you escaped from it i am glad i helped you yes yes you did help me indeed you helped me at the hard part she went on a little vacantly it was easy to escape or i should not have got away they never suspected me as they suspected the others i was so quiet and so obedient and so easily frightened the finding london was the hard part and there you helped me did i thank you at the time i thank you now very kindly was the asylum far from where you met me come show that you believe me to be your friend and tell me where it was she mentioned the place a private asylum as its situation informed me a private asylum not very far from the spot where i had seen her and then with evident suspicion of the use to which i might put her answer anxiously repeated her former inquiry you dont think i ought to be taken back do you once again i am glad you escaped i am glad you prospered well after you left me i answered you said you had a friend in london to go to did you find the friend yes it was very late but there was a girl up at needlework in the house and she helped me to rouse mrs clements mrs clements is my friend a good kind woman but not like mrs fairlie ah no nobody is like mrs fairlie is mrs clements an old friend of yours have you known her a long time yes she was a neighbour of ours once at home in hampshire and liked me and took care of me when i was a little girl years ago when she went away from us she wrote down in my prayerbook for me where she was going to live in london and she said if you are ever in trouble anne come to me i have no husband alive to say me nay and no children to look after and i will take care of you kind words were they not i suppose i remember them because they were kind its little enough i remember besides little enough little enough had you no father or mother to take care of you father i never saw him i never heard mother speak of him father ah dear he is dead i suppose and your mother i dont get on well with her we are a trouble and a fear to each other a trouble and a fear to each other at those words the suspicion crossed my mind for the first time that her mother might be the person who had placed her under restraint dont ask me about mother she went on id rather talk of mrs clements mrs clements is like you she doesnt think that i ought to be back in the asylum and she is as glad as you are that i escaped from it she cried over my misfortune and said it must be kept secret from everybody her misfortune in what sense was she using that word in a sense which might explain her motive in writing the anonymous letter in a sense which might show it to be the too common and too customary motive that has led many a woman to interpose anonymous hindrances to the marriage of the man who has ruined her i resolved to attempt the clearing up of this doubt before more words passed between us on either side what misfortune i asked the misfortune of my being shut up she answered with every appearance of feeling surprised at my question what other misfortune could there be i determined to persist as delicately and forbearingly as possible it was of very great importance that i should be absolutely sure of every step in the investigation which i now gained in advance there is another misfortune i said to which a woman may be liable and by which she may suffer lifelong sorrow and shame what is it she asked eagerly the misfortune of believing too innocently in her own virtue and in the faith and honour of the man she loves i answered she looked up at me with the artless bewilderment of a child not the slightest confusion or change of colour not the faintest trace of any secret consciousness of shame struggling to the surface appeared in her face that face which betrayed every other emotion with such transparent clearness no words that ever were spoken could have assured me as her look and manner now assured me that the motive which i had assigned for her writing the letter and sending it to miss fairlie was plainly and distinctly the wrong one that doubt at any rate was now set at rest but the very removal of it opened a new prospect of uncertainty the letter as i knew from positive testimony pointed at sir percival glyde though it did not name him she must have had some strong motive originating in some deep sense of injury for secretly denouncing him to miss fairlie in such terms as she had employed and that motive was unquestionably not to be traced to the loss of her innocence and her character whatever wrong he might have inflicted on her was not of that nature of what nature could it be i dont understand you she said after evidently trying hard and trying in vain to discover the meaning of the words i had last said to her never mind i answered let us go on with what we were talking about tell me how long you stayed with mrs clements in london and how you came here how long she repeated i stayed with mrs clements till we both came to this place two days ago you are living in the village then i said it is strange i should not have heard of you though you have only been here two days no no not in the village three miles away at a farm do you know the farm they call it todds corner i remembered the place perfectly we had often passed by it in our drives it was one of the oldest farms in the neighbourhood situated in a solitary sheltered spot inland at the junction of two hills they are relations of mrs clements at todds corner she went on and they had often asked her to go and see them she said she would go and take me with her for the quiet and the fresh air it was very kind was it not i would have gone anywhere to be quiet and safe and out of the way but when i heard that todds corner was near limmeridge oh i was so happy i would have walked all the way barefoot to get there and see the schools and the village and limmeridge house again they are very good people at todds corner i hope i shall stay there a long time there is only one thing i dont like about them and dont like about mrs clements what is it they will tease me about dressing all in white they say it looks so particular how do they know mrs fairlie knew best mrs fairlie would never have made me wear this ugly blue cloak ah she was fond of white in her lifetime and here is white stone about her grave and i am making it whiter for her sake she often wore white herself and she always dressed her little daughter in white is miss fairlie well and happy does she wear white now as she used when she was a girl her voice sank when she put the questions about miss fairlie and she turned her head farther and farther away from me i thought i detected in the alteration of her manner an uneasy consciousness of the risk she had run in sending the anonymous letter and i instantly determined so to frame my answer as to surprise her into owning it miss fairlie was not very well or very happy this morning i said she murmured a few words but they were spoken so confusedly and in such a low tone that i could not even guess at what they meant did you ask me why miss fairlie was neither well nor happy this morning i continued no she said quickly and eagerly oh no i never asked that i will tell you without your asking i went on miss fairlie has received your letter she had been down on her knees for some little time past carefully removing the last weatherstains left about the inscription while we were speaking together the first sentence of the words i had just addressed to her made her pause in her occupation and turn slowly without rising from her knees so as to face me the second sentence literally petrified her the cloth she had been holding dropped from her hands her lips fell apart all the little colour that there was naturally in her face left it in an instant how do you know she said faintly who showed it to you the blood rushed back into her face rushed overwhelmingly as the sense rushed upon her mind that her own words had betrayed her she struck her hands together in despair i never wrote it she gasped affrightedly i know nothing about it yes i said you wrote it and you know about it it was wrong to send such a letter it was wrong to frighten miss fairlie if you had anything to say that it was right and necessary for her to hear you should have gone yourself to limmeridge house you should have spoken to the young lady with your own lips she crouched down over the flat stone of the grave till her face was hidden on it and made no reply miss fairlie will be as good and kind to you as her mother was if you mean well i went on miss fairlie will keep your secret and not let you come to any harm will you see her to morrow at the farm will you meet her in the garden at limmeridge house oh if i could die and be hidden and at rest with you her lips murmured the words close on the gravestone murmured them in tones of passionate endearment to the dead remains beneath you know how i love your child for your sake oh mrs fairlie mrs fairlie tell me how to save her be my darling and my mother once more and tell me what to do for the best i heard her lips kissing the stone i saw her hands beating on it passionately the sound and the sight deeply affected me i stooped down and took the poor helpless hands tenderly in mine and tried to soothe her it was useless she snatched her hands from me and never moved her face from the stone seeing the urgent necessity of quieting her at any hazard and by any means i appealed to the only anxiety that she appeared to feel in connection with me and with my opinion of her the anxiety to convince me of her fitness to be mistress of her own actions come come i said gently try to compose yourself or you will make me alter my opinion of you dont let me think that the person who put you in the asylum might have had some excuse the next words died away on my lips the instant i risked that chance reference to the person who had put her in the asylum she sprang up on her knees a most extraordinary and startling change passed over her her face at all ordinary times so touching to look at in its nervous sensitiveness weakness and uncertainty became suddenly darkened by an expression of maniacally intense hatred and fear which communicated a wild unnatural force to every feature her eyes dilated in the dim evening light like the eyes of a wild animal she caught up the cloth that had fallen at her side as if it had been a living creature that she could kill and crushed it in both her hands with such convulsive strength that the few drops of moisture left in it trickled down on the stone beneath her talk of something else she said whispering through her teeth i shall lose myself if you talk of that every vestige of the gentler thoughts which had filled her mind hardly a minute since seemed to be swept from it now it was evident that the impression left by mrs fairlies kindness was not as i had supposed the only strong impression on her memory with the grateful remembrance of her schooldays at limmeridge there existed the vindictive remembrance of the wrong inflicted on her by her confinement in the asylum who had done that wrong could it really be her mother it was hard to give up pursuing the inquiry to that final point but i forced myself to abandon all idea of continuing it seeing her as i saw her now it would have been cruel to think of anything but the necessity and the humanity of restoring her composure i will talk of nothing to distress you i said soothingly you want something she answered sharply and suspiciously dont look at me like that speak to me tell me what you want i only want you to quiet yourself and when you are calmer to think over what i have said said she paused twisted the cloth in her hands backwards and forwards and whispered to herself what is it he said she turned again towards me and shook her head impatiently why dont you help me she asked with angry suddenness yes yes i said i will help you and you will soon remember i ask you to see miss fairlie tomorrow and to tell her the truth about the letter ah miss fairlie fairlie fairlie the mere utterance of the loved familiar name seemed to quiet her her face softened and grew like itself again you need have no fear of miss fairlie i continued and no fear of getting into trouble through the letter she knows so much about it already that you will have no difficulty in telling her all there can be little necessity for concealment where there is hardly anything left to conceal you mention no names in the letter but miss fairlie knows that the person you write of is sir percival glyde the instant i pronounced that name she started to her feet and a scream burst from her that rang through the churchyard and made my heart leap in me with the terror of it the dark deformity of the expression which had just left her face lowered on it once more with doubled and trebled intensity the shriek at the name the reiterated look of hatred and fear that instantly followed told all not even a last doubt now remained her mother was guiltless of imprisoning her in the asylum a man had shut her up and that man was sir percival glyde the scream had reached other ears than mine on one side i heard the door of the sextons cottage open on the other i heard the voice of her companion the woman in the shawl the woman whom she had spoken of as mrs clements im coming im coming cried the voice from behind the clump of dwarf trees in a moment more mrs clements hurried into view who are you she cried facing me resolutely as she set her foot on the stile how dare you frighten a poor helpless woman like that she was at anne cathericks side and had put one arm around her before i could answer what is it my dear she said what has he done to you nothing the poor creature answered nothing im only frightened mrs clements turned on me with a fearless indignation for which i respected her i should be heartily ashamed of myself if i deserved that angry look i said but i do not deserve it i have unfortunately startled her without intending it this is not the first time she has seen me ask her yourself and she will tell you that i am incapable of willingly harming her or any woman i spoke distinctly so that anne catherick might hear and understand me and i saw that the words and their meaning had reached her yes yes she said he was good to me once he helped me she whispered the rest into her friends ear strange indeed said mrs clements with a look of perplexity it makes all the difference though im sorry i spoke so rough to you sir but you must own that appearances looked suspicious to a stranger its more my fault than yours for humouring her whims and letting her be alone in such a place as this come my dear come home now i thought the good woman looked a little uneasy at the prospect of the walk back and i offered to go with them until they were both within sight of home mrs clements thanked me civilly and declined she said they were sure to meet some of the farm labourers as soon as they got to the moor try to forgive me i said when anne catherick took her friends arm to go away innocent as i had been of any intention to terrify and agitate her my heart smote me as i looked at the poor pale frightened face i will try she answered but you know too much im afraid youll always frighten me now mrs clements glanced at me and shook her head pityingly goodnight sir she said you couldnt help it i know but i wish it was me you had frightened and not her they moved away a few steps i thought they had left me but anne suddenly stopped and separated herself from her friend wait a little she said i must say goodbye she returned to the grave rested both hands tenderly on the marble cross and kissed it im better now she sighed looking up at me quietly i forgive you she joined her companion again and they left the burialground i saw them stop near the church and speak to the sextons wife who had come from the cottage and had waited watching us from a distance then they went on again up the path that led to the moor i looked after anne catherick as she disappeared till all trace of her had faded in the twilight looked as anxiously and sorrowfully as if that was the last i was to see in this weary world of the woman in white xiv half an hour later i was back at the house and was informing miss halcombe of all that had happened she listened to me from beginning to end with a steady silent attention which in a woman of her temperament and disposition was the strongest proof that could be offered of the serious manner in which my narrative affected her my mind misgives me was all she said when i had done my mind misgives me sadly about the future the future may depend i suggested on the use we make of the present it is not improbable that anne catherick may speak more readily and unreservedly to a woman than she has spoken to me if miss fairlie not to be thought of for a moment interposed miss halcombe in her most decided manner let me suggest then i continued that you should see anne catherick yourself and do all you can to win her confidence for my own part i shrink from the idea of alarming the poor creature a second time as i have most unhappily alarmed her already do you see any objection to accompanying me to the farmhouse to morrow none whatever i will go anywhere and do anything to serve lauras interests what did you say the place was called you must know it well it is called todds corner certainly todds corner is one of mr fairlies farms our dairymaid here is the farmers second daughter she goes backwards and forwards constantly between this house and her fathers farm and she may have heard or seen something which it may be useful to us to know shall i ascertain at once if the girl is downstairs she rang the bell and sent the servant with his message he returned and announced that the dairymaid was then at the farm she had not been there for the last three days and the housekeeper had given her leave to go home for an hour or two that evening i can speak to her tomorrow said miss halcombe when the servant had left the room again in the meantime let me thoroughly understand the object to be gained by my interview with anne catherick is there no doubt in your mind that the person who confined her in the asylum was sir percival glyde there is not the shadow of a doubt the only mystery that remains is the mystery of his motive looking to the great difference between his station in life and hers which seems to preclude all idea of the most distant relationship between them it is of the last importance even assuming that she really required to be placed under restraint to know why he should have been the person to assume the serious responsibility of shutting her up in a private asylum i think you said yes in a private asylum where a sum of money which no poor person could afford to give must have been paid for her maintenance as a patient i see where the doubt lies mr hartright and i promise you that it shall be set at rest whether anne catherick assists us to morrow or not sir percival glyde shall not be long in this house without satisfying mr gilmore and satisfying me my sisters future is my dearest care in life and i have influence enough over her to give me some power where her marriage is concerned in the disposal of it we parted for the night after breakfast the next morning an obstacle which the events of the evening before had put out of my memory interposed to prevent our proceeding immediately to the farm this was my last day at limmeridge house and it was necessary as soon as the post came in to follow miss halcombes advice and to ask mr fairlies permission to shorten my engagement by a month in consideration of an unforeseen necessity for my return to london fortunately for the probability of this excuse so far as appearances were concerned the post brought me two letters from london friends that morning i took them away at once to my own room and sent the servant with a message to mr fairlie requesting to know when i could see him on a matter of business i awaited the mans return free from the slightest feeling of anxiety about the manner in which his master might receive my application with mr fairlies leave or without it i must go the consciousness of having now taken the first step on the dreary journey which was henceforth to separate my life from miss fairlies seemed to have blunted my sensibility to every consideration connected with myself i had done with my poor mans touchy pride i had done with all my little artist vanities no insolence of mr fairlies if he chose to be insolent could wound me now the servant returned with a message for which i was not unprepared mr fairlie regretted that the state of his health on that particular morning was such as to preclude all hope of his having the pleasure of receiving me he begged therefore that i would accept his apologies and kindly communicate what i had to say in the form of a letter similar messages to this had reached me at various intervals during my three months residence in the house throughout the whole of that period mr fairlie had been rejoiced to possess me but had never been well enough to see me for a second time the servant took every fresh batch of drawings that i mounted and restored back to his master with my respects and returned emptyhanded with mr fairlies kind compliments best thanks and sincere regrets that the state of his health still obliged him to remain a solitary prisoner in his own room a more satisfactory arrangement to both sides could not possibly have been adopted it would be hard to say which of us under the circumstances felt the most grateful sense of obligation to mr fairlies accommodating nerves i sat down at once to write the letter expressing myself in it as civilly as clearly and as briefly as possible mr fairlie did not hurry his reply nearly an hour elapsed before the answer was placed in my hands it was written with beautiful regularity and neatness of character in violetcoloured ink on notepaper as smooth as ivory and almost as thick as cardboard and it addressed me in these terms mr fairlies compliments to mr hartright mr fairlie is more surprised and disappointed than he can say in the present state of his health by mr hartrights application mr fairlie is not a man of business but he has consulted his steward who is and that person confirms mr fairlies opinion that mr hartrights request to be allowed to break his engagement cannot be justified by any necessity whatever excepting perhaps a case of life and death if the highlyappreciative feeling towards art and its professors which it is the consolation and happiness of mr fairlies suffering existence to cultivate could be easily shaken mr hartrights present proceeding would have shaken it it has not done so except in the instance of mr hartright himself having stated his opinion so far that is to say as acute nervous suffering will allow him to state anything mr fairlie has nothing to add but the expression of his decision in reference to the highly irregular application that has been made to him perfect repose of body and mind being to the last degree important in his case mr fairlie will not suffer mr hartright to disturb that repose by remaining in the house under circumstances of an essentially irritating nature to both sides accordingly mr fairlie waives his right of refusal purely with a view to the preservation of his own tranquillity and informs mr hartright that he may go i folded the letter up and put it away with my other papers the time had been when i should have resented it as an insult i accepted it now as a written release from my engagement it was off my mind it was almost out of my memory when i went downstairs to the breakfastroom and informed miss halcombe that i was ready to walk with her to the farm has mr fairlie given you a satisfactory answer she asked as we left the house he has allowed me to go miss halcombe she looked up at me quickly and then for the first time since i had known her took my arm of her own accord no words could have expressed so delicately that she understood how the permission to leave my employment had been granted and that she gave me her sympathy not as my superior but as my friend i had not felt the mans insolent letter but i felt deeply the womans atoning kindness on our way to the farm we arranged that miss halcombe was to enter the house alone and that i was to wait outside within call we adopted this mode of proceeding from an apprehension that my presence after what had happened in the churchyard the evening before might have the effect of renewing anne cathericks nervous dread and of rendering her additionally distrustful of the advances of a lady who was a stranger to her miss halcombe left me with the intention of speaking in the first instance to the farmers wife of whose friendly readiness to help her in any way she was well assured while i waited for her in the near neighbourhood of the house i had fully expected to be left alone for some time to my surprise however little more than five minutes had elapsed before miss halcombe returned does anne catherick refuse to see you i asked in astonishment anne catherick is gone replied miss halcombe gone gone with mrs clements they both left the farm at eight oclock this morning i could say nothing i could only feel that our last chance of discovery had gone with them all that mrs todd knows about her guests i know miss halcombe went on and it leaves me as it leaves her in the dark they both came back safe last night after they left you and they passed the first part of the evening with mr todds family as usual just before suppertime however anne catherick startled them all by being suddenly seized with faintness she had had a similar attack of a less alarming kind on the day she arrived at the farm and mrs todd had connected it on that occasion with something she was reading at the time in our local newspaper which lay on the farm table and which she had taken up only a minute or two before does mrs todd know what particular passage in the newspaper affected her in that way i inquired no replied miss halcombe she had looked it over and had seen nothing in it to agitate any one i asked leave however to look it over in my turn and at the very first page i opened i found that the editor had enriched his small stock of news by drawing upon our family affairs and had published my sisters marriage engagement among his other announcements copied from the london papers of marriages in high life i concluded at once that this was the paragraph which had so strangely affected anne catherick and i thought i saw in it also the origin of the letter which she sent to our house the next day there can be no doubt in either case but what did you hear about her second attack of faintness yesterday evening nothing the cause of it is a complete mystery there was no stranger in the room the only visitor was our dairymaid who as i told you is one of mr todds daughters and the only conversation was the usual gossip about local affairs they heard her cry out and saw her turn deadly pale without the slightest apparent reason mrs todd and mrs clements took her upstairs and mrs clements remained with her they were heard talking together until long after the usual bedtime and early this morning mrs clements took mrs todd aside and amazed her beyond all power of expression by saying that they must go the only explanation mrs todd could extract from her guest was that something had happened which was not the fault of any one at the farmhouse but which was serious enough to make anne catherick resolve to leave limmeridge immediately it was quite useless to press mrs clements to be more explicit she only shook her head and said that for annes sake she must beg and pray that no one would question her all she could repeat with every appearance of being seriously agitated herself was that anne must go that she must go with her and that the destination to which they might both betake themselves must be kept a secret from everybody i spare you the recital of mrs todds hospitable remonstrances and refusals it ended in her driving them both to the nearest station more than three hours since she tried hard on the way to get them to speak more plainly but without success and she set them down outside the stationdoor so hurt and offended by the unceremonious abruptness of their departure and their unfriendly reluctance to place the least confidence in her that she drove away in anger without so much as stopping to bid them goodbye that is exactly what has taken place search your own memory mr hartright and tell me if anything happened in the burialground yesterday evening which can at all account for the extraordinary departure of those two women this morning i should like to account first miss halcombe for the sudden change in anne catherick which alarmed them at the farmhouse hours after she and i had parted and when time enough had elapsed to quiet any violent agitation that i might have been unfortunate enough to cause did you inquire particularly about the gossip which was going on in the room when she turned faint yes but mrs todds household affairs seem to have divided her attention that evening with the talk in the farmhouse parlour she could only tell me that it was just the news meaning i suppose that they all talked as usual about each other the dairymaids memory may be better than her mothers i said it may be as well for you to speak to the girl miss halcombe as soon as we get back my suggestion was acted on the moment we returned to the house miss halcombe led me round to the servants offices and we found the girl in the dairy with her sleeves tucked up to her shoulders cleaning a large milkpan and singing blithely over her work i have brought this gentleman to see your dairy hannah said miss halcombe it is one of the sights of the house and it always does you credit the girl blushed and curtseyed and said shyly that she hoped she always did her best to keep things neat and clean we have just come from your fathers miss halcombe continued you were there yesterday evening i hear and you found visitors at the house yes miss one of them was taken faint and ill i am told i suppose nothing was said or done to frighten her you were not talking of anything very terrible were you oh no miss said the girl laughing we were only talking of the news your sisters told you the news at todds corner i suppose yes miss and you told them the news at limmeridge house yes miss and im quite sure nothing was said to frighten the poor thing for i was talking when she was taken ill it gave me quite a turn miss to see it never having been taken faint myself before any more questions could be put to her she was called away to receive a basket of eggs at the dairy door as she left us i whispered to miss halcombe ask her if she happened to mention last night that visitors were expected at limmeridge house miss halcombe showed me by a look that she understood and put the question as soon as the dairymaid returned to us oh yes miss i mentioned that said the girl simply the company coming and the accident to the brindled cow was all the news i had to take to the farm did you mention names did you tell them that sir percival glyde was expected on monday yes miss i told them sir percival glyde was coming i hope there was no harm in it i hope i didnt do wrong oh no no harm come mr hartright hannah will begin to think us in the way if we interrupt her any longer over her work we stopped and looked at one another the moment we were alone again is there any doubt in your mind now miss halcombe sir percival glyde shall remove that doubt mr hartright or laura fairlie shall never be his wife xv as we walked round to the front of the house a fly from the railway approached us along the drive miss halcombe waited on the doorsteps until the fly drew up and then advanced to shake hands with an old gentleman who got out briskly the moment the steps were let down mr gilmore had arrived i looked at him when we were introduced to each other with an interest and a curiosity which i could hardly conceal this old man was to remain at limmeridge house after i had left it he was to hear sir percival glydes explanation and was to give miss halcombe the assistance of his experience in forming her judgment he was to wait until the question of the marriage was set at rest and his hand if that question were decided in the affirmative was to draw the settlement which bound miss fairlie irrevocably to her engagement even then when i knew nothing by comparison with what i know now i looked at the family lawyer with an interest which i had never felt before in the presence of any man breathing who was a total stranger to me in external appearance mr gilmore was the exact opposite of the conventional idea of an old lawyer his complexion was florid his white hair was worn rather long and kept carefully brushed his black coat waistcoat and trousers fitted him with perfect neatness his white cravat was carefully tied and his lavender coloured kid gloves might have adorned the hands of a fashionable clergyman without fear and without reproach his manners were pleasantly marked by the formal grace and refinement of the old school of politeness quickened by the invigorating sharpness and readiness of a man whose business in life obliges him always to keep his faculties in good working order a sanguine constitution and fair prospects to begin with a long subsequent career of creditable and comfortable prosperity a cheerful diligent widelyrespected old age such were the general impressions i derived from my introduction to mr gilmore and it is but fair to him to add that the knowledge i gained by later and better experience only tended to confirm them i left the old gentleman and miss halcombe to enter the house together and to talk of family matters undisturbed by the restraint of a strangers presence they crossed the hall on their way to the drawingroom and i descended the steps again to wander about the garden alone my hours were numbered at limmeridge house my departure the next morning was irrevocably settled my share in the investigation which the anonymous letter had rendered necessary was at an end no harm could be done to any one but myself if i let my heart loose again for the little time that was left me from the cold cruelty of restraint which necessity had forced me to inflict upon it and took my farewell of the scenes which were associated with the brief dreamtime of my happiness and my love i turned instinctively to the walk beneath my studywindow where i had seen her the evening before with her little dog and followed the path which her dear feet had trodden so often till i came to the wicket gate that led into her rose garden the winter bareness spread drearily over it now the flowers that she had taught me to distinguish by their names the flowers that i had taught her to paint from were gone and the tiny white paths that led between the beds were damp and green already i went on to the avenue of trees where we had breathed together the warm fragrance of august evenings where we had admired together the myriad combinations of shade and sunlight that dappled the ground at our feet the leaves fell about me from the groaning branches and the earthy decay in the atmosphere chilled me to the bones a little farther on and i was out of the grounds and following the lane that wound gently upward to the nearest hills the old felled tree by the wayside on which we had sat to rest was sodden with rain and the tuft of ferns and grasses which i had drawn for her nestling under the rough stone wall in front of us had turned to a pool of water stagnating round an island of draggled weeds i gained the summit of the hill and looked at the view which we had so often admired in the happier time it was cold and barren it was no longer the view that i remembered the sunshine of her presence was far from methe charm of her voice no longer murmured in my ear she had talked to me on the spot from which i now looked down of her father who was her last surviving parent had told me how fond of each other they had been and how sadly she missed him still when she entered certain rooms in the house and when she took up forgotten occupations and amusements with which he had been associated was the view that i had seen while listening to those words the view that i saw now standing on the hilltop by myself i turned and left it i wound my way back again over the moor and round the sandhills down to the beach there was the white rage of the surf and the multitudinous glory of the leaping waves but where was the place on which she had once drawn idle figures with her parasol in the sand the place where we had sat together while she talked to me about myself and my home while she asked me a womans minutely observant questions about my mother and my sister and innocently wondered whether i should ever leave my lonely chambers and have a wife and a house of my own wind and wave had long since smoothed out the trace of her which she had left in those marks on the sand i looked over the wide monotony of the seaside prospect and the place in which we two had idled away the sunny hours was as lost to me as if i had never known it as strange to me as if i stood already on a foreign shore the empty silence of the beach struck cold to my heart i returned to the house and the garden where traces were left to speak of her at every turn on the west terrace walk i met mr gilmore he was evidently in search of me for he quickened his pace when we caught sight of each other the state of my spirits little fitted me for the society of a stranger but the meeting was inevitable and i resigned myself to make the best of it you are the very person i wanted to see said the old gentleman i had two words to say to you my dear sir and if you have no objection i will avail myself of the present opportunity to put it plainly miss halcombe and i have been talking over family affairs affairs which are the cause of my being here and in the course of our conversation she was naturally led to tell me of this unpleasant matter connected with the anonymous letter and of the share which you have most creditably and properly taken in the proceedings so far that share i quite understand gives you an interest which you might not otherwise have felt in knowing that the future management of the investigation which you have begun will be placed in safe hands my dear sir make yourself quite easy on that point it will be placed in my hands you are in every way mr gilmore much fitter to advise and to act in the matter than i am is it an indiscretion on my part to ask if you have decided yet on a course of proceeding so far as it is possible to decide mr hartright i have decided i mean to send a copy of the letter accompanied by a statement of the circumstances to sir percival glydes solicitor in london with whom i have some acquaintance the letter itself i shall keep here to show to sir percival as soon as he arrives the tracing of the two women i have already provided for by sending one of mr fairlies servants a confidential person to the station to make inquiries the man has his money and his directions and he will follow the women in the event of his finding any clue this is all that can be done until sir percival comes on monday i have no doubt myself that every explanation which can be expected from a gentleman and a man of honour he will readily give sir percival stands very high sir an eminent position a reputation above suspicion i feel quite easy about results quite easy i am rejoiced to assure you things of this sort happen constantly in my experience anonymous letters unfortunate woman sad state of society i dont deny that there are peculiar complications in this case but the case itself is most unhappily common common i am afraid mr gilmore i have the misfortune to differ from you in the view i take of the case just so my dear sir just so i am an old man and i take the practical view you are a young man and you take the romantic view let us not dispute about our views i live professionally in an atmosphere of disputation mr hartright and i am only too glad to escape from it as i am escaping here we will wait for events yes yes yes we will wait for events charming place this good shooting probably not none of mr fairlies land is preserved i think charming place though and delightful people you draw and paint i hear mr hartright enviable accomplishment what style we dropped into general conversation or rather mr gilmore talked and i listened my attention was far from him and from the topics on which he discoursed so fluently the solitary walk of the last two hours had wrought its effect on me it had set the idea in my mind of hastening my departure from limmeridge house why should i prolong the hard trial of saying farewell by one unnecessary minute what further service was required of me by any one there was no useful purpose to be served by my stay in cumberland there was no restriction of time in the permission to leave which my employer had granted to me why not end it there and then i determined to end it there were some hours of daylight still left there was no reason why my journey back to london should not begin on that afternoon i made the first civil excuse that occurred to me for leaving mr gilmore and returned at once to the house on my way up to my own room i met miss halcombe on the stairs she saw by the hurry of my movements and the change in my manner that i had some new purpose in view and asked what had happened i told her the reasons which induced me to think of hastening my departure exactly as i have told them here no no she said earnestly and kindly leave us like a friend break bread with us once more stay here and dine stay here and help us to spend our last evening with you as happily as like our first evenings as we can it is my invitation mrs veseys invitation she hesitated a little and then added lauras invitation as well i promised to remain god knows i had no wish to leave even the shadow of a sorrowful impression with any one of them my own room was the best place for me till the dinner bell rang i waited there till it was time to go downstairs i had not spoken to miss fairlie i had not even seen her all that day the first meeting with her when i entered the drawing room was a hard trial to her selfcontrol and to mine she too had done her best to make our last evening renew the golden bygone time the time that could never come again she had put on the dress which i used to admire more than any other that she possessed a dark blue silk trimmed quaintly and prettily with oldfashioned lace she came forward to meet me with her former readiness she gave me her hand with the frank innocent goodwill of happier days the cold fingers that trembled round mine the pale cheeks with a bright red spot burning in the midst of them the faint smile that struggled to live on her lips and died away from them while i looked at it told me at what sacrifice of herself her outward composure was maintained my heart could take her no closer to me or i should have loved her then as i had never loved her yet mr gilmore was a great assistance to us he was in high good humour and he led the conversation with unflagging spirit miss halcombe seconded him resolutely and i did all i could to follow her example the kind blue eyes whose slightest changes of expression i had learnt to interpret so well looked at me appealingly when we first sat down to table help my sister the sweet anxious face seemed to say help my sister and you will help me we got through the dinner to all outward appearance at least happily enough when the ladies had risen from table and mr gilmore and i were left alone in the diningroom a new interest presented itself to occupy our attention and to give me an opportunity of quieting myself by a few minutes of needful and welcome silence the servant who had been despatched to trace anne catherick and mrs clements returned with his report and was shown into the diningroom immediately well said mr gilmore what have you found out i have found out sir answered the man that both the women took tickets at our station here for carlisle you went to carlisle of course when you heard that i did sir but i am sorry to say i could find no further trace of them you inquired at the railway yes sir and at the different inns yes sir and you left the statement i wrote for you at the police station i did sir well my friend you have done all you could and i have done all i could and there the matter must rest till further notice we have played our trump cards mr hartright continued the old gentleman when the servant had withdrawn for the present at least the women have outmanoeuvred us and our only resource now is to wait till sir percival glyde comes here on monday next wont you fill your glass again good bottle of port that sound substantial old wine i have got better in my own cellar though we returned to the drawingroom the room in which the happiest evenings of my life had been passed the room which after this last night i was never to see again its aspect was altered since the days had shortened and the weather had grown cold the glass doors on the terrace side were closed and hidden by thick curtains instead of the soft twilight obscurity in which we used to sit the bright radiant glow of lamplight now dazzled my eyes all was changed indoors and out all was changed miss halcombe and mr gilmore sat down together at the cardtable mrs vesey took her customary chair there was no restraint on the disposal of their evening and i felt the restraint on the disposal of mine all the more painfully from observing it i saw miss fairlie lingering near the musicstand the time had been when i might have joined her there i waited irresolutely i knew neither where to go nor what to do next she cast one quick glance at me took a piece of music suddenly from the stand and came towards me of her own accord shall i play some of those little melodies of mozarts which you used to like so much she asked opening the music nervously and looking down at it while she spoke before i could thank her she hastened to the piano the chair near it which i had always been accustomed to occupy stood empty she struck a few chords then glanced round at me then looked back again at her music wont you take your old place she said speaking very abruptly and in very low tones i may take it on the last night i answered she did not reply she kept her attention riveted on the music music which she knew by memory which she had played over and over again in former times without the book i only knew that she had heard me i only knew that she was aware of my being close to her by seeing the red spot on the cheek that was nearest to me fade out and the face grow pale all over i am very sorry you are going she said her voice almost sinking to a whisper her eyes looking more and more intently at the music her fingers flying over the keys of the piano with a strange feverish energy which i had never noticed in her before i shall remember those kind words miss fairlie long after to morrow has come and gone the paleness grew whiter on her face and she turned it farther away from me dont speak of tomorrow she said let the music speak to us of tonight in a happier language than ours her lips trembled a faint sigh fluttered from them which she tried vainly to suppress her fingers wavered on the piano she struck a false note confused herself in trying to set it right and dropped her hands angrily on her lap miss halcombe and mr gilmore looked up in astonishment from the cardtable at which they were playing even mrs vesey dozing in her chair woke at the sudden cessation of the music and inquired what had happened you play at whist mr hartright asked miss halcombe with her eyes directed significantly at the place i occupied i knew what she meant i knew she was right and i rose at once to go to the cardtable as i left the piano miss fairlie turned a page of the music and touched the keys again with a surer hand i will play it she said striking the notes almost passionately i will play it on the last night come mrs vesey said miss halcombe mr gilmore and i are tired of ecarte come and be mr hartrights partner at whist the old lawyer smiled satirically his had been the winning hand and he had just turned up a king he evidently attributed miss halcombes abrupt change in the cardtable arrangements to a ladys inability to play the losing game the rest of the evening passed without a word or a look from her she kept her place at the piano and i kept mine at the card table she played unintermittingly played as if the music was her only refuge from herself sometimes her fingers touched the notes with a lingering fondness a soft plaintive dying tenderness unutterably beautiful and mournful to hear sometimes they faltered and failed her or hurried over the instrument mechanically as if their task was a burden to them but still change and waver as they might in the expression they imparted to the music their resolution to play never faltered she only rose from the piano when we all rose to say goodnight mrs vesey was the nearest to the door and the first to shake hands with me i shall not see you again mr hartright said the old lady i am truly sorry you are going away you have been very kind and attentive and an old woman like me feels kindness and attention i wish you happy sir i wish you a kind goodbye mr gilmore came next i hope we shall have a future opportunity of bettering our acquaintance mr hartright you quite understand about that little matter of business being safe in my hands yes yes of course bless me how cold it is dont let me keep you at the door bon voyage my dear sir bon voyage as the french say miss halcombe followed halfpast seven tomorrow morning she said then added in a whisper i have heard and seen more than you think your conduct tonight has made me your friend for life miss fairlie came last i could not trust myself to look at her when i took her hand and when i thought of the next morning my departure must be a very early one i said i shall be gone miss fairlie before you no no she interposed hastily not before i am out of my room i shall be down to breakfast with marian i am not so ungrateful not so forgetful of the past three months her voice failed her her hand closed gently round mine then dropped it suddenly before i could say goodnight she was gone the end comes fast to meet me comes inevitably as the light of the last morning came at limmeridge house it was barely halfpast seven when i went downstairs but i found them both at the breakfasttable waiting for me in the chill air in the dim light in the gloomy morning silence of the house we three sat down together and tried to eat tried to talk the struggle to preserve appearances was hopeless and useless and i rose to end it as i held out my hand as miss halcombe who was nearest to me took it miss fairlie turned away suddenly and hurried from the room better so said miss halcombe when the door had closed better so for you and for her i waited a moment before i could speak it was hard to lose her without a parting word or a parting look i controlled myself i tried to take leave of miss halcombe in fitting terms but all the farewell words i would fain have spoken dwindled to one sentence have i deserved that you should write to me was all i could say you have nobly deserved everything that i can do for you as long as we both live whatever the end is you shall know it and if i can ever be of help again at any future time long after the memory of my presumption and my folly is forgotten i could add no more my voice faltered my eyes moistened in spite of me she caught me by both hands she pressed them with the strong steady grasp of a man her dark eyes glittered her brown complexion flushed deep the force and energy of her face glowed and grew beautiful with the pure inner light of her generosity and her pity i will trust you if ever the time comes i will trust you as my friend and her friend as my brother and her brother she stopped drew me nearer to her the fearless noble creature touched my forehead sisterlike with her lips and called me by my christian name god bless you walter she said wait here alone and compose yourself i had better not stay for both our sakes i had better see you go from the balcony upstairs she left the room i turned away towards the window where nothing faced me but the lonely autumn landscape i turned away to master myself before i too left the room in my turn and left it for ever a minute passed it could hardly have been more when i heard the door open again softly and the rustling of a womans dress on the carpet moved towards me my heart beat violently as i turned round miss fairlie was approaching me from the farther end of the room she stopped and hesitated when our eyes met and when she saw that we were alone then with that courage which women lose so often in the small emergency and so seldom in the great she came on nearer to me strangely pale and strangely quiet drawing one hand after her along the table by which she walked and holding something at her side in the other which was hidden by the folds of her dress i only went into the drawingroom she said to look for this it may remind you of your visit here and of the friends you leave behind you you told me i had improved very much when i did it and i thought you might like she turned her head away and offered me a little sketch drawn throughout by her own pencil of the summerhouse in which we had first met the paper trembled in her hand as she held it out to me trembled in mine as i took it from her i was afraid to say what i felt i only answered it shall never leave me all my life long it shall be the treasure that i prize most i am very grateful for it very grateful to you for not letting me go away without bidding you goodbye oh she said innocently how could i let you go after we have passed so many happy days together those days may never return miss fairlie my way of life and yours are very far apart but if a time should come when the devotion of my whole heart and soul and strength will give you a moments happiness or spare you a moments sorrow will you try to remember the poor drawingmaster who has taught you miss halcombe has promised to trust me will you promise too the farewell sadness in the kind blue eyes shone dimly through her gathering tears i promise it she said in broken tones oh dont look at me like that i promise it with all my heart i ventured a little nearer to her and held out my hand you have many friends who love you miss fairlie your happy future is the dear object of many hopes may i say at parting that it is the dear object of my hopes too the tears flowed fast down her cheeks she rested one trembling hand on the table to steady herself while she gave me the other i took it in mine i held it fast my head drooped over it my tears fell on it my lips pressed it not in love oh not in love at that last moment but in the agony and the self abandonment of despair for gods sake leave me she said faintly the confession of her hearts secret burst from her in those pleading words i had no right to hear them no right to answer them they were the words that banished me in the name of her sacred weakness from the room it was all over i dropped her hand i said no more the blinding tears shut her out from my eyes and i dashed them away to look at her for the last time one look as she sank into a chair as her arms fell on the table as her fair head dropped on them wearily one farewell look and the door had closed upon her the great gulf of separation had opened between us the image of laura fairlie was a memory of the past already the end of hartrights narrative the story continued by vincent gilmore of chancery lane solicitor i i write these lines at the request of my friend mr walter hartright they are intended to convey a description of certain events which seriously affected miss fairlies interests and which took place after the period of mr hartrights departure from limmeridge house there is no need for me to say whether my own opinion does or does not sanction the disclosure of the remarkable family story of which my narrative forms an important component part mr hartright has taken that responsibility on himself and circumstances yet to be related will show that he has amply earned the right to do so if he chooses to exercise it the plan he has adopted for presenting the story to others in the most truthful and most vivid manner requires that it should be told at each successive stage in the march of events by the persons who were directly concerned in those events at the time of their occurrence my appearance here as narrator is the necessary consequence of this arrangement i was present during the sojourn of sir percival glyde in cumberland and was personally concerned in one important result of his short residence under mr fairlies roof it is my duty therefore to add these new links to the chain of events and to take up the chain itself at the point where for the present only mr hartright has dropped it i arrived at limmeridge house on friday the second of november my object was to remain at mr fairlies until the arrival of sir percival glyde if that event led to the appointment of any given day for sir percivals union with miss fairlie i was to take the necessary instructions back with me to london and to occupy myself in drawing the ladys marriagesettlement on the friday i was not favoured by mr fairlie with an interview he had been or had fancied himself to be an invalid for years past and he was not well enough to receive me miss halcombe was the first member of the family whom i saw she met me at the house door and introduced me to mr hartright who had been staying at limmeridge for some time past i did not see miss fairlie until later in the day at dinnertime she was not looking well and i was sorry to observe it she is a sweet lovable girl as amiable and attentive to every one about her as her excellent mother used to be though personally speaking she takes after her father mrs fairlie had dark eyes and hair and her elder daughter miss halcombe strongly reminds me of her miss fairlie played to us in the evening not so well as usual i thought we had a rubber at whist a mere profanation so far as play was concerned of that noble game i had been favourably impressed by mr hartright on our first introduction to one another but i soon discovered that he was not free from the social failings incidental to his age there are three things that none of the young men of the present generation can do they cant sit over their wine they cant play at whist and they cant pay a lady a compliment mr hartright was no exception to the general rule otherwise even in those early days and on that short acquaintance he struck me as being a modest and gentlemanlike young man so the friday passed i say nothing about the more serious matters which engaged my attention on that day the anonymous letter to miss fairlie the measures i thought it right to adopt when the matter was mentioned to me and the conviction i entertained that every possible explanation of the circumstances would be readily afforded by sir percival glyde having all been fully noticed as i understand in the narrative which precedes this on the saturday mr hartright had left before i got down to breakfast miss fairlie kept her room all day and miss halcombe appeared to me to be out of spirits the house was not what it used to be in the time of mr and mrs philip fairlie i took a walk by myself in the forenoon and looked about at some of the places which i first saw when i was staying at limmeridge to transact family business more than thirty years since they were not what they used to be either at two oclock mr fairlie sent to say he was well enough to see me he had not altered at any rate since i first knew him his talk was to the same purpose as usual all about himself and his ailments his wonderful coins and his matchless rembrandt etchings the moment i tried to speak of the business that had brought me to his house he shut his eyes and said i upset him i persisted in upsetting him by returning again and again to the subject all i could ascertain was that he looked on his nieces marriage as a settled thing that her father had sanctioned it that he sanctioned it himself that it was a desirable marriage and that he should be personally rejoiced when the worry of it was over as to the settlements if i would consult his niece and afterwards dive as deeply as i pleased into my own knowledge of the family affairs and get everything ready and limit his share in the business as guardian to saying yes at the right moment why of course he would meet my views and everybody elses views with infinite pleasure in the meantime there i saw him a helpless sufferer confined to his room did i think he looked as if he wanted teasing no then why tease him i might perhaps have been a little astonished at this extraordinary absence of all selfassertion on mr fairlies part in the character of guardian if my knowledge of the family affairs had not been sufficient to remind me that he was a single man and that he had nothing more than a lifeinterest in the limmeridge property as matters stood therefore i was neither surprised nor disappointed at the result of the interview mr fairlie had simply justified my expectations and there was an end of it sunday was a dull day out of doors and in a letter arrived for me from sir percival glydes solicitor acknowledging the receipt of my copy of the anonymous letter and my accompanying statement of the case miss fairlie joined us in the afternoon looking pale and depressed and altogether unlike herself i had some talk with her and ventured on a delicate allusion to sir percival she listened and said nothing all other subjects she pursued willingly but this subject she allowed to drop i began to doubt whether she might not be repenting of her engagement just as young ladies often do when repentance comes too late on monday sir percival glyde arrived i found him to be a most prepossessing man so far as manners and appearance were concerned he looked rather older than i had expected his head being bald over the forehead and his face somewhat marked and worn but his movements were as active and his spirits as high as a young mans his meeting with miss halcombe was delightfully hearty and unaffected and his reception of me upon my being presented to him was so easy and pleasant that we got on together like old friends miss fairlie was not with us when he arrived but she entered the room about ten minutes afterwards sir percival rose and paid his compliments with perfect grace his evident concern on seeing the change for the worse in the young ladys looks was expressed with a mixture of tenderness and respect with an unassuming delicacy of tone voice and manner which did equal credit to his good breeding and his good sense i was rather surprised under these circumstances to see that miss fairlie continued to be constrained and uneasy in his presence and that she took the first opportunity of leaving the room again sir percival neither noticed the restraint in her reception of him nor her sudden withdrawal from our society he had not obtruded his attentions on her while she was present and he did not embarrass miss halcombe by any allusion to her departure when she was gone his tact and taste were never at fault on this or on any other occasion while i was in his company at limmeridge house as soon as miss fairlie had left the room he spared us all embarrassment on the subject of the anonymous letter by adverting to it of his own accord he had stopped in london on his way from hampshire had seen his solicitor had read the documents forwarded by me and had travelled on to cumberland anxious to satisfy our minds by the speediest and the fullest explanation that words could convey on hearing him express himself to this effect i offered him the original letter which i had kept for his inspection he thanked me and declined to look at it saying that he had seen the copy and that he was quite willing to leave the original in our hands the statement itself on which he immediately entered was as simple and satisfactory as i had all along anticipated it would be mrs catherick he informed us had in past years laid him under some obligations for faithful services rendered to his family connections and to himself she had been doubly unfortunate in being married to a husband who had deserted her and in having an only child whose mental faculties had been in a disturbed condition from a very early age although her marriage had removed her to a part of hampshire far distant from the neighbourhood in which sir percivals property was situated he had taken care not to lose sight of her his friendly feeling towards the poor woman in consideration of her past services having been greatly strengthened by his admiration of the patience and courage with which she supported her calamities in course of time the symptoms of mental affliction in her unhappy daughter increased to such a serious extent as to make it a matter of necessity to place her under proper medical care mrs catherick herself recognised this necessity but she also felt the prejudice common to persons occupying her respectable station against allowing her child to be admitted as a pauper into a public asylum sir percival had respected this prejudice as he respected honest independence of feeling in any rank of life and had resolved to mark his grateful sense of mrs cathericks early attachment to the interests of himself and his family by defraying the expense of her daughters maintenance in a trustworthy private asylum to her mothers regret and to his own regret the unfortunate creature had discovered the share which circumstances had induced him to take in placing her under restraint and had conceived the most intense hatred and distrust of him in consequence to that hatred and distrust which had expressed itself in various ways in the asylum the anonymous letter written after her escape was plainly attributable if miss halcombes or mr gilmores recollection of the document did not confirm that view or if they wished for any additional particulars about the asylum the address of which he mentioned as well as the names and addresses of the two doctors on whose certificates the patient was admitted he was ready to answer any question and to clear up any uncertainty he had done his duty to the unhappy young woman by instructing his solicitor to spare no expense in tracing her and in restoring her once more to medical care and he was now only anxious to do his duty towards miss fairlie and towards her family in the same plain straightforward way i was the first to speak in answer to this appeal my own course was plain to me it is the great beauty of the law that it can dispute any human statement made under any circumstances and reduced to any form if i had felt professionally called upon to set up a case against sir percival glyde on the strength of his own explanation i could have done so beyond all doubt but my duty did not lie in this direction my function was of the purely judicial kind i was to weigh the explanation we had just heard to allow all due force to the high reputation of the gentleman who offered it and to decide honestly whether the probabilities on sir percivals own showing were plainly with him or plainly against him my own conviction was that they were plainly with him and i accordingly declared that his explanation was to my mind unquestionably a satisfactory one miss halcombe after looking at me very earnestly said a few words on her side to the same effect with a certain hesitation of manner however which the circumstances did not seem to me to warrant i am unable to say positively whether sir percival noticed this or not my opinion is that he did seeing that he pointedly resumed the subject although he might now with all propriety have allowed it to drop if my plain statement of facts had only been addressed to mr gilmore he said i should consider any further reference to this unhappy matter as unnecessary i may fairly expect mr gilmore as a gentleman to believe me on my word and when he has done me that justice all discussion of the subject between us has come to an end but my position with a lady is not the same i owe to her what i would concede to no man alive a proof of the truth of my assertion you cannot ask for that proof miss halcombe and it is therefore my duty to you and still more to miss fairlie to offer it may i beg that you will write at once to the mother of this unfortunate woman to mrs catherick to ask for her testimony in support of the explanation which i have just offered to you i saw miss halcombe change colour and look a little uneasy sir percivals suggestion politely as it was expressed appeared to her as it appeared to me to point very delicately at the hesitation which her manner had betrayed a moment or two since i hope sir percival you dont do me the injustice to suppose that i distrust you she said quickly certainly not miss halcombe i make my proposal purely as an act of attention to you will you excuse my obstinacy if i still venture to press it he walked to the writingtable as he spoke drew a chair to it and opened the paper case let me beg you to write the note he said as a favour to me it need not occupy you more than a few minutes you have only to ask mrs catherick two questions first if her daughter was placed in the asylum with her knowledge and approval secondly if the share i took in the matter was such as to merit the expression of her gratitude towards myself mr gilmores mind is at ease on this unpleasant subject and your mind is at ease pray set my mind at ease also by writing the note you oblige me to grant your request sir percival when i would much rather refuse it with those words miss halcombe rose from her place and went to the writingtable sir percival thanked her handed her a pen and then walked away towards the fireplace miss fairlies little italian greyhound was lying on the rug he held out his hand and called to the dog goodhumouredly come nina he said we remember each other dont we the little beast cowardly and crossgrained as petdogs usually are looked up at him sharply shrank away from his outstretched hand whined shivered and hid itself under a sofa it was scarcely possible that he could have been put out by such a trifle as a dogs reception of him but i observed nevertheless that he walked away towards the window very suddenly perhaps his temper is irritable at times if so i can sympathise with him my temper is irritable at times too miss halcombe was not long in writing the note when it was done she rose from the writingtable and handed the open sheet of paper to sir percival he bowed took it from her folded it up immediately without looking at the contents sealed it wrote the address and handed it back to her in silence i never saw anything more gracefully and more becomingly done in my life you insist on my posting this letter sir percival said miss halcombe i beg you will post it he answered and now that it is written and sealed up allow me to ask one or two last questions about the unhappy woman to whom it refers i have read the communication which mr gilmore kindly addressed to my solicitor describing the circumstances under which the writer of the anonymous letter was identified but there are certain points to which that statement does not refer did anne catherick see miss fairlie certainly not replied miss halcombe did she see you no she saw nobody from the house then except a certain mr hartright who accidentally met with her in the churchyard here nobody else mr hartright was employed at limmeridge as a drawingmaster i believe is he a member of one of the watercolour societies i believe he is answered miss halcombe he paused for a moment as if he was thinking over the last answer and then added did you find out where anne catherick was living when she was in this neighbourhood yes at a farm on the moor called todds corner it is a duty we all owe to the poor creature herself to trace her continued sir percival she may have said something at todds corner which may help us to find her i will go there and make inquiries on the chance in the meantime as i cannot prevail on myself to discuss this painful subject with miss fairlie may i beg miss halcombe that you will kindly undertake to give her the necessary explanation deferring it of course until you have received the reply to that note miss halcombe promised to compy with his request he thanked her nodded pleasantly and left us to go and establish himself in his own room as he opened the door the crossgrained greyhound poked out her sharp muzzle from under the sofa and barked and snapped at him a good mornings work miss halcombe i said as soon as we were alone here is an anxious day well ended already yes she answered no doubt i am very glad your mind is satisfied my mind surely with that note in your hand your mind is at ease too oh yes how can it be otherwise i know the thing could not be she went on speaking more to herself than to me but i almost wish walter hartright had stayed here long enough to be present at the explanation and to hear the proposal to me to write this note i was a little surprised perhaps a little piqued also by these last words events it is true connected mr hartright very remarkably with the affair of the letter i said and i readily admit that he conducted himself all things considered with great delicacy and discretion but i am quite at a loss to understand what useful influence his presence could have exercised in relation to the effect of sir percivals statement on your mind or mine it was only a fancy she said absently there is no need to discuss it mr gilmore your experience ought to be and is the best guide i can desire i did not altogether like her thrusting the whole responsibility in this marked manner on my shoulders if mr fairlie had done it i should not have been surprised but resolute clearminded miss halcombe was the very last person in the world whom i should have expected to find shrinking from the expression of an opinion of her own if any doubts still trouble you i said why not mention them to me at once tell me plainly have you any reason to distrust sir percival glyde none whatever do you see anything improbable or contradictory in his explanation how can i say i do after the proof he has offered me of the truth of it can there be better testimony in his favour mr gilmore than the testimony of the womans mother none better if the answer to your note of inquiry proves to be satisfactory i for one cannot see what more any friend of sir percivals can possibly expect from him then we will post the note she said rising to leave the room and dismiss all further reference to the subject until the answer arrives dont attach any weight to my hesitation i can give no better reason for it than that i have been overanxious about laura lately and anxiety mr gilmore unsettles the strongest of us she left me abruptly her naturally firm voice faltering as she spoke those last words a sensitive vehement passionate nature a woman of ten thousand in these trivial superficial times i had known her from her earliest years i had seen her tested as she grew up in more than one trying family crisis and my long experience made me attach an importance to her hesitation under the circumstances here detailed which i should certainly not have felt in the case of another woman i could see no cause for any uneasiness or any doubt but she had made me a little uneasy and a little doubtful nevertheless in my youth i should have chafed and fretted under the irritation of my own unreasonable state of mind in my age i knew better and went out philosophically to walk it off ii we all met again at dinnertime sir percival was in such boisterous high spirits that i hardly recognised him as the same man whose quiet tact refinement and good sense had impressed me so strongly at the interview of the morning the only trace of his former self that i could detect reappeared every now and then in his manner towards miss fairlie a look or a word from her suspended his loudest laugh checked his gayest flow of talk and rendered him all attention to her and to no one else at table in an instant although he never openly tried to draw her into the conversation he never lost the slightest chance she gave him of letting her drift into it by accident and of saying the words to her under those favourable circumstances which a man with less tact and delicacy would have pointedly addressed to her the moment they occurred to him rather to my surprise miss fairlie appeared to be sensible of his attentions without being moved by them she was a little confused from time to time when he looked at her or spoke to her but she never warmed towards him rank fortune good breeding good looks the respect of a gentleman and the devotion of a lover were all humbly placed at her feet and so far as appearances went were all offered in vain on the next day the tuesday sir percival went in the morning taking one of the servants with him as a guide to todds corner his inquiries as i afterwards heard led to no results on his return he had an interview with mr fairlie and in the afternoon he and miss halcombe rode out together nothing else happened worthy of record the evening passed as usual there was no change in sir percival and no change in miss fairlie the wednesdays post brought with it an event the reply from mrs catherick i took a copy of the document which i have preserved and which i may as well present in this place it ran as follows madam i beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter inquiring whether my daughter anne was placed under medical superintendence with my knowledge and approval and whether the share taken in the matter by sir percival glyde was such as to merit the expression of my gratitude towards that gentleman be pleased to accept my answer in the affirmative to both those questions and believe me to remain your obedient servant jane anne catherick short sharp and to the point in form rather a businesslike letter for a woman to write in substance as plain a confirmation as could be desired of sir percival glydes statement this was my opinion and with certain minor reservations miss halcombes opinion also sir percival when the letter was shown to him did not appear to be struck by the sharp short tone of it he told us that mrs catherick was a woman of few words a clearheaded straightforward unimaginative person who wrote briefly and plainly just as she spoke the next duty to be accomplished now that the answer had been received was to acquaint miss fairlie with sir percivals explanation miss halcombe had undertaken to do this and had left the room to go to her sister when she suddenly returned again and sat down by the easychair in which i was reading the newspaper sir percival had gone out a minute before to look at the stables and no one was in the room but ourselves i suppose we have really and truly done all we can she said turning and twisting mrs cathericks letter in her hand if we are friends of sir percivals who know him and trust him we have done all and more than all that is necessary i answered a little annoyed by this return of her hesitation but if we are enemies who suspect him that alternative is not even to be thought of she interposed we are sir percivals friends and if generosity and forbearance can add to our regard for him we ought to be sir percivals admirers as well you know that he saw mr fairlie yesterday and that he afterwards went out with me yes i saw you riding away together we began the ride by talking about anne catherick and about the singular manner in which mr hartright met with her but we soon dropped that subject and sir percival spoke next in the most unselfish terms of his engagement with laura he said he had observed that she was out of spirits and he was willing if not informed to the contrary to attribute to that cause the alteration in her manner towards him during his present visit if however there was any more serious reason for the change he would entreat that no constraint might be placed on her inclinations either by mr fairlie or by me all he asked in that case was that she would recall to mind for the last time what the circumstances were under which the engagement between them was made and what his conduct had been from the beginning of the courtship to the present time if after due reflection on those two subjects she seriously desired that he should withdraw his pretensions to the honour of becoming her husband and if she would tell him so plainly with her own lips he would sacrifice himself by leaving her perfectly free to withdraw from the engagement no man could say more than that miss halcombe as to my experience few men in his situation would have said as much she paused after i had spoken those words and looked at me with a singular expression of perplexity and distress i accuse nobody and i suspect nothing she broke out abruptly but i cannot and will not accept the responsibility of persuading laura to this marriage that is exactly the course which sir percival glyde has himself requested you to take i replied in astonishment he has begged you not to force her inclinations and he indirectly obliges me to force them if i give her his message how can that possibly be consult your own knowledge of laura mr gilmore if i tell her to reflect on the circumstances of her engagement i at once appeal to two of the strongest feelings in her nature to her love for her fathers memory and to her strict regard for truth you know that she never broke a promise in her life you know that she entered on this engagement at the beginning of her fathers fatal illness and that he spoke hopefully and happily of her marriage to sir percival glyde on his deathbed i own that i was a little shocked at this view of the case surely i said you dont mean to infer that when sir percival spoke to you yesterday he speculated on such a result as you have just mentioned her frank fearless face answered for her before she spoke do you think i would remain an instant in the company of any man whom i suspected of such baseness as that she asked angrily i liked to feel her hearty indignation flash out on me in that way we see so much malice and so little indignation in my profession in that case i said excuse me if i tell you in our legal phrase that you are travelling out of the record whatever the consequences may be sir percival has a right to expect that your sister should carefully consider her engagement from every reasonable point of view before she claims her release from it if that unlucky letter has prejudiced her against him go at once and tell her that he has cleared himself in your eyes and in mine what objection can she urge against him after that what excuse can she possibly have for changing her mind about a man whom she had virtually accepted for her husband more than two years ago in the eyes of law and reason mr gilmore no excuse i daresay if she still hesitates and if i still hesitate you must attribute our strange conduct if you like to caprice in both cases and we must bear the imputation as well as we can with those words she suddenly rose and left me when a sensible woman has a serious question put to her and evades it by a flippant answer it is a sure sign in ninetynine cases out of a hundred that she has something to conceal i returned to the perusal of the newspaper strongly suspecting that miss halcombe and miss fairlie had a secret between them which they were keeping from sir percival and keeping from me i thought this hard on both of us especially on sir percival my doubts or to speak more correctly my convictions were confirmed by miss halcombes language and manner when i saw her again later in the day she was suspiciously brief and reserved in telling me the result of her interview with her sister miss fairlie it appeared had listened quietly while the affair of the letter was placed before her in the right point of view but when miss halcombe next proceeded to say that the object of sir percivals visit at limmeridge was to prevail on her to let a day be fixed for the marriage she checked all further reference to the subject by begging for time if sir percival would consent to spare her for the present she would undertake to give him his final answer before the end of the year she pleaded for this delay with such anxiety and agitation that miss halcombe had promised to use her influence if necessary to obtain it and there at miss fairlies earnest entreaty all further discussion of the marriage question had ended the purely temporary arrangement thus proposed might have been convenient enough to the young lady but it proved somewhat embarrassing to the writer of these lines that mornings post had brought a letter from my partner which obliged me to return to town the next day by the afternoon train it was extremely probable that i should find no second opportunity of presenting myself at limmeridge house during the remainder of the year in that case supposing miss fairlie ultimately decided on holding to her engagement my necessary personal communication with her before i drew her settlement would become something like a downright impossibility and we should be obliged to commit to writing questions which ought always to be discussed on both sides by word of mouth i said nothing about this difficulty until sir percival had been consulted on the subject of the desired delay he was too gallant a gentleman not to grant the request immediately when miss halcombe informed me of this i told her that i must absolutely speak to her sister before i left limmeridge and it was therefore arranged that i should see miss fairlie in her own sittingroom the next morning she did not come down to dinner or join us in the evening indisposition was the excuse and i thought sir percival looked as well he might a little annoyed when he heard of it the next morning as soon as breakfast was over i went up to miss fairlies sittingroom the poor girl looked so pale and sad and came forward to welcome me so readily and prettily that the resolution to lecture her on her caprice and indecision which i had been forming all the way upstairs failed me on the spot i led her back to the chair from which she had risen and placed myself opposite to her her crossgrained pet greyhound was in the room and i fully expected a barking and snapping reception strange to say the whimsical little brute falsified my expectations by jumping into my lap and poking its sharp muzzle familiarly into my hand the moment i sat down you used often to sit on my knee when you were a child my dear i said and now your little dog seems determined to succeed you in the vacant throne is that pretty drawing your doing i pointed to a little album which lay on the table by her side and which she had evidently been looking over when i came in the page that lay open had a small watercolour landscape very neatly mounted on it this was the drawing which had suggested my question an idle question enough but how could i begin to talk of business to her the moment i opened my lips no she said looking away from the drawing rather confusedly it is not my doing her fingers had a restless habit which i remembered in her as a child of always playing with the first thing that came to hand whenever any one was talking to her on this occasion they wandered to the album and toyed absently about the margin of the little watercolour drawing the expression of melancholy deepened on her face she did not look at the drawing or look at me her eyes moved uneasily from object to object in the room betraying plainly that she suspected what my purpose was in coming to speak to her seeing that i thought it best to get to the purpose with as little delay as possible one of the errands my dear which brings me here is to bid you goodbye i began i must get back to london today and before i leave i want to have a word with you on the subject of your own affairs i am very sorry you are going mr gilmore she said looking at me kindly it is like the happy old times to have you here i hope i may be able to come back and recall those pleasant memories once more i continued but as there is some uncertainty about the future i must take my opportunity when i can get it and speak to you now i am your old lawyer and your old friend and i may remind you i am sure without offence of the possibility of your marrying sir percival glyde she took her hand off the little album as suddenly as if it had turned hot and burnt her her fingers twined together nervously in her lap her eyes looked down again at the floor and an expression of constraint settled on her face which looked almost like an expression of pain is it absolutely necessary to speak of my marriage engagement she asked in low tones it is necessary to refer to it i answered but not to dwell on it let us merely say that you may marry or that you may not marry in the first case i must be prepared beforehand to draw your settlement and i ought not to do that without as a matter of politeness first consulting you this may be my only chance of hearing what your wishes are let us therefore suppose the case of your marrying and let me inform you in as few words as possible what your position is now and what you may make it if you please in the future i explained to her the object of a marriagesettlement and then told her exactly what her prospects were in the first place on her coming of age and in the second place on the decease of her uncle marking the distinction between the property in which she had a lifeinterest only and the property which was left at her own control she listened attentively with the constrained expression still on her face and her hands still nervously clasped together in her lap and now i said in conclusion tell me if you can think of any condition which in the case we have supposed you would wish me to make for you subject of course to your guardians approval as you are not yet of age she moved uneasily in her chair then looked in my face on a sudden very earnestly if it does happen she began faintly if i am if you are married i added helping her out dont let him part me from marian she cried with a sudden outbreak of energy oh mr gilmore pray make it law that marian is to live with me under other circumstances i might perhaps have been amused at this essentially feminine interpretation of my question and of the long explanation which had preceded it but her looks and tones when she spoke were of a kind to make me more than serious they distressed me her words few as they were betrayed a desperate clinging to the past which boded ill for the future your having marian halcombe to live with you can easily be settled by private arrangement i said you hardly understood my question i think it referred to your own property to the disposal of your money supposing you were to make a will when you come of age who would you like the money to go to marian has been mother and sister both to me said the good affectionate girl her pretty blue eyes glistening while she spoke may i leave it to marian mr gilmore certainly my love i answered but remember what a large sum it is would you like it all to go to miss halcombe she hesitated her colour came and went and her hand stole back again to the little album not all of it she said there is some one else besides marian she stopped her colour heightened and the fingers of the hand that rested upon the album beat gently on the margin of the drawing as if her memory had set them going mechanically with the remembrance of a favourite tune you mean some other member of the family besides miss halcombe i suggested seeing her at a loss to proceed the heightening colour spread to her forehead and her neck and the nervous fingers suddenly clasped themselves fast round the edge of the book there is some one else she said not noticing my last words though she had evidently heard them there is some one else who might like a little keepsake if if i might leave it there would be no harm if i should die first she paused again the colour that had spread over her cheeks suddenly as suddenly left them the hand on the album resigned its hold trembled a little and moved the book away from her she looked at me for an instant then turned her head aside in the chair her handkerchief fell to the floor as she changed her position and she hurriedly hid her face from me in her hands sad to remember her as i did the liveliest happiest child that ever laughed the day through and to see her now in the flower of her age and her beauty so broken and so brought down as this in the distress that she caused me i forgot the years that had passed and the change they had made in our position towards one another i moved my chair close to her and picked up her handkerchief from the carpet and drew her hands from her face gently dont cry my love i said and dried the tears that were gathering in her eyes with my own hand as if she had been the little laura fairlie of ten long years ago it was the best way i could have taken to compose her she laid her head on my shoulder and smiled faintly through her tears i am very sorry for forgetting myself she said artlessly i have not been well i have felt sadly weak and nervous lately and i often cry without reason when i am alone i am better now i can answer you as i ought mr gilmore i can indeed no no my dear i replied we will consider the subject as done with for the present you have said enough to sanction my taking the best possible care of your interests and we can settle details at another opportunity let us have done with business now and talk of something else i led her at once into speaking on other topics in ten minutes time she was in better spirits and i rose to take my leave come here again she said earnestly i will try to be worthier of your kind feeling for me and for my interests if you will only come again still clinging to the past that past which i represented to her in my way as miss halcombe did in hers it troubled me sorely to see her looking back at the beginning of her career just as i look back at the end of mine if i do come again i hope i shall find you better i said better and happier god bless you my dear she only answered by putting up her cheek to me to be kissed even lawyers have hearts and mine ached a little as i took leave of her the whole interview between us had hardly lasted more than half an hour she had not breathed a word in my presence to explain the mystery of her evident distress and dismay at the prospect of her marriage and yet she had contrived to win me over to her side of the question i neither knew how nor why i had entered the room feeling that sir percival glyde had fair reason to complain of the manner in which she was treating him i left it secretly hoping that matters might end in her taking him at his word and claiming her release a man of my age and experience ought to have known better than to vacillate in this unreasonable manner i can make no excuse for myself i can only tell the truth and say so it was the hour for my departure was now drawing near i sent to mr fairlie to say that i would wait on him to take leave if he liked but that he must excuse my being rather in a hurry he sent a message back written in pencil on a slip of paper kind love and best wishes dear gilmore hurry of any kind is inexpressibly injurious to me pray take care of yourself goodbye just before i left i saw miss halcombe for a moment alone have you said all you wanted to laura she asked yes i replied she is very weak and nervous i am glad she has you to take care of her miss halcombes sharp eyes studied my face attentively you are altering your opinion about laura she said you are readier to make allowances for her than you were yesterday no sensible man ever engages unprepared in a fencing match of words with a woman i only answered let me know what happens i will do nothing till i hear from you she still looked hard in my face i wish it was all over and well over mr gilmore and so do you with those words she left me sir percival most politely insisted on seeing me to the carriage door if you are ever in my neighbourhood he said pray dont forget that i am sincerely anxious to improve our acquaintance the tried and trusted old friend of this family will be always a welcome visitor in any house of mine a really irresistible man courteous considerate delightfully free from pride a gentleman every inch of him as i drove away to the station i felt as if i could cheerfully do anything to promote the interests of sir percival glyde anything in the world except drawing the marriage settlement of his wife iii a week passed after my return to london without the receipt of any communication from miss halcombe on the eighth day a letter in her handwriting was placed among the other letters on my table it announced that sir percival glyde had been definitely accepted and that the marriage was to take place as he had originally desired before the end of the year in all probability the ceremony would be performed during the last fortnight in december miss fairlies twentyfirst birthday was late in march she would therefore by this arrangement become sir percivals wife about three months before she was of age i ought not to have been surprised i ought not to have been sorry but i was surprised and sorry nevertheless some little disappointment caused by the unsatisfactory shortness of miss halcombes letter mingled itself with these feelings and contributed its share towards upsetting my serenity for the day in six lines my correspondent announced the proposed marriage in three more she told me that sir percival had left cumberland to return to his house in hampshire and in two concluding sentences she informed me first that laura was sadly in want of change and cheerful society secondly that she had resolved to try the effect of some such change forthwith by taking her sister away with her on a visit to certain old friends in yorkshire there the letter ended without a word to explain what the circumstances were which had decided miss fairlie to accept sir percival glyde in one short week from the time when i had last seen her at a later period the cause of this sudden determination was fully explained to me it is not my business to relate it imperfectly on hearsay evidence the circumstances came within the personal experience of miss halcombe and when her narrative succeeds mine she will describe them in every particular exactly as they happened in the meantime the plain duty for me to perform before i in my turn lay down my pen and withdraw from the story is to relate the one remaining event connected with miss fairlies proposed marriage in which i was concerned namely the drawing of the settlement it is impossible to refer intelligibly to this document without first entering into certain particulars in relation to the brides pecuniary affairs i will try to make my explanation briefly and plainly and to keep it free from professional obscurities and technicalities the matter is of the utmost importance i warn all readers of these lines that miss fairlies inheritance is a very serious part of miss fairlies story and that mr gilmores experience in this particular must be their experience also if they wish to understand the narratives which are yet to come miss fairlies expectations then were of a twofold kind comprising her possible inheritance of real property or land when her uncle died and her absolute inheritance of personal property or money when she came of age let us take the land first in the time of miss fairlies paternal grandfather whom we will call mr fairlie the elder the entailed succession to the limmeridge estate stood thus mr fairlie the elder died and left three sons philip frederick and arthur as eldest son philip succeeded to the estate if he died without leaving a son the property went to the second brother frederick and if frederick died also without leaving a son the property went to the third brother arthur as events turned out mr philip fairlie died leaving an only daughter the laura of this story and the estate in consequence went in course of law to the second brother frederick a single man the third brother arthur had died many years before the decease of philip leaving a son and a daughter the son at the age of eighteen was drowned at oxford his death left laura the daughter of mr philip fairlie presumptive heiress to the estate with every chance of succeeding to it in the ordinary course of nature on her uncle fredericks death if the said frederick died without leaving male issue except in the event then of mr frederick fairlies marrying and leaving an heir the two very last things in the world that he was likely to do his niece laura would have the property on his death possessing it must be remembered nothing more than a lifeinterest in it if she died single or died childless the estate would revert to her cousin magdalen the daughter of mr arthur fairlie if she married with a proper settlement or in other words with the settlement i meant to make for her the income from the estate a good three thousand a year would during her lifetime be at her own disposal if she died before her husband he would naturally expect to be left in the enjoyment of the income for his lifetime if she had a son that son would be the heir to the exclusion of her cousin magdalen thus sir percivals prospects in marrying miss fairlie so far as his wifes expectations from real property were concerned promised him these two advantages on mr frederick fairlies death first the use of three thousand a year by his wifes permission while she lived and in his own right on her death if he survived her and secondly the inheritance of limmeridge for his son if he had one so much for the landed property and for the disposal of the income from it on the occasion of miss fairlies marriage thus far no difficulty or difference of opinion on the ladys settlement was at all likely to arise between sir percivals lawyer and myself the personal estate or in other words the money to which miss fairlie would become entitled on reaching the age of twentyone years is the next point to consider this part of her inheritance was in itself a comfortable little fortune it was derived under her fathers will and it amounted to the sum of twenty thousand pounds besides this she had a lifeinterest in ten thousand pounds more which latter amount was to go on her decease to her aunt eleanor her fathers only sister it will greatly assist in setting the family affairs before the reader in the clearest possible light if i stop here for a moment to explain why the aunt had been kept waiting for her legacy until the death of the niece mr philip fairlie had lived on excellent terms with his sister eleanor as long as she remained a single woman but when her marriage took place somewhat late in life and when that marriage united her to an italian gentleman named fosco or rather to an italian nobleman seeing that he rejoiced in the title of count mr fairlie disapproved of her conduct so strongly that he ceased to hold any communication with her and even went the length of striking her name out of his will the other members of the family all thought this serious manifestation of resentment at his sisters marriage more or less unreasonable count fosco though not a rich man was not a penniless adventurer either he had a small but sufficient income of his own he had lived many years in england and he held an excellent position in society these recommendations however availed nothing with mr fairlie in many of his opinions he was an englishman of the old school and he hated a foreigner simply and solely because he was a foreigner the utmost that he could be prevailed on to do in after years mainly at miss fairlies intercession was to restore his sisters name to its former place in his will but to keep her waiting for her legacy by giving the income of the money to his daughter for life and the money itself if her aunt died before her to her cousin magdalen considering the relative ages of the two ladies the aunts chance in the ordinary course of nature of receiving the ten thousand pounds was thus rendered doubtful in the extreme and madame fosco resented her brothers treatment of her as unjustly as usual in such cases by refusing to see her niece and declining to believe that miss fairlies intercession had ever been exerted to restore her name to mr fairlies will such was the history of the ten thousand pounds here again no difficulty could arise with sir percivals legal adviser the income would be at the wifes disposal and the principal would go to her aunt or her cousin on her death all preliminary explanations being now cleared out of the way i come at last to the real knot of the case to the twenty thousand pounds this sum was absolutely miss fairlies own on her completing her twentyfirst year and the whole future disposition of it depended in the first instance on the conditions i could obtain for her in her marriagesettlement the other clauses contained in that document were of a formal kind and need not be recited here but the clause relating to the money is too important to be passed over a few lines will be sufficient to give the necessary abstract of it my stipulation in regard to the twenty thousand pounds was simply this the whole amount was to be settled so as to give the income to the lady for her life afterwards to sir percival for his life and the principal to the children of the marriage in default of issue the principal was to be disposed of as the lady might by her will direct for which purpose i reserved to her the right of making a will the effect of these conditions may be thus summed up if lady glyde died without leaving children her halfsister miss halcombe and any other relatives or friends whom she might be anxious to benefit would on her husbands death divide among them such shares of her money as she desired them to have if on the other hand she died leaving children then their interest naturally and necessarily superseded all other interests whatsoever this was the clause and no one who reads it can fail i think to agree with me that it meted out equal justice to all parties we shall see how my proposals were met on the husbands side at the time when miss halcombes letter reached me i was even more busily occupied than usual but i contrived to make leisure for the settlement i had drawn it and had sent it for approval to sir percivals solicitor in less than a week from the time when miss halcombe had informed me of the proposed marriage after a lapse of two days the document was returned to me with notes and remarks of the baronets lawyer his objections in general proved to be of the most trifling and technical kind until he came to the clause relating to the twenty thousand pounds against this there were double lines drawn in red ink and the following note was appended to them not admissible the principal to go to sir percival glyde in the event of his surviving lady glyde and there being no issue that is to say not one farthing of the twenty thousand pounds was to go to miss halcombe or to any other relative or friend of lady glydes the whole sum if she left no children was to slip into the pockets of her husband the answer i wrote to this audacious proposal was as short and sharp as i could make it my dear sir miss fairlies settlement i maintain the clause to which you object exactly as it stands yours truly the rejoinder came back in a quarter of an hour my dear sir miss fairlies settlement i maintain the red ink to which you object exactly as it stands yours truly in the detestable slang of the day we were now both at a deadlock and nothing was left for it but to refer to our clients on either side as matters stood my client miss fairlie not having yet completed her twentyfirst year mr frederick fairlie was her guardian i wrote by that days post and put the case before him exactly as it stood not only urging every argument i could think of to induce him to maintain the clause as i had drawn it but stating to him plainly the mercenary motive which was at the bottom of the opposition to my settlement of the twenty thousand pounds the knowledge of sir percivals affairs which i had necessarily gained when the provisions of the deed on his side were submitted in due course to my examination had but too plainly informed me that the debts on his estate were enormous and that his income though nominally a large one was virtually for a man in his position next to nothing the want of ready money was the practical necessity of sir percivals existence and his lawyers note on the clause in the settlement was nothing but the frankly selfish expression of it mr fairlies answer reached me by return of post and proved to be wandering and irrelevant in the extreme turned into plain english it practically expressed itself to this effect would dear gilmore be so very obliging as not to worry his friend and client about such a trifle as a remote contingency was it likely that a young woman of twentyone would die before a man of forty five and die without children on the other hand in such a miserable world as this was it possible to overestimate the value of peace and quietness if those two heavenly blessings were offered in exchange for such an earthly trifle as a remote chance of twenty thousand pounds was it not a fair bargain surely yes then why not make it i threw the letter away in disgust just as it had fluttered to the ground there was a knock at my door and sir percival s solicitor mr merriman was shown in there are many varieties of sharp practitioners in this world but i think the hardest of all to deal with are the men who overreach you under the disguise of inveterate goodhumour a fat well fed smiling friendly man of business is of all parties to a bargain the most hopeless to deal with mr merriman was one of this class and how is good mr gilmore he began all in a glow with the warmth of his own amiability glad to see you sir in such excellent health i was passing your door and i thought i would look in in case you might have something to say to me do now pray do let us settle this little difference of ours by word of mouth if we can have you heard from your client yet yes have you heard from yours my dear good sir i wish i had heard from him to any purpose i wish with all my heart the responsibility was off my shoulders but he is obstinate or let me rather say resolute and he wont take it off merriman i leave details to you do what you think right for my interests and consider me as having personally withdrawn from the business until it is all over those were sir percivals words a fortnight ago and all i can get him to do now is to repeat them i am not a hard man mr gilmore as you know personally and privately i do assure you i should like to sponge out that note of mine at this very moment but if sir percival wont go into the matter if sir percival will blindly leave all his interests in my sole care what course can i possibly take except the course of asserting them my hands are bound dont you see my dear sir my hands are bound you maintain your note on the clause then to the letter i said yes deuce take it i have no other alternative he walked to the fireplace and warmed himself humming the fag end of a tune in a rich convivial bass voice what does your side say he went on now pray tell me what does your side say i was ashamed to tell him i attempted to gain time nay i did worse my legal instincts got the better of me and i even tried to bargain twenty thousand pounds is rather a large sum to be given up by the ladys friends at two days notice i said very true replied mr merriman looking down thoughtfully at his boots properly put sir most properly put a compromise recognising the interests of the ladys family as well as the interests of the husband might not perhaps have frightened my client quite so much i went on come come this contingency resolves itself into a matter of bargaining after all what is the least you will take the least we will take said mr merriman is nineteen thousandninehundredandninetyninepoundsnineteenshillings andelevenpencethreefarthings ha ha ha excuse me mr gilmore i must have my little joke little enough i remarked the joke is just worth the odd farthing it was made for mr merriman was delighted he laughed over my retort till the room rang again i was not half so goodhumoured on my side i came back to business and closed the interview this is friday i said give us till tuesday next for our final answer by all means replied mr merriman longer my dear sir if you like he took up his hat to go and then addressed me again by the way he said your clients in cumberland have not heard anything more of the woman who wrote the anonymous letter have they nothing more i answered have you found no trace of her not yet said my legal friend but we dont despair sir percival has his suspicions that somebody is keeping her in hiding and we are having that somebody watched you mean the old woman who was with her in cumberland i said quite another party sir answered mr merriman we dont happen to have laid hands on the old woman yet our somebody is a man we have got him close under our eye here in london and we strongly suspect he had something to do with helping her in the first instance to escape from the asylum sir percival wanted to question him at once but i said no questioning him will only put him on his guard watch him and wait we shall see what happens a dangerous woman to be at large mr gilmore nobody knows what she may do next i wish you goodmorning sir on tuesday next i shall hope for the pleasure of hearing from you he smiled amiably and went out my mind had been rather absent during the latter part of the conversation with my legal friend i was so anxious about the matter of the settlement that i had little attention to give to any other subject and the moment i was left alone again i began to think over what my next proceeding ought to be in the case of any other client i should have acted on my instructions however personally distasteful to me and have given up the point about the twenty thousand pounds on the spot but i could not act with this businesslike indifference towards miss fairlie i had an honest feeling of affection and admiration for her i remembered gratefully that her father had been the kindest patron and friend to me that ever man had i had felt towards her while i was drawing the settlement as i might have felt if i had not been an old bachelor towards a daughter of my own and i was determined to spare no personal sacrifice in her service and where her interests were concerned writing a second time to mr fairlie was not to be thought of it would only be giving him a second opportunity of slipping through my fingers seeing him and personally remonstrating with him might possibly be of more use the next day was saturday i determined to take a return ticket and jolt my old bones down to cumberland on the chance of persuading him to adopt the just the independent and the honourable course it was a poor chance enough no doubt but when i had tried it my conscience would be at ease i should then have done all that a man in my position could do to serve the interests of my old friends only child the weather on saturday was beautiful a west wind and a bright sun having felt latterly a return of that fulness and oppression of the head against which my doctor warned me so seriously more than two years since i resolved to take the opportunity of getting a little extra exercise by sending my bag on before me and walking to the terminus in euston square as i came out into holborn a gentleman walking by rapidly stopped and spoke to me it was mr walter hartright if he had not been the first to greet me i should certainly have passed him he was so changed that i hardly knew him again his face looked pale and haggard his manner was hurried and uncertain and his dress which i remembered as neat and gentlemanlike when i saw him at limmeridge was so slovenly now that i should really have been ashamed of the appearance of it on one of my own clerks have you been long back from cumberland he asked i heard from miss halcombe lately i am aware that sir percival glydes explanation has been considered satisfactory will the marriage take place soon do you happen to know mr gilmore he spoke so fast and crowded his questions together so strangely and confusedly that i could hardly follow him however accidentally intimate he might have been with the family at limmeridge i could not see that he had any right to expect information on their private affairs and i determined to drop him as easily as might be on the subject of miss fairlies marriage time will show mr hartright i said time will show i dare say if we look out for the marriage in the papers we shall not be far wrong excuse my noticing it but i am sorry to see you not looking so well as you were when we last met a momentary nervous contraction quivered about his lips and eyes and made me half reproach myself for having answered him in such a significantly guarded manner i had no right to ask about her marriage he said bitterly i must wait to see it in the newspapers like other people yes he went on before i could make any apologies i have not been well lately i am going to another country to try a change of scene and occupation miss halcombe has kindly assisted me with her influence and my testimonials have been found satisfactory it is a long distance off but i dont care where i go what the climate is or how long i am away he looked about him while he said this at the throng of strangers passing us by on either side in a strange suspicious manner as if he thought that some of them might be watching us i wish you well through it and safe back again i said and then added so as not to keep him altogether at arms length on the subject of the fairlies i am going down to limmeridge today on business miss halcombe and miss fairlie are away just now on a visit to some friends in yorkshire his eyes brightened and he seemed about to say something in answer but the same momentary nervous spasm crossed his face again he took my hand pressed it hard and disappeared among the crowd without saying another word though he was little more than a stranger to me i waited for a moment looking after him almost with a feeling of regret i had gained in my profession sufficient experience of young men to know what the outward signs and tokens were of their beginning to go wrong and when i resumed my walk to the railway i am sorry to say i felt more than doubtful about mr hartrights future iv leaving by an early train i got to limmeridge in time for dinner the house was oppressively empty and dull i had expected that good mrs vesey would have been company for me in the absence of the young ladies but she was confined to her room by a cold the servants were so surprised at seeing me that they hurried and bustled absurdly and made all sorts of annoying mistakes even the butler who was old enough to have known better brought me a bottle of port that was chilled the reports of mr fairlies health were just as usual and when i sent up a message to announce my arrival i was told that he would be delighted to see me the next morning but that the sudden news of my appearance had prostrated him with palpitations for the rest of the evening the wind howled dismally all night and strange cracking and groaning noises sounded here there and everywhere in the empty house i slept as wretchedly as possible and got up in a mighty bad humour to breakfast by myself the next morning at ten oclock i was conducted to mr fairlies apartments he was in his usual room his usual chair and his usual aggravating state of mind and body when i went in his valet was standing before him holding up for inspection a heavy volume of etchings as long and as broad as my office writingdesk the miserable foreigner grinned in the most abject manner and looked ready to drop with fatigue while his master composedly turned over the etchings and brought their hidden beauties to light with the help of a magnifying glass you very best of good old friends said mr fairlie leaning hack lazily before he could look at me are you quite well how nice of you to come here and see me in my solitude dear gilmore i had expected that the valet would be dismissed when i appeared but nothing of the sort happened there he stood in front of his masters chair trembling under the weight of the etchings and there mr fairlie sat serenely twirling the magnifying glass between his white fingers and thumbs i have come to speak to you on a very important matter i said and you will therefore excuse me if i suggest that we had better be alone the unfortunate valet looked at me gratefully mr fairlie faintly repeated my last three words better be alone with every appearance of the utmost possible astonishment i was in no humour for trifling and i resolved to make him understand what i meant oblige me by giving that man permission to withdraw i said pointing to the valet mr fairlie arched his eyebrows and pursed up his lips in sarcastic surprise man he repeated you provoking old gilmore what can you possibly mean by calling him a man hes nothing of the sort he might have been a man half an hour ago before i wanted my etchings and he may be a man half an hour hence when i dont want them any longer at present he is simply a portfolio stand why object gilmore to a portfolio stand i do object for the third time mr fairlie i beg that we may be alone my tone and manner left him no alternative but to comply with my request he looked at the servant and pointed peevishly to a chair at his side put down the etchings and go away he said dont upset me by losing my place have you or have you not lost my place are you sure you have not and have you put my handbell quite within my reach yes then why the devil dont you go the valet went out mr fairlie twisted himself round in his chair polished the magnifying glass with his delicate cambric handkerchief and indulged himself with a sidelong inspection of the open volume of etchings it was not easy to keep my temper under these circumstances but i did keep it i have come here at great personal inconvenience i said to serve the interests of your niece and your family and i think i have established some slight claim to be favoured with your attention in return dont bully me exclaimed mr fairlie falling back helplessly in the chair and closing his eyes please dont bully me im not strong enough i was determined not to let him provoke me for laura fairlies sake my object i went on is to entreat you to reconsider your letter and not to force me to abandon the just rights of your niece and of all who belong to her let me state the case to you once more and for the last time mr fairlie shook his head and sighed piteously this is heartless of you gilmore very heartless he said never mind go on i put all the points to him carefully i set the matter before him in every conceivable light he lay back in the chair the whole time i was speaking with his eyes closed when i had done he opened them indolently took his silver smellingbottle from the table and sniffed at it with an air of gentle relish good gilmore he said between the sniffs how very nice this is of you how you reconcile one to human nature give me a plain answer to a plain question mr fairlie i tell you again sir percival glyde has no shadow of a claim to expect more than the income of the money the money itself if your niece has no children ought to be under her control and to return to her family if you stand firm sir percival must give way he must give way i tell you or he exposes himself to the base imputation of marrying miss fairlie entirely from mercenary motives mr fairlie shook the silver smellingbottle at me playfully you dear old gilmore how you do hate rank and family dont you how you detest glyde because he happens to be a baronet what a radical you are oh dear me what a radical you are a radical i could put up with a good deal of provocation but after holding the soundest conservative principles all my life i could not put up with being called a radical my blood boiled at it i started out of my chair i was speechless with indignation dont shake the room cried mr fairlie for heavens sake dont shake the room worthiest of all possible gilmores i meant no offence my own views are so extremely liberal that i think i am a radical myself yes we are a pair of radicals please dont be angry i cant quarrel i havent stamina enough shall we drop the subject yes come and look at these sweet etchings do let me teach you to understand the heavenly pearliness of these lines do now theres a good gilmore while he was maundering on in this way i was fortunately for my own selfrespect returning to my senses when i spoke again i was composed enough to treat his impertinence with the silent contempt that it deserved you are entirely wrong sir i said in supposing that i speak from any prejudice against sir percival glyde i may regret that he has so unreservedly resigned himself in this matter to his lawyers direction as to make any appeal to himself impossible but i am not prejudiced against him what i have said would equally apply to any other man in his situation high or low the principle i maintain is a recognised principle if you were to apply at the nearest town here to the first respectable solicitor you could find he would tell you as a stranger what i tell you as a friend he would inform you that it is against all rule to abandon the ladys money entirely to the man she marries he would decline on grounds of common legal caution to give the husband under any circumstances whatever an interest of twenty thousand pounds in his wifes death would he really gilmore said mr fairlie if he said anything half so horrid i do assure you i should tinkle my bell for louis and have him sent out of the house immediately you shall not irritate me mr fairlie for your nieces sake and for her fathers sake you shall not irritate me you shall take the whole responsibility of this discreditable settlement on your own shoulders before i leave the room dont now please dont said mr fairlie think how precious your time is gilmore and dont throw it away i would dispute with you if i could but i cant i havent stamina enough you want to upset me to upset yourself to upset glyde and to upset laura and oh dear me all for the sake of the very last thing in the world that is likely to happen no dear friend in the interests of peace and quietness positively no i am to understand then that you hold by the determination expressed in your letter yes please so glad we understand each other at last sit down again do i walked at once to the door and mr fairlie resignedly tinkled his handbell before i left the room i turned round and addressed him for the last time whatever happens in the future sir i said remember that my plain duty of warning you has been performed as the faithful friend and servant of your family i tell you at parting that no daughter of mine should be married to any man alive under such a settlement as you are forcing me to make for miss fairlie the door opened behind me and the valet stood waiting on the threshold louis said mr fairlie show mr gilmore out and then come back and hold up my etchings for me again make them give you a good lunch downstairs do gilmore make my idle beasts of servants give you a good lunch i was too much disgusted to reply i turned on my heel and left him in silence there was an up train at two oclock in the afternoon and by that train i returned to london on the tuesday i sent in the altered settlement which practically disinherited the very persons whom miss fairlies own lips had informed me she was most anxious to benefit i had no choice another lawyer would have drawn up the deed if i had refused to undertake it my task is done my personal share in the events of the family story extends no farther than the point which i have just reached other pens than mine will describe the strange circumstances which are now shortly to follow seriously and sorrowfully i close this brief record seriously and sorrowfully i repeat here the parting words that i spoke at limmeridge house no daughter of mine should have been married to any man alive under such a settlement as i was compelled to make for laura fairlie the end of mr gilmores narrative the story continued by marian halcombe in extracts from her diary limmeridge house nov the passages omitted here and elsewhere in miss halcombes diary are only those which bear no reference to miss fairlie or to any of the persons with whom she is associated in these pages this morning mr gilmore left us his interview with laura had evidently grieved and surprised him more than he liked to confess i felt afraid from his look and manner when we parted that she might have inadvertently betrayed to him the real secret of her depression and my anxiety this doubt grew on me so after he had gone that i declined riding out with sir percival and went up to lauras room instead i have been sadly distrustful of myself in this difficult and lamentable matter ever since i found out my own ignorance of the strength of lauras unhappy attachment i ought to have known that the delicacy and forbearance and sense of honour which drew me to poor hartright and made me so sincerely admire and respect him were just the qualities to appeal most irresistibly to lauras natural sensitiveness and natural generosity of nature and yet until she opened her heart to me of her own accord i had no suspicion that this new feeling had taken root so deeply i once thought time and care might remove it i now fear that it will remain with her and alter her for life the discovery that i have committed such an error in judgment as this makes me hesitate about everything else i hesitate about sir percival in the face of the plainest proofs i hesitate even in speaking to laura on this very morning i doubted with my hand on the door whether i should ask her the questions i had come to put or not when i went into her room i found her walking up and down in great impatience she looked flushed and excited and she came forward at once and spoke to me before i could open my lips i wanted you she said come and sit down on the sofa with me marian i can bear this no longer i must and will end it there was too much colour in her cheeks too much energy in her manner too much firmness in her voice the little book of hartrights drawings the fatal book that she will dream over whenever she is alone was in one of her hands i began by gently and firmly taking it from her and putting it out of sight on a sidetable tell me quietly my darling what you wish to do i said has mr gilmore been advising you she shook her head no not in what i am thinking of now he was very kind and good to me marian and i am ashamed to say i distressed him by crying i am miserably helpless i cant control myself for my own sake and for all our sakes i must have courage enough to end it do you mean courage enough to claim your release i asked no she said simply courage dear to tell the truth she put her arms round my neck and rested her head quietly on my bosom on the opposite wall hung the miniature portrait of her father i bent over her and saw that she was looking at it while her head lay on my breast i can never claim my release from my engagement she went on whatever way it ends it must end wretchedly for me all i can do marian is not to add the remembrance that i have broken my promise and forgotten my fathers dying words to make that wretchedness worse what is it you propose then i asked to tell sir percival glyde the truth with my own lips she answered and to let him release me if he will not because i ask him but because he knows all what do you mean laura by all sir percival will know enough he has told me so himself if he knows that the engagement is opposed to your own wishes can i tell him that when the engagement was made for me by my father with my own consent i should have kept my promise not happily i am afraid but still contentedly she stopped turned her face to me and laid her cheek close against mine i should have kept my engagement marian if another love had not grown up in my heart which was not there when i first promised to be sir percivals wife laura you will never lower yourself by making a confession to him i shall lower myself indeed if i gain my release by hiding from him what he has a right to know he has not the shadow of a right to know it wrong marian wrong i ought to deceive no one least of all the man to whom my father gave me and to whom i gave myself she put her lips to mine and kissed me my own love she said softly you are so much too fond of me and so much too proud of me that you forget in my case what you would remember in your own better that sir percival should doubt my motives and misjudge my conduct if he will than that i should be first false to him in thought and then mean enough to serve my own interests by hiding the falsehood i held her away from me in astonishment for the first time in our lives we had changed places the resolution was all on her side the hesitation all on mine i looked into the pale quiet resigned young face i saw the pure innocent heart in the loving eyes that looked back at me and the poor worldly cautions and objections that rose to my lips dwindled and died away in their own emptiness i hung my head in silence in her place the despicably small pride which makes so many women deceitful would have been my pride and would have made me deceitful too dont be angry with me marian she said mistaking my silence i only answered by drawing her close to me again i was afraid of crying if i spoke my tears do not flow so easily as they ought they come almost like mens tears with sobs that seem to tear me in pieces and that frighten every one about me i have thought of this love for many days she went on twining and twisting my hair with that childish restlessness in her fingers which poor mrs vesey still tries so patiently and so vainly to cure her of i have thought of it very seriously and i can be sure of my courage when my own conscience tells me i am right let me speak to him tomorrow in your presence marian i will say nothing that is wrong nothing that you or i need be ashamed of but oh it will ease my heart so to end this miserable concealment only let me know and feel that i have no deception to answer for on my side and then when he has heard what i have to say let him act towards me as he will she sighed and put her head back in its old position on my bosom sad misgivings about what the end would be weighed upon my mind but still distrusting myself i told her that i would do as she wished she thanked me and we passed gradually into talking of other things at dinner she joined us again and was more easy and more herself with sir percival than i have seen her yet in the evening she went to the piano choosing new music of the dexterous tuneless florid kind the lovely old melodies of mozart which poor hartright was so fond of she has never played since he left the book is no longer in the musicstand she took the volume away herself so that nobody might find it out and ask her to play from it i had no opportunity of discovering whether her purpose of the morning had changed or not until she wished sir percival good night and then her own words informed me that it was unaltered she said very quietly that she wished to speak to him after breakfast and that he would find her in her sittingroom with me he changed colour at those words and i felt his hand trembling a little when it came to my turn to take it the event of the next morning would decide his future life and he evidently knew it i went in as usual through the door between our two bedrooms to bid laura goodnight before she went to sleep in stooping over her to kiss her i saw the little book of hartrights drawings half hidden under her pillow just in the place where she used to hide her favourite toys when she was a child i could not find it in my heart to say anything but i pointed to the book and shook my head she reached both hands up to my cheeks and drew my face down to hers till our lips met leave it there tonight she whispered tomorrow may be cruel and may make me say goodbye to it for ever th the first event of the morning was not of a kind to raise my spirits a letter arrived for me from poor walter hartright it is the answer to mine describing the manner in which sir percival cleared himself of the suspicions raised by anne cathericks letter he writes shortly and bitterly about sir percivals explanations only saying that he has no right to offer an opinion on the conduct of those who are above him this is sad but his occasional references to himself grieve me still more he says that the effort to return to his old habits and pursuits grows harder instead of easier to him every day and he implores me if i have any interest to exert it to get him employment that will necessitate his absence from england and take him among new scenes and new people i have been made all the readier to comply with this request by a passage at the end of his letter which has almost alarmed me after mentioning that he has neither seen nor heard anything of anne catherick he suddenly breaks off and hints in the most abrupt mysterious manner that he has been perpetually watched and followed by strange men ever since he returned to london he acknowledges that he cannot prove this extraordinary suspicion by fixing on any particular persons but he declares that the suspicion itself is present to him night and day this has frightened me because it looks as if his one fixed idea about laura was becoming too much for his mind i will write immediately to some of my mothers influential old friends in london and press his claims on their notice change of scene and change of occupation may really be the salvation of him at this crisis in his life greatly to my relief sir percival sent an apology for not joining us at breakfast he had taken an early cup of coffee in his own room and he was still engaged there in writing letters at eleven oclock if that hour was convenient he would do himself the honour of waiting on miss fairlie and miss halcombe my eyes were on lauras face while the message was being delivered i had found her unaccountably quiet and composed on going into her room in the morning and so she remained all through breakfast even when we were sitting together on the sofa in her room waiting for sir percival she still preserved her selfcontrol dont be afraid of me marian was all she said i may forget myself with an old friend like mr gilmore or with a dear sister like you but i will not forget myself with sir percival glyde i looked at her and listened to her in silent surprise through all the years of our close intimacy this passive force in her character had been hidden from me hidden even from herself till love found it and suffering called it forth as the clock on the mantelpiece struck eleven sir percival knocked at the door and came in there was suppressed anxiety and agitation in every line of his face the dry sharp cough which teases him at most times seemed to be troubling him more incessantly than ever he sat down opposite to us at the table and laura remained by me i looked attentively at them both and he was the palest of the two he said a few unimportant words with a visible effort to preserve his customary ease of manner but his voice was not to be steadied and the restless uneasiness in his eyes was not to be concealed he must have felt this himself for he stopped in the middle of a sentence and gave up even the attempt to hide his embarrassment any longer there was just one moment of dead silence before laura addressed him i wish to speak to you sir percival she said on a subject that is very important to us both my sister is here because her presence helps me and gives me confidence she has not suggested one word of what i am going to say i speak from my own thoughts not from hers i am sure you will be kind enough to understand that before i go any farther sir percival bowed she had proceeded thus far with perfect outward tranquillity and perfect propriety of manner she looked at him and he looked at her they seemed at the outset at least resolved to understand one another plainly i have heard from marian she went on that i have only to claim my release from our engagement to obtain that release from you it was forbearing and generous on your part sir percival to send me such a message it is only doing you justice to say that i am grateful for the offer and i hope and believe that it is only doing myself justice to tell you that i decline to accept it his attentive face relaxed a little but i saw one of his feet softly quietly incessantly beating on the carpet under the table and i felt that he was secretly as anxious as ever i have not forgotten she said that you asked my fathers permission before you honoured me with a proposal of marriage perhaps you have not forgotten either what i said when i consented to our engagement i ventured to tell you that my fathers influence and advice had mainly decided me to give you my promise i was guided by my father because i had always found him the truest of all advisers the best and fondest of all protectors and friends i have lost him now i have only his memory to love but my faith in that dear dead friend has never been shaken i believe at this moment as truly as i ever believed that he knew what was best and that his hopes and wishes ought to be my hopes and wishes too her voice trembled for the first time her restless fingers stole their way into my lap and held fast by one of my hands there was another moment of silence and then sir percival spoke may i ask he said if i have ever proved myself unworthy of the trust which it has been hitherto my greatest honour and greatest happiness to possess i have found nothing in your conduct to blame she answered you have always treated me with the same delicacy and the same forbearance you have deserved my trust and what is of far more importance in my estimation you have deserved my fathers trust out of which mine grew you have given me no excuse even if i had wanted to find one for asking to be released from my pledge what i have said so far has been spoken with the wish to acknowledge my whole obligation to you my regard for that obligation my regard for my fathers memory and my regard for my own promise all forbid me to set the example on my side of withdrawing from our present position the breaking of our engagement must be entirely your wish and your act sir percival not mine the uneasy beating of his foot suddenly stopped and he leaned forward eagerly across the table my act he said what reason can there be on my side for withdrawing i heard her breath quickening i felt her hand growing cold in spite of what she had said to me when we were alone i began to be afraid of her i was wrong a reason that it is very hard to tell you she answered there is a change in me sir percival a change which is serious enough to justify you to yourself and to me in breaking off our engagement his face turned so pale again that even his lips lost their colour he raised the arm which lay on the table turned a little away in his chair and supported his head on his hand so that his profile only was presented to us what change he asked the tone in which he put the question jarred on me there was something painfully suppressed in it she sighed heavily and leaned towards me a little so as to rest her shoulder against mine i felt her trembling and tried to spare her by speaking myself she stopped me by a warning pressure of her hand and then addressed sir percival one more but this time without looking at him i have heard she said and i believe it that the fondest and truest of all affections is the affection which a woman ought to bear to her husband when our engagement began that affection was mine to give if i could and yours to win if you could will you pardon me and spare me sir percival if i acknowledge that it is not so any longer a few tears gathered in her eyes and dropped over her cheeks slowly as she paused and waited for his answer he did not utter a word at the beginning of her reply he had moved the hand on which his head rested so that it hid his face i saw nothing but the upper part of his figure at the table not a muscle of him moved the fingers of the hand which supported his head were dented deep in his hair they might have expressed hidden anger or hidden grief it was hard to say which there was no significant trembling in them there was nothing absolutely nothing to tell the secret of his thoughts at that moment the moment which was the crisis of his life and the crisis of hers i was determined to make him declare himself for lauras sake sir percival i interposed sharply have you nothing to say when my sister has said so much more in my opinion i added my unlucky temper getting the better of me than any man alive in your position has a right to hear from her that last rash sentence opened a way for him by which to escape me if he chose and he instantly took advantage of it pardon me miss halcombe he said still keeping his hand over his face pardon me if i remind you that i have claimed no such right the few plain words which would have brought him back to the point from which he had wandered were just on my lips when laura checked me by speaking again i hope i have not made my painful acknowledgment in vain she continued i hope it has secured me your entire confidence in what i have still to say pray be assured of it he made that brief reply warmly dropping his hand on the table while he spoke and turning towards us again whatever outward change had passed over him was gone now his face was eager and expectant it expressed nothing but the most intense anxiety to hear her next words i wish you to understand that i have not spoken from any selfish motive she said if you leave me sir percival after what you have just heard you do not leave me to marry another man you only allow me to remain a single woman for the rest of my life my fault towards you has begun and ended in my own thoughts it can never go any farther no word has passed she hesitated in doubt about the expression she should use next hesitated in a momentary confusion which it was very sad and very painful to see no word has passed she patiently and resolutely resumed between myself and the person to whom i am now referring for the first and last time in your presence of my feelings towards him or of his feelings towards me no word ever can pass neither he nor i are likely in this world to meet again i earnestly beg you to spare me from saying any more and to believe me on my word in what i have just told you it is the truth sir percival the truth which i think my promised husband has a claim to hear at any sacrifice of my own feelings i trust to his generosity to pardon me and to his honour to keep my secret both those trusts are sacred to me he said and both shall be sacredly kept after answering in those terms he paused and looked at her as if he was waiting to hear more i have said all i wish to say she added quietly i have said more than enough to justify you in withdrawing from your engagement you have said more than enough he answered to make it the dearest object of my life to keep the engagement with those words he rose from his chair and advanced a few steps towards the place where she was sitting she started violently and a faint cry of surprise escaped her every word she had spoken had innocently betrayed her purity and truth to a man who thoroughly understood the priceless value of a pure and true woman her own noble conduct had been the hidden enemy throughout of all the hopes she had trusted to it i had dreaded this from the first i would have prevented it if she had allowed me the smallest chance of doing so i even waited and watched now when the harm was done for a word from sir percival that would give me the opportunity of putting him in the wrong you have left it to me miss fairlie to resign you he continued i am not heartless enough to resign a woman who has just shown herself to be the noblest of her sex he spoke with such warmth and feeling with such passionate enthusiasm and yet with such perfect delicacy that she raised her head flushed up a little and looked at him with sudden animation and spirit no she said firmly the most wretched of her sex if she must give herself in marriage when she cannot give her love may she not give it in the future he asked if the one object of her husbands life is to deserve it never she answered if you still persist in maintaining our engagement i may be your true and faithful wife sir percival your loving wife if i know my own heart never she looked so irresistibly beautiful as she said those brave words that no man alive could have steeled his heart against her i tried hard to feel that sir percival was to blame and to say so but my womanhood would pity him in spite of myself i gratefully accept your faith and truth he said the least that you can offer is more to me than the utmost that i could hope for from any other woman in the world her left hand still held mine but her right hand hung listlessly at her side he raised it gently to his lips touched it with them rather than kissed it bowed to me and then with perfect delicacy and discretion silently quitted the room she neither moved nor said a word when he was gone she sat by me cold and still with her eyes fixed on the ground i saw it was hopeless and useless to speak and i only put my arm round her and held her to me in silence we remained together so for what seemed a long and weary time so long and so weary that i grew uneasy and spoke to her softly in the hope of producing a change the sound of my voice seemed to startle her into consciousness she suddenly drew herself away from me and rose to her feet i must submit marian as well as i can she said my new life has its hard duties and one of them begins today as she spoke she went to a sidetable near the window on which her sketching materials were placed gathered them together carefully and put them in a drawer of her cabinet she locked the drawer and brought the key to me i must part from everything that reminds me of him she said keep the key wherever you please i shall never want it again before i could say a word she had turned away to her bookcase and had taken from it the album that contained walter hartrights drawings she hesitated for a moment holding the little volume fondly in her hands then lifted it to her lips and kissed it oh laura laura i said not angrily not reprovingly with nothing but sorrow in my voice and nothing but sorrow in my heart it is the last time marian she pleaded i am bidding it goodbye for ever she laid the book on the table and drew out the comb that fastened her hair it fell in its matchless beauty over her back and shoulders and dropped round her far below her waist she separated one long thin lock from the rest cut it off and pinned it carefully in the form of a circle on the first blank page of the album the moment it was fastened she closed the volume hurriedly and placed it in my hands you write to him and he writes to you she said while i am alive if he asks after me always tell him i am well and never say i am unhappy dont distress him marian for my sake dont distress him if i die first promise you will give him this little book of his drawings with my hair in it there can be no harm when i am gone in telling him that i put it there with my own hands and say oh marian say for me then what i can never say for myself say i loved him she flung her arms round my neck and whispered the last words in my ear with a passionate delight in uttering them which it almost broke my heart to hear all the long restraint she had imposed on herself gave way in that first last outburst of tenderness she broke from me with hysterical vehemence and threw herself on the sofa in a paroxysm of sobs and tears that shook her from head to foot i tried vainly to soothe her and reason with her she was past being soothed and past being reasoned with it was the sad sudden end for us two of this memorable day when the fit had worn itself out she was too exhausted to speak she slumbered towards the afternoon and i put away the book of drawings so that she might not see it when she woke my face was calm whatever my heart might be when she opened her eyes again and looked at me we said no more to each other about the distressing interview of the morning sir percivals name was not mentioned walter hartright was not alluded to again by either of us for the remainder of the day th finding that she was composed and like herself this morning i returned to the painful subject of yesterday for the sole purpose of imploring her to let me speak to sir percival and mr fairlie more plainly and strongly than she could speak to either of them herself about this lamentable marriage she interposed gently but firmly in the middle of my remonstrances i left yesterday to decide she said and yesterday has decided it is too late to go back sir percival spoke to me this afternoon about what had passed in lauras room he assured me that the unparalleled trust she had placed in him had awakened such an answering conviction of her innocence and integrity in his mind that he was guiltless of having felt even a moments unworthy jealousy either at the time when he was in her presence or afterwards when he had withdrawn from it deeply as he lamented the unfortunate attachment which had hindered the progress he might otherwise have made in her esteem and regard he firmly believed that it had remained unacknowledged in the past and that it would remain under all changes of circumstance which it was possible to contemplate unacknowledged in the future this was his absolute conviction and the strongest proof he could give of it was the assurance which he now offered that he felt no curiosity to know whether the attachment was of recent date or not or who had been the object of it his implicit confidence in miss fairlie made him satisfied with what she had thought fit to say to him and he was honestly innocent of the slightest feeling of anxiety to hear more he waited after saying those words and looked at me i was so conscious of my unreasonable prejudice against him so conscious of an unworthy suspicion that he might be speculating on my impulsively answering the very questions which he had just described himself as resolved not to ask that i evaded all reference to this part of the subject with something like a feeling of confusion on my own part at the same time i was resolved not to lose even the smallest opportunity of trying to plead lauras cause and i told him boldly that i regretted his generosity had not carried him one step farther and induced him to withdraw from the engagement altogether here again he disarmed me by not attempting to defend himself he would merely beg me to remember the difference there was between his allowing miss fairlie to give him up which was a matter of submission only and his forcing himself to give up miss fairlie which was in other words asking him to be the suicide of his own hopes her conduct of the day before had so strengthened the unchangeable love and admiration of two long years that all active contention against those feelings on his part was henceforth entirely out of his power i must think him weak selfish unfeeling towards the very woman whom he idolised and he must bow to my opinion as resignedly as he could only putting it to me at the same time whether her future as a single woman pining under an unhappily placed attachment which she could never acknowledge could be said to promise her a much brighter prospect than her future as the wife of a man who worshipped the very ground she walked on in the last case there was hope from time however slight it might be in the first case on her own showing there was no hope at all i answered him more because my tongue is a womans and must answer than because i had anything convincing to say it was only too plain that the course laura had adopted the day before had offered him the advantage if he chose to take it and that he had chosen to take it i felt this at the time and i feel it just as strongly now while i write these lines in my own room the one hope left is that his motives really spring as he says they do from the irresistible strength of his attachment to laura before i close my diary for tonight i must record that i wrote today in poor hartrights interest to two of my mothers old friends in london both men of influence and position if they can do anything for him i am quite sure they will except laura i never was more anxious about any one than i am now about walter all that has happened since he left us has only increased my strong regard and sympathy for him i hope i am doing right in trying to help him to employment abroad i hope most earnestly and anxiously that it will end well th sir percival had an interview with mr fairlie and i was sent for to join them i found mr fairlie greatly relieved at the prospect of the family worry as he was pleased to describe his nieces marriage being settled at last so far i did not feel called on to say anything to him about my own opinion but when he proceeded in his most aggravatingly languid manner to suggest that the time for the marriage had better be settled next in accordance with sir percivals wishes i enjoyed the satisfaction of assailing mr fairlies nerves with as strong a protest against hurrying lauras decision as i could put into words sir percival immediately assured me that he felt the force of my objection and begged me to believe that the proposal had not been made in consequence of any interference on his part mr fairlie leaned back in his chair closed his eyes said we both of us did honour to human nature and then repeated his suggestion as coolly as if neither sir percival nor i had said a word in opposition to it it ended in my flatly declining to mention the subject to laura unless she first approached it of her own accord i left the room at once after making that declaration sir percival looked seriously embarrassed and distressed mr fairlie stretched out his lazy legs on his velvet footstool and said dear marian how i envy you your robust nervous system dont bang the door on going to lauras room i found that she had asked for me and that mrs vesey had informed her that i was with mr fairlie she inquired at once what i had been wanted for and i told her all that had passed without attempting to conceal the vexation and annoyance that i really felt her answer surprised and distressed me inexpressibly it was the very last reply that i should have expected her to make my uncle is right she said i have caused trouble and anxiety enough to you and to all about me let me cause no more marian let sir percival decide i remonstrated warmly but nothing that i could say moved her i am held to my engagement she replied i have broken with my old life the evil day will not come the less surely because i put it off no marian once again my uncle is right i have caused trouble enough and anxiety enough and i will cause no more she used to be pliability itself but she was now inflexibly passive in her resignation i might almost say in her despair dearly as i love her i should have been less pained if she had been violently agitated it was so shockingly unlike her natural character to see her as cold and insensible as i saw her now th sir percival put some questions to me at breakfast about laura which left me no choice but to tell him what she had said while we were talking she herself came down and joined us she was just as unnaturally composed in sir percivals presence as she had been in mine when breakfast was over he had an opportunity of saying a few words to her privately in a recess of one of the windows they were not more than two or three minutes together and on their separating she left the room with mrs vesey while sir percival came to me he said he had entreated her to favour him by maintaining her privilege of fixing the time for the marriage at her own will and pleasure in reply she had merely expressed her acknowledgments and had desired him to mention what his wishes were to miss halcombe i have no patience to write more in this instance as in every other sir percival has carried his point with the utmost possible credit to himself in spite of everything that i can say or do his wishes are now what they were of course when he first came here and laura having resigned herself to the one inevitable sacrifice of the marriage remains as coldly hopeless and enduring as ever in parting with the little occupations and relics that reminded her of hartright she seems to have parted with all her tenderness and all her impressibility it is only three oclock in the afternoon while i write these lines and sir percival has left us already in the happy hurry of a bridegroom to prepare for the brides reception at his house in hampshire unless some extraordinary event happens to prevent it they will be married exactly at the time when he wished to be married before the end of the year my very fingers burn as i write it th a sleepless night through uneasiness about laura towards the morning i came to a resolution to try what change of scene would do to rouse her she cannot surely remain in her present torpor of insensibility if i take her away from limmeridge and surround her with the pleasant faces of old friends after some consideration i decided on writing to the arnolds in yorkshire they are simple kindhearted hospitable people and she has known them from her childhood when i had put the letter in the postbag i told her what i had done it would have been a relief to me if she had shown the spirit to resist and object but no she only said i will go anywhere with you marian i dare say you are right i dare say the change will do me good th i wrote to mr gilmore informing him that there was really a prospect of this miserable marriage taking place and also mentioning my idea of trying what change of scene would do for laura i had no heart to go into particulars time enough for them when we get nearer to the end of the year th three letters for me the first from the arnolds full of delight at the prospect of seeing laura and me the second from one of the gentlemen to whom i wrote on walter hartrights behalf informing me that he has been fortunate enough to find an opportunity of complying with my request the third from walter himself thanking me poor fellow in the warmest terms for giving him an opportunity of leaving his home his country and his friends a private expedition to make excavations among the ruined cities of central america is it seems about to sail from liverpool the draughtsman who had been already appointed to accompany it has lost heart and withdrawn at the eleventh hour and walter is to fill his place he is to be engaged for six months certain from the time of the landing in honduras and for a year afterwards if the excavations are successful and if the funds hold out his letter ends with a promise to write me a farewell line when they are all on board ship and when the pilot leaves them i can only hope and pray earnestly that he and i are both acting in this matter for the best it seems such a serious step for him to take that the mere contemplation of it startles me and yet in his unhappy position how can i expect him or wish him to remain at home th the carriage is at the door laura and i set out on our visit to the arnolds today polesdean lodge yorkshire rd a week in these new scenes and among these kindhearted people has done her some good though not so much as i had hoped i have resolved to prolong our stay for another week at least it is useless to go back to limmeridge till there is an absolute necessity for our return th sad news by this mornings post the expedition to central america sailed on the twentyfirst we have parted with a true man we have lost a faithful friend water hartright has left england th sad news yesterday ominous news today sir percival glyde has written to mr fairlie and mr fairlie has written to laura and me to recall us to limmeridge immediately what can this mean has the day for the marriage been fixed in our absence ii limmeridge house november th my forebodings are realised the marriage is fixed for the twentysecond of december the day after we left for polesdean lodge sir percival wrote it seems to mr fairlie to say that the necessary repairs and alterations in his house in hampshire would occupy a much longer time in completion than he had originally anticipated the proper estimates were to be submitted to him as soon as possible and it would greatly facilitate his entering into definite arrangements with the workpeople if he could be informed of the exact period at which the wedding ceremony might be expected to take place he could then make all his calculations in reference to time besides writing the necessary apologies to friends who had been engaged to visit him that winter and who could not of course be received when the house was in the hands of the workmen to this letter mr fairlie had replied by requesting sir percival himself to suggest a day for the marriage subject to miss fairlies approval which her guardian willingly undertook to do his best to obtain sir percival wrote back by the next post and proposed in accordance with his own views and wishes from the first the latter part of december perhaps the twentysecond or twentyfourth or any other day that the lady and her guardian might prefer the lady not being at hand to speak for herself her guardian had decided in her absence on the earliest day mentioned the twentysecond of december and had written to recall us to limmeridge in consequence after explaining these particulars to me at a private interview yesterday mr fairlie suggested in his most amiable manner that i should open the necessary negotiations today feeling that resistance was useless unless i could first obtain lauras authority to make it i consented to speak to her but declared at the same time that i would on no consideration undertake to gain her consent to sir percivals wishes mr fairlie complimented me on my excellent conscience much as he would have complimented me if he had been out walking on my excellent constitution and seemed perfectly satisfied so far with having simply shifted one more family responsibility from his own shoulders to mine this morning i spoke to laura as i had promised the composure i may almost say the insensibility which she has so strangely and so resolutely maintained ever since sir percival left us was not proof against the shock of the news i had to tell her she turned pale and trembled violently not so soon she pleaded oh marian not so soon the slightest hint she could give was enough for me i rose to leave the room and fight her battle for her at once with mr fairlie just as my hand was on the door she caught fast hold of my dress and stopped me let me go i said my tongue burns to tell your uncle that he and sir percival are not to have it all their own way she sighed bitterly and still held my dress no she said faintly too late marian too late not a minute too late i retorted the question of time is our question and trust me laura to take a womans full advantage of it i unclasped her hand from my gown while i spoke but she slipped both her arms round my waist at the same moment and held me more effectually than ever it will only involve us in more trouble and more confusion she said it will set you and my uncle at variance and bring sir percival here again with fresh causes of complaint so much the better i cried out passionately who cares for his causes of complaint are you to break your heart to set his mind at ease no man under heaven deserves these sacrifices from us women men they are the enemies of our innocence and our peace they drag us away from our parents love and our sisters friendship they take us body and soul to themselves and fasten our helpless lives to theirs as they chain up a dog to his kennel and what does the best of them give us in return let me go laura im mad when i think of it the tears miserable weak womens tears of vexation and rage started to my eyes she smiled sadly and put her handkerchief over my face to hide for me the betrayal of my own weakness the weakness of all others which she knew that i most despised oh marian she said you crying think what you would say to me if the places were changed and if those tears were mine all your love and courage and devotion will not alter what must happen sooner or later let my uncle have his way let us have no more troubles and heartburnings that any sacrifice of mine can prevent say you will live with me marian when i am married and say no more but i did say more i forced back the contemptible tears that were no relief to me and that only distressed her and reasoned and pleaded as calmly as i could it was of no avail she made me twice repeat the promise to live with her when she was married and then suddenly asked a question which turned my sorrow and my sympathy for her into a new direction while we were at polesdean she said you had a letter marian her altered tone the abrupt manner in which she looked away from me and hid her face on my shoulder the hesitation which silenced her before she had completed her question all told me but too plainly to whom the halfexpressed inquiry pointed i thought laura that you and i were never to refer to him again i said gently you had a letter from him she persisted yes i replied if you must know it do you mean to write to him again i hesitated i had been afraid to tell her of his absence from england or of the manner in which my exertions to serve his new hopes and projects had connected me with his departure what answer could i make he was gone where no letters could reach him for months perhaps for years to come suppose i do mean to write to him again i said at last what then laura her cheek grew burning hot against my neck and her arms trembled and tightened round me dont tell him about the twentysecond she whispered promise marian pray promise you will not even mention my name to him when you write next i gave the promise no words can say how sorrowfully i gave it she instantly took her arm from my waist walked away to the window and stood looking out with her back to me after a moment she spoke once more but without turning round without allowing me to catch the smallest glimpse of her face are you going to my uncles room she asked will you say that i consent to whatever arrangement he may think best never mind leaving me marian i shall be better alone for a little while i went out if as soon as i got into the passage i could have transported mr fairlie and sir percival glyde to the uttermost ends of the earth by lifting one of my fingers that finger would have been raised without an instants hesitation for once my unhappy temper now stood my friend i should have broken down altogether and burst into a violent fit of crying if my tears had not been all burnt up in the heat of my anger as it was i dashed into mr fairlies room called to him as harshly as possible laura consents to the twentysecond and dashed out again without waiting for a word of answer i banged the door after me and i hope i shattered mr fairlies nervous system for the rest of the day th this morning i read poor hartrights farewell letter over again a doubt having crossed my mind since yesterday whether i am acting wisely in concealing the fact of his departure from laura on reflection i still think i am right the allusions in his letter to the preparations made for the expedition to central america all show that the leaders of it know it to be dangerous if the discovery of this makes me uneasy what would it make her it is bad enough to feel that his departure has deprived us of the friend of all others to whose devotion we could trust in the hour of need if ever that hour comes and finds us helpless but it is far worse to know that he has gone from us to face the perils of a bad climate a wild country and a disturbed population surely it would be a cruel candour to tell laura this without a pressing and a positive necessity for it i almost doubt whether i ought not to go a step farther and burn the letter at once for fear of its one day falling into wrong hands it not only refers to laura in terms which ought to remain a secret for ever between the writer and me but it reiterates his suspicion so obstinate so unaccountable and so alarming that he has been secretly watched since he left limmeridge he declares that he saw the faces of the two strange men who followed him about the streets of london watching him among the crowd which gathered at liverpool to see the expedition embark and he positively asserts that he heard the name of anne catherick pronounced behind him as he got into the boat his own words are these events have a meaning these events must lead to a result the mystery of anne catherick is not cleared up yet she may never cross my path again but if ever she crosses yours make better use of the opportunity miss halcombe than i made of it i speak on strong conviction i entreat you to remember what i say these are his own expressions there is no danger of my forgetting them my memory is only too ready to dwell on any words of hartrights that refer to anne catherick but there is danger in my keeping the letter the merest accident might place it at the mercy of strangers i may fall ill i may die better to burn it at once and have one anxiety the less it is burnt the ashes of his farewell letter the last he may ever write to me lie in a few black fragments on the hearth is this the sad end to all that sad story oh not the end surely surely not the end already th the preparations for the marriage have begun the dressmaker has come to receive her orders laura is perfectly impassive perfectly careless about the question of all others in which a womans personal interests are most closely bound up she has left it all to the dressmaker and to me if poor hartright had been the baronet and the husband of her fathers choice how differently she would have behaved how anxious and capricious she would have been and what a hard task the best of dressmakers would have found it to please her th we hear every day from sir percival the last news is that the alterations in his house will occupy from four to six months before they can be properly completed if painters paperhangers and upholsterers could make happiness as well as splendour i should be interested about their proceedings in lauras future home as it is the only part of sir percivals last letter which does not leave me as it found me perfectly indifferent to all his plans and projects is the part which refers to the wedding tour he proposes as laura is delicate and as the winter threatens to be unusually severe to take her to rome and to remain in italy until the early part of next summer if this plan should not be approved he is equally ready although he has no establishment of his own in town to spend the season in london in the most suitable furnished house that can be obtained for the purpose putting myself and my own feelings entirely out of the question which it is my duty to do and which i have done i for one have no doubt of the propriety of adopting the first of these proposals in either case a separation between laura and me is inevitable it will be a longer separation in the event of their going abroad than it would be in the event of their remaining in london but we must set against this disadvantage the benefit to laura on the other side of passing the winter in a mild climate and more than that the immense assistance in raising her spirits and reconciling her to her new existence which the mere wonder and excitement of travelling for the first time in her life in the most interesting country in the world must surely afford she is not of a disposition to find resources in the conventional gaieties and excitements of london they would only make the first oppression of this lamentable marriage fall the heavier on her i dread the beginning of her new life more than words can tell but i see some hope for her if she travels none if she remains at home it is strange to look back at this latest entry in my journal and to find that i am writing of the marriage and the parting with laura as people write of a settled thing it seems so cold and so unfeeling to be looking at the future already in this cruelly composed way but what other way is possible now that the time is drawing so near before another month is over our heads she will be his laura instead of mine his laura i am as little able to realise the idea which those two words convey my mind feels almost as dulled and stunned by it as if writing of her marriage were like writing of her death december st a sad sad day a day that i have no heart to describe at any length after weakly putting it off last night i was obliged to speak to her this morning of sir percivals proposal about the wedding tour in the full conviction that i should be with her wherever she went the poor child for a child she is still in many things was almost happy at the prospect of seeing the wonders of florence and rome and naples it nearly broke my heart to dispel her delusion and to bring her face to face with the hard truth i was obliged to tell her that no man tolerates a rival not even a woman rival in his wifes affections when he first marries whatever he may do afterwards i was obliged to warn her that my chance of living with her permanently under her own roof depended entirely on my not arousing sir percivals jealousy and distrust by standing between them at the beginning of their marriage in the position of the chosen depositary of his wifes closest secrets drop by drop i poured the profaning bitterness of this worlds wisdom into that pure heart and that innocent mind while every higher and better feeling within me recoiled from my miserable task it is over now she has learnt her hard her inevitable lesson the simple illusions of her girlhood are gone and my hand has stripped them off better mine than his that is all my consolation better mine than his so the first proposal is the proposal accepted they are to go to italy and i am to arrange with sir percivals permission for meeting them and staying with them when they return to england in other words i am to ask a personal favour for the first time in my life and to ask it of the man of all others to whom i least desire to owe a serious obligation of any kind well i think i could do even more than that for lauras sake nd on looking back i find myself always referring to sir percival in disparaging terms in the turn affairs have now taken i must and will root out my prejudice against him i cannot think how it first got into my mind it certainly never existed in former times is it lauras reluctance to become his wife that has set me against him have hartrights perfectly intelligible prejudices infected me without my suspecting their influence does that letter of anne cathericks still leave a lurking distrust in my mind in spite of sir percivals explanation and of the proof in my possession of the truth of it i cannot account for the state of my own feelings the one thing i am certain of is that it is my duty doubly my duty now not to wrong sir percival by unjustly distrusting him if it has got to be a habit with me always to write of him in the same unfavourable manner i must and will break myself of this unworthy tendency even though the effort should force me to close the pages of my journal till the marriage is over i am seriously dissatisfied with myself i will write no more today december th a whole fortnight has passed and i have not once opened these pages i have been long enough away from my journal to come back to it with a healthier and better mind i hope so far as sir percival is concerned there is not much to record of the past two weeks the dresses are almost all finished and the new travelling trunks have been sent here from london poor dear laura hardly leaves me for a moment all day and last night when neither of us could sleep she came and crept into my bed to talk to me there i shall lose you so soon marian she said i must make the most of you while i can they are to be married at limmeridge church and thank heaven not one of the neighbours is to be invited to the ceremony the only visitor will be our old friend mr arnold who is to come from polesdean to give laura away her uncle being far too delicate to trust himself outside the door in such inclement weather as we now have if i were not determined from this day forth to see nothing but the bright side of our prospects the melancholy absence of any male relative of lauras at the most important moment of her life would make me very gloomy and very distrustful of the future but i have done with gloom and distrust that is to say i have done with writing about either the one or the other in this journal sir percival is to arrive tomorrow he offered in case we wished to treat him on terms of rigid etiquette to write and ask our clergyman to grant him the hospitality of the rectory during the short period of his sojourn at limmeridge before the marriage under the circumstances neither mr fairlie nor i thought it at all necessary for us to trouble ourselves about attending to trifling forms and ceremonies in our wild moorland country and in this great lonely house we may well claim to be beyond the reach of the trivial conventionalities which hamper people in other places i wrote to sir percival to thank him for his polite offer and to beg that he would occupy his old rooms just as usual at limmeridge house th he arrived today looking as i thought a little worn and anxious but still talking and laughing like a man in the best possible spirits he brought with him some really beautiful presents in jewellery which laura received with her best grace and outwardly at least with perfect selfpossession the only sign i can detect of the struggle it must cost her to preserve appearances at this trying time expresses itself in a sudden unwillingness on her part ever to be left alone instead of retreating to her own room as usual she seems to dread going there when i went upstairs today after lunch to put on my bonnet for a walk she volunteered to join me and again before dinner she threw the door open between our two rooms so that we might talk to each other while we were dressing keep me always doing something she said keep me always in company with somebody dont let me think that is all i ask now marian dont let me think this sad change in her only increases her attractions for sir percival he interprets it i can see to his own advantage there is a feverish flush in her cheeks a feverish brightness in her eyes which he welcomes as the return of her beauty and the recovery of her spirits she talked today at dinner with a gaiety and carelessness so false so shockingly out of her character that i secretly longed to silence her and take her away sir percivals delight and surprise appeared to be beyond all expression the anxiety which i had noticed on his face when he arrived totally disappeared from it and he looked even to my eyes a good ten years younger than he really is there can be no doubt though some strange perversity prevents me from seeing it myself there can be no doubt that lauras future husband is a very handsome man regular features form a personal advantage to begin with and he has them bright brown eyes either in man or woman are a great attraction and he has them even baldness when it is only baldness over the forehead as in his case is rather becoming than not in a man for it heightens the head and adds to the intelligence of the face grace and ease of movement untiring animation of manner ready pliant conversational powers all these are unquestionable merits and all these he certainly possesses surely mr gilmore ignorant as he is of lauras secret was not to blame for feeling surprised that she should repent of her marriage engagement any one else in his place would have shared our good old friends opinion if i were asked at this moment to say plainly what defects i have discovered in sir percival i could only point out two one his incessant restlessness and excitability which may be caused naturally enough by unusual energy of character the other his short sharp illtempered manner of speaking to the servants which may be only a bad habit after all no i cannot dispute it and i will not dispute it sir percival is a very handsome and a very agreeable man there i have written it down at last and i am glad its over th feeling weary and depressed this morning i left laura with mrs vesey and went out alone for one of my brisk midday walks which i have discontinued too much of late i took the dry airy road over the moor that leads to todds corner after having been out half an hour i was excessively surprised to see sir percival approaching me from the direction of the farm he was walking rapidly swinging his stick his head erect as usual and his shooting jacket flying open in the wind when we met he did not wait for me to ask any questions he told me at once that he had been to the farm to inquire if mr or mrs todd had received any tidings since his last visit to limmeridge of anne catherick you found of course that they had heard nothing i said nothing whatever he replied i begin to be seriously afraid that we have lost her do you happen to know he continued looking me in the face very attentively if the artist mr hartright is in a position to give us any further information he has neither heard of her nor seen her since he left cumberland i answered very sad said sir percival speaking like a man who was disappointed and yet oddly enough looking at the same time like a man who was relieved it is impossible to say what misfortunes may not have happened to the miserable creature i am inexpressibly annoyed at the failure of all my efforts to restore her to the care and protection which she so urgently needs this time he really looked annoyed i said a few sympathising words and we then talked of other subjects on our way back to the house surely my chance meeting with him on the moor has disclosed another favourable trait in his character surely it was singularly considerate and unselfish of him to think of anne catherick on the eve of his marriage and to go all the way to todds corner to make inquiries about her when he might have passed the time so much more agreeably in lauras society considering that he can only have acted from motives of pure charity his conduct under the circumstances shows unusual good feeling and deserves extraordinary praise well i give him extraordinary praise and theres an end of it th more discoveries in the inexhaustible mine of sir percivals virtues today i approached the subject of my proposed sojourn under his wifes roof when he brings her back to england i had hardly dropped my first hint in this direction before he caught me warmly by the hand and said i had made the very offer to him which he had been on his side most anxious to make to me i was the companion of all others whom he most sincerely longed to secure for his wife and he begged me to believe that i had conferred a lasting favour on him by making the proposal to live with laura after her marriage exactly as i had always lived with her before it when i had thanked him in her name and mine for his considerate kindness to both of us we passed next to the subject of his wedding tour and began to talk of the english society in rome to which laura was to be introduced he ran over the names of several friends whom he expected to meet abroad this winter they were all english as well as i can remember with one exception the one exception was count fosco the mention of the counts name and the discovery that he and his wife are likely to meet the bride and bridegroom on the continent puts lauras marriage for the first time in a distinctly favourable light it is likely to be the means of healing a family feud hitherto madame fosco has chosen to forget her obligations as lauras aunt out of sheer spite against the late mr fairlie for his conduct in the affair of the legacy now however she can persist in this course of conduct no longer sir percival and count fosco are old and fast friends and their wives will have no choice but to meet on civil terms madame fosco in her maiden days was one of the most impertinent women i ever met with capricious exacting and vain to the last degree of absurdity if her husband has succeeded in bringing her to her senses he deserves the gratitude of every member of the family and he may have mine to begin with i am becoming anxious to know the count he is the most intimate friend of lauras husband and in that capacity he excites my strongest interest neither laura nor i have ever seen him all i know of him is that his accidental presence years ago on the steps of the trinita del monte at rome assisted sir percivals escape from robbery and assassination at the critical moment when he was wounded in the hand and might the next instant have been wounded in the heart i remember also that at the time of the late mr fairlies absurd objections to his sisters marriage the count wrote him a very temperate and sensible letter on the subject which i am ashamed to say remained unanswered this is all i know of sir percivals friend i wonder if he will ever come to england i wonder if i shall like him my pen is running away into mere speculation let me return to sober matter of fact it is certain that sir percivals reception of my venturesome proposal to live with his wife was more than kind it was almost affectionate i am sure lauras husband will have no reason to complain of me if i can only go on as i have begun i have already declared him to be handsome agreeable full of good feeling towards the unfortunate and full of affectionate kindness towards me really i hardly know myself again in my new character of sir percivals warmest friend th i hate sir percival i flatly deny his good looks i consider him to be eminently illtempered and disagreeable and totally wanting in kindness and good feeling last night the cards for the married couple were sent home laura opened the packet and saw her future name in print for the first time sir percival looked over her shoulder familiarly at the new card which had already transformed miss fairlie into lady glyde smiled with the most odious selfcomplacency and whispered something in her ear i dont know what it was laura has refused to tell me but i saw her face turn to such a deadly whiteness that i thought she would have fainted he took no notice of the change he seemed to be barbarously unconscious that he had said anything to pain her all my old feelings of hostility towards him revived on the instant and all the hours that have passed since have done nothing to dissipate them i am more unreasonable and more unjust than ever in three words how glibly my pen writes them in three words i hate him st have the anxieties of this anxious time shaken me a little at last i have been writing for the last few days in a tone of levity which heaven knows is far enough from my heart and which it has rather shocked me to discover on looking back at the entries in my journal perhaps i may have caught the feverish excitement of lauras spirits for the last week if so the fit has already passed away from me and has left me in a very strange state of mind a persistent idea has been forcing itself on my attention ever since last night that something will yet happen to prevent the marriage what has produced this singular fancy is it the indirect result of my apprehensions for lauras future or has it been unconsciously suggested to me by the increasing restlessness and irritability which i have certainly observed in sir percivals manner as the weddingday draws nearer and nearer impossible to say i know that i have the idea surely the wildest idea under the circumstances that ever entered a womans head but try as i may i cannot trace it back to its source this last day has been all confusion and wretchedness how can i write about it and yet i must write anything is better than brooding over my own gloomy thoughts kind mrs vesey whom we have all too much overlooked and forgotten of late innocently caused us a sad morning to begin with she has been for months past secretly making a warm shetland shawl for her dear pupil a most beautiful and surprising piece of work to be done by a woman at her age and with her habits the gift was presented this morning and poor warm hearted laura completely broke down when the shawl was put proudly on her shoulders by the loving old friend and guardian of her motherless childhood i was hardly allowed time to quiet them both or even to dry my own eyes when i was sent for by mr fairlie to be favoured with a long recital of his arrangements for the preservation of his own tranquillity on the weddingday dear laura was to receive his present a shabby ring with her affectionate uncles hair for an ornament instead of a precious stone and with a heartless french inscription inside about congenial sentiments and eternal friendship dear laura was to receive this tender tribute from my hands immediately so that she might have plenty of time to recover from the agitation produced by the gift before she appeared in mr fairlies presence dear laura was to pay him a little visit that evening and to be kind enough not to make a scene dear laura was to pay him another little visit in her weddingdress the next morning and to be kind enough again not to make a scene dear laura was to look in once more for the third time before going away but without harrowing his feelings by saying when she was going away and without tears in the name of pity in the name of everything dear marian that is most affectionate and most domestic and most delightfully and charmingly selfcomposed without tears i was so exasperated by this miserable selfish trifling at such a time that i should certainly have shocked mr fairlie by some of the hardest and rudest truths he has ever heard in his life if the arrival of mr arnold from polesdean had not called me away to new duties downstairs the rest of the day is indescribable i believe no one in the house really knew how it passed the confusion of small events all huddled together one on the other bewildered everybody there were dresses sent home that had been forgotten there were trunks to be packed and unpacked and packed again there were presents from friends far and near friends high and low we were all needlessly hurried all nervously expectant of the morrow sir percival especially was too restless now to remain five minutes together in the same place that short sharp cough of his troubled him more than ever he was in and out of doors all day long and he seemed to grow so inquisitive on a sudden that he questioned the very strangers who came on small errands to the house add to all this the one perpetual thought in lauras mind and mine that we were to part the next day and the haunting dread unexpressed by either of us and yet ever present to both that this deplorable marriage might prove to be the one fatal error of her life and the one hopeless sorrow of mine for the first time in all the years of our close and happy intercourse we almost avoided looking each other in the face and we refrained by common consent from speaking together in private through the whole evening i can dwell on it no longer whatever future sorrows may be in store for me i shall always look back on this twentyfirst of december as the most comfortless and most miserable day of my life i am writing these lines in the solitude of my own room long after midnight having just come back from a stolen look at laura in her pretty little white bed the bed she has occupied since the days of her girlhood there she lay unconscious that i was looking at her quiet more quiet than i had dared to hope but not sleeping the glimmer of the nightlight showed me that her eyes were only partially closed the traces of tears glistened between her eyelids my little keepsake only a brooch lay on the table at her bedside with her prayerbook and the miniature portrait of her father which she takes with her wherever she goes i waited a moment looking at her from behind her pillow as she lay beneath me with one arm and hand resting on the white coverlid so still so quietly breathing that the frill on her nightdress never moved i waited looking at her as i have seen her thousands of times as i shall never see her again and then stole back to my room my own love with all your wealth and all your beauty how friendless you are the one man who would give his hearts life to serve you is far away tossing this stormy night on the awful sea who else is left to you no father no brother no living creature but the helpless useless woman who writes these sad lines and watches by you for the morning in sorrow that she cannot compose in doubt that she cannot conquer oh what a trust is to be placed in that mans hands tomorrow if ever he forgets it if ever he injures a hair of her head the twentysecond of december seven oclock a wild unsettled morning she has just risen better and calmer now that the time has come than she was yesterday ten oclock she is dressed we have kissed each other we have promised each other not to lose courage i am away for a moment in my own room in the whirl and confusion of my thoughts i can detect that strange fancy of some hindrance happening to stop the marriage still hanging about my mind is it hanging about his mind too i see him from the window moving hither and thither uneasily among the carriages at the door how can i write such folly the marriage is a certainty in less than half an hour we start for the church eleven oclock it is all over they are married three oclock they are gone i am blind with crying i can write no more the first epoch of the story closes here the second epoch the story continued by marian halcombe i blackwater park hampshire june th six months to look back on six long lonely months since laura and i last saw each other how many days have i still to wait only one tomorrow the twelfth the travellers return to england i can hardly realise my own happiness i can hardly believe that the next fourand twenty hours will complete the last day of separation between laura and me she and her husband have been in italy all the winter and afterwards in the tyrol they come back accompanied by count fosco and his wife who propose to settle somewhere in the neighbourhood of london and who have engaged to stay at blackwater park for the summer months before deciding on a place of residence so long as laura returns no matter who returns with her sir percival may fill the house from floor to ceiling if he likes on condition that his wife and i inhabit it together meanwhile here i am established at blackwater park the ancient and interesting seat as the county history obligingly informs me of sir percival glyde bart and the future abidingplace as i may now venture to add on my account of plain marian halcombe spinster now settled in a snug little sittingroom with a cup of tea by her side and all her earthly possessions ranged round her in three boxes and a bag i left limmeridge yesterday having received lauras delightful letter from paris the day before i had been previously uncertain whether i was to meet them in london or in hampshire but this last letter informed me that sir percival proposed to land at southampton and to travel straight on to his countryhouse he has spent so much money abroad that he has none left to defray the expenses of living in london for the remainder of the season and he is economically resolved to pass the summer and autumn quietly at blackwater laura has had more than enough of excitement and change of scene and is pleased at the prospect of country tranquillity and retirement which her husbands prudence provides for her as for me i am ready to be happy anywhere in her society we are all therefore well contented in our various ways to begin with last night i slept in london and was delayed there so long today by various calls and commissions that i did not reach blackwater this evening till after dusk judging by my vague impressions of the place thus far it is the exact opposite of limmeridge the house is situated on a dead flat and seems to be shut in almost suffocated to my northcountry notions by trees i have seen nobody but the manservant who opened the door to me and the housekeeper a very civil person who showed me the way to my own room and got me my tea i have a nice little boudoir and bedroom at the end of a long passage on the first floor the servants and some of the spare rooms are on the second floor and all the living rooms are on the ground floor i have not seen one of them yet and i know nothing about the house except that one wing of it is said to be five hundred years old that it had a moat round it once and that it gets its name of blackwater from a lake in the park eleven oclock has just struck in a ghostly and solemn manner from a turret over the centre of the house which i saw when i came in a large dog has been woke apparently by the sound of the bell and is howling and yawning drearily somewhere round a corner i hear echoing footsteps in the passages below and the iron thumping of bolts and bars at the house door the servants are evidently going to bed shall i follow their example no i am not half sleepy enough sleepy did i say i feel as if i should never close my eyes again the bare anticipation of seeing that dear face and hearing that wellknown voice to morrow keeps me in a perpetual fever of excitement if i only had the privileges of a man i would order out sir percivals best horse instantly and tear away on a nightgallop eastward to meet the rising sun a long hard heavy ceaseless gallop of hours and hours like the famous highwaymans ride to york being however nothing but a woman condemned to patience propriety and petticoats for life i must respect the house keepers opinions and try to compose myself in some feeble and feminine way reading is out of the question i cant fix my attention on books let me try if i can write myself into sleepiness and fatigue my journal has been very much neglected of late what can i recall standing as i now do on the threshold of a new life of persons and events of chances and changes during the past six months the long weary empty interval since lauras weddingday walter hartright is uppermost in my memory and he passes first in the shadowy procession of my absent friends i received a few lines from him after the landing of the expedition in honduras written more cheerfully and hopefully than he has written yet a month or six weeks later i saw an extract from an american newspaper describing the departure of the adventurers on their inland journey they were last seen entering a wild primeval forest each man with his rifle on his shoulder and his baggage at his back since that time civilisation has lost all trace of them not a line more have i received from walter not a fragment of news from the expedition has appeared in any of the public journals the same dense disheartening obscurity hangs over the fate and fortunes of anne catherick and her companion mrs clements nothing whatever has been heard of either of them whether they are in the country or out of it whether they are living or dead no one knows even sir percivals solicitor has lost all hope and has ordered the useless search after the fugitives to be finally given up our good old friend mr gilmore has met with a sad check in his active professional career early in the spring we were alarmed by hearing that he had been found insensible at his desk and that the seizure was pronounced to be an apoplectic fit he had been long complaining of fulness and oppression in the head and his doctor had warned him of the consequences that would follow his persistency in continuing to work early and late as if he were still a young man the result now is that he has been positively ordered to keep out of his office for a year to come at least and to seek repose of body and relief of mind by altogether changing his usual mode of life the business is left accordingly to be carried on by his partner and he is himself at this moment away in germany visiting some relations who are settled there in mercantile pursuits thus another true friend and trustworthy adviser is lost to us lost i earnestly hope and trust for a time only poor mrs vesey travelled with me as far as london it was impossible to abandon her to solitude at limmeridge after laura and i had both left the house and we have arranged that she is to live with an unmarried younger sister of hers who keeps a school at clapham she is to come here this autumn to visit her pupil i might almost say her adopted child i saw the good old lady safe to her destination and left her in the care of her relative quietly happy at the prospect of seeing laura again in a few months time as for mr fairlie i believe i am guilty of no injustice if i describe him as being unutterably relieved by having the house clear of us women the idea of his missing his niece is simply preposterous he used to let months pass in the old times without attempting to see her and in my case and mrs veseys i take leave to consider his telling us both that he was half heart broken at our departure to be equivalent to a confession that he was secretly rejoiced to get rid of us his last caprice has led him to keep two photographers incessantly employed in producing sunpictures of all the treasures and curiosities in his possession one complete copy of the collection of the photographs is to be presented to the mechanics institution of carlisle mounted on the finest cardboard with ostentatious red letter inscriptions underneath madonna and child by raphael in the possession of frederick fairlie esquire copper coin of the period of tiglath pileser in the possession of frederick fairlie esquire unique rembrandt etching known all over europe as the smudge from a printers blot in the corner which exists in no other copy valued at three hundred guineas in the possession of frederick fairlie esq dozens of photographs of this sort and all inscribed in this manner were completed before i left cumberland and hundreds more remain to be done with this new interest to occupy him mr fairlie will be a happy man for months and months to come and the two unfortunate photographers will share the social martyrdom which he has hitherto inflicted on his valet alone so much for the persons and events which hold the foremost place in my memory what next of the one person who holds the foremost place in my heart laura has been present to my thoughts all the while i have been writing these lines what can i recall of her during the past six months before i close my journal for the night i have only her letters to guide me and on the most important of all the questions which our correspondence can discuss every one of those letters leaves me in the dark does he treat her kindly is she happier now than she was when i parted with her on the weddingday all my letters have contained these two inquiries put more or less directly now in one form and now in another and all on that point only have remained without reply or have been answered as if my questions merely related to the state of her health she informs me over and over again that she is perfectly well that travelling agrees with her that she is getting through the winter for the first time in her life without catching cold but not a word can i find anywhere which tells me plainly that she is reconciled to her marriage and that she can now look back to the twentysecond of december without any bitter feelings of repentance and regret the name of her husband is only mentioned in her letters as she might mention the name of a friend who was travelling with them and who had undertaken to make all the arrangements for the journey sir percival has settled that we leave on such a day sir percival has decided that we travel by such a road sometimes she writes percival only but very seldom in nine cases out of ten she gives him his title i cannot find that his habits and opinions have changed and coloured hers in any single particular the usual moral transformation which is insensibly wrought in a young fresh sensitive woman by her marriage seems never to have taken place in laura she writes of her own thoughts and impressions amid all the wonders she has seen exactly as she might have written to some one else if i had been travelling with her instead of her husband i see no betrayal anywhere of sympathy of any kind existing between them even when she wanders from the subject of her travels and occupies herself with the prospects that await her in england her speculations are busied with her future as my sister and persistently neglect to notice her future as sir percivals wife in all this there is no undertone of complaint to warn me that she is absolutely unhappy in her married life the impression i have derived from our correspondence does not thank god lead me to any such distressing conclusion as that i only see a sad torpor an unchangeable indifference when i turn my mind from her in the old character of a sister and look at her through the medium of her letters in the new character of a wife in other words it is always laura fairlie who has been writing to me for the last six months and never lady glyde the strange silence which she maintains on the subject of her husbands character and conduct she preserves with almost equal resolution in the few references which her later letters contain to the name of her husbands bosom friend count fosco for some unexplained reason the count and his wife appear to have changed their plans abruptly at the end of last autumn and to have gone to vienna instead of going to rome at which latter place sir percival had expected to find them when he left england they only quitted vienna in the spring and travelled as far as the tyrol to meet the bride and bridegroom on their homeward journey laura writes readily enough about the meeting with madame fosco and assures me that she has found her aunt so much changed for the better so much quieter and so much more sensible as a wife than she was as a single woman that i shall hardly know her again when i see her here but on the subject of count fosco who interests me infinitely more than his wife laura is provokingly circumspect and silent she only says that he puzzles her and that she will not tell me what her impression of him is until i have seen him and formed my own opinion first this to my mind looks ill for the count laura has preserved far more perfectly than most people do in later life the childs subtle faculty of knowing a friend by instinct and if i am right in assuming that her first impression of count fosco has not been favourable i for one am in some danger of doubting and distrusting that illustrious foreigner before i have so much as set eyes on him but patience patience this uncertainty and many uncertainties more cannot last much longer tomorrow will see all my doubts in a fair way of being cleared up sooner or later twelve oclock has struck and i have just come back to close these pages after looking out at my open window it is a still sultry moonless night the stars are dull and few the trees that shut out the view on all sides look dimly black and solid in the distance like a great wall of rock i hear the croaking of frogs faint and far off and the echoes of the great clock hum in the airless calm long after the strokes have ceased i wonder how blackwater park will look in the daytime i dont altogether like it by night th a day of investigations and discoveries a more interesting day for many reasons than i had ventured to anticipate i began my sightseeing of course with the house the main body of the building is of the time of that highly overrated woman queen elizabeth on the ground floor there are two hugely long galleries with low ceilings lying parallel with each other and rendered additionally dark and dismal by hideous family portraits every one of which i should like to burn the rooms on the floor above the two galleries are kept in tolerable repair but are very seldom used the civil housekeeper who acted as my guide offered to show me over them but considerately added that she feared i should find them rather out of order my respect for the integrity of my own petticoats and stockings infinitely exceeds my respect for all the elizabethan bedrooms in the kingdom so i positively declined exploring the upper regions of dust and dirt at the risk of soiling my nice clean clothes the housekeeper said i am quite of your opinion miss and appeared to think me the most sensible woman she had met with for a long time past so much then for the main building two wings are added at either end of it the halfruined wing on the left as you approach the house was once a place of residence standing by itself and was built in the fourteenth century one of sir percivals maternal ancestors i dont remember and dont care which tacked on the main building at right angles to it in the aforesaid queen elizabeths time the housekeeper told me that the architecture of the old wing both outside and inside was considered remarkably fine by good judges on further investigation i discovered that good judges could only exercise their abilities on sir percivals piece of antiquity by previously dismissing from their minds all fear of damp darkness and rats under these circumstances i unhesitatingly acknowledged myself to be no judge at all and suggested that we should treat the old wing precisely as we had previously treated the elizabethan bedrooms once more the housekeeper said i am quite of your opinion miss and once more she looked at me with undisguised admiration of my extraordinary commonsense we went next to the wing on the right which was built by way of completing the wonderful architectural jumble at blackwater park in the time of george the second this is the habitable part of the house which has been repaired and redecorated inside on lauras account my two rooms and all the good bedrooms besides are on the first floor and the basement contains a drawingroom a diningroom a morningroom a library and a pretty little boudoir for laura all very nicely ornamented in the bright modern way and all very elegantly furnished with the delightful modern luxuries none of the rooms are anything like so large and airy as our rooms at limmeridge but they all look pleasant to live in i was terribly afraid from what i had heard of blackwater park of fatiguing antique chairs and dismal stained glass and musty frouzy hangings and all the barbarous lumber which people born without a sense of comfort accumulate about them in defiance of the consideration due to the convenience of their friends it is an inexpressible relief to find that the nineteenth century has invaded this strange future home of mine and has swept the dirty good old times out of the way of our daily life i dawdled away the morning part of the time in the rooms downstairs and part out of doors in the great square which is formed by the three sides of the house and by the lofty iron railings and gates which protect it in front a large circular fishpond with stone sides and an allegorical leaden monster in the middle occupies the centre of the square the pond itself is full of gold and silver fish and is encircled by a broad belt of the softest turf i ever walked on i loitered here on the shady side pleasantly enough till luncheontime and after that took my broad straw hat and wandered out alone in the warm lovely sunlight to explore the grounds daylight confirmed the impression which i had felt the night before of there being too many trees at blackwater the house is stifled by them they are for the most part young and planted far too thickly i suspect there must have been a ruinous cutting down of timber all over the estate before sir percivals time and an angry anxiety on the part of the next possessor to fill up all the gaps as thickly and rapidly as possible after looking about me in front of the house i observed a flowergarden on my left hand and walked towards it to see what i could discover in that direction on a nearer view the garden proved to be small and poor and ill kept i left it behind me opened a little gate in a ring fence and found myself in a plantation of firtrees a pretty winding path artificially made led me on among the trees and my northcountry experience soon informed me that i was approaching sandy heathy ground after a walk of more than half a mile i should think among the firs the path took a sharp turn the trees abruptly ceased to appear on either side of me and i found myself standing suddenly on the margin of a vast open space and looking down at the blackwater lake from which the house takes its name the ground shelving away below me was all sand with a few little heathy hillocks to break the monotony of it in certain places the lake itself had evidently once flowed to the spot on which i stood and had been gradually wasted and dried up to less than a third of its former size i saw its still stagnant waters a quarter of a mile away from me in the hollow separated into pools and ponds by twining reeds and rushes and little knolls of earth on the farther bank from me the trees rose thickly again and shut out the view and cast their black shadows on the sluggish shallow water as i walked down to the lake i saw that the ground on its farther side was damp and marshy overgrown with rank grass and dismal willows the water which was clear enough on the open sandy side where the sun shone looked black and poisonous opposite to me where it lay deeper under the shade of the spongy banks and the rank overhanging thickets and tangled trees the frogs were croaking and the rats were slipping in and out of the shadowy water like live shadows themselves as i got nearer to the marshy side of the lake i saw here lying half in and half out of the water the rotten wreck of an old overturned boat with a sickly spot of sunlight glimmering through a gap in the trees on its dry surface and a snake basking in the midst of the spot fantastically coiled and treacherously still far and near the view suggested the same dreary impressions of solitude and decay and the glorious brightness of the summer sky overhead seemed only to deepen and harden the gloom and barrenness of the wilderness on which it shone i turned and retraced my steps to the high heathy ground directing them a little aside from my former path towards a shabby old wooden shed which stood on the outer skirt of the fir plantation and which had hitherto been too unimportant to share my notice with the wide wild prospect of the lake on approaching the shed i found that it had once been a boat house and that an attempt had apparently been made to convert it afterwards into a sort of rude arbour by placing inside it a firwood seat a few stools and a table i entered the place and sat down for a little while to rest and get my breath again i had not been in the boathouse more than a minute when it struck me that the sound of my own quick breathing was very strangely echoed by something beneath me i listened intently for a moment and heard a low thick sobbing breath that seemed to come from the ground under the seat which i was occupying my nerves are not easily shaken by trifles but on this occasion i started to my feet in a fright called out received no answer summoned back my recreant courage and looked under the seat there crouched up in the farthest corner lay the forlorn cause of my terror in the shape of a poor little dog a black and white spaniel the creature moaned feebly when i looked at it and called to it but never stirred i moved away the seat and looked closer the poor little dogs eyes were glazing fast and there were spots of blood on its glossy white side the misery of a weak helpless dumb creature is surely one of the saddest of all the mournful sights which this world can show i lifted the poor dog in my arms as gently as i could and contrived a sort of make shift hammock for him to lie in by gathering up the front of my dress all round him in this way i took the creature as painlessly as possible and as fast as possible back to the house finding no one in the hall i went up at once to my own sitting room made a bed for the dog with one of my old shawls and rang the bell the largest and fattest of all possible housemaids answered it in a state of cheerful stupidity which would have provoked the patience of a saint the girls fat shapeless face actually stretched into a broad grin at the sight of the wounded creature on the floor what do you see there to laugh at i asked as angrily as if she had been a servant of my own do you know whose dog it is no miss that i certainly dont she stooped and looked down at the spaniels injured side brightened suddenly with the irradiation of a new idea and pointing to the wound with a chuckle of satisfaction said thats baxters doings that is i was so exasperated that i could have boxed her ears baxter i said who is the brute you call baxter the girl grinned again more cheerfully than ever bless you miss baxters the keeper and when he finds strange dogs hunting about he takes and shoots em its keepers dooty miss i think that dog will die heres where hes been shot aint it thats baxters doings that is baxters doings miss and baxters dooty i was almost wicked enough to wish that baxter had shot the housemaid instead of the dog seeing that it was quite useless to expect this densely impenetrable personage to give me any help in relieving the suffering creature at our feet i told her to request the housekeepers attendance with my compliments she went out exactly as she had come in grinning from ear to ear as the door closed on her she said to herself softly its baxters doings and baxters dooty thats what it is the housekeeper a person of some education and intelligence thoughtfully brought upstairs with her some milk and some warm water the instant she saw the dog on the floor she started and changed colour why lord bless me cried the housekeeper that must be mrs cathericks dog whose i asked in the utmost astonishment mrs cathericks you seem to know mrs catherick miss halcombe not personally but i have heard of her does she live here has she had any news of her daughter no miss halcombe she came here to ask for news when only yesterday she said some one had reported that a stranger answering to the description of her daughter had been seen in our neighbourhood no such report has reached us here and no such report was known in the village when i sent to make inquiries there on mrs cathericks account she certainly brought this poor little dog with her when she came and i saw it trot out after her when she went away i suppose the creature strayed into the plantations and got shot where did you find it miss halcombe in the old shed that looks out on the lake ah yes that is the plantation side and the poor thing dragged itself i suppose to the nearest shelter as dogs will to die if you can moisten its lips with the milk miss halcombe i will wash the clotted hair from the wound i am very much afraid it is too late to do any good however we can but try mrs catherick the name still rang in my ears as if the housekeeper had only that moment surprised me by uttering it while we were attending to the dog the words of walter hartrights caution to me returned to my memory if ever anne catherick crosses your path make better use of the opportunity miss halcombe than i made of it the finding of the wounded spaniel had led me already to the discovery of mrs cathericks visit to blackwater park and that event might lead in its turn to something more i determined to make the most of the chance which was now offered to me and to gain as much information as i could did you say that mrs catherick lived anywhere in this neighbourhood i asked oh dear no said the housekeeper she lives at welmingham quite at the other end of the county fiveandtwenty miles off at least i suppose you have known mrs catherick for some years on the contrary miss halcombe i never saw her before she came here yesterday i had heard of her of course because i had heard of sir percivals kindness in putting her daughter under medical care mrs catherick is rather a strange person in her manners but extremely respectablelooking she seemed sorely put out when she found that there was no foundation none at least that any of us could discover for the report of her daughter having been seen in this neighbourhood i am rather interested about mrs catherick i went on continuing the conversation as long as possible i wish i had arrived here soon enough to see her yesterday did she stay for any length of time yes said the housekeeper she stayed for some time and i think she would have remained longer if i had not been called away to speak to a strange gentleman a gentleman who came to ask when sir percival was expected back mrs catherick got up and left at once when she heard the maid tell me what the visitors errand was she said to me at parting that there was no need to tell sir percival of her coming here i thought that rather an odd remark to make especially to a person in my responsible situation i thought it an odd remark too sir percival had certainly led me to believe at limmeridge that the most perfect confidence existed between himself and mrs catherick if that was the case why should she be anxious to have her visit at blackwater park kept a secret from him probably i said seeing that the housekeeper expected me to give my opinion on mrs cathericks parting words probably she thought the announcement of her visit might vex sir percival to no purpose by reminding him that her lost daughter was not found yet did she talk much on that subject very little replied the housekeeper she talked principally of sir percival and asked a great many questions about where he had been travelling and what sort of lady his new wife was she seemed to be more soured and put out than distressed by failing to find any traces of her daughter in these parts i give her up were the last words she said that i can remember i give her up maam for lost and from that she passed at once to her questions about lady glyde wanting to know if she was a handsome amiable lady comely and healthy and youngah dear i thought how it would end look miss halcombe the poor thing is out of its misery at last the dog was dead it had given a faint sobbing cry it had suffered an instants convulsion of the limbs just as those last words comely and healthy and young dropped from the housekeepers lips the change had happened with startling suddenness in one moment the creature lay lifeless under our hands eight oclock i have just returned from dining downstairs in solitary state the sunset is burning redly on the wilderness of trees that i see from my window and i am poring over my journal again to calm my impatience for the return of the travellers they ought to have arrived by my calculations before this how still and lonely the house is in the drowsy evening quiet oh me how many minutes more before i hear the carriage wheels and run downstairs to find myself in lauras arms the poor little dog i wish my first day at blackwater park had not been associated with death though it is only the death of a stray animal welmingham i see on looking back through these private pages of mine that welmingham is the name of the place where mrs catherick lives her note is still in my possession the note in answer to that letter about her unhappy daughter which sir percival obliged me to write one of these days when i can find a safe opportunity i will take the note with me by way of introduction and try what i can make of mrs catherick at a personal interview i dont understand her wishing to conceal her visit to this place from sir percivals knowledge and i dont feel half so sure as the housekeeper seems to do that her daughter anne is not in the neighbourhood after all what would walter hartright have said in this emergency poor dear hartright i am beginning to feel the want of his honest advice and his willing help already surely i heard something was it a bustle of footsteps below stairs yes i hear the horses feet i hear the rolling wheels ii june th the confusion of their arrival has had time to subside two days have elapsed since the return of the travellers and that interval has sufficed to put the new machinery of our lives at blackwater park in fair working order i may now return to my journal with some little chance of being able to continue the entries in it as collectedly as usual i think i must begin by putting down an odd remark which has suggested itself to me since laura came back when two members of a family or two intimate friends are separated and one goes abroad and one remains at home the return of the relative or friend who has been travelling always seems to place the relative or friend who has been staying at home at a painful disadvantage when the two first meet the sudden encounter of the new thoughts and new habits eagerly gained in the one case with the old thoughts and old habits passively preserved in the other seems at first to part the sympathies of the most loving relatives and the fondest friends and to set a sudden strangeness unexpected by both and uncontrollable by both between them on either side after the first happiness of my meeting with laura was over after we had sat down together hand in hand to recover breath enough and calmness enough to talk i felt this strangeness instantly and i could see that she felt it too it has partially worn away now that we have fallen back into most of our old habits and it will probably disappear before long but it has certainly had an influence over the first impressions that i have formed of her now that we are living together again for which reason only i have thought fit to mention it here she has found me unaltered but i have found her changed changed in person and in one respect changed in character i cannot absolutely say that she is less beautiful than she used to be i can only say that she is less beautiful to me others who do not look at her with my eyes and my recollections would probably think her improved there is more colour and more decision and roundness of outline in her face than there used to be and her figure seems more firmly set and more sure and easy in all its movements than it was in her maiden days but i miss something when i look at her something that once belonged to the happy innocent life of laura fairlie and that i cannot find in lady glyde there was in the old times a freshness a softness an evervarying and yet everremaining tenderness of beauty in her face the charm of which it is not possible to express in words or as poor hartright used often to say in painting either this is gone i thought i saw the faint reflection of it for a moment when she turned pale under the agitation of our sudden meeting on the evening of her return but it has never reappeared since none of her letters had prepared me for a personal change in her on the contrary they had led me to expect that her marriage had left her in appearance at least quite unaltered perhaps i read her letters wrongly in the past and am now reading her face wrongly in the present no matter whether her beauty has gained or whether it has lost in the last six months the separation either way has made her own dear self more precious to me than ever and that is one good result of her marriage at any rate the second change the change that i have observed in her character has not surprised me because i was prepared for it in this case by the tone of her letters now that she is at home again i find her just as unwilling to enter into any details on the subject of her married life as i had previously found her all through the time of our separation when we could only communicate with each other by writing at the first approach i made to the forbidden topic she put her hand on my lips with a look and gesture which touchingly almost painfully recalled to my memory the days of her girlhood and the happy bygone time when there were no secrets between us whenever you and i are together marian she said we shall both be happier and easier with one another if we accept my married life for what it is and say and think as little about it as possible i would tell you everything darling about myself she went on nervously buckling and unbuckling the ribbon round my waist if my confidences could only end there but they could not they would lead me into confidences about my husband too and now i am married i think i had better avoid them for his sake and for your sake and for mine i dont say that they would distress you or distress me i wouldnt have you think that for the world but i want to be so happy now i have got you back again and i want you to be so happy too she broke off abruptly and looked round the room my own sittingroom in which we were talking ah she cried clapping her hands with a bright smile of recognition another old friend found already your bookcase marian your dearlittleshabbyoldsatinwood bookcase how glad i am you brought it with you from limmeridge and the horrid heavy mans umbrella that you always would walk out with when it rained and first and foremost of all your own dear dark clever gipsyface looking at me just as usual it is so like home again to be here how can we make it more like home still i will put my fathers portrait in your room instead of in mine and i will keep all my little treasures from limmeridge here and we will pass hours and hours every day with these four friendly walls round us oh marian she said suddenly seating herself on a footstool at my knees and looking up earnestly in my face promise you will never marry and leave me it is selfish to say so but you are so much better off as a single woman unless unless you are very fond of your husband but you wont be very fond of anybody but me will you she stopped again crossed my hands on my lap and laid her face on them have you been writing many letters and receiving many letters lately she asked in low suddenlyaltered tones i understood what the question meant but i thought it my duty not to encourage her by meeting her half way have you heard from him she went on coaxing me to forgive the more direct appeal on which she now ventured by kissing my hands upon which her face still rested is he well and happy and getting on in his profession has he recovered himself and forgotten me she should not have asked those questions she should have remembered her own resolution on the morning when sir percival held her to her marriage engagement and when she resigned the book of hartrights drawings into my hands for ever but ah me where is the faultless human creature who can persevere in a good resolution without sometimes failing and falling back where is the woman who has ever really torn from her heart the image that has been once fixed in it by a true love books tell us that such unearthly creatures have existed but what does our own experience say in answer to books i made no attempt to remonstrate with her perhaps because i sincerely appreciated the fearless candour which let me see what other women in her position might have had reasons for concealing even from their dearest friends perhaps because i felt in my own heart and conscience that in her place i should have asked the same questions and had the same thoughts all i could honestly do was to reply that i had not written to him or heard from him lately and then to turn the conversation to less dangerous topics there has been much to sadden me in our interview my first confidential interview with her since her return the change which her marriage has produced in our relations towards each other by placing a forbidden subject between us for the first time in our lives the melancholy conviction of the dearth of all warmth of feeling of all close sympathy between her husband and herself which her own unwilling words now force on my mind the distressing discovery that the influence of that illfated attachment still remains no matter how innocently how harmlessly rooted as deeply as ever in her heart all these are disclosures to sadden any woman who loves her as dearly and feels for her as acutely as i do there is only one consolation to set against them a consolation that ought to comfort me and that does comfort me all the graces and gentleness of her character all the frank affection of her nature all the sweet simple womanly charms which used to make her the darling and delight of every one who approached her have come back to me with herself of my other impressions i am sometimes a little inclined to doubt of this last best happiest of all impressions i grow more and more certain every hour in the day let me turn now from her to her travelling companions her husband must engage my attention first what have i observed in sir percival since his return to improve my opinion of him i can hardly say small vexations and annoyances seem to have beset him since he came back and no man under those circumstances is ever presented at his best he looks as i think thinner than he was when he left england his wearisome cough and his comfortless restlessness have certainly increased his manner at least his manner towards me is much more abrupt than it used to be he greeted me on the evening of his return with little or nothing of the ceremony and civility of former times no polite speeches of welcome no appearance of extraordinary gratification at seeing me nothing but a short shake of the hand and a sharp howdyedo miss halcombe glad to see you again he seemed to accept me as one of the necessary fixtures of blackwater park to be satisfied at finding me established in my proper place and then to pass me over altogether most men show something of their disposition in their own houses which they have concealed elsewhere and sir percival has already displayed a mania for order and regularity which is quite a new revelation of him so far as my previous knowledge of his character is concerned if i take a book from the library and leave it on the table he follows me and puts it back again if i rise from a chair and let it remain where i have been sitting he carefully restores it to its proper place against the wall he picks up stray flowerblossoms from the carpet and mutters to himself as discontentedly as if they were hot cinders burning holes in it and he storms at the servants if there is a crease in the tablecloth or a knife missing from its place at the dinner table as fiercely as if they had personally insulted him i have already referred to the small annoyances which appear to have troubled him since his return much of the alteration for the worse which i have noticed in him may be due to these i try to persuade myself that it is so because i am anxious not to be disheartened already about the future it is certainly trying to any mans temper to be met by a vexation the moment he sets foot in his own house again after a long absence and this annoying circumstance did really happen to sir percival in my presence on the evening of their arrival the housekeeper followed me into the hall to receive her master and mistress and their guests the instant he saw her sir percival asked if any one had called lately the housekeeper mentioned to him in reply what she had previously mentioned to me the visit of the strange gentleman to make inquiries about the time of her masters return he asked immediately for the gentlemans name no name had been left the gentlemans business no business had been mentioned what was the gentleman like the housekeeper tried to describe him but failed to distinguish the nameless visitor by any personal peculiarity which her master could recognise sir percival frowned stamped angrily on the floor and walked on into the house taking no notice of anybody why he should have been so discomposed by a trifle i cannot say but he was seriously discomposed beyond all doubt upon the whole it will be best perhaps if i abstain from forming a decisive opinion of his manners language and conduct in his own house until time has enabled him to shake off the anxieties whatever they may be which now evidently troubled his mind in secret i will turn over to a new page and my pen shall let lauras husband alone for the present the two guests the count and countess fosco come next in my catalogue i will dispose of the countess first so as to have done with the woman as soon as possible laura was certainly not chargeable with any exaggeration in writing me word that i should hardly recognise her aunt again when we met never before have i beheld such a change produced in a woman by her marriage as has been produced in madame fosco as eleanor fairlie aged sevenandthirty she was always talking pretentious nonsense and always worrying the unfortunate men with every small exaction which a vain and foolish woman can impose on longsuffering male humanity as madame fosco aged threeand forty she sits for hours together without saying a word frozen up in the strangest manner in herself the hideously ridiculous lovelocks which used to hang on either side of her face are now replaced by stiff little rows of very short curls of the sort one sees in oldfashioned wigs a plain matronly cap covers her head and makes her look for the first time in her life since i remember her like a decent woman nobody putting her husband out of the question of course now sees in her what everybody once saw i mean the structure of the female skeleton in the upper regions of the collarbones and the shoulderblades clad in quiet black or grey gowns made high round the throat dresses that she would have laughed at or screamed at as the whim of the moment inclined her in her maiden days she sits speechless in corners her dry white hands so dry that the pores of her skin look chalky incessantly engaged either in monotonous embroidery work or in rolling up endless cigarettes for the counts own particular smoking on the few occasions when her cold blue eyes are off her work they are generally turned on her husband with the look of mute submissive inquiry which we are all familiar with in the eyes of a faithful dog the only approach to an inward thaw which i have yet detected under her outer covering of icy constraint has betrayed itself once or twice in the form of a suppressed tigerish jealousy of any woman in the house the maids included to whom the count speaks or on whom he looks with anything approaching to special interest or attention except in this one particular she is always morning noon and night indoors and out fair weather or foul as cold as a statue and as impenetrable as the stone out of which it is cut for the common purposes of society the extraordinary change thus produced in her is beyond all doubt a change for the better seeing that it has transformed her into a civil silent unobtrusive woman who is never in the way how far she is really reformed or deteriorated in her secret self is another question i have once or twice seen sudden changes of expression on her pinched lips and heard sudden inflexions of tone in her calm voice which have led me to suspect that her present state of suppression may have sealed up something dangerous in her nature which used to evaporate harmlessly in the freedom of her former life it is quite possible that i may be altogether wrong in this idea my own impression however is that i am right time will show and the magician who has wrought this wonderful transformation the foreign husband who has tamed this once wayward english woman till her own relations hardly know her again the count himself what of the count this in two words he looks like a man who could tame anything if he had married a tigress instead of a woman he would have tamed the tigress if he had married me i should have made his cigarettes as his wife does i should have held my tongue when he looked at me as she holds hers i am almost afraid to confess it even to these secret pages the man has interested me has attracted me has forced me to like him in two short days he has made his way straight into my favourable estimation and how he has worked the miracle is more than i can tell it absolutely startles me now he is in my mind to find how plainly i see him how much more plainly than i see sir percival or mr fairlie or walter hartright or any other absent person of whom i think with the one exception of laura herself i can hear his voice as if he was speaking at this moment i know what his conversation was yesterday as well as if i was hearing it now how am i to describe him there are peculiarities in his personal appearance his habits and his amusements which i should blame in the boldest terms or ridicule in the most merciless manner if i had seen them in another man what is it that makes me unable to blame them or to ridicule them in him for example he is immensely fat before this time i have always especially disliked corpulent humanity i have always maintained that the popular notion of connecting excessive grossness of size and excessive goodhumour as inseparable allies was equivalent to declaring either that no people but amiable people ever get fat or that the accidental addition of so many pounds of flesh has a directly favourable influence over the disposition of the person on whose body they accumulate i have invariably combated both these absurd assertions by quoting examples of fat people who were as mean vicious and cruel as the leanest and the worst of their neighbours i have asked whether henry the eighth was an amiable character whether pope alexander the sixth was a good man whether mr murderer and mrs murderess manning were not both unusually stout people whether hired nurses proverbially as cruel a set of women as are to be found in all england were not for the most part also as fat a set of women as are to be found in all england and so on through dozens of other examples modern and ancient native and foreign high and low holding these strong opinions on the subject with might and main as i do at this moment here nevertheless is count fosco as fat as henry the eighth himself established in my favour at one days notice without let or hindrance from his own odious corpulence marvellous indeed is it his face that has recommended him it may be his face he is a most remarkable likeness on a large scale of the great napoleon his features have napoleons magnificent regularity his expression recalls the grandly calm immovable power of the great soldiers face this striking resemblance certainly impressed me to begin with but there is something in him besides the resemblance which has impressed me more i think the influence i am now trying to find is in his eyes they are the most unfathomable grey eyes i ever saw and they have at times a cold clear beautiful irresistible glitter in them which forces me to look at him and yet causes me sensations when i do look which i would rather not feel other parts of his face and head have their strange peculiarities his complexion for instance has a singular sallowfairness so much at variance with the darkbrown colour of his hair that i suspect the hair of being a wig and his face closely shaven all over is smoother and freer from all marks and wrinkles than mine though according to sir percivals account of him he is close on sixty years of age but these are not the prominent personal characteristics which distinguish him to my mind from all the other men i have ever seen the marked peculiarity which singles him out from the rank and file of humanity lies entirely so far as i can tell at present in the extraordinary expression and extraordinary power of his eyes his manner and his command of our language may also have assisted him in some degree to establish himself in my good opinion he has that quiet deference that look of pleased attentive interest in listening to a woman and that secret gentleness in his voice in speaking to a woman which say what we may we can none of us resist here too his unusual command of the english language necessarily helps him i had often heard of the extraordinary aptitude which many italians show in mastering our strong hard northern speech but until i saw count fosco i had never supposed it possible that any foreigner could have spoken english as he speaks it there are times when it is almost impossible to detect by his accent that he is not a countryman of our own and as for fluency there are very few born englishmen who can talk with as few stoppages and repetitions as the count he may construct his sentences more or less in the foreign way but i have never yet heard him use a wrong expression or hesitate for a moment in his choice of a word all the smallest characteristics of this strange man have something strikingly original and perplexingly contradictory in them fat as he is and old as he is his movements are astonishingly light and easy he is as noiseless in a room as any of us women and more than that with all his look of unmistakable mental firmness and power he is as nervously sensitive as the weakest of us he starts at chance noises as inveterately as laura herself he winced and shuddered yesterday when sir percival beat one of the spaniels so that i felt ashamed of my own want of tenderness and sensibility by comparison with the count the relation of this last incident reminds me of one of his most curious peculiarities which i have not yet mentioned his extraordinary fondness for pet animals some of these he has left on the continent but he has brought with him to this house a cockatoo two canarybirds and a whole family of white mice he attends to all the necessities of these strange favourites himself and he has taught the creatures to be surprisingly fond of him and familiar with him the cockatoo a most vicious and treacherous bird towards every one else absolutely seems to love him when he lets it out of its cage it hops on to his knee and claws its way up his great big body and rubs its topknot against his sallow double chin in the most caressing manner imaginable he has only to set the doors of the canaries cages open and to call them and the pretty little cleverly trained creatures perch fearlessly on his hand mount his fat outstretched fingers one by one when he tells them to go upstairs and sing together as if they would burst their throats with delight when they get to the top finger his white mice live in a little pagoda of gailypainted wirework designed and made by himself they are almost as tame as the canaries and they are perpetually let out like the canaries they crawl all over him popping in and out of his waistcoat and sitting in couples white as snow on his capacious shoulders he seems to be even fonder of his mice than of his other pets smiles at them and kisses them and calls them by all sorts of endearing names if it be possible to suppose an englishman with any taste for such childish interests and amusements as these that englishman would certainly feel rather ashamed of them and would be anxious to apologise for them in the company of grownup people but the count apparently sees nothing ridiculous in the amazing contrast between his colossal self and his frail little pets he would blandly kiss his white mice and twitter to his canarybirds amid an assembly of english foxhunters and would only pity them as barbarians when they were all laughing their loudest at him it seems hardly credible while i am writing it down but it is certainly true that this same man who has all the fondness of an old maid for his cockatoo and all the small dexterities of an organboy in managing his white mice can talk when anything happens to rouse him with a daring independence of thought a knowledge of books in every language and an experience of society in half the capitals of europe which would make him the prominent personage of any assembly in the civilised world this trainer of canarybirds this architect of a pagoda for white mice is as sir percival himself has told me one of the first experimental chemists living and has discovered among other wonderful inventions a means of petrifying the body after death so as to preserve it as hard as marble to the end of time this fat indolent elderly man whose nerves are so finely strung that he starts at chance noises and winces when he sees a housespaniel get a whipping went into the stableyard on the morning after his arrival and put his hand on the head of a chained bloodhound a beast so savage that the very groom who feeds him keeps out of his reach his wife and i were present and i shall not forget the scene that followed short as it was mind that dog sir said the groom he flies at everybody he does that my friend replied the count quietly because everybody is afraid of him let us see if he flies at me and he laid his plump yellowwhite fingers on which the canarybirds had been perching ten minutes before upon the formidable brutes head and looked him straight in the eyes you big dogs are all cowards he said addressing the animal contemptuously with his face and the dogs within an inch of each other you would kill a poor cat you infernal coward you would fly at a starving beggar you infernal coward anything that you can surprise unawares anything that is afraid of your big body and your wicked white teeth and your slobbering bloodthirsty mouth is the thing you like to fly at you could throttle me at this moment you mean miserable bully and you darent so much as look me in the face because im not afraid of you will you think better of it and try your teeth in my fat neck bah not you he turned away laughing at the astonishment of the men in the yard and the dog crept back meekly to his kennel ah my nice waistcoat he said pathetically i am sorry i came here some of that brutes slobber has got on my pretty clean waistcoat those words express another of his incomprehensible oddities he is as fond of fine clothes as the veriest fool in existence and has appeared in four magnificent waistcoats already all of light garish colours and all immensely large even for him in the two days of his residence at blackwater park his tact and cleverness in small things are quite as noticeable as the singular inconsistencies in his character and the childish triviality of his ordinary tastes and pursuits i can see already that he means to live on excellent terms with all of us during the period of his sojourn in this place he has evidently discovered that laura secretly dislikes him she confessed as much to me when i pressed her on the subject but he has also found out that she is extravagantly fond of flowers whenever she wants a nosegay he has got one to give her gathered and arranged by himself and greatly to my amusement he is always cunningly provided with a duplicate composed of exactly the same flowers grouped in exactly the same way to appease his icily jealous wife before she can so much as think herself aggrieved his management of the countess in public is a sight to see he bows to her he habitually addresses her as my angel he carries his canaries to pay her little visits on his fingers and to sing to her he kisses her hand when she gives him his cigarettes he presents her with sugarplums in return which he puts into her mouth playfully from a box in his pocket the rod of iron with which he rules her never appears in company it is a private rod and is always kept upstairs his method of recommending himself to me is entirely different he flatters my vanity by talking to me as seriously and sensibly as if i was a man yes i can find him out when i am away from him i know he flatters my vanity when i think of him up here in my own room and yet when i go downstairs and get into his company again he will blind me again and i shall be flattered again just as if i had never found him out at all he can manage me as he manages his wife and laura as he managed the bloodhound in the stableyard as he manages sir percival himself every hour in the day my good percival how i like your rough english humour my good percival how i enjoy your solid english sense he puts the rudest remarks sir percival can make on his effeminate tastes and amusements quietly away from him in that manner always calling the baronet by his christian name smiling at him with the calmest superiority patting him on the shoulder and bearing with him benignantly as a goodhumoured father bears with a wayward son the interest which i really cannot help feeling in this strangely original man has led me to question sir percival about his past life sir percival either knows little or will tell me little about it he and the count first met many years ago at rome under the dangerous circumstances to which i have alluded elsewhere since that time they have been perpetually together in london in paris and in vienna but never in italy again the count having oddly enough not crossed the frontiers of his native country for years past perhaps he has been made the victim of some political persecution at all events he seems to be patriotically anxious not to lose sight of any of his own countrymen who may happen to be in england on the evening of his arrival he asked how far we were from the nearest town and whether we knew of any italian gentlemen who might happen to be settled there he is certainly in correspondence with people on the continent for his letters have all sorts of odd stamps on them and i saw one for him this morning waiting in his place at the breakfasttable with a huge officiallooking seal on it perhaps he is in correspondence with his government and yet that is hardly to be reconciled either with my other idea that he may be a political exile how much i seem to have written about count fosco and what does it all amount to as poor dear mr gilmore would ask in his impenetrable businesslike way i can only repeat that i do assuredly feel even on this short acquaintance a strange half willing halfunwilling liking for the count he seems to have established over me the same sort of ascendency which he has evidently gained over sir percival free and even rude as he may occasionally be in his manner towards his fat friend sir percival is nevertheless afraid as i can plainly see of giving any serious offence to the count i wonder whether i am afraid too i certainly never saw a man in all my experience whom i should be so sorry to have for an enemy is this because i like him or because i am afraid of him chi sa as count fosco might say in his own language who knows june th something to chronicle today besides my own ideas and impressions a visitor has arrived quite unknown to laura and to me and apparently quite unexpected by sir percival we were all at lunch in the room with the new french windows that open into the verandah and the count who devours pastry as i have never yet seen it devoured by any human beings but girls at boardingschools had just amused us by asking gravely for his fourth tart when the servant entered to announce the visitor mr merriman has just come sir percival and wishes to see you immediately sir percival started and looked at the man with an expression of angry alarm mr merriman he repeated as if he thought his own ears must have deceived him yes sir percival mr merriman from london where is he in the library sir percival he left the table the instant the last answer was given and hurried out of the room without saying a word to any of us who is mr merriman asked laura appealing to me i have not the least idea was all i could say in reply the count had finished his fourth tart and had gone to a side table to look after his vicious cockatoo he turned round to us with the bird perched on his shoulder mr merriman is sir percivals solicitor he said quietly sir percivals solicitor it was a perfectly straightforward answer to lauras question and yet under the circumstances it was not satisfactory if mr merriman had been specially sent for by his client there would have been nothing very wonderful in his leaving town to obey the summons but when a lawyer travels from london to hampshire without being sent for and when his arrival at a gentlemans house seriously startles the gentleman himself it may be safely taken for granted that the legal visitor is the bearer of some very important and very unexpected news news which may be either very good or very bad but which cannot in either case be of the common everyday kind laura and i sat silent at the table for a quarter of an hour or more wondering uneasily what had happened and waiting for the chance of sir percivals speedy return there were no signs of his return and we rose to leave the room the count attentive as usual advanced from the corner in which he had been feeding his cockatoo with the bird still perched on his shoulder and opened the door for us laura and madame fosco went out first just as i was on the point of following them he made a sign with his hand and spoke to me before i passed him in the oddest manner yes he said quietly answering the unexpressed idea at that moment in my mind as if i had plainly confided it to him in so many words yes miss halcombe something has happened i was on the point of answering i never said so but the vicious cockatoo ruffled his clipped wings and gave a screech that set all my nerves on edge in an instant and made me only too glad to get out of the room i joined laura at the foot of the stairs the thought in her mind was the same as the thought in mine which count fosco had surprised and when she spoke her words were almost the echo of his she too said to me secretly that she was afraid something had happened iii june th i have a few lines more to add to this days entry before i go to bed tonight about two hours after sir percival rose from the luncheontable to receive his solicitor mr merriman in the library i left my room alone to take a walk in the plantations just as i was at the end of the landing the library door opened and the two gentlemen came out thinking it best not to disturb them by appearing on the stairs i resolved to defer going down till they had crossed the hall although they spoke to each other in guarded tones their words were pronounced with sufficient distinctness of utterance to reach my ears make your mind easy sir percival i heard the lawyer say it all rests with lady glyde i had turned to go back to my own room for a minute or two but the sound of lauras name on the lips of a stranger stopped me instantly i daresay it was very wrong and very discreditable to listen but where is the woman in the whole range of our sex who can regulate her actions by the abstract principles of honour when those principles point one way and when her affections and the interests which grow out of them point the other i listened and under similar circumstances i would listen again yes with my ear at the keyhole if i could not possibly manage it in any other way you quite understand sir percival the lawyer went on lady glyde is to sign her name in the presence of a witness or of two witnesses if you wish to be particularly careful and is then to put her finger on the seal and say i deliver this as my act and deed if that is done in a weeks time the arrangement will be perfectly successful and the anxiety will be all over if not what do you mean by if not asked sir percival angrily if the thing must be done it shall be done i promise you that merriman just so sir percival just so but there are two alternatives in all transactions and we lawyers like to look both of them in the face boldly if through any extraordinary circumstance the arrangement should not be made i think i may be able to get the parties to accept bills at three months but how the money is to be raised when the bills fall due damn the bills the money is only to be got in one way and in that way i tell you again it shall be got take a glass of wine merriman before you go much obliged sir percival i have not a moment to lose if i am to catch the uptrain you will let me know as soon as the arrangement is complete and you will not forget the caution i recommended of course i wont theres the dogcart at the door for you my groom will get you to the station in no time benjamin drive like mad jump in if mr merriman misses the train you lose your place hold fast merriman and if you are upset trust to the devil to save his own with that parting benediction the baronet turned about and walked back to the library i had not heard much but the little that had reached my ears was enough to make me feel uneasy the something that had happened was but too plainly a serious money embarrassment and sir percivals relief from it depended upon laura the prospect of seeing her involved in her husbands secret difficulties filled me with dismay exaggerated no doubt by my ignorance of business and my settled distrust of sir percival instead of going out as i proposed i went back immediately to lauras room to tell her what i had heard she received my bad news so composedly as to surprise me she evidently knows more of her husbands character and her husbands embarrassments than i have suspected up to this time i feared as much she said when i heard of that strange gentleman who called and declined to leave his name who do you think the gentleman was then i asked some person who has heavy claims on sir percival she answered and who has been the cause of mr merrimans visit here today do you know anything about those claims no i know no particulars you will sign nothing laura without first looking at it certainly not marian whatever i can harmlessly and honestly do to help him i will do for the sake of making your life and mine love as easy and as happy as possible but i will do nothing ignorantly which we might one day have reason to feel ashamed of let us say no more about it now you have got your hat on suppose we go and dream away the afternoon in the grounds on leaving the house we directed our steps to the nearest shade as we passed an open space among the trees in front of the house there was count fosco slowly walking backwards and forwards on the grass sunning himself in the full blaze of the hot june afternoon he had a broad straw hat on with a violetcoloured ribbon round it a blue blouse with profuse white fancywork over the bosom covered his prodigious body and was girt about the place where his waist might once have been with a broad scarlet leather belt nankeen trousers displaying more white fancywork over the ankles and purple morocco slippers adorned his lower extremities he was singing figaros famous song in the barber of seville with that crisply fluent vocalisation which is never heard from any other than an italian throat accompanying himself on the concertina which he played with ecstatic throwingsup of his arms and graceful twistings and turnings of his head like a fat st cecilia masquerading in male attire figaro qua figaro la figaro su figaro giu sang the count jauntily tossing up the concertina at arms length and bowing to us on one side of the instrument with the airy grace and elegance of figaro himself at twenty years of age take my word for it laura that man knows something of sir percivals embarrassments i said as we returned the counts salutation from a safe distance what makes you think that she asked how should he have known otherwise that mr merriman was sir percivals solicitor i rejoined besides when i followed you out of the luncheonroom he told me without a single word of inquiry on my part that something had happened depend upon it he knows more than we do dont ask him any questions if he does dont take him into our confidence you seem to dislike him laura in a very determined manner what has he said or done to justify you nothing marian on the contrary he was all kindness and attention on our journey home and he several times checked sir percivals outbreaks of temper in the most considerate manner towards me perhaps i dislike him because he has so much more power over my husband than i have perhaps it hurts my pride to be under any obligations to his interference all i know is that i do dislike him the rest of the day and evening passed quietly enough the count and i played at chess for the first two games he politely allowed me to conquer him and then when he saw that i had found him out begged my pardon and at the third game checkmated me in ten minutes sir percival never once referred all through the evening to the lawyers visit but either that event or something else had produced a singular alteration for the better in him he was as polite and agreeable to all of us as he used to be in the days of his probation at limmeridge and he was so amazingly attentive and kind to his wife that even icy madame fosco was roused into looking at him with a grave surprise what does this mean i think i can guess i am afraid laura can guess and i am sure count fosco knows i caught sir percival looking at him for approval more than once in the course of the evening june th a day of events i most fervently hope i may not have to add a day of disasters as well sir percival was as silent at breakfast as he had been the evening before on the subject of the mysterious arrangement as the lawyer called it which is hanging over our heads an hour afterwards however he suddenly entered the morningroom where his wife and i were waiting with our hats on for madame fosco to join us and inquired for the count we expect to see him here directly i said the fact is sir percival went on walking nervously about the room i want fosco and his wife in the library for a mere business formality and i want you there laura for a minute too he stopped and appeared to notice for the first time that we were in our walking costume have you just come in he asked or were you just going out we were all thinking of going to the lake this morning said laura but if you have any other arrangement to propose no no he answered hastily my arrangement can wait after lunch will do as well for it as after breakfast all going to the lake eh a good idea lets have an idle morning ill be one of the party there was no mistaking his manner even if it had been possible to mistake the uncharacteristic readiness which his words expressed to submit his own plans and projects to the convenience of others he was evidently relieved at finding any excuse for delaying the business formality in the library to which his own words had referred my heart sank within me as i drew the inevitable inference the count and his wife joined us at that moment the lady had her husbands embroidered tobaccopouch and her store of paper in her hand for the manufacture of the eternal cigarettes the gentleman dressed as usual in his blouse and straw hat carried the gay little pagodacage with his darling white mice in it and smiled on them and on us with a bland amiability which it was impossible to resist with your kind permission said the count i will take my small family here my poorlittleharmlessprettymouseys out for an airing along with us there are dogs about the house and shall i leave my forlorn white children at the mercies of the dogs ah never he chirruped paternally at his small white children through the bars of the pagoda and we all left the house for the lake in the plantation sir percival strayed away from us it seems to be part of his restless disposition always to separate himself from his companions on these occasions and always to occupy himself when he is alone in cutting new walkingsticks for his own use the mere act of cutting and lopping at hazard appears to please him he has filled the house with walkingsticks of his own making not one of which he ever takes up for a second time when they have been once used his interest in them is all exhausted and he thinks of nothing but going on and making more at the old boathouse he joined us again i will put down the conversation that ensued when we were all settled in our places exactly as it passed it is an important conversation so far as i am concerned for it has seriously disposed me to distrust the influence which count fosco has exercised over my thoughts and feelings and to resist it for the future as resolutely as i can the boathouse was large enough to hold us all but sir percival remained outside trimming the last new stick with his pocketaxe we three women found plenty of room on the large seat laura took her work and madame fosco began her cigarettes i as usual had nothing to do my hands always were and always will be as awkward as a mans the count goodhumouredly took a stool many sizes too small for him and balanced himself on it with his back against the side of the shed which creaked and groaned under his weight he put the pagodacage on his lap and let out the mice to crawl over him as usual they are pretty innocentlooking little creatures but the sight of them creeping about a mans body is for some reason not pleasant to me it excites a strange responsive creeping in my own nerves and suggests hideous ideas of men dying in prison with the crawling creatures of the dungeon preying on them undisturbed the morning was windy and cloudy and the rapid alternations of shadow and sunlight over the waste of the lake made the view look doubly wild weird and gloomy some people call that picturesque said sir percival pointing over the wide prospect with his halffinished walkingstick i call it a blot on a gentlemans property in my great grandfathers time the lake flowed to this place look at it now it is not four feet deep anywhere and it is all puddles and pools i wish i could afford to drain it and plant it all over my bailiff a superstitious idiot says he is quite sure the lake has a curse on it like the dead sea what do you think fosco it looks just the place for a murder doesnt it my good percival remonstrated the count what is your solid english sense thinking of the water is too shallow to hide the body and there is sand everywhere to print off the murderers footsteps it is upon the whole the very worst place for a murder that i ever set my eyes on humbug said sir percival cutting away fiercely at his stick you know what i mean the dreary scenery the lonely situation if you choose to understand me you can if you dont choose i am not going to trouble myself to explain my meaning and why not asked the count when your meaning can be explained by anybody in two words if a fool was going to commit a murder your lake is the first place he would choose for it if a wise man was going to commit a murder your lake is the last place he would choose for it is that your meaning if it is there is your explanation for you ready made take it percival with your good foscos blessing laura looked at the count with her dislike for him appearing a little too plainly in her face he was so busy with his mice that he did not notice her i am sorry to hear the lakeview connected with anything so horrible as the idea of murder she said and if count fosco must divide murderers into classes i think he has been very unfortunate in his choice of expressions to describe them as fools only seems like treating them with an indulgence to which they have no claim and to describe them as wise men sounds to me like a downright contradiction in terms i have always heard that truly wise men are truly good men and have a horror of crime my dear lady said the count those are admirable sentiments and i have seen them stated at the tops of copybooks he lifted one of the white mice in the palm of his hand and spoke to it in his whimsical way my pretty little smooth white rascal he said here is a moral lesson for you a truly wise mouse is a truly good mouse mention that if you please to your companions and never gnaw at the bars of your cage again as long as you live it is easy to turn everything into ridicule said laura resolutely but you will not find it quite so easy count fosco to give me an instance of a wise man who has been a great criminal the count shrugged his huge shoulders and smiled on laura in the friendliest manner most true he said the fools crime is the crime that is found out and the wise mans crime is the crime that is not found out if i could give you an instance it would not be the instance of a wise man dear lady glyde your sound english common sense has been too much for me it is checkmate for me this time miss halcombe ha stand to your guns laura sneered sir percival who had been listening in his place at the door tell him next that crimes cause their own detection theres another bit of copybook morality for you fosco crimes cause their own detection what infernal humbug i believe it to be true said laura quietly sir percival burst out laughing so violently so outrageously that he quite startled us all the count more than any of us i believe it too i said coming to lauras rescue sir percival who had been unaccountably amused at his wifes remark was just as unaccountably irritated by mine he struck the new stick savagely on the sand and walked away from us poor dear percival cried count fosco looking after him gaily he is the victim of english spleen but my dear miss halcombe my dear lady glyde do you really believe that crimes cause their own detection and you my angel he continued turning to his wife who had not uttered a word yet do you think so too i wait to be instructed replied the countess in tones of freezing reproof intended for laura and me before i venture on giving my opinion in the presence of wellinformed men do you indeed i said i remember the time countess when you advocated the rights of women and freedom of female opinion was one of them what is your view of the subject count asked madame fosco calmly proceeding with her cigarettes and not taking the least notice of me the count stroked one of his white mice reflectively with his chubby little finger before he answered it is truly wonderful he said how easily society can console itself for the worst of its shortcomings with a little bit of claptrap the machinery it has set up for the detection of crime is miserably ineffective and yet only invent a moral epigram saying that it works well and you blind everybody to its blunders from that moment crimes cause their own detection do they and murder will out another moral epigram will it ask coroners who sit at inquests in large towns if that is true lady glyde ask secretaries of lifeassurance companies if that is true miss halcombe read your own public journals in the few cases that get into the newspapers are there not instances of slain bodies found and no murderers ever discovered multiply the cases that are reported by the cases that are not reported and the bodies that are found by the bodies that are not found and what conclusion do you come to this that there are foolish criminals who are discovered and wise criminals who escape the hiding of a crime or the detection of a crime what is it a trial of skill between the police on one side and the individual on the other when the criminal is a brutal ignorant fool the police in nine cases out of ten win when the criminal is a resolute educated highlyintelligent man the police in nine cases out of ten lose if the police win you generally hear all about it if the police lose you generally hear nothing and on this tottering foundation you build up your comfortable moral maxim that crime causes its own detection yes all the crime you know of and what of the rest devilish true and very well put cried a voice at the entrance of the boathouse sir percival had recovered his equanimity and had come back while we were listening to the count some of it may be true i said and all of it may be very well put but i dont see why count fosco should celebrate the victory of the criminal over society with so much exultation or why you sir percival should applaud him so loudly for doing it do you hear that fosco asked sir percival take my advice and make your peace with your audience tell them virtues a fine thing they like that i can promise you the count laughed inwardly and silently and two of the white mice in his waistcoat alarmed by the internal convulsion going on beneath them darted out in a violent hurry and scrambled into their cage again the ladies my good percival shall tell me about virtue he said they are better authorities than i am for they know what virtue is and i dont you hear him said sir percival isnt it awful it is true said the count quietly i am a citizen of the world and i have met in my time with so many different sorts of virtue that i am puzzled in my old age to say which is the right sort and which is the wrong here in england there is one virtue and there in china there is another virtue and john englishman says my virtue is the genuine virtue and john chinaman says my virtue is the genuine virtue and i say yes to one or no to the other and am just as much bewildered about it in the case of john with the topboots as i am in the case of john with the pigtail ah nice little mousey come kiss me what is your own private notion of a virtuous man my pretpretpretty a man who keeps you warm and gives you plenty to eat and a good notion too for it is intelligible at the least stay a minute count i interposed accepting your illustration surely we have one unquestionable virtue in england which is wanting in china the chinese authorities kill thousands of innocent people on the most frivolous pretexts we in england are free from all guilt of that kind we commit no such dreadful crime we abhor reckless bloodshed with all our hearts quite right marian said laura well thought of and well expressed pray allow the count to proceed said madame fosco with stern civility you will find young ladies that he never speaks without having excellent reasons for all that he says thank you my angel replied the count have a bonbon he took out of his pocket a pretty little inlaid box and placed it open on the table chocolat a la vanille cried the impenetrable man cheerfully rattling the sweetmeats in the box and bowing all round offered by fosco as an act of homage to the charming society be good enough to go on count said his wife with a spiteful reference to myself oblige me by answering miss halcombe miss halcombe is unanswerable replied the polite italian that is to say so far as she goes yes i agree with her john bull does abhor the crimes of john chinaman he is the quickest old gentleman at finding out faults that are his neighbours and the slowest old gentleman at finding out the faults that are his own who exists on the face of creation is he so very much better in this way than the people whom he condemns in their way english society miss halcombe is as often the accomplice as it is the enemy of crime yes yes crime is in this country what crime is in other countries a good friend to a man and to those about him as often as it is an enemy a great rascal provides for his wife and family the worse he is the more he makes them the objects for your sympathy he often provides also for himself a profligate spendthrift who is always borrowing money will get more from his friends than the rigidly honest man who only borrows of them once under pressure of the direst want in the one case the friends will not be at all surprised and they will give in the other case they will be very much surprised and they will hesitate is the prison that mr scoundrel lives in at the end of his career a more uncomfortable place than the workhouse that mr honesty lives in at the end of his career when johnhoward philanthropist wants to relieve misery he goes to find it in prisons where crime is wretched not in huts and hovels where virtue is wretched too who is the english poet who has won the most universal sympathy who makes the easiest of all subjects for pathetic writing and pathetic painting that nice young person who began life with a forgery and ended it by a suicide your dear romantic interesting chatterton which gets on best do you think of two poor starving dressmakers the woman who resists temptation and is honest or the woman who falls under temptation and steals you all know that the stealing is the making of that second womans fortune it advertises her from length to breadth of goodhumoured charitable england and she is relieved as the breaker of a commandment when she would have been left to starve as the keeper of it come here my jolly little mouse hey presto pass i transform you for the time being into a respectable lady stop there in the palm of my great big hand my dear and listen you marry the poor man whom you love mouse and one half your friends pity and the other half blame you and now on the contrary you sell yourself for gold to a man you dont care for and all your friends rejoice over you and a minister of public worship sanctions the base horror of the vilest of all human bargains and smiles and smirks afterwards at your table if you are polite enough to ask him to breakfast hey presto pass be a mouse again and squeak if you continue to be a lady much longer i shall have you telling me that society abhors crime and then mouse i shall doubt if your own eyes and ears are really of any use to you ah i am a bad man lady glyde am i not i say what other people only think and when all the rest of the world is in a conspiracy to accept the mask for the true face mine is the rash hand that tears off the plump pasteboard and shows the bare bones beneath i will get up on my big elephants legs before i do myself any more harm in your amiable estimations i will get up and take a little airy walk of my own dear ladies as your excellent sheridan said i go and leave my character behind me he got up put the cage on the table and paused for a moment to count the mice in it one two three fourha he cried with a look of horror where in the name of heaven is the fifth the youngest the whitest the most amiable of all my benjamin of mice neither laura nor i were in any favorable disposition to be amused the counts glib cynicism had revealed a new aspect of his nature from which we both recoiled but it was impossible to resist the comical distress of so very large a man at the loss of so very small a mouse we laughed in spite of ourselves and when madame fosco rose to set the example of leaving the boathouse empty so that her husband might search it to its remotest corners we rose also to follow her out before we had taken three steps the counts quick eye discovered the lost mouse under the seat that we had been occupying he pulled aside the bench took the little animal up in his hand and then suddenly stopped on his knees looking intently at a particular place on the ground just beneath him when he rose to his feet again his hand shook so that he could hardly put the mouse back in the cage and his face was of a faint livid yellow hue all over percival he said in a whisper percival come here sir percival had paid no attention to any of us for the last ten minutes he had been entirely absorbed in writing figures on the sand and then rubbing them out again with the point of his stick whats the matter now he asked lounging carelessly into the boathouse do you see nothing there said the count catching him nervously by the collar with one hand and pointing with the other to the place near which he had found the mouse i see plenty of dry sand answered sir percival and a spot of dirt in the middle of it not dirt whispered the count fastening the other hand suddenly on sir percivals collar and shaking it in his agitation blood laura was near enough to hear the last word softly as he whispered it she turned to me with a look of terror nonsense my dear i said there is no need to be alarmed it is only the blood of a poor little stray dog everybody was astonished and everybodys eyes were fixed on me inquiringly how do you know that asked sir percival speaking first i found the dog here dying on the day when you all returned from abroad i replied the poor creature had strayed into the plantation and had been shot by your keeper whose dog was it inquired sir percival not one of mine did you try to save the poor thing asked laura earnestly surely you tried to save it marian yes i said the housekeeper and i both did our best but the dog was mortally wounded and he died under our hands whose dog was it persisted sir percival repeating his question a little irritably one of mine no not one of yours whose then did the housekeeper know the housekeepers report of mrs cathericks desire to conceal her visit to blackwater park from sir percivals knowledge recurred to my memory the moment he put that last question and i half doubted the discretion of answering it but in my anxiety to quiet the general alarm i had thoughtlessly advanced too far to draw back except at the risk of exciting suspicion which might only make matters worse there was nothing for it but to answer at once without reference to results yes i said the housekeeper knew she told me it was mrs cathericks dog sir percival had hitherto remained at the inner end of the boat house with count fosco while i spoke to him from the door but the instant mrs cathericks name passed my lips he pushed by the count roughly and placed himself face to face with me under the open daylight how came the housekeeper to know it was mrs cathericks dog he asked fixing his eyes on mine with a frowning interest and attention which half angered half startled me she knew it i said quietly because mrs catherick brought the dog with her brought it with her where did she bring it with her to this house what the devil did mrs catherick want at this house the manner in which he put the question was even more offensive than the language in which he expressed it i marked my sense of his want of common politeness by silently turning away from him just as i moved the counts persuasive hand was laid on his shoulder and the counts mellifluous voice interposed to quiet him my dear percival gently gently sir percival looked round in his angriest manner the count only smiled and repeated the soothing application gently my good friend gently sir percival hesitated followed me a few steps and to my great surprise offered me an apology i beg your pardon miss halcombe he said i have been out of order lately and i am afraid i am a little irritable but i should like to know what mrs catherick could possibly want here when did she come was the housekeeper the only person who saw her the only person i answered so far as i know the count interposed again in that case why not question the housekeeper he said why not go percival to the fountainhead of information at once quite right said sir percival of course the housekeeper is the first person to question excessively stupid of me not to see it myself with those words he instantly left us to return to the house the motive of the counts interference which had puzzled me at first betrayed itself when sir percivals back was turned he had a host of questions to put to me about mrs catherick and the cause of her visit to blackwater park which he could scarcely have asked in his friends presence i made my answers as short as i civilly could for i had already determined to check the least approach to any exchanging of confidences between count fosco and myself laura however unconsciously helped him to extract all my information by making inquiries herself which left me no alternative but to reply to her or to appear in the very unenviable and very false character of a depositary of sir percivals secrets the end of it was that in about ten minutes time the count knew as much as i know of mrs catherick and of the events which have so strangely connected us with her daughter anne from the time when cartright met with her to this day the effect of my information on him was in one respect curious enough intimately as he knows sir percival and closely as he appears to be associated with sir percivals private affairs in general he is certainly as far as i am from knowing anything of the true story of anne catherick the unsolved mystery in connection with this unhappy woman is now rendered doubly suspicious in my eyes by the absolute conviction which i feel that the clue to it has been hidden by sir percival from the most intimate friend he has in the world it was impossible to mistake the eager curiosity of the counts look and manner while he drank in greedily every word that fell from my lips there are many kinds of curiosity i know but there is no misinterpreting the curiosity of blank surprise if i ever saw it in my life i saw it in the counts face while the questions and answers were going on we had all been strolling quietly back through the plantation as soon as we reached the house the first object that we saw in front of it was sir percivals dogcart with the horse put to and the groom waiting by it in his stablejacket if these unexpected appearances were to be trusted the examination of the house keeper had produced important results already a fine horse my friend said the count addressing the groom with the most engaging familiarity of manner you are going to drive out i am not going sir replied the man looking at his stable jacket and evidently wondering whether the foreign gentleman took it for his livery my master drives himself aha said the count does he indeed i wonder he gives himself the trouble when he has got you to drive for him is he going to fatigue that nice shining pretty horse by taking him very far today i dont know sir answered the man the horse is a mare if you please sir shes the highestcouraged thing weve got in the stables her names brown molly sir and shell go till she drops sir percival usually takes isaac of york for the short distances and your shining courageous brown molly for the long logical inference miss halcombe continued the count wheeling round briskly and addressing me sir percival is going a long distance today i made no reply i had my own inferences to draw from what i knew through the housekeeper and from what i saw before me and i did not choose to share them with count fosco when sir percival was in cumberland i thought to myself he walked away a long distance on annes account to question the family at todds corner now he is in hampshire is he going to drive away a long distance on annes account again to question mrs catherick at welmingham we all entered the house as we crossed the hall sir percival came out from the library to meet us he looked hurried and pale and anxious but for all that he was in his most polite mood when he spoke to us i am sorry to say i am obliged to leave you he began a long drive a matter that i cant very well put off i shall be back in good time tomorrow but before i go i should like that little businessformality which i spoke of this morning to be settled laura will you come into the library it wont take a minute a mere formality countess may i trouble you also i want you and the countess fosco to be witnesses to a signature nothing more come in at once and get it over he held the library door open until they had passed in followed them and shut it softly i remained for a moment afterwards standing alone in the hall with my heart beating fast and my mind misgiving me sadly then i went on to the staircase and ascended slowly to my own room iv june th just as my hand was on the door of my room i heard sir percivals voice calling to me from below i must beg you to come downstairs again he said it is foscos fault miss halcombe not mine he has started some nonsensical objection to his wife being one of the witnesses and has obliged me to ask you to join us in the library i entered the room immediately with sir percival laura was waiting by the writingtable twisting and turning her garden hat uneasily in her hands madame fosco sat near her in an arm chair imperturbably admiring her husband who stood by himself at the other end of the library picking off the dead leaves from the flowers in the window the moment i appeared the count advanced to meet me and to offer his explanations a thousand pardons miss halcombe he said you know the character which is given to my countrymen by the english we italians are all wily and suspicious by nature in the estimation of the good john bull set me down if you please as being no better than the rest of my race i am a wily italian and a suspicious italian you have thought so yourself dear lady have you not well it is part of my wiliness and part of my suspicion to object to madame fosco being a witness to lady glydes signature when i am also a witness myself there is not the shadow of a reason for his objection interposed sir percival i have explained to him that the law of england allows madame fosco to witness a signature as well as her husband i admit it resumed the count the law of england says yes but the conscience of fosco says no he spread out his fat fingers on the bosom of his blouse and bowed solemnly as if he wished to introduce his conscience to us all in the character of an illustrious addition to the society what this document which lady glyde is about to sign may be he continued i neither know nor desire to know i only say this circumstances may happen in the future which may oblige percival or his representatives to appeal to the two witnesses in which case it is certainly desirable that those witnesses should represent two opinions which are perfectly independent the one of the other this cannot be if my wife signs as well as myself because we have but one opinion between us and that opinion is mine i will not have it cast in my teeth at some future day that madame fosco acted under my coercion and was in plain fact no witness at all i speak in percivals interest when i propose that my name shall appear as the nearest friend of the husband and your name miss halcombe as the nearest friend of the wife i am a jesuit if you please to think so a splitter of straws a man of trifles and crochets and scruples but you will humour me i hope in merciful consideration for my suspicious italian character and my uneasy italian conscience he bowed again stepped back a few paces and withdrew his conscience from our society as politely as he had introduced it the counts scruples might have been honourable and reasonable enough but there was something in his manner of expressing them which increased my unwillingness to be concerned in the business of the signature no consideration of less importance than my consideration for laura would have induced me to consent to be a witness at all one look however at her anxious face decided me to risk anything rather than desert her i will readily remain in the room i said and if i find no reason for starting any small scruples on my side you may rely on me as a witness sir percival looked at me sharply as if he was about to say something but at the same moment madame fosco attracted his attention by rising from her chair she had caught her husbands eye and had evidently received her orders to leave the room you neednt go said sir percival madame fosco looked for her orders again got them again said she would prefer leaving us to our business and resolutely walked out the count lit a cigarette went back to the flowers in the window and puffed little jets of smoke at the leaves in a state of the deepest anxiety about killing the insects meanwhile sir percival unlocked a cupboard beneath one of the bookcases and produced from it a piece of parchment folded longwise many times over he placed it on the table opened the last fold only and kept his hand on the rest the last fold displayed a strip of blank parchment with little wafers stuck on it at certain places every line of the writing was hidden in the part which he still held folded up under his hand laura and i looked at each other her face was pale but it showed no indecision and no fear sir percival dipped a pen in ink and handed it to his wife sign your name there he said pointing to the place you and fosco are to sign afterwards miss halcombe opposite those two wafers come here fosco witnessing a signature is not to be done by mooning out of window and smoking into the flowers the count threw away his cigarette and joined us at the table with his hands carelessly thrust into the scarlet belt of his blouse and his eyes steadily fixed on sir percivals face laura who was on the other side of her husband with the pen in her hand looked at him too he stood between them holding the folded parchment down firmly on the table and glancing across at me as i sat opposite to him with such a sinister mixture of suspicion and embarrassment on his face that he looked more like a prisoner at the bar than a gentleman in his own house sign there he repeated turning suddenly on laura and pointing once more to the place on the parchment what is it i am to sign she asked quietly i have no time to explain he answered the dogcart is at the door and i must go directly besides if i had time you wouldnt understand it is a purely formal document full of legal technicalities and all that sort of thing come come sign your name and let us have done as soon as possible i ought surely to know what i am signing sir percival before i write my name nonsense what have women to do with business i tell you again you cant understand it at any rate let me try to understand it whenever mr gilmore had any business for me to do he always explained it first and i always understood him i dare say he did he was your servant and was obliged to explain i am your husband and am not obliged how much longer do you mean to keep me here i tell you again there is no time for reading anything the dogcart is waiting at the door once for all will you sign or will you not she still had the pen in her hand but she made no approach to signing her name with it if my signature pledges me to anything she said surely i have some claim to know what that pledge is he lifted up the parchment and struck it angrily on the table speak out he said you were always famous for telling the truth never mind miss halcombe never mind fosco say in plain terms you distrust me the count took one of his hands out of his belt and laid it on sir percivals shoulder sir percival shook it off irritably the count put it on again with unruffled composure control your unfortunate temper percival he said lady glyde is right right cried sir percival a wife right in distrusting her husband it is unjust and cruel to accuse me of distrusting you said laura ask marian if i am not justified in wanting to know what this writing requires of me before i sign it i wont have any appeals made to miss halcombe retorted sir percival miss halcombe has nothing to do with the matter i had not spoken hitherto and i would much rather not have spoken now but the expression of distress in lauras face when she turned it towards me and the insolent injustice of her husbands conduct left me no other alternative than to give my opinion for her sake as soon as i was asked for it excuse me sir percival i said but as one of the witnesses to the signature i venture to think that i have something to do with the matter lauras objection seems to me a perfectly fair one and speaking for myself only i cannot assume the responsibility of witnessing her signature unless she first understands what the writing is which you wish her to sign a cool declaration upon my soul cried sir percival the next time you invite yourself to a mans house miss halcombe i recommend you not to repay his hospitality by taking his wifes side against him in a matter that doesnt concern you i started to my feet as suddenly as if he had struck me if i had been a man i would have knocked him down on the threshold of his own door and have left his house never on any earthly consideration to enter it again but i was only a woman and i loved his wife so dearly thank god that faithful love helped me and i sat down again without saying a word she knew what i had suffered and what i had suppressed she ran round to me with the tears streaming from her eyes oh marian she whispered softly if my mother had been alive she could have done no more for me come back and sign cried sir percival from the other side of the table shall i she asked in my ear i will if you tell me no i answered the right and the truth are with you sign nothing unless you have read it first come back and sign he reiterated in his loudest and angriest tones the count who had watched laura and me with a close and silent attention interposed for the second time percival he said i remember that i am in the presence of ladies be good enough if you please to remember it too sir percival turned on him speechless with passion the counts firm hand slowly tightened its grasp on his shoulder and the counts steady voice quietly repeated be good enough if you please to remember it too they both looked at each other sir percival slowly drew his shoulder from under the counts hand slowly turned his face away from the counts eyes doggedly looked down for a little while at the parchment on the table and then spoke with the sullen submission of a tamed animal rather than the becoming resignation of a convinced man i dont want to offend anybody he said but my wifes obstinacy is enough to try the patience of a saint i have told her this is merely a formal document and what more can she want you may say what you please but it is no part of a womans duty to set her husband at defiance once more lady glyde and for the last time will you sign or will you not laura returned to his side of the table and took up the pen again i will sign with pleasure she said if you will only treat me as a responsible being i care little what sacrifice is required of me if it will affect no one else and lead to no ill results who talked of a sacrifice being required of you he broke in with a halfsuppressed return of his former violence i only meant she resumed that i would refuse no concession which i could honourably make if i have a scruple about signing my name to an engagement of which i know nothing why should you visit it on me so severely it is rather hard i think to treat count foscos scruples so much more indulgently than you have treated mine this unfortunate yet most natural reference to the counts extraordinary power over her husband indirect as it was set sir percivals smouldering temper on fire again in an instant scruples he repeated your scruples it is rather late in the day for you to be scrupulous i should have thought you had got over all weakness of that sort when you made a virtue of necessity by marrying me the instant he spoke those words laura threw down the pen looked at him with an expression in her eyes which throughout all my experience of her i had never seen in them before and turned her back on him in dead silence this strong expression of the most open and the most bitter contempt was so entirely unlike herself so utterly out of her character that it silenced us all there was something hidden beyond a doubt under the mere surfacebrutality of the words which her husband had just addressed to her there was some lurking insult beneath them of which i was wholly ignorant but which had left the mark of its profanation so plainly on her face that even a stranger might have seen it the count who was no stranger saw it as distinctly as i did when i left my chair to join laura i heard him whisper under his breath to sir percival you idiot laura walked before me to the door as i advanced and at the same time her husband spoke to her once more you positively refuse then to give me your signature he said in the altered tone of a man who was conscious that he had let his own licence of language seriously injure him after what you have just said to me she replied firmly i refuse my signature until i have read every line in that parchment from the first word to the last come away marian we have remained here long enough one moment interposed the count before sir percival could speak again one moment lady glyde i implore you laura would have left the room without noticing him but i stopped her dont make an enemy of the count i whispered whatever you do dont make an enemy of the count she yielded to me i closed the door again and we stood near it waiting sir percival sat down at the table with his elbow on the folded parchment and his head resting on his clenched fist the count stood between us master of the dreadful position in which we were placed as he was master of everything else lady glyde he said with a gentleness which seemed to address itself to our forlorn situation instead of to ourselves pray pardon me if i venture to offer one suggestion and pray believe that i speak out of my profound respect and my friendly regard for the mistress of this house he turned sharply towards sir percival is it absolutely necessary he asked that this thing here under your elbow should be signed today it is necessary to my plans and wishes returned the other sulkily but that consideration as you may have noticed has no influence with lady glyde answer my plain question plainly can the business of the signature be put off till tomorrow yes or no yes if you will have it so then what are you wasting your time for here let the signature wait till tomorrow let it wait till you come back sir percival looked up with a frown and an oath you are taking a tone with me that i dont like he said a tone i wont bear from any man i am advising you for your good returned the count with a smile of quiet contempt give yourself time give lady glyde time have you forgotten that your dogcart is waiting at the door my tone surprises you ha i dare say it does it is the tone of a man who can keep his temper how many doses of good advice have i given you in my time more than you can count have i ever been wrong i defy you to quote me an instance of it go take your drive the matter of the signature can wait till to morrow let it wait and renew it when you come back sir percival hesitated and looked at his watch his anxiety about the secret journey which he was to take that day revived by the counts words was now evidently disputing possession of his mind with his anxiety to obtain lauras signature he considered for a little while and then got up from his chair it is easy to argue me down he said when i have no time to answer you i will take your advice fosco not because i want it or believe in it but because i cant stop here any longer he paused and looked round darkly at his wife if you dont give me your signature when i come back tomorrow the rest was lost in the noise of his opening the bookcase cupboard again and locking up the parchment once more he took his hat and gloves off the table and made for the door laura and i drew back to let him pass remember tomorrow he said to his wife and went out we waited to give him time to cross the hall and drive away the count approached us while we were standing near the door you have just seen percival at his worst miss halcombe he said as his old friend i am sorry for him and ashamed of him as his old friend i promise you that he shall not break out to morrow in the same disgraceful manner in which he has broken out today laura had taken my arm while he was speaking and she pressed it significantly when he had done it would have been a hard trial to any woman to stand by and see the office of apologist for her husbands misconduct quietly assumed by his male friend in her own house and it was a trial to her i thanked the count civilly and let her out yes i thanked him for i felt already with a sense of inexpressible helplessness and humiliation that it was either his interest or his caprice to make sure of my continuing to reside at blackwater park and i knew after sir percivals conduct to me that without the support of the counts influence i could not hope to remain there his influence the influence of all others that i dreaded most was actually the one tie which now held me to laura in the hour of her utmost need we heard the wheels of the dogcart crashing on the gravel of the drive as we came into the hall sir percival had started on his journey where is he going to marian laura whispered every fresh thing he does seems to terrify me about the future have you any suspicions after what she had undergone that morning i was unwilling to tell her my suspicions how should i know his secrets i said evasively i wonder if the housekeeper knows she persisted certainly not i replied she must be quite as ignorant as we are laura shook her head doubtfully did you not hear from the housekeeper that there was a report of anne catherick having been seen in this neighbourhood dont you think he may have gone away to look for her i would rather compose myself laura by not thinking about it at all and after what has happened you had better follow my example come into my room and rest and quiet yourself a little we sat down together close to the window and let the fragrant summer air breathe over our faces i am ashamed to look at you marian she said after what you submitted to downstairs for my sake oh my own love i am almost heartbroken when i think of it but i will try to make it up to you i will indeed hush hush i replied dont talk so what is the trifling mortification of my pride compared to the dreadful sacrifice of your happiness you heard what he said to me she went on quickly and vehemently you heard the words but you dont know what they meant you dont know why i threw down the pen and turned my back on him she rose in sudden agitation and walked about the room i have kept many things from your knowledge marian for fear of distressing you and making you unhappy at the outset of our new lives you dont know how he has used me and yet you ought to know for you saw how he used me today you heard him sneer at my presuming to be scrupulous you heard him say i had made a virtue of necessity in marrying him she sat down again her face flushed deeply and her hands twisted and twined together in her lap i cant tell you about it now she said i shall burst out crying if i tell you now later marian when i am more sure of myself my poor head aches darling aches aches aches where is your smellingbottle let me talk to you about yourself i wish i had given him my signature for your sake shall i give it to him tomorrow i would rather compromise myself than compromise you after your taking my part against him he will lay all the blame on you if i refuse again what shall we do oh for a friend to help us and advise us a friend we could really trust she sighed bitterly i saw in her face that she was thinking of hartright saw it the more plainly because her last words set me thinking of him too in six months only from her marriage we wanted the faithful service he had offered to us in his farewell words how little i once thought that we should ever want it at all we must do what we can to help ourselves i said let us try to talk it over calmly laura let us do all in our power to decide for the best putting what she knew of her husbands embarrassments and what i had heard of his conversation with the lawyer together we arrived necessarily at the conclusion that the parchment in the library had been drawn up for the purpose of borrowing money and that lauras signature was absolutely necessary to fit it for the attainment of sir percivals object the second question concerning the nature of the legal contract by which the money was to be obtained and the degree of personal responsibility to which laura might subject herself if she signed it in the dark involved considerations which lay far beyond any knowledge and experience that either of us possessed my own convictions led me to believe that the hidden contents of the parchment concealed a transaction of the meanest and the most fraudulent kind i had not formed this conclusion in consequence of sir percivals refusal to show the writing or to explain it for that refusal might well have proceeded from his obstinate disposition and his domineering temper alone my sole motive for distrusting his honesty sprang from the change which i had observed in his language and his manners at blackwater park a change which convinced me that he had been acting a part throughout the whole period of his probation at limmeridge house his elaborate delicacy his ceremonious politeness which harmonised so agreeably with mr gilmores oldfashioned notions his modesty with laura his candour with me his moderation with mr fairlie all these were the artifices of a mean cunning and brutal man who had dropped his disguise when his practised duplicity had gained its end and had openly shown himself in the library on that very day i say nothing of the grief which this discovery caused me on lauras account for it is not to be expressed by any words of mine i only refer to it at all because it decided me to oppose her signing the parchment whatever the consequences might be unless she was first made acquainted with the contents under these circumstances the one chance for us when tomorrow came was to be provided with an objection to giving the signature which might rest on sufficiently firm commercial or legal grounds to shake sir percivals resolution and to make him suspect that we two women understood the laws and obligations of business as well as himself after some pondering i determined to write to the only honest man within reach whom we could trust to help us discreetly in our forlorn situation that man was mr gilmores partner mr kyrle who conducted the business now that our old friend had been obliged to withdraw from it and to leave london on account of his health i explained to laura that i had mr gilmores own authority for placing implicit confidence in his partners integrity discretion and accurate knowledge of all her affairs and with her full approval i sat down at once to write the letter i began by stating our position to mr kyrle exactly as it was and then asked for his advice in return expressed in plain downright terms which he could comprehend without any danger of misinterpretations and mistakes my letter was as short as i could possibly make it and was i hope unencumbered by needless apologies and needless details just as i was about to put the address on the envelope an obstacle was discovered by laura which in the effort and preoccupation of writing had escaped my mind altogether how are we to get the answer in time she asked your letter will not be delivered in london before tomorrow morning and the post will not bring the reply here till the morning after the only way of overcoming this difficulty was to have the answer brought to us from the lawyers office by a special messenger i wrote a postscript to that effect begging that the messenger might be despatched with the reply by the eleven oclock morning train which would bring him to our station at twenty minutes past one and so enable him to reach blackwater park by two oclock at the latest he was to be directed to ask for me to answer no questions addressed to him by any one else and to deliver his letter into no hands but mine in case sir percival should come back tomorrow before two oclock i said to laura the wisest plan for you to adopt is to be out in the grounds all the morning with your book or your work and not to appear at the house till the messenger has had time to arrive with the letter i will wait here for him all the morning to guard against any misadventures or mistakes by following this arrangement i hope and believe we shall avoid being taken by surprise let us go down to the drawingroom now we may excite suspicion if we remain shut up together too long suspicion she repeated whose suspicion can we excite now that sir percival has left the house do you mean count fosco perhaps i do laura you are beginning to dislike him as much as i do marian no not to dislike him dislike is always more or less associated with contempt i can see nothing in the count to despise you are not afraid of him are you perhaps i am a little afraid of him after his interference in our favour today yes i am more afraid of his interference than i am of sir percivals violence remember what i said to you in the library whatever you do laura dont make an enemy of the count we went downstairs laura entered the drawingroom while i proceeded across the hall with my letter in my hand to put it into the postbag which hung against the wall opposite to me the house door was open and as i crossed past it i saw count fosco and his wife standing talking together on the steps outside with their faces turned towards me the countess came into the hall rather hastily and asked if i had leisure enough for five minutes private conversation feeling a little surprised by such an appeal from such a person i put my letter into the bag and replied that i was quite at her disposal she took my arm with unaccustomed friendliness and familiarity and instead of leading me into an empty room drew me out with her to the belt of turf which surrounded the large fishpond as we passed the count on the steps he bowed and smiled and then went at once into the house pushing the hall door to after him but not actually closing it the countess walked me gently round the fishpond i expected to be made the depositary of some extraordinary confidence and i was astonished to find that madame foscos communication for my private ear was nothing more than a polite assurance of her sympathy for me after what had happened in the library her husband had told her of all that had passed and of the insolent manner in which sir percival had spoken to me this information had so shocked and distressed her on my account and on lauras that she had made up her mind if anything of the sort happened again to mark her sense of sir percivals outrageous conduct by leaving the house the count had approved of her idea and she now hoped that i approved of it too i thought this a very strange proceeding on the part of such a remarkably reserved woman as madame fosco especially after the interchange of sharp speeches which had passed between us during the conversation in the boathouse on that very morning however it was my plain duty to meet a polite and friendly advance on the part of one of my elders with a polite and friendly reply i answered the countess accordingly in her own tone and then thinking we had said all that was necessary on either side made an attempt to get back to the house but madame fosco seemed resolved not to part with me and to my unspeakable amazement resolved also to talk hitherto the most silent of women she now persecuted me with fluent conventionalities on the subject of married life on the subject of sir percival and laura on the subject of her own happiness on the subject of the late mr fairlies conduct to her in the matter of her legacy and on half a dozen other subjects besides until she had detained me walking round and round the fishpond for more than half an hour and had quite wearied me out whether she discovered this or not i cannot say but she stopped as abruptly as she had begun looked towards the house door resumed her icy manner in a moment and dropped my arm of her own accord before i could think of an excuse for accomplishing my own release from her as i pushed open the door and entered the hall i found myself suddenly face to face with the count again he was just putting a letter into the postbag after he had dropped it in and had closed the bag he asked me where i had left madame fosco i told him and he went out at the hall door immediately to join his wife his manner when he spoke to me was so unusually quiet and subdued that i turned and looked after him wondering if he were ill or out of spirits why my next proceeding was to go straight up to the postbag and take out my own letter and look at it again with a vague distrust on me and why the looking at it for the second time instantly suggested the idea to my mind of sealing the envelope for its greater security are mysteries which are either too deep or too shallow for me to fathom women as everybody knows constantly act on impulses which they cannot explain even to themselves and i can only suppose that one of those impulses was the hidden cause of my unaccountable conduct on this occasion whatever influence animated me i found cause to congratulate myself on having obeyed it as soon as i prepared to seal the letter in my own room i had originally closed the envelope in the usual way by moistening the adhesive point and pressing it on the paper beneath and when i now tried it with my finger after a lapse of full threequarters of an hour the envelope opened on the instant without sticking or tearing perhaps i had fastened it insufficiently perhaps there might have been some defect in the adhesive gum or perhapsno it is quite revolting enough to feel that third conjecture stirring in my mind i would rather not see it confronting me in plain black and white i almost dread tomorrow so much depends on my discretion and selfcontrol there are two precautions at all events which i am sure not to forget i must be careful to keep up friendly appearances with the count and i must be well on my guard when the messenger from the office comes here with the answer to my letter v june th when the dinner hour brought us together again count fosco was in his usual excellent spirits he exerted himself to interest and amuse us as if he was determined to efface from our memories all recollection of what had passed in the library that afternoon lively descriptions of his adventures in travelling amusing anecdotes of remarkable people whom he had met with abroad quaint comparisons between the social customs of various nations illustrated by examples drawn from men and women indiscriminately all over europe humorous confessions of the innocent follies of his own early life when he ruled the fashions of a secondrate italian town and wrote preposterous romances on the french model for a secondrate italian newspaper all flowed in succession so easily and so gaily from his lips and all addressed our various curiosities and various interests so directly and so delicately that laura and i listened to him with as much attention and inconsistent as it may seem with as much admiration also as madame fosco herself women can resist a mans love a mans fame a mans personal appearance and a mans money but they cannot resist a mans tongue when he knows how to talk to them after dinner while the favourable impression which he had produced on us was still vivid in our minds the count modestly withdrew to read in the library laura proposed a stroll in the grounds to enjoy the close of the long evening it was necessary in common politeness to ask madame fosco to join us but this time she had apparently received her orders beforehand and she begged we would kindly excuse her the count will probably want a fresh supply of cigarettes she remarked by way of apology and nobody can make them to his satisfaction but myself her cold blue eyes almost warmed as she spoke the words she looked actually proud of being the officiating medium through which her lord and master composed himself with tobaccosmoke laura and i went out together alone it was a misty heavy evening there was a sense of blight in the air the flowers were drooping in the garden and the ground was parched and dewless the western heaven as we saw it over the quiet trees was of a pale yellow hue and the sun was setting faintly in a haze coming rain seemed near it would fall probably with the fall of night which way shall we go i asked towards the lake marian if you like she answered you seem unaccountably fond laura of that dismal lake no not of the lake but of the scenery about it the sand and heath and the firtrees are the only objects i can discover in all this large place to remind me of limmeridge but we will walk in some other direction if you prefer it i have no favourite walks at blackwater park my love one is the same as another to me let us go to the lake we may find it cooler in the open space than we find it here we walked through the shadowy plantation in silence the heaviness in the evening air oppressed us both and when we reached the boathouse we were glad to sit down and rest inside a white fog hung low over the lake the dense brown line of the trees on the opposite bank appeared above it like a dwarf forest floating in the sky the sandy ground shelving downward from where we sat was lost mysteriously in the outward layers of the fog the silence was horrible no rustling of the leaves no birds note in the wood no cry of waterfowl from the pools of the hidden lake even the croaking of the frogs had ceased to night it is very desolate and gloomy said laura but we can be more alone here than anywhere else she spoke quietly and looked at the wilderness of sand and mist with steady thoughtful eyes i could see that her mind was too much occupied to feel the dreary impressions from without which had fastened themselves already on mine i promised marian to tell you the truth about my married life instead of leaving you any longer to guess it for yourself she began that secret is the first i have ever had from you love and i am determined it shall be the last i was silent as you know for your sake and perhaps a little for my own sake as well it is very hard for a woman to confess that the man to whom she has given her whole life is the man of all others who cares least for the gift if you were married yourself marian and especially if you were happily married you would feel for me as no single woman can feel however kind and true she may be what answer could i make i could only take her hand and look at her with my whole heart as well as my eyes would let me how often she went on i have heard you laughing over what you used to call your poverty how often you have made me mock speeches of congratulation on my wealth oh marian never laugh again thank god for your poverty it has made you your own mistress and has saved you from the lot that has fallen on me a sad beginning on the lips of a young wife sad in its quiet plainspoken truth the few days we had all passed together at blackwater park had been many enough to show me to show any one what her husband had married her for you shall not be distressed she said by hearing how soon my disappointments and my trials began or even by knowing what they were it is bad enough to have them on my memory if i tell you how he received the first and last attempt at remonstrance that i ever made you will know how he has always treated me as well as if i had described it in so many words it was one day at rome when we had ridden out together to the tomb of cecilia metella the sky was calm and lovely and the grand old ruin looked beautiful and the remembrance that a husbands love had raised it in the old time to a wifes memory made me feel more tenderly and more anxiously towards my husband than i had ever felt yet would you build such a tomb for me percival i asked him you said you loved me dearly before we were married and yet since that time i could get no farther marian he was not even looking at me i pulled down my veil thinking it best not to let him see that the tears were in my eyes i fancied he had not paid any attention to me but he had he said come away and laughed to himself as he helped me on to my horse he mounted his own horse and laughed again as we rode away if i do build you a tomb he said it will be done with your own money i wonder whether cecilia metella had a fortune and paid for hers i made no reply how could i when i was crying behind my veil ah you lightcomplexioned women are all sulky he said what do you want compliments and soft speeches well im in a good humour this morning consider the compliments paid and the speeches said men little know when they say hard things to us how well we remember them and how much harm they do us it would have been better for me if i had gone on crying but his contempt dried up my tears and hardened my heart from that time marian i never checked myself again in thinking of walter hartright i let the memory of those happy days when we were so fond of each other in secret come back and comfort me what else had i to look to for consolation if we had been together you would have helped me to better things i know it was wrong darling but tell me if i was wrong without any excuse i was obliged to turn my face from her dont ask me i said have i suffered as you have suffered what right have i to decide i used to think of him she pursued dropping her voice and moving closer to me i used to think of him when percival left me alone at night to go among the opera people i used to fancy what i might have been if it had pleased god to bless me with poverty and if i had been his wife i used to see myself in my neat cheap gown sitting at home and waiting for him while he was earning our bread sitting at home and working for him and loving him all the better because i had to work for him seeing him come in tired and taking off his hat and coat for him and marian pleasing him with little dishes at dinner that i had learnt to make for his sake oh i hope he is never lonely enough and sad enough to think of me and see me as i have thought of him and see him as she said those melancholy words all the lost tenderness returned to her voice and all the lost beauty trembled back into her face her eyes rested as lovingly on the blighted solitary illomened view before us as if they saw the friendly hills of cumberland in the dim and threatening sky dont speak of walter any more i said as soon as i could control myself oh laura spare us both the wretchedness of talking of him now she roused herself and looked at me tenderly i would rather be silent about him for ever she answered than cause you a moments pain it is in your interests i pleaded it is for your sake that i speak if your husband heard you it would not surprise him if he did hear me she made that strange reply with a weary calmness and coldness the change in her manner when she gave the answer startled me almost as much as the answer itself not surprise him i repeated laura remember what you are saying you frighten me it is true she said it is what i wanted to tell you today when we were talking in your room my only secret when i opened my heart to him at limmeridge was a harmless secret marian you said so yourself the name was all i kept from him and he has discovered it i heard her but i could say nothing her last words had killed the little hope that still lived in me it happened at rome she went on as wearily calm and cold as ever we were at a little party given to the english by some friends of sir percivals mr and mrs markland mrs markland had the reputation of sketching very beautifully and some of the guests prevailed on her to show us her drawings we all admired them but something i said attracted her attention particularly to me surely you draw yourself she asked i used to draw a little once i answered but i have given it up if you have once drawn she said you may take to it again one of these days and if you do i wish you would let me recommend you a master i said nothing you know why marian and tried to change the conversation but mrs markland persisted i have had all sorts of teachers she went on but the best of all the most intelligent and the most attentive was a mr hartright if you ever take up your drawing again do try him as a master he is a young man modest and gentlemanlike i am sure you will like him think of those words being spoken to me publicly in the presence of strangers strangers who had been invited to meet the bride and bridegroom i did all i could to control myself i said nothing and looked down close at the drawings when i ventured to raise my head again my eyes and my husbands eyes met and i knew by his look that my face had betrayed me we will see about mr hartright he said looking at me all the time when we get back to england i agree with you mrs markland i think lady glyde is sure to like him he laid an emphasis on the last words which made my cheeks burn and set my heart beating as if it would stifle me nothing more was said we came away early he was silent in the carriage driving back to the hotel he helped me out and followed me upstairs as usual but the moment we were in the drawingroom he locked the door pushed me down into a chair and stood over me with his hands on my shoulders ever since that morning when you made your audacious confession to me at limmeridge he said i have wanted to find out the man and i found him in your face tonight your drawingmaster was the man and his name is hartright you shall repent it and he shall repent it to the last hour of your lives now go to bed and dream of him if you like with the marks of my horsewhip on his shoulders whenever he is angry with me now he refers to what i acknowledged to him in your presence with a sneer or a threat i have no power to prevent him from putting his own horrible construction on the confidence i placed in him i have no influence to make him believe me or to keep him silent you looked surprised today when you heard him tell me that i had made a virtue of necessity in marrying him you will not be surprised again when you hear him repeat it the next time he is out of temperoh marian dont dont you hurt me i had caught her in my arms and the sting and torment of my remorse had closed them round her like a vice yes my remorse the white despair of walters face when my cruel words struck him to the heart in the summerhouse at limmeridge rose before me in mute unendurable reproach my hand had pointed the way which led the man my sister loved step by step far from his country and his friends between those two young hearts i had stood to sunder them for ever the one from the other and his life and her life lay wasted before me alike in witness of the deed i had done this and done it for sir percival glyde for sir percival glyde i heard her speaking and i knew by the tone of her voice that she was comforting me i who deserved nothing but the reproach of her silence how long it was before i mastered the absorbing misery of my own thoughts i cannot tell i was first conscious that she was kissing me and then my eyes seemed to wake on a sudden to their sense of outward things and i knew that i was looking mechanically straight before me at the prospect of the lake it is late i heard her whisper it will be dark in the plantation she shook my arm and repeated marian it will be dark in the plantation give me a minute longer i said a minute to get better in i was afraid to trust myself to look at her yet and i kept my eyes fixed on the view it was late the dense brown line of trees in the sky had faded in the gathering darkness to the faint resemblance of a long wreath of smoke the mist over the lake below had stealthily enlarged and advanced on us the silence was as breathless as ever but the horror of it had gone and the solemn mystery of its stillness was all that remained we are far from the house she whispered let us go back she stopped suddenly and turned her face from me towards the entrance of the boathouse marian she said trembling violently do you see nothing look where down there below us she pointed my eyes followed her hand and i saw it too a living figure was moving over the waste of heath in the distance it crossed our range of view from the boathouse and passed darkly along the outer edge of the mist it stopped far off in front of us waited and passed on moving slowly with the white cloud of mist behind it and above it slowly slowly till it glided by the edge of the boathouse and we saw it no more we were both unnerved by what had passed between us that evening some minutes elapsed before laura would venture into the plantation and before i could make up my mind to lead her back to the house was it a man or a woman she asked in a whisper as we moved at last into the dark dampness of the outer air i am not certain which do you think it looked like a woman i was afraid it was a man in a long cloak it may be a man in this dim light it is not possible to be certain wait marian im frightened i dont see the path suppose the figure should follow us not at all likely laura there is really nothing to be alarmed about the shores of the lake are not far from the village and they are free to any one to walk on by day or night it is only wonderful we have seen no living creature there before we were now in the plantation it was very dark so dark that we found some difficulty in keeping the path i gave laura my arm and we walked as fast as we could on our way back before we were halfway through she stopped and forced me to stop with her she was listening hush she whispered i hear something behind us dead leaves i said to cheer her or a twig blown off the trees it is summer time marian and there is not a breath of wind listen i heard the sound too a sound like a light footstep following us no matter who it is or what it is i said let us walk on in another minute if there is anything to alarm us we shall be near enough to the house to be heard we went on quickly so quickly that laura was breathless by the time we were nearly through the plantation and within sight of the lighted windows i waited a moment to give her breathingtime just as we were about to proceed she stopped me again and signed to me with her hand to listen once more we both heard distinctly a long heavy sigh behind us in the black depths of the trees whos there i called out there was no answer whos there i repeated an instant of silence followed and then we heard the light fall of the footsteps again fainter and fainter sinking away into the darkness sinking sinking sinking till they were lost in the silence we hurried out from the trees to the open lawn beyond crossed it rapidly and without another word passing between us reached the house in the light of the halllamp laura looked at me with white cheeks and startled eyes i am half dead with fear she said who could it have been we will try to guess tomorrow i replied in the meantime say nothing to any one of what we have heard and seen why not because silence is safe and we have need of safety in this house i sent laura upstairs immediately waited a minute to take off my hat and put my hair smooth and then went at once to make my first investigations in the library on pretence of searching for a book there sat the count filling out the largest easychair in the house smoking and reading calmly with his feet on an ottoman his cravat across his knees and his shirt collar wide open and there sat madame fosco like a quiet child on a stool by his side making cigarettes neither husband nor wife could by any possibility have been out late that evening and have just got back to the house in a hurry i felt that my object in visiting the library was answered the moment i set eyes on them count fosco rose in polite confusion and tied his cravat on when i entered the room pray dont let me disturb you i said i have only come here to get a book all unfortunate men of my size suffer from the heat said the count refreshing himself gravely with a large green fan i wish i could change places with my excellent wife she is as cool at this moment as a fish in the pond outside the countess allowed herself to thaw under the influence of her husbands quaint comparison i am never warm miss halcombe she remarked with the modest air of a woman who was confessing to one of her own merits have you and lady glyde been out this evening asked the count while i was taking a book from the shelves to preserve appearances yes we went out to get a little air may i ask in what direction in the direction of the lake as far as the boathouse aha as far as the boathouse under other circumstances i might have resented his curiosity but tonight i hailed it as another proof that neither he nor his wife were connected with the mysterious appearance at the lake no more adventures i suppose this evening he went on no more discoveries like your discovery of the wounded dog he fixed his unfathomable grey eyes on me with that cold clear irresistible glitter in them which always forces me to look at him and always makes me uneasy while i do look an unutterable suspicion that his mind is prying into mine overcomes me at these times and it overcame me now no i said shortly no adventures no discoveries i tried to look away from him and leave the room strange as it seems i hardly think i should have succeeded in the attempt if madame fosco had not helped me by causing him to move and look away first count you are keeping miss halcombe standing she said the moment he turned round to get me a chair i seized my opportunity thanked him made my excuses and slipped out an hour later when lauras maid happened to be in her mistresss room i took occasion to refer to the closeness of the night with a view to ascertaining next how the servants had been passing their time have you been suffering much from the heat downstairs i asked no miss said the girl we have not felt it to speak of you have been out in the woods then i suppose some of us thought of going miss but cook said she should take her chair into the cool courtyard outside the kitchen door and on second thoughts all the rest of us took our chairs out there too the housekeeper was now the only person who remained to be accounted for is mrs michelson gone to bed yet i inquired i should think not miss said the girl smiling mrs michelson is more likely to be getting up just now than going to bed why what do you mean has mrs michelson been taking to her bed in the daytime no miss not exactly but the next thing to it shes been asleep all the evening on the sofa in her own room putting together what i observed for myself in the library and what i have just heard from lauras maid one conclusion seems inevitable the figure we saw at the lake was not the figure of madame fosco of her husband or of any of the servants the footsteps we heard behind us were not the footsteps of any one belonging to the house who could it have been it seems useless to inquire i cannot even decide whether the figure was a mans or a womans i can only say that i think it was a womans vi june th the misery of selfreproach which i suffered yesterday evening on hearing what laura told me in the boathouse returned in the loneliness of the night and kept me waking and wretched for hours i lighted my candle at last and searched through my old journals to see what my share in the fatal error of her marriage had really been and what i might have once done to save her from it the result soothed me a little for it showed that however blindly and ignorantly i acted i acted for the best crying generally does me harm but it was not so last night i think it relieved me i rose this morning with a settled resolution and a quiet mind nothing sir percival can say or do shall ever irritate me again or make me forget for one moment that i am staying here in defiance of mortifications insults and threats for lauras service and for lauras sake the speculations in which we might have indulged this morning on the subject of the figure at the lake and the footsteps in the plantation have been all suspended by a trifling accident which has caused laura great regret she has lost the little brooch i gave her for a keepsake on the day before her marriage as she wore it when we went out yesterday evening we can only suppose that it must have dropped from her dress either in the boathouse or on our way back the servants have been sent to search and have returned unsuccessful and now laura herself has gone to look for it whether she finds it or not the loss will help to excuse her absence from the house if sir percival returns before the letter from mr gilmores partner is placed in my hands one oclock has just struck i am considering whether i had better wait here for the arrival of the messenger from london or slip away quietly and watch for him outside the lodge gate my suspicion of everybody and everything in this house inclines me to think that the second plan may be the best the count is safe in the breakfastroom i heard him through the door as i ran upstairs ten minutes since exercising his canarybirds at their tricks come out on my little finger my pretpretpretties come out and hop upstairs one two three and up three two one and down one two three twittwittwittweet the birds burst into their usual ecstasy of singing and the count chirruped and whistled at them in return as if he was a bird himself my room door is open and i can hear the shrill singing and whistling at this very moment if i am really to slip out without being observed now is my time four oclock the three hours that have passed since i made my last entry have turned the whole march of events at blackwater park in a new direction whether for good or for evil i cannot and dare not decide let me get back first to the place at which i left off or i shall lose myself in the confusion of my own thoughts i went out as i had proposed to meet the messenger with my letter from london at the lodge gate on the stairs i saw no one in the hall i heard the count still exercising his birds but on crossing the quadrangle outside i passed madame fosco walking by herself in her favourite circle round and round the great fish pond i at once slackened my pace so as to avoid all appearance of being in a hurry and even went the length for cautions sake of inquiring if she thought of going out before lunch she smiled at me in the friendliest manner said she preferred remaining near the house nodded pleasantly and reentered the hall i looked back and saw that she had closed the door before i had opened the wicket by the side of the carriage gates in less than a quarter of an hour i reached the lodge the lane outside took a sudden turn to the left ran on straight for a hundred yards or so and then took another sharp turn to the right to join the highroad between these two turns hidden from the lodge on one side and from the way to the station on the other i waited walking backwards and forwards high hedges were on either side of me and for twenty minutes by my watch i neither saw nor heard anything at the end of that time the sound of a carriage caught my ear and i was met as i advanced towards the second turning by a fly from the railway i made a sign to the driver to stop as he obeyed me a respectablelooking man put his head out of the window to see what was the matter i beg your pardon i said but am i right in supposing that you are going to blackwater park yes maam with a letter for any one with a letter for miss halcombe maam you may give me the letter i am miss halcombe the man touched his hat got out of the fly immediately and gave me the letter i opened it at once and read these lines i copy them here thinking it best to destroy the original for cautions sake dear madam your letter received this morning has caused me very great anxiety i will reply to it as briefly and plainly as possible my careful consideration of the statement made by yourself and my knowledge of lady glydes position as defined in the settlement lead me i regret to say to the conclusion that a loan of the trust money to sir percival or in other words a loan of some portion of the twenty thousand pounds of lady glydes fortune is in contemplation and that she is made a party to the deed in order to secure her approval of a flagrant breach of trust and to have her signature produced against her if she should complain hereafter it is impossible on any other supposition to account situated as she is for her execution to a deed of any kind being wanted at all in the event of lady glydes signing such a document as i am compelled to suppose the deed in question to be her trustees would be at liberty to advance money to sir percival out of her twenty thousand pounds if the amount so lent should not he paid back and if lady glyde should have children their fortune will then be diminished by the sum large or small so advanced in plainer terms still the transaction for anything that lady glyde knows to the contrary may be a fraud upon her unborn children under these serious circumstances i would recommend lady glyde to assign as a reason for withholding her signature that she wishes the deed to be first submitted to myself as her family solicitor in the absence of my partner mr gilmore no reasonable objection can be made to taking this course for if the transaction is an honourable one there will necessarily be no difficulty in my giving my approval sincerely assuring you of my readiness to afford any additional help or advice that may be wanted i beg to remain madam your faithful servant william kyrle i read this kind and sensible letter very thankfully it supplied laura with a reason for objecting to the signature which was unanswerable and which we could both of us understand the messenger waited near me while i was reading to receive his directions when i had done will you be good enough to say that i understand the letter and that i am very much obliged i said there is no other reply necessary at present exactly at the moment when i was speaking those words holding the letter open in my hand count fosco turned the corner of the lane from the highroad and stood before me as if he had sprung up out of the earth the suddenness of his appearance in the very last place under heaven in which i should have expected to see him took me completely by surprise the messenger wished me goodmorning and got into the fly again i could not say a word to him i was not even able to return his bow the conviction that i was discovered and by that man of all others absolutely petrified me are you going back to the house miss halcombe he inquired without showing the least surprise on his side and without even looking after the fly which drove off while he was speaking to me i collected myself sufficiently to make a sign in the affirmative i am going back too he said pray allow me the pleasure of accompanying you will you take my arm you look surprised at seeing me i took his arm the first of my scattered senses that came back was the sense that warned me to sacrifice anything rather than make an enemy of him you look surprised at seeing me he repeated in his quietly pertinacious way i thought count i heard you with your birds in the breakfast room i answered as quietly and firmly as i could surely but my little feathered children dear lady are only too like other children they have their days of perversity and this morning was one of them my wife came in as i was putting them back in their cage and said she had left you going out alone for a walk you told her so did you not certainly well miss halcombe the pleasure of accompanying you was too great a temptation for me to resist at my age there is no harm in confessing so much as that is there i seized my hat and set off to offer myself as your escort even so fat an old man as fosco is surely better than no escort at all i took the wrong path i came back in despair and here i am arrived may i say it at the height of my wishes he talked on in this complimentary strain with a fluency which left me no exertion to make beyond the effort of maintaining my composure he never referred in the most distant manner to what he had seen in the lane or to the letter which i still had in my hand this ominous discretion helped to convince me that he must have surprised by the most dishonourable means the secret of my application in lauras interest to the lawyer and that having now assured himself of the private manner in which i had received the answer he had discovered enough to suit his purposes and was only bent on trying to quiet the suspicions which he knew he must have aroused in my mind i was wise enough under these circumstances not to attempt to deceive him by plausible explanations and woman enough notwithstanding my dread of him to feel as if my hand was tainted by resting on his arm on the drive in front of the house we met the dogcart being taken round to the stables sir percival had just returned he came out to meet us at the housedoor whatever other results his journey might have had it had not ended in softening his savage temper oh here are two of you come back he said with a lowering face what is the meaning of the house being deserted in this way where is lady glyde i told him of the loss of the brooch and said that laura had gone into the plantation to look for it brooch or no brooch he growled sulkily i recommend her not to forget her appointment in the library this afternoon i shall expect to see her in half an hour i took my hand from the counts arm and slowly ascended the steps he honoured me with one of his magnificent bows and then addressed himself gaily to the scowling master of the house tell me percival he said have you had a pleasant drive and has your pretty shining brown molly come back at all tired brown molly be hanged and the drive too i want my lunch and i want five minutes talk with you percival first returned the count five minutes talk my friend here on the grass what about about business that very much concerns you i lingered long enough in passing through the halldoor to hear this question and answer and to see sir percival thrust his hands into his pockets in sullen hesitation if you want to badger me with any more of your infernal scruples he said i for one wont hear them i want my lunch come out here and speak to me repeated the count still perfectly uninfluenced by the rudest speech that his friend could make to him sir percival descended the steps the count took him by the arm and walked him away gently the business i was sure referred to the question of the signature they were speaking of laura and of me beyond a doubt i felt heartsick and faint with anxiety it might be of the last importance to both of us to know what they were saying to each other at that moment and not one word of it could by any possibility reach my ears i walked about the house from room to room with the lawyers letter in my bosom i was afraid by this time even to trust it under lock and key till the oppression of my suspense half maddened me there were no signs of lauras return and i thought of going out to look for her but my strength was so exhausted by the trials and anxieties of the morning that the heat of the day quite overpowered me and after an attempt to get to the door i was obliged to return to the drawingroom and lie down on the nearest sofa to recover i was just composing myself when the door opened softly and the count looked in a thousand pardons miss halcombe he said i only venture to disturb you because i am the bearer of good news percival who is capricious in everything as you know has seen fit to alter his mind at the last moment and the business of the signature is put off for the present a great relief to all of us miss halcombe as i see with pleasure in your face pray present my best respects and felicitations when you mention this pleasant change of circumstances to lady glyde he left me before i had recovered my astonishment there could be no doubt that this extraordinary alteration of purpose in the matter of the signature was due to his influence and that his discovery of my application to london yesterday and of my having received an answer to it today had offered him the means of interfering with certain success i felt these impressions but my mind seemed to share the exhaustion of my body and i was in no condition to dwell on them with any useful reference to the doubtful present or the threatening future i tried a second time to run out and find laura but my head was giddy and my knees trembled under me there was no choice but to give it up again and return to the sofa sorely against my will the quiet in the house and the low murmuring hum of summer insects outside the open window soothed me my eyes closed of themselves and i passed gradually into a strange condition which was not waking for i knew nothing of what was going on about me and not sleeping for i was conscious of my own repose in this state my fevered mind broke loose from me while my weary body was at rest and in a trance or daydream of my fancy i know not what to call it i saw walter hartright i had not thought of him since i rose that morning laura had not said one word to me either directly or indirectly referring to him and yet i saw him now as plainly as if the past time had returned and we were both together again at limmeridge house he appeared to me as one among many other men none of whose faces i could plainly discern they were all lying on the steps of an immense ruined temple colossal tropical trees with rank creepers twining endlessly about their trunks and hideous stone idols glimmering and grinning at intervals behind leaves and stalks and branches surrounded the temple and shut out the sky and threw a dismal shadow over the forlorn band of men on the steps white exhalations twisted and curled up stealthily from the ground approached the men in wreaths like smoke touched them and stretched them out dead one by one in the places where they lay an agony of pity and fear for walter loosened my tongue and i implored him to escape come back come back i said remember your promise to her and to me come back to us before the pestilence reaches you and lays you dead like the rest he looked at me with an unearthly quiet in his face wait he said i shall come back the night when i met the lost woman on the highway was the night which set my life apart to be the instrument of a design that is yet unseen here lost in the wilderness or there welcomed back in the land of my birth i am still walking on the dark road which leads me and you and the sister of your love and mine to the unknown retribution and the inevitable end wait and look the pestilence which touches the rest will pass me i saw him again he was still in the forest and the numbers of his lost companions had dwindled to very few the temple was gone and the idols were gone and in their place the figures of dark dwarfish men lurked murderously among the trees with bows in their hands and arrows fitted to the string once more i feared for walter and cried out to warn him once more he turned to me with the immovable quiet in his face another step he said on the dark road wait and look the arrows that strike the rest will spare me i saw him for the third time in a wrecked ship stranded on a wild sandy shore the overloaded boats were making away from him for the land and he alone was left to sink with the ship i cried to him to hail the hindmost boat and to make a last effort for his life the quiet face looked at me in return and the unmoved voice gave me back the changeless reply another step on the journey wait and look the sea which drowns the rest will spare me i saw him for the last time he was kneeling by a tomb of white marble and the shadow of a veiled woman rose out of the grave beneath and waited by his side the unearthly quiet of his face had changed to an unearthly sorrow but the terrible certainty of his words remained the same darker and darker he said farther and farther yet death takes the good the beautiful and the young and spares me the pestilence that wastes the arrow that strikes the sea that drowns the grave that closes over love and hope are steps of my journey and take me nearer and nearer to the end my heart sank under a dread beyond words under a grief beyond tears the darkness closed round the pilgrim at the marble tomb closed round the veiled woman from the grave closed round the dreamer who looked on them i saw and heard no more i was aroused by a hand laid on my shoulder it was lauras she had dropped on her knees by the side of the sofa her face was flushed and agitated and her eyes met mine in a wild bewildered manner i started the instant i saw her what has happened i asked what has frightened you she looked round at the halfopen door put her lips close to my ear and answered in a whisper marian the figure at the lake the footsteps last night ive just seen her ive just spoken to her who for heavens sake anne catherick i was so startled by the disturbance in lauras face and manner and so dismayed by the first waking impressions of my dream that i was not fit to bear the revelation which burst upon me when that name passed her lips i could only stand rooted to the floor looking at her in breathless silence she was too much absorbed by what had happened to notice the effect which her reply had produced on me i have seen anne catherick i have spoken to anne catherick she repeated as if i had not heard her oh marian i have such things to tell you come away we may be interrupted here come at once into my room with those eager words she caught me by the hand and led me through the library to the end room on the ground floor which had been fitted up for her own especial use no third person except her maid could have any excuse for surprising us here she pushed me in before her locked the door and drew the chintz curtains that hung over the inside the strange stunned feeling which had taken possession of me still remained but a growing conviction that the complications which had long threatened to gather about her and to gather about me had suddenly closed fast round us both was now beginning to penetrate my mind i could not express it in words i could hardly even realise it dimly in my own thoughts anne catherick i whispered to myself with useless helpless reiteration anne catherick laura drew me to the nearest seat an ottoman in the middle of the room look she said look here and pointed to the bosom of her dress i saw for the first time that the lost brooch was pinned in its place again there was something real in the sight of it something real in the touching of it afterwards which seemed to steady the whirl and confusion in my thoughts and to help me to compose myself where did you find your brooch the first words i could say to her were the words which put that trivial question at that important moment she found it marian where on the floor of the boathouse oh how shall i begin how shall i tell you about it she talked to me so strangely she looked so fearfully ill she left me so suddenly her voice rose as the tumult of her recollections pressed upon her mind the inveterate distrust which weighs night and day on my spirits in this house instantly roused me to warn her just as the sight of the brooch had roused me to question her the moment before speak low i said the window is open and the garden path runs beneath it begin at the beginning laura tell me word for word what passed between that woman and you shall i close the window no only speak low only remember that anne catherick is a dangerous subject under your husbands roof where did you first see her at the boathouse marian i went out as you know to find my brooch and i walked along the path through the plantation looking down on the ground carefully at every step in that way i got on after a long time to the boathouse and as soon as i was inside it i went on my knees to hunt over the floor i was still searching with my back to the doorway when i heard a soft strange voice behind me say miss fairlie miss fairlie yes my old name the dear familiar name that i thought i had parted from for ever i started up not frightened the voice was too kind and gentle to frighten anybody but very much surprised there looking at me from the doorway stood a woman whose face i never remembered to have seen before how was she dressed she had a neat pretty white gown on and over it a poor worn thin dark shawl her bonnet was of brown straw as poor and worn as the shawl i was struck by the difference between her gown and the rest of her dress and she saw that i noticed it dont look at my bonnet and shawl she said speaking in a quick breathless sudden way if i mustnt wear white i dont care what i wear look at my gown as much as you please im not ashamed of that very strange was it not before i could say anything to soothe her she held out one of her hands and i saw my brooch in it i was so pleased and so grateful that i went quite close to her to say what i really felt are you thankful enough to do me one little kindness she asked yes indeed i answered any kindness in my power i shall be glad to show you then let me pin your brooch on for you now i have found it her request was so unexpected marian and she made it with such extraordinary eagerness that i drew back a step or two not well knowing what to do ah she said your mother would have let me pin on the brooch there was something in her voice and her look as well as in her mentioning my mother in that reproachful manner which made me ashamed of my distrust i took her hand with the brooch in it and put it up gently on the bosom of my dress you knew my mother i said was it very long ago have i ever seen you before her hands were busy fastening the brooch she stopped and pressed them against my breast you dont remember a fine spring day at limmeridge she said and your mother walking down the path that led to the school with a little girl on each side of her i have had nothing else to think of since and i remember it you were one of the little girls and i was the other pretty clever miss fairlie and poor dazed anne catherick were nearer to each other then than they are now did you remember her laura when she told you her name yes i remembered your asking me about anne catherick at limmeridge and your saying that she had once been considered like me what reminded you of that laura she reminded me while i was looking at her while she was very close to me it came over my mind suddenly that we were like each other her face was pale and thin and weary but the sight of it startled me as if it had been the sight of my own face in the glass after a long illness the discovery i dont know why gave me such a shock that i was perfectly incapable of speaking to her for the moment did she seem hurt by your silence i am afraid she was hurt by it you have not got your mothers face she said or your mothers heart your mothers face was dark and your mothers heart miss fairlie was the heart of an angel i am sure i feel kindly towards you i said though i may not be able to express it as i ought why do you call me miss fairlie because i love the name of fairlie and hate the name of glyde she broke out violently i had seen nothing like madness in her before this but i fancied i saw it now in her eyes i only thought you might not know i was married i said remembering the wild letter she wrote to me at limmeridge and trying to quiet her she sighed bitterly and turned away from me not know you were married she repeated i am here because you are married i am here to make atonement to you before i meet your mother in the world beyond the grave she drew farther and farther away from me till she was out of the boat house and then she watched and listened for a little while when she turned round to speak again instead of coming back she stopped where she was looking in at me with a hand on each side of the entrance did you see me at the lake last night she said did you hear me following you in the wood i have been waiting for days together to speak to you alone i have left the only friend i have in the world anxious and frightened about me i have risked being shut up again in the madhouse and all for your sake miss fairlie all for your sake her words alarmed me marian and yet there was something in the way she spoke that made me pity her with all my heart i am sure my pity must have been sincere for it made me bold enough to ask the poor creature to come in and sit down in the boathouse by my side did she do so no she shook her head and told me she must stop where she was to watch and listen and see that no third person surprised us and from first to last there she waited at the entrance with a hand on each side of it sometimes bending in suddenly to speak to me sometimes drawing back suddenly to look about her i was here yesterday she said before it came dark and i heard you and the lady with you talking together i heard you tell her about your husband i heard you say you had no influence to make him believe you and no influence to keep him silent ah i knew what those words meant my conscience told me while i was listening why did i ever let you marry him oh my fear my mad miserable wicked fear she covered up her face in her poor worn shawl and moaned and murmured to herself behind it i began to be afraid she might break out into some terrible despair which neither she nor i could master try to quiet yourself i said try to tell me how you might have prevented my marriage she took the shawl from her face and looked at me vacantly i ought to have had heart enough to stop at limmeridge she answered i ought never to have let the news of his coming there frighten me away i ought to have warned you and saved you before it was too late why did i only have courage enough to write you that letter why did i only do harm when i wanted and meant to do good oh my fear my mad miserable wicked fear she repeated those words again and hid her face again in the end of her poor worn shawl it was dreadful to see her and dreadful to hear her surely laura you asked what the fear was which she dwelt on so earnestly yes i asked that and what did she say she asked me in return if i should not be afraid of a man who had shut me up in a madhouse and who would shut me up again if he could i said are you afraid still surely you would not be here if you were afraid now no she said i am not afraid now i asked why not she suddenly bent forward into the boat house and said cant you guess why i shook my head look at me she went on i told her i was grieved to see that she looked very sorrowful and very ill she smiled for the first time ill she repeated im dying you know why im not afraid of him now do you think i shall meet your mother in heaven will she forgive me if i do i was so shocked and so startled that i could make no reply i have been thinking of it she went on all the time i have been in hiding from your husband all the time i lay ill my thoughts have driven me here i want to make atonement i want to undo all i can of the harm i once did i begged her as earnestly as i could to tell me what she meant she still looked at me with fixed vacant eyes shall i undo the harm she said to herself doubtfully you have friends to take your part if you know his secret he will be afraid of you he wont dare use you as he used me he must treat you mercifully for his own sake if he is afraid of you and your friends and if he treats you mercifully and if i can say it was my doing i listened eagerly for more but she stopped at those words you tried to make her go on i tried but she only drew herself away from me again and leaned her face and arms against the side of the boathouse oh i heard her say with a dreadful distracted tenderness in her voice oh if i could only be buried with your mother if i could only wake at her side when the angels trumpet sounds and the graves give up their dead at the resurrection marian i trembled from head to foot it was horrible to hear her but there is no hope of that she said moving a little so as to look at me again no hope for a poor stranger like me i shall not rest under the marble cross that i washed with my own hands and made so white and pure for her sake oh no oh no gods mercy not mans will take me to her where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest she spoke those words quietly and sorrowfully with a heavy hopeless sigh and then waited a little her face was confused and troubled she seemed to be thinking or trying to think what was it i said just now she asked after a while when your mother is in my mind everything else goes out of it what was i saying what was i saying i reminded the poor creature as kindly and delicately as i could ah yes yes she said still in a vacant perplexed manner you are helpless with your wicked husband yes and i must do what i have come to do here i must make it up to you for having been afraid to speak out at a better time what is it you have to tell me i asked the secret that your cruel husband is afraid of she answered i once threatened him with the secret and frightened him you shall threaten him with the secret and frighten him too her face darkened and a hard angry stare fixed itself in her eyes she began waving her hand at me in a vacant unmeaning manner my mother knows the secret she said my mother has wasted under the secret half her lifetime one day when i was grown up she said something to me and the next day your husband yes yes go on what did she tell you about your husband she stopped again marian at that point and said no more and listened eagerly hush she whispered still waving her hand at me hush she moved aside out of the doorway moved slowly and stealthily step by step till i lost her past the edge of the boathouse surely you followed her yes my anxiety made me bold enough to rise and follow her just as i reached the entrance she appeared again suddenly round the side of the boathouse the secret i whispered to her wait and tell me the secret she caught hold of my arm and looked at me with wild frightened eyes not now she said we are not alone we are watched come here tomorrow at this time by yourself mind by yourself she pushed me roughly into the boat house again and i saw her no more oh laura laura another chance lost if i had only been near you she should not have escaped us on which side did you lose sight of her on the left side where the ground sinks and the wood is thickest did you run out again did you call after her how could i i was too terrified to move or speak but when you did move when you came out i ran back here to tell you what had happened did you see any one or hear any one in the plantation no it seemed to be all still and quiet when i passed through it i waited for a moment to consider was this third person supposed to have been secretly present at the interview a reality or the creature of anne cathericks excited fancy it was impossible to determine the one thing certain was that we had failed again on the very brink of discovery failed utterly and irretrievably unless anne catherick kept her appointment at the boathouse for the next day are you quite sure you have told me everything that passed every word that was said i inquired i think so she answered my powers of memory marian are not like yours but i was so strongly impressed so deeply interested that nothing of any importance can possibly have escaped me my dear laura the merest trifles are of importance where anne catherick is concerned think again did no chance reference escape her as to the place in which she is living at the present time none that i can remember did she not mention a companion and friend a woman named mrs clements oh yes yes i forgot that she told me mrs clements wanted sadly to go with her to the lake and take care of her and begged and prayed that she would not venture into this neighbourhood alone was that all she said about mrs clements yes that was all she told you nothing about the place in which she took refuge after leaving todds corner nothing i am quite sure nor where she has lived since nor what her illness had been no marian not a word tell me pray tell me what you think about it i dont know what to think or what to do next you must do this my love you must carefully keep the appointment at the boathouse tomorrow it is impossible to say what interests may not depend on your seeing that woman again you shall not be left to yourself a second time i will follow you at a safe distance nobody shall see me but i will keep within hearing of your voice if anything happens anne catherick has escaped walter hartright and has escaped you whatever happens she shall not escape me lauras eyes read mine attentively you believe she said in this secret that my husband is afraid of suppose marian it should only exist after all in anne cathericks fancy suppose she only wanted to see me and to speak to me for the sake of old remembrances her manner was so strange i almost doubted her would you trust her in other things i trust nothing laura but my own observation of your husbands conduct i judge anne cathericks words by his actions and i believe there is a secret i said no more and got up to leave the room thoughts were troubling me which i might have told her if we had spoken together longer and which it might have been dangerous for her to know the influence of the terrible dream from which she had awakened me hung darkly and heavily over every fresh impression which the progress of her narrative produced on my mind i felt the ominous future coming close chilling me with an unutterable awe forcing on me the conviction of an unseen design in the long series of complications which had now fastened round us i thought of hartright as i saw him in the body when he said farewell as i saw him in the spirit in my dream and i too began to doubt now whether we were not advancing blindfold to an appointed and an inevitable end leaving laura to go upstairs alone i went out to look about me in the walks near the house the circumstances under which anne catherick had parted from her had made me secretly anxious to know how count fosco was passing the afternoon and had rendered me secretly distrustful of the results of that solitary journey from which sir percival had returned but a few hours since after looking for them in every direction and discovering nothing i returned to the house and entered the different rooms on the ground floor one after another they were all empty i came out again into the hall and went upstairs to return to laura madame fosco opened her door as i passed it in my way along the passage and i stopped to see if she could inform me of the whereabouts of her husband and sir percival yes she had seen them both from her window more than an hour since the count had looked up with his customary kindness and had mentioned with his habitual attention to her in the smallest trifles that he and his friend were going out together for a long walk for a long walk they had never yet been in each others company with that object in my experience of them sir percival cared for no exercise but riding and the count except when he was polite enough to be my escort cared for no exercise at all when i joined laura again i found that she had called to mind in my absence the impending question of the signature to the deed which in the interest of discussing her interview with anne catherick we had hitherto overlooked her first words when i saw her expressed her surprise at the absence of the expected summons to attend sir percival in the library you may make your mind easy on that subject i said for the present at least neither your resolution nor mine will be exposed to any further trial sir percival has altered his plans the business of the signature is put off put off laura repeated amazedly who told you so my authority is count fosco i believe it is to his interference that we are indebted for your husbands sudden change of purpose it seems impossible marian if the object of my signing was as we suppose to obtain money for sir percival that he urgently wanted how can the matter be put off i think laura we have the means at hand of setting that doubt at rest have you forgotten the conversation that i heard between sir percival and the lawyer as they were crossing the hall no but i dont remember i do there were two alternatives proposed one was to obtain your signature to the parchment the other was to gain time by giving bills at three months the last resource is evidently the resource now adopted and we may fairly hope to be relieved from our share in sir percivals embarrassments for some time to come oh marian it sounds too good to be true does it my love you complimented me on my ready memory not long since but you seem to doubt it now i will get my journal and you shall see if i am right or wrong i went away and got the book at once on looking back to the entry referring to the lawyers visit we found that my recollection of the two alternatives presented was accurately correct it was almost as great a relief to my mind as to lauras to find that my memory had served me on this occasion as faithfully as usual in the perilous uncertainty of our present situation it is hard to say what future interests may not depend upon the regularity of the entries in my journal and upon the reliability of my recollection at the time when i make them lauras face and manner suggested to me that this last consideration had occurred to her as well as to myself anyway it is only a trifling matter and i am almost ashamed to put it down here in writing it seems to set the forlornness of our situation in such a miserably vivid light we must have little indeed to depend on when the discovery that my memory can still be trusted to serve us is hailed as if it was the discovery of a new friend the first bell for dinner separated us just as it had done ringing sir percival and the count returned from their walk we heard the master of the house storming at the servants for being five minutes late and the masters guest interposing as usual in the interests of propriety patience and peace the evening has come and gone no extraordinary event has happened but i have noticed certain peculiarities in the conduct of sir percival and the count which have sent me to my bed feeling very anxious and uneasy about anne catherick and about the results which tomorrow may produce i know enough by this time to be sure that the aspect of sir percival which is the most false and which therefore means the worst is his polite aspect that long walk with his friend had ended in improving his manners especially towards his wife to lauras secret surprise and to my secret alarm he called her by her christian name asked if she had heard lately from her uncle inquired when mrs vesey was to receive her invitation to blackwater and showed her so many other little attentions that he almost recalled the days of his hateful courtship at limmeridge house this was a bad sign to begin with and i thought it more ominous still that he should pretend after dinner to fall asleep in the drawingroom and that his eyes should cunningly follow laura and me when he thought we neither of us suspected him i have never had any doubt that his sudden journey by himself took him to welmingham to question mrs catherick but the experience of tonight has made me fear that the expedition was not undertaken in vain and that he has got the information which he unquestionably left us to collect if i knew where anne catherick was to be found i would be up tomorrow with sunrise and warn her while the aspect under which sir percival presented himself to night was unhappily but too familiar to me the aspect under which the count appeared was on the other hand entirely new in my experience of him he permitted me this evening to make his acquaintance for the first time in the character of a man of sentiment of sentiment as i believe really felt not assumed for the occasion for instance he was quiet and subdued his eyes and his voice expressed a restrained sensibility he wore as if there was some hidden connection between his showiest finery and his deepest feeling the most magnificent waistcoat he has yet appeared in it was made of pale seagreen silk and delicately trimmed with fine silver braid his voice sank into the tenderest inflections his smile expressed a thoughtful fatherly admiration whenever he spoke to laura or to me he pressed his wifes hand under the table when she thanked him for trifling little attentions at dinner he took wine with her your health and happiness my angel he said with fond glistening eyes he ate little or nothing and sighed and said good percival when his friend laughed at him after dinner he took laura by the hand and asked her if she would be so sweet as to play to him she complied through sheer astonishment he sat by the piano with his watchchain resting in folds like a golden serpent on the seagreen protuberance of his waistcoat his immense head lay languidly on one side and he gently beat time with two of his yellowwhite fingers he highly approved of the music and tenderly admired lauras manner of playing not as poor hartright used to praise it with an innocent enjoyment of the sweet sounds but with a clear cultivated practical knowledge of the merits of the composition in the first place and of the merits of the players touch in the second as the evening closed in he begged that the lovely dying light might not be profaned just yet by the appearance of the lamps he came with his horribly silent tread to the distant window at which i was standing to be out of his way and to avoid the very sight of him he came to ask me to support his protest against the lamps if any one of them could only have burnt him up at that moment i would have gone down to the kitchen and fetched it myself surely you like this modest trembling english twilight he said softly ah i love it i feel my inborn admiration of all that is noble and great and good purified by the breath of heaven on an evening like this nature has such imperishable charms such inextinguishable tenderness for me i am an old fat man talk which would become your lips miss halcombe sounds like a derision and a mockery on mine it is hard to be laughed at in my moments of sentiment as if my soul was like myself old and overgrown observe dear lady what a light is dying on the trees does it penetrate your heart as it penetrates mine he paused looked at me and repeated the famous lines of dante on the eveningtime with a melody and tenderness which added a charm of their own to the matchless beauty of the poetry itself bah he cried suddenly as the last cadence of those noble italian words died away on his lips i make an old fool of myself and only weary you all let us shut up the window in our bosoms and get back to the matteroffact world percival i sanction the admission of the lamps lady glyde miss halcombe eleanor my good wife which of you will indulge me with a game at dominoes he addressed us all but he looked especially at laura she had learnt to feel my dread of offending him and she accepted his proposal it was more than i could have done at that moment i could not have sat down at the same table with him for any consideration his eyes seemed to reach my inmost soul through the thickening obscurity of the twilight his voice trembled along every nerve in my body and turned me hot and cold alternately the mystery and terror of my dream which had haunted me at intervals all through the evening now oppressed my mind with an unendurable foreboding and an unutterable awe i saw the white tomb again and the veiled woman rising out of it by hartrights side the thought of laura welled up like a spring in the depths of my heart and filled it with waters of bitterness never never known to it before i caught her by the hand as she passed me on her way to the table and kissed her as if that night was to part us for ever while they were all gazing at me in astonishment i ran out through the low window which was open before me to the ground ran out to hide from them in the darkness to hide even from myself we separated that evening later than usual towards midnight the summer silence was broken by the shuddering of a low melancholy wind among the trees we all felt the sudden chill in the atmosphere but the count was the first to notice the stealthy rising of the wind he stopped while he was lighting my candle for me and held up his hand warningly listen he said there will be a change tomorrow vii june th the events of yesterday warned me to be ready sooner or later to meet the worst today is not yet at an end and the worst has come judging by the closest calculation of time that laura and i could make we arrived at the conclusion that anne catherick must have appeared at the boathouse at halfpast two oclock on the afternoon of yesterday i accordingly arranged that laura should just show herself at the luncheontable today and should then slip out at the first opportunity leaving me behind to preserve appearances and to follow her as soon as i could safely do so this mode of proceeding if no obstacles occurred to thwart us would enable her to be at the boathouse before halfpast two and when i left the table in my turn would take me to a safe position in the plantation before three the change in the weather which last nights wind warned us to expect came with the morning it was raining heavily when i got up and it continued to rain until twelve oclock when the clouds dispersed the blue sky appeared and the sun shone again with the bright promise of a fine afternoon my anxiety to know how sir percival and the count would occupy the early part of the day was by no means set at rest so far as sir percival was concerned by his leaving us immediately after breakfast and going out by himself in spite of the rain he neither told us where he was going nor when we might expect him back we saw him pass the breakfastroom window hastily with his high boots and his waterproof coat on and that was all the count passed the morning quietly indoors some part of it in the library some part in the drawingroom playing odds and ends of music on the piano and humming to himself judging by appearances the sentimental side of his character was persistently inclined to betray itself still he was silent and sensitive and ready to sigh and languish ponderously as only fat men can sigh and languish on the smallest provocation luncheontime came and sir percival did not return the count took his friends place at the table plaintively devoured the greater part of a fruit tart submerged under a whole jugful of cream and explained the full merit of the achievement to us as soon as he had done a taste for sweets he said in his softest tones and his tenderest manner is the innocent taste of women and children i love to share it with them it is another bond dear ladies between you and me laura left the table in ten minutes time i was sorely tempted to accompany her but if we had both gone out together we must have excited suspicion and worse still if we allowed anne catherick to see laura accompanied by a second person who was a stranger to her we should in all probability forfeit her confidence from that moment never to regain it again i waited therefore as patiently as i could until the servant came in to clear the table when i quitted the room there were no signs in the house or out of it of sir percivals return i left the count with a piece of sugar between his lips and the vicious cockatoo scrambling up his waistcoat to get at it while madame fosco sitting opposite to her husband watched the proceedings of his bird and himself as attentively as if she had never seen anything of the sort before in her life on my way to the plantation i kept carefully beyond the range of view from the luncheonroom window nobody saw me and nobody followed me it was then a quarter to three oclock by my watch once among the trees i walked rapidly until i had advanced more than halfway through the plantation at that point i slackened my pace and proceeded cautiously but i saw no one and heard no voices by little and little i came within view of the back of the boathouse stopped and listened then went on till i was close behind it and must have heard any persons who were talking inside still the silence was unbroken still far and near no sign of a living creature appeared anywhere after skirting round by the back of the building first on one side and then on the other and making no discoveries i ventured in front of it and fairly looked in the place was empty i called laura at first softly then louder and louder no one answered and no one appeared for all that i could see and hear the only human creature in the neighbourhood of the lake and the plantation was myself my heart began to beat violently but i kept my resolution and searched first the boathouse and then the ground in front of it for any signs which might show me whether laura had really reached the place or not no mark of her presence appeared inside the building but i found traces of her outside it in footsteps on the sand i detected the footsteps of two persons large footsteps like a mans and small footsteps which by putting my own feet into them and testing their size in that manner i felt certain were lauras the ground was confusedly marked in this way just before the boathouse close against one side of it under shelter of the projecting roof i discovered a little hole in the sand a hole artificially made beyond a doubt i just noticed it and then turned away immediately to trace the footsteps as far as i could and to follow the direction in which they might lead me they led me starting from the lefthand side of the boathouse along the edge of the trees a distance i should think of between two and three hundred yards and then the sandy ground showed no further trace of them feeling that the persons whose course i was tracking must necessarily have entered the plantation at this point i entered it too at first i could find no path but i discovered one afterwards just faintly traced among the trees and followed it it took me for some distance in the direction of the village until i stopped at a point where another foottrack crossed it the brambles grew thickly on either side of this second path i stood looking down it uncertain which way to take next and while i looked i saw on one thorny branch some fragments of fringe from a womans shawl a closer examination of the fringe satisfied me that it had been torn from a shawl of lauras and i instantly followed the second path it brought me out at last to my great relief at the back of the house i say to my great relief because i inferred that laura must for some unknown reason have returned before me by this roundabout way i went in by the courtyard and the offices the first person whom i met in crossing the servants hall was mrs michelson the housekeeper do you know i asked whether lady glyde has come in from her walk or not my lady came in a little while ago with sir percival answered the housekeeper i am afraid miss halcombe something very distressing has happened my heart sank within me you dont mean an accident i said faintly no no thank god no accident but my lady ran upstairs to her own room in tears and sir percival has ordered me to give fanny warning to leave in an hours time fanny was lauras maid a good affectionate girl who had been with her for years the only person in the house whose fidelity and devotion we could both depend upon where is fanny i inquired in my room miss halcombe the young woman is quite overcome and i told her to sit down and try to recover herself i went to mrs michelsons room and found fanny in a corner with her box by her side crying bitterly she could give me no explanation whatever of her sudden dismissal sir percival had ordered that she should have a months wages in place of a months warning and go no reason had been assigned no objection had been made to her conduct she had been forbidden to appeal to her mistress forbidden even to see her for a moment to say goodbye she was to go without explanations or farewells and to go at once after soothing the poor girl by a few friendly words i asked where she proposed to sleep that night she replied that she thought of going to the little inn in the village the landlady of which was a respectable woman known to the servants at blackwater park the next morning by leaving early she might get back to her friends in cumberland without stopping in london where she was a total stranger i felt directly that fannys departure offered us a safe means of communication with london and with limmeridge house of which it might be very important to avail ourselves accordingly i told her that she might expect to hear from her mistress or from me in the course of the evening and that she might depend on our both doing all that lay in our power to help her under the trial of leaving us for the present those words said i shook hands with her and went upstairs the door which led to lauras room was the door of an antechamber opening on to the passage when i tried it it was bolted on the inside i knocked and the door was opened by the same heavy overgrown housemaid whose lumpish insensibility had tried my patience so severely on the day when i found the wounded dog i had since that time discovered that her name was margaret porcher and that she was the most awkward slatternly and obstinate servant in the house on opening the door she instantly stepped out to the threshold and stood grinning at me in stolid silence why do you stand there i said dont you see that i want to come in ah but you mustnt come in was the answer with another and a broader grin still how dare you talk to me in that way stand back instantly she stretched out a great red hand and arm on each side of her so as to bar the doorway and slowly nodded her addle head at me masters orders she said and nodded again i had need of all my selfcontrol to warn me against contesting the matter with her and to remind me that the next words i had to say must be addressed to her master i turned my back on her and instantly went downstairs to find him my resolution to keep my temper under all the irritations that sir percival could offer was by this time as completely forgotten i say so to my shame as if i had never made it it did me good after all i had suffered and suppressed in that house it actually did me good to feel how angry i was the drawingroom and the breakfastroom were both empty i went on to the library and there i found sir percival the count and madame fosco they were all three standing up close together and sir percival had a little slip of paper in his hand as i opened the door i heard the count say to him no a thousand times over no i walked straight up to him and looked him full in the face am i to understand sir percival that your wifes room is a prison and that your housemaid is the gaoler who keeps it i asked yes that is what you are to understand he answered take care my gaoler hasnt got double duty to do take care your room is not a prison too take you care how you treat your wife and how you threaten me i broke out in the heat of my anger there are laws in england to protect women from cruelty and outrage if you hurt a hair of lauras head if you dare to interfere with my freedom come what may to those laws i will appeal instead of answering me he turned round to the count what did i tell you he asked what do you say now what i said before replied the count no even in the vehemence of my anger i felt his calm cold grey eyes on my face they turned away from me as soon as he had spoken and looked significantly at his wife madame fosco immediately moved close to my side and in that position addressed sir percival before either of us could speak again favour me with your attention for one moment she said in her clear icilysuppressed tones i have to thank you sir percival for your hospitality and to decline taking advantage of it any longer i remain in no house in which ladies are treated as your wife and miss halcombe have been treated here today sir percival drew back a step and stared at her in dead silence the declaration he had just heard a declaration which he well knew as i well knew madame fosco would not have ventured to make without her husbands permission seemed to petrify him with surprise the count stood by and looked at his wife with the most enthusiastic admiration she is sublime he said to himself he approached her while he spoke and drew her hand through his arm i am at your service eleanor he went on with a quiet dignity that i had never noticed in him before and at miss halcombes service if she will honour me by accepting all the assistance i can offer her damn it what do you mean cried sir percival as the count quietly moved away with his wife to the door at other times i mean what i say but at this time i mean what my wife says replied the impenetrable italian we have changed places percival for once and madame foscos opinion is mine sir percival crumpled up the paper in his hand and pushing past the count with another oath stood between him and the door have your own way he said with baffled rage in his low half whispering tones have your own way and see what comes of it with those words he left the room madame fosco glanced inquiringly at her husband he has gone away very suddenly she said what does it mean it means that you and i together have brought the worsttempered man in all england to his senses answered the count it means miss halcombe that lady glyde is relieved from a gross indignity and you from the repetition of an unpardonable insult suffer me to express my admiration of your conduct and your courage at a very trying moment sincere admiration suggested madame fosco sincere admiration echoed the count i had no longer the strength of my first angry resistance to outrage and injury to support me my heartsick anxiety to see laura my sense of my own helpless ignorance of what had happened at the boathouse pressed on me with an intolerable weight i tried to keep up appearances by speaking to the count and his wife in the tone which they had chosen to adopt in speaking to me but the words failed on my lips my breath came short and thick my eyes looked longingly in silence at the door the count understanding my anxiety opened it went out and pulled it to after him at the same time sir percivals heavy step descended the stairs i heard them whispering together outside while madame fosco was assuring me in her calmest and most conventional manner that she rejoiced for all our sakes that sir percivals conduct had not obliged her husband and herself to leave blackwater park before she had done speaking the whispering ceased the door opened and the count looked in miss halcombe he said i am happy to inform you that lady glyde is mistress again in her own house i thought it might be more agreeable to you to hear of this change for the better from me than from sir percival and i have therefore expressly returned to mention it admirable delicacy said madame fosco paying back her husbands tribute of admiration with the counts own coin in the counts own manner he smiled and bowed as if he had received a formal compliment from a polite stranger and drew back to let me pass out first sir percival was standing in the hall as i hurried to the stairs i heard him call impatiently to the count to come out of the library what are you waiting there for he said i want to speak to you and i want to think a little by myself replied the other wait till later percival wait till later neither he nor his friend said any more i gained the top of the stairs and ran along the passage in my haste and my agitation i left the door of the antechamber open but i closed the door of the bedroom the moment i was inside it laura was sitting alone at the far end of the room her arms resting wearily on a table and her face hidden in her hands she started up with a cry of delight when she saw me how did you get here she asked who gave you leave not sir percival in my overpowering anxiety to hear what she had to tell me i could not answer her i could only put questions on my side lauras eagerness to know what had passed downstairs proved however too strong to be resisted she persistently repeated her inquiries the count of course i answered impatiently whose influence in the house she stopped me with a gesture of disgust dont speak of him she cried the count is the vilest creature breathing the count is a miserable spy before we could either of us say another word we were alarmed by a soft knocking at the door of the bedroom i had not yet sat down and i went first to see who it was when i opened the door madame fosco confronted me with my handkerchief in her hand you dropped this downstairs miss halcombe she said and i thought i could bring it to you as i was passing by to my own room her face naturally pale had turned to such a ghastly whiteness that i started at the sight of it her hands so sure and steady at all other times trembled violently and her eyes looked wolfishly past me through the open door and fixed on laura she had been listening before she knocked i saw it in her white face i saw it in her trembling hands i saw it in her look at laura after waiting an instant she turned from me in silence and slowly walked away i closed the door again oh laura laura we shall both rue the day when you called the count a spy you would have called him so yourself marian if you had known what i know anne catherick was right there was a third person watching us in the plantation yesterday and that third person are you sure it was the count i am absolutely certain he was sir percivals spy he was sir percivals informer he set sir percival watching and waiting all the morning through for anne catherick and for me is anne found did you see her at the lake no she has saved herself by keeping away from the place when i got to the boathouse no one was there yes yes i went in and sat waiting for a few minutes but my restlessness made me get up again to walk about a little as i passed out i saw some marks on the sand close under the front of the boat house i stooped down to examine them and discovered a word written in large letters on the sand the word was look and you scraped away the sand and dug a hollow place in it how do you know that marian i saw the hollow place myself when i followed you to the boat house go on go on yes i scraped away the sand on the surface and in a little while i came to a strip of paper hidden beneath which had writing on it the writing was signed with anne cathericks initials where is it sir percival has taken it from me can you remember what the writing was do you think you can repeat it to me in substance i can marian it was very short you would have remembered it word for word try to tell me what the substance was before we go any further she complied i write the lines down here exactly as she repeated them to me they ran thus i was seen with you yesterday by a tall stout old man and had to run to save myself he was not quick enough on his feet to follow me and he lost me among the trees i dare not risk coming back here today at the same time i write this and hide it in the sand at six in the morning to tell you so when we speak next of your wicked husbands secret we must speak safely or not at all try to have patience i promise you shall see me again and that soon a c the reference to the tall stout old man the terms of which laura was certain that she had repeated to me correctly left no doubt as to who the intruder had been i called to mind that i had told sir percival in the counts presence the day before that laura had gone to the boathouse to look for her brooch in all probability he had followed her there in his officious way to relieve her mind about the matter of the signature immediately after he had mentioned the change in sir percivals plans to me in the drawingroom in this case he could only have got to the neighbourhood of the boathouse at the very moment when anne catherick discovered him the suspiciously hurried manner in which she parted from laura had no doubt prompted his useless attempt to follow her of the conversation which had previously taken place between them he could have heard nothing the distance between the house and the lake and the time at which he left me in the drawingroom as compared with the time at which laura and anne catherick had been speaking together proved that fact to us at any rate beyond a doubt having arrived at something like a conclusion so far my next great interest was to know what discoveries sir percival had made after count fosco had given him his information how came you to lose possession of the letter i asked what did you do with it when you found it in the sand after reading it once through she replied i took it into the boathouse with me to sit down and look over it a second time while i was reading a shadow fell across the paper i looked up and saw sir percival standing in the doorway watching me did you try to hide the letter i tried but he stopped me you neednt trouble to hide that he said i happen to have read it i could only look at him helplessly i could say nothing you understand he went on i have read it i dug it up out of the sand two hours since and buried it again and wrote the word above it again and left it ready to your hands you cant lie yourself out of the scrape now you saw anne catherick in secret yesterday and you have got her letter in your hand at this moment i have not caught her yet but i have caught you give me the letter he stepped close up to me i was alone with him marian what could i do i gave him the letter what did he say when you gave it to him at first he said nothing he took me by the arm and led me out of the boathouse and looked about him on all sides as if he was afraid of our being seen or heard then he clasped his hand fast round my arm and whispered to me what did anne catherick say to you yesterday i insist on hearing every word from first to last did you tell him i was alone with him marian his cruel hand was bruising my arm what could i do is the mark on your arm still let me see it why do you want to see it i want to see it laura because our endurance must end and our resistance must begin today that mark is a weapon to strike him with let me see it now i may have to swear to it at some future time oh marian dont look so dont talk so it doesnt hurt me now let me see it she showed me the marks i was past grieving over them past crying over them past shuddering over them they say we are either better than men or worse if the temptation that has fallen in some womens way and made them worse had fallen in mine at that moment thank god my face betrayed nothing that his wife could read the gentle innocent affectionate creature thought i was frightened for her and sorry for her and thought no more dont think too seriously of it marian she said simply as she pulled her sleeve down again it doesnt hurt me now i will try to think quietly of it my love for your sake well well and you told him all that anne catherick had said to you all that you told me yes all he insisted on it i was alone with him i could conceal nothing did he say anything when you had done he looked at me and laughed to himself in a mocking bitter way i mean to have the rest out of you he said do you hear the rest i declared to him solemnly that i had told him everything i knew not you he answered you know more than you choose to tell wont you tell it you shall ill wring it out of you at home if i cant wring it out of you here he led me away by a strange path through the plantation a path where there was no hope of our meeting you and he spoke no more till we came within sight of the house then he stopped again and said will you take a second chance if i give it to you will you think better of it and tell me the rest i could only repeat the same words i had spoken before he cursed my obstinacy and went on and took me with him to the house you cant deceive me he said you know more than you choose to tell ill have your secret out of you and ill have it out of that sister of yours as well there shall be no more plotting and whispering between you neither you nor she shall see each other again till you have confessed the truth ill have you watched morning noon and night till you confess the truth he was deaf to everything i could say he took me straight upstairs into my own room fanny was sitting there doing some work for me and he instantly ordered her out ill take good care youre not mixed up in the conspiracy he said you shall leave this house today if your mistress wants a maid she shall have one of my choosing he pushed me into the room and locked the door on me he set that senseless woman to watch me outside marian he looked and spoke like a madman you may hardly understand it he did indeed i do understand it laura he is mad mad with the terrors of a guilty conscience every word you have said makes me positively certain that when anne catherick left you yesterday you were on the eve of discovering a secret which might have been your vile husbands ruin and he thinks you have discovered it nothing you can say or do will quiet that guilty distrust and convince his false nature of your truth i dont say this my love to alarm you i say it to open your eyes to your position and to convince you of the urgent necessity of letting me act as i best can for your protection while the chance is our own count foscos interference has secured me access to you today but he may withdraw that interference tomorrow sir percival has already dismissed fanny because she is a quickwitted girl and devotedly attached to you and has chosen a woman to take her place who cares nothing for your interests and whose dull intelligence lowers her to the level of the watchdog in the yard it is impossible to say what violent measures he may take next unless we make the most of our opportunities while we have them what can we do marian oh if we could only leave this house never to see it again listen to me my love and try to think that you are not quite helpless so long as i am here with you i will think so i do think so dont altogether forget poor fanny in thinking of me she wants help and comfort too i will not forget her i saw her before i came up here and i have arranged to communicate with her tonight letters are not safe in the postbag at blackwater park and i shall have two to write today in your interests which must pass through no hands but fannys what letters i mean to write first laura to mr gilmores partner who has offered to help us in any fresh emergency little as i know of the law i am certain that it can protect a woman from such treatment as that ruffian has inflicted on you today i will go into no details about anne catherick because i have no certain information to give but the lawyer shall know of those bruises on your arm and of the violence offered to you in this room he shall before i rest tonight but think of the exposure marian i am calculating on the exposure sir percival has more to dread from it than you have the prospect of an exposure may bring him to terms when nothing else will i rose as i spoke but laura entreated me not to leave her you will drive him to desperation she said and increase our dangers tenfold i felt the truth the disheartening truth of those words but i could not bring myself plainly to acknowledge it to her in our dreadful position there was no help and no hope for us but in risking the worst i said so in guarded terms she sighed bitterly but did not contest the matter she only asked about the second letter that i had proposed writing to whom was it to be addressed to mr fairlie i said your uncle is your nearest male relative and the head of the family he must and shall interfere laura shook her head sorrowfully yes yes i went on your uncle is a weak selfish worldly man i know but he is not sir percival glyde and he has no such friend about him as count fosco i expect nothing from his kindness or his tenderness of feeling towards you or towards me but he will do anything to pamper his own indolence and to secure his own quiet let me only persuade him that his interference at this moment will save him inevitable trouble and wretchedness and responsibility hereafter and he will bestir himself for his own sake i know how to deal with him laura i have had some practice if you could only prevail on him to let me go back to limmeridge for a little while and stay there quietly with you marian i could be almost as happy again as i was before i was married those words set me thinking in a new direction would it be possible to place sir percival between the two alternatives of either exposing himself to the scandal of legal interference on his wifes behalf or of allowing her to be quietly separated from him for a time under pretext of a visit to her uncles house and could he in that case be reckoned on as likely to accept the last resource it was doubtful more than doubtful and yet hopeless as the experiment seemed surely it was worth trying i resolved to try it in sheer despair of knowing what better to do your uncle shall know the wish you have just expressed i said and i will ask the lawyers advice on the subject as well good may come of it and will come of it i hope saying that i rose again and again laura tried to make me resume my seat dont leave me she said uneasily my desk is on that table you can write here it tried me to the quick to refuse her even in her own interests but we had been too long shut up alone together already our chance of seeing each other again might entirely depend on our not exciting any fresh suspicions it was full time to show myself quietly and unconcernedly among the wretches who were at that very moment perhaps thinking of us and talking of us downstairs i explained the miserable necessity to laura and prevailed on her to recognise it as i did i will come back again love in an hour or less i said the worst is over for today keep yourself quiet and fear nothing is the key in the door marian can i lock it on the inside yes here is the key lock the door and open it to nobody until i come upstairs again i kissed her and left her it was a relief to me as i walked away to hear the key turned in the lock and to know that the door was at her own command viii june th i had only got as far as the top of the stairs when the locking of lauras door suggested to me the precaution of also locking my own door and keeping the key safely about me while i was out of the room my journal was already secured with other papers in the table drawer but my writing materials were left out these included a seal bearing the common device of two doves drinking out of the same cup and some sheets of blottingpaper which had the impression on them of the closing lines of my writing in these pages traced during the past night distorted by the suspicion which had now become a part of myself even such trifles as these looked too dangerous to be trusted without a guard even the locked table drawer seemed to be not sufficiently protected in my absence until the means of access to it had been carefully secured as well i found no appearance of any one having entered the room while i had been talking with laura my writing materials which i had given the servant instructions never to meddle with were scattered over the table much as usual the only circumstance in connection with them that at all struck me was that the seal lay tidily in the tray with the pencils and the wax it was not in my careless habits i am sorry to say to put it there neither did i remember putting it there but as i could not call to mind on the other hand where else i had thrown it down and as i was also doubtful whether i might not for once have laid it mechanically in the right place i abstained from adding to the perplexity with which the days events had filled my mind by troubling it afresh about a trifle i locked the door put the key in my pocket and went downstairs madame fosco was alone in the hall looking at the weatherglass still falling she said i am afraid we must expect more rain her face was composed again to its customary expression and its customary colour but the hand with which she pointed to the dial of the weatherglass still trembled could she have told her husband already that she had overheard laura reviling him in my company as a spy my strong suspicion that she must have told him my irresistible dread all the more overpowering from its very vagueness of the consequences which might follow my fixed conviction derived from various little selfbetrayals which women notice in each other that madame fosco in spite of her wellassumed external civility had not forgiven her niece for innocently standing between her and the legacy of ten thousand pounds all rushed upon my mind together all impelled me to speak in the vain hope of using my own influence and my own powers of persuasion for the atonement of lauras offence may i trust to your kindness to excuse me madame fosco if i venture to speak to you on an exceedingly painful subject she crossed her hands in front of her and bowed her head solemnly without uttering a word and without taking her eyes off mine for a moment when you were so good as to bring me back my handkerchief i went on i am very very much afraid you must have accidentally heard laura say something which i am unwilling to repeat and which i will not attempt to defend i will only venture to hope that you have not thought it of sufficient importance to be mentioned to the count i think it of no importance whatever said madame fosco sharply and suddenly but she added resuming her icy manner in a moment i have no secrets from my husband even in trifles when he noticed just now that i looked distressed it was my painful duty to tell him why i was distressed and i frankly acknowledge to you miss halcombe that i have told him i was prepared to hear it and yet she turned me cold all over when she said those words let me earnestly entreat you madame fosco let me earnestly entreat the count to make some allowances for the sad position in which my sister is placed she spoke while she was smarting under the insult and injustice inflicted on her by her husband and she was not herself when she said those rash words may i hope that they will be considerately and generously forgiven most assuredly said the counts quiet voice behind me he had stolen on us with his noiseless tread and his book in his hand from the library when lady glyde said those hasty words he went on she did me an injustice which i lament and forgive let us never return to the subject miss halcombe let us all comfortably combine to forget it from this moment you are very kind i said you relieve me inexpressibly i tried to continue but his eyes were on me his deadly smile that hides everything was set hard and unwavering on his broad smooth face my distrust of his unfathomable falseness my sense of my own degradation in stooping to conciliate his wife and himself so disturbed and confused me that the next words failed on my lips and i stood there in silence i beg you on my knees to say no more miss halcombe i am truly shocked that you should have thought it necessary to say so much with that polite speech he took my hand oh how i despise myself oh how little comfort there is even in knowing that i submitted to it for lauras sake he took my hand and put it to his poisonous lips never did i know all my horror of him till then that innocent familiarity turned my blood as if it had been the vilest insult that a man could offer me yet i hid my disgust from him i tried to smile i who once mercilessly despised deceit in other women was as false as the worst of them as false as the judas whose lips had touched my hand i could not have maintained my degrading selfcontrol it is all that redeems me in my own estimation to know that i could not if he had still continued to keep his eyes on my face his wifes tigerish jealousy came to my rescue and forced his attention away from me the moment he possessed himself of my hand her cold blue eyes caught light her dull white cheeks flushed into bright colour she looked years younger than her age in an instant count she said your foreign forms of politeness are not understood by englishwomen pardon me my angel the best and dearest englishwoman in the world understands them with those words he dropped my hand and quietly raised his wifes hand to his lips in place of it i ran back up the stairs to take refuge in my own room if there had been time to think my thoughts when i was alone again would have caused me bitter suffering but there was no time to think happily for the preservation of my calmness and my courage there was time for nothing but action the letters to the lawyer and to mr fairlie were still to be written and i sat down at once without a moments hesitation to devote myself to them there was no multitude of resources to perplex me there was absolutely no one to depend on in the first instance but myself sir percival had neither friends nor relatives in the neighbourhood whose intercession i could attempt to employ he was on the coldest terms in some cases on the worst terms with the families of his own rank and station who lived near him we two women had neither father nor brother to come to the house and take our parts there was no choice but to write those two doubtful letters or to put laura in the wrong and myself in the wrong and to make all peaceable negotiation in the future impossible by secretly escaping from blackwater park nothing but the most imminent personal peril could justify our taking that second course the letters must be tried first and i wrote them i said nothing to the lawyer about anne catherick because as i had already hinted to laura that topic was connected with a mystery which we could not yet explain and which it would therefore be useless to write about to a professional man i left my correspondent to attribute sir percivals disgraceful conduct if he pleased to fresh disputes about money matters and simply consulted him on the possibility of taking legal proceedings for lauras protection in the event of her husbands refusal to allow her to leave blackwater park for a time and return with me to limmeridge i referred him to mr fairlie for the details of this last arrangement i assured him that i wrote with lauras authority and i ended by entreating him to act in her name to the utmost extent of his power and with the least possible loss of time the letter to mr fairlie occupied me next i appealed to him on the terms which i had mentioned to laura as the most likely to make him bestir himself i enclosed a copy of my letter to the lawyer to show him how serious the case was and i represented our removal to limmeridge as the only compromise which would prevent the danger and distress of lauras present position from inevitably affecting her uncle as well as herself at no very distant time when i had done and had sealed and directed the two envelopes i went back with the letters to lauras room to show her that they were written has anybody disturbed you i asked when she opened the door to me nobody has knocked she replied but i heard some one in the outer room was it a man or a woman a woman i heard the rustling of her gown a rustling like silk yes like silk madame fosco had evidently been watching outside the mischief she might do by herself was little to be feared but the mischief she might do as a willing instrument in her husbands hands was too formidable to be overlooked what became of the rustling of the gown when you no longer heard it in the anteroom i inquired did you hear it go past your wall along the passage yes i kept still and listened and just heard it which way did it go towards your room i considered again the sound had not caught my ears but i was then deeply absorbed in my letters and i write with a heavy hand and a quill pen scraping and scratching noisily over the paper it was more likely that madame fosco would hear the scraping of my pen than that i should hear the rustling of her dress another reason if i had wanted one for not trusting my letters to the postbag in the hall laura saw me thinking more difficulties she said wearily more difficulties and more dangers no dangers i replied some little difficulty perhaps i am thinking of the safest way of putting my two letters into fannys hands you have really written them then oh marian run no risks pray pray run no risks no no no fear let me see what oclock is it now it was a quarter to six there would be time for me to get to the village inn and to come back again before dinner if i waited till the evening i might find no second opportunity of safely leaving the house keep the key turned in the lock laura i said and dont be afraid about me if you hear any inquiries made call through the door and say that i am gone out for a walk when shall you be back before dinner without fail courage my love by this time to morrow you will have a clearheaded trustworthy man acting for your good mr gilmores partner is our next best friend to mr gilmore himself a moments reflection as soon as i was alone convinced me that i had better not appear in my walkingdress until i had first discovered what was going on in the lower part of the house i had not ascertained yet whether sir percival was indoors or out the singing of the canaries in the library and the smell of tobaccosmoke that came through the door which was not closed told me at once where the count was i looked over my shoulder as i passed the doorway and saw to my surprise that he was exhibiting the docility of the birds in his most engagingly polite manner to the housekeeper he must have specially invited her to see them for she would never have thought of going into the library of her own accord the mans slightest actions had a purpose of some kind at the bottom of every one of them what could be his purpose here it was no time then to inquire into his motives i looked about for madame fosco next and found her following her favourite circle round and round the fishpond i was a little doubtful how she would meet me after the outbreak of jealousy of which i had been the cause so short a time since but her husband had tamed her in the interval and she now spoke to me with the same civility as usual my only object in addressing myself to her was to ascertain if she knew what had become of sir percival i contrived to refer to him indirectly and after a little fencing on either side she at last mentioned that he had gone out which of the horses has he taken i asked carelessly none of them she replied he went away two hours since on foot as i understood it his object was to make fresh inquiries about the woman named anne catherick he appears to be unreasonably anxious about tracing her do you happen to know if she is dangerously mad miss halcombe i do not countess are you going in yes i think so i suppose it will soon be time to dress for dinner we entered the house together madame fosco strolled into the library and closed the door i went at once to fetch my hat and shawl every moment was of importance if i was to get to fanny at the inn and be back before dinner when i crossed the hall again no one was there and the singing of the birds in the library had ceased i could not stop to make any fresh investigations i could only assure myself that the way was clear and then leave the house with the two letters safe in my pocket on my way to the village i prepared myself for the possibility of meeting sir percival as long as i had him to deal with alone i felt certain of not losing my presence of mind any woman who is sure of her own wits is a match at any time for a man who is not sure of his own temper i had no such fear of sir percival as i had of the count instead of fluttering it had composed me to hear of the errand on which he had gone out while the tracing of anne catherick was the great anxiety that occupied him laura and i might hope for some cessation of any active persecution at his hands for our sakes now as well as for annes i hoped and prayed fervently that she might still escape him i walked on as briskly as the heat would let me till i reached the crossroad which led to the village looking back from time to time to make sure that i was not followed by any one nothing was behind me all the way but an empty country waggon the noise made by the lumbering wheels annoyed me and when i found that the waggon took the road to the village as well as myself i stopped to let it go by and pass out of hearing as i looked toward it more attentively than before i thought i detected at intervals the feet of a man walking close behind it the carter being in front by the side of his horses the part of the crossroad which i had just passed over was so narrow that the waggon coming after me brushed the trees and thickets on either side and i had to wait until it went by before i could test the correctness of my impression apparently that impression was wrong for when the waggon had passed me the road behind it was quite clear i reached the inn without meeting sir percival and without noticing anything more and was glad to find that the landlady had received fanny with all possible kindness the girl had a little parlour to sit in away from the noise of the taproom and a clean bedchamber at the top of the house she began crying again at the sight of me and said poor soul truly enough that it was dreadful to feel herself turned out into the world as if she had committed some unpardonable fault when no blame could be laid at her door by anybody not even by her master who had sent her away try to make the best of it fanny i said your mistress and i will stand your friends and will take care that your character shall not suffer now listen to me i have very little time to spare and i am going to put a great trust in your hands i wish you to take care of these two letters the one with the stamp on it you are to put into the post when you reach london tomorrow the other directed to mr fairlie you are to deliver to him yourself as soon as you get home keep both the letters about you and give them up to no one they are of the last importance to your mistresss interests fanny put the letters into the bosom of her dress there they shall stop miss she said till i have done what you tell me mind you are at the station in good time tomorrow morning i continued and when you see the housekeeper at limmeridge give her my compliments and say that you are in my service until lady glyde is able to take you back we may meet again sooner than you think so keep a good heart and dont miss the seven oclock train thank you miss thank you kindly it gives one courage to hear your voice again please to offer my duty to my lady and say i left all the things as tidy as i could in the time oh dear dear who will dress her for dinner today it really breaks my heart miss to think of it when i got back to the house i had only a quarter of an hour to spare to put myself in order for dinner and to say two words to laura before i went downstairs the letters are in fannys hands i whispered to her at the door do you mean to join us at dinner oh no no not for the world has anything happened has any one disturbed you yes just now sir percival did he come in no he frightened me by a thump on the door outside i said whos there you know he answered will you alter your mind and tell me the rest you shall sooner or later ill wring it out of you you know where anne catherick is at this moment indeed indeed i said i dont you do he called back ill crush your obstinacy mind that ill wring it out of you he went away with those words went away marian hardly five minutes ago he had not found anne we were safe for that night he had not found her yet you are going downstairs marian come up again in the evening yes yes dont be uneasy if i am a little late i must be careful not to give offence by leaving them too soon the dinnerbell rang and i hastened away sir percival took madame fosco into the diningroom and the count gave me his arm he was hot and flushed and was not dressed with his customary care and completeness had he too been out before dinner and been late in getting back or was he only suffering from the heat a little more severely than usual however this might be he was unquestionably troubled by some secret annoyance or anxiety which with all his powers of deception he was not able entirely to conceal through the whole of dinner he was almost as silent as sir percival himself and he every now and then looked at his wife with an expression of furtive uneasiness which was quite new in my experience of him the one social obligation which he seemed to be selfpossessed enough to perform as carefully as ever was the obligation of being persistently civil and attentive to me what vile object he has in view i cannot still discover but be the design what it may invariable politeness towards myself invariable humility towards laura and invariable suppression at any cost of sir percivals clumsy violence have been the means he has resolutely and impenetrably used to get to his end ever since he set foot in this house i suspected it when he first interfered in our favour on the day when the deed was produced in the library and i feel certain of it now when madame fosco and i rose to leave the table the count rose also to accompany us back to the drawingroom what are you going away for asked sir percival i mean you fosco i am going away because i have had dinner enough and wine enough answered the count be so kind percival as to make allowances for my foreign habit of going out with the ladies as well as coming in with them nonsense another glass of claret wont hurt you sit down again like an englishman i want half an hours quiet talk with you over our wine a quiet talk percival with all my heart but not now and not over the wine later in the evening if you please later in the evening civil said sir percival savagely civil behaviour upon my soul to a man in his own house i had more than once seen him look at the count uneasily during dinnertime and had observed that the count carefully abstained from looking at him in return this circumstance coupled with the hosts anxiety for a little quiet talk over the wine and the guests obstinate resolution not to sit down again at the table revived in my memory the request which sir percival had vainly addressed to his friend earlier in the day to come out of the library and speak to him the count had deferred granting that private interview when it was first asked for in the afternoon and had again deferred granting it when it was a second time asked for at the dinnertable whatever the coming subject of discussion between them might be it was clearly an important subject in sir percivals estimation and perhaps judging from his evident reluctance to approach it a dangerous subject as well in the estimation of the count these considerations occurred to me while we were passing from the diningroom to the drawingroom sir percivals angry commentary on his friends desertion of him had not produced the slightest effect the count obstinately accompanied us to the teatable waited a minute or two in the room went out into the hall and returned with the postbag in his hands it was then eight oclock the hour at which the letters were always despatched from blackwater park have you any letter for the post miss halcombe he asked approaching me with the bag i saw madame fosco who was making the tea pause with the sugar tongs in her hand to listen for my answer no count thank you no letters today he gave the bag to the servant who was then in the room sat down at the piano and played the air of the lively neapolitan street song la mia carolina twice over his wife who was usually the most deliberate of women in all her movements made the tea as quickly as i could have made it myself finished her own cup in two minutes and quietly glided out of the room i rose to follow her example partly because i suspected her of attempting some treachery upstairs with laura partly because i was resolved not to remain alone in the same room with her husband before i could get to the door the count stopped me by a request for a cup of tea i gave him the cup of tea and tried a second time to get away he stopped me again this time by going back to the piano and suddenly appealing to me on a musical question in which he declared that the honour of his country was concerned i vainly pleaded my own total ignorance of music and total want of taste in that direction he only appealed to me again with a vehemence which set all further protest on my part at defiance the english and the germans he indignantly declared were always reviling the italians for their inability to cultivate the higher kinds of music we were perpetually talking of our oratorios and they were perpetually talking of their symphonies did we forget and did they forget his immortal friend and countryman rossini what was moses in egypt but a sublime oratorio which was acted on the stage instead of being coldly sung in a concertroom what was the overture to guillaume tell but a symphony under another name had i heard moses in egypt would i listen to this and this and this and say if anything more sublimely sacred and grand had ever been composed by mortal man and without waiting for a word of assent or dissent on my part looking me hard in the face all the time he began thundering on the piano and singing to it with loud and lofty enthusiasm only interrupting himself at intervals to announce to me fiercely the titles of the different pieces of music chorus of egyptians in the plague of darkness miss halcombe recitativo of moses with the tables of the law prayer of israelites at the passage of the red sea aha aha is that sacred is that sublime the piano trembled under his powerful hands and the teacups on the table rattled as his big bass voice thundered out the notes and his heavy foot beat time on the floor there was something horrible something fierce and devilish in the outburst of his delight at his own singing and playing and in the triumph with which he watched its effect upon me as i shrank nearer and nearer to the door i was released at last not by my own efforts but by sir percivals interposition he opened the diningroom door and called out angrily to know what that infernal noise meant the count instantly got up from the piano ah if percival is coming he said harmony and melody are both at an end the muse of music miss halcombe deserts us in dismay and i the fat old minstrel exhale the rest of my enthusiasm in the open air he stalked out into the verandah put his hands in his pockets and resumed the recitativo of moses sotto voce in the garden i heard sir percival call after him from the diningroom window but he took no notice he seemed determined not to hear that longdeferred quiet talk between them was still to be put off was still to wait for the counts absolute will and pleasure he had detained me in the drawingroom nearly half an hour from the time when his wife left us where had she been and what had she been doing in that interval i went upstairs to ascertain but i made no discoveries and when i questioned laura i found that she had not heard anything nobody had disturbed her no faint rustling of the silk dress had been audible either in the anteroom or in the passage it was then twenty minutes to nine after going to my room to get my journal i returned and sat with laura sometimes writing sometimes stopping to talk with her nobody came near us and nothing happened we remained together till ten oclock i then rose said my last cheering words and wished her goodnight she locked her door again after we had arranged that i should come in and see her the first thing in the morning i had a few sentences more to add to my diary before going to bed myself and as i went down again to the drawingroom after leaving laura for the last time that weary day i resolved merely to show myself there to make my excuses and then to retire an hour earlier than usual for the night sir percival and the count and his wife were sitting together sir percival was yawning in an easychair the count was reading madame fosco was fanning herself strange to say her face was flushed now she who never suffered from the heat was most undoubtedly suffering from it tonight i am afraid countess you are not quite so well as usual i said the very remark i was about to make to you she replied you are looking pale my dear my dear it was the first time she had ever addressed me with that familiarity there was an insolent smile too on her face when she said the words i am suffering from one of my bad headaches i answered coldly ah indeed want of exercise i suppose a walk before dinner would have been just the thing for you she referred to the walk with a strange emphasis had she seen me go out no matter if she had the letters were safe now in fannys hands come and have a smoke fosco said sir percival rising with another uneasy look at his friend with pleasure percival when the ladies have gone to bed replied the count excuse me countess if i set you the example of retiring i said the only remedy for such a headache as mine is going to bed i took my leave there was the same insolent smile on the womans face when i shook hands with her sir percival paid no attention to me he was looking impatiently at madame fosco who showed no signs of leaving the room with me the count smiled to himself behind his book there was yet another delay to that quiet talk with sir percival and the countess was the impediment this time ix june th once safely shut into my own room i opened these pages and prepared to go on with that part of the days record which was still left to write for ten minutes or more i sat idle with the pen in my hand thinking over the events of the last twelve hours when i at last addressed myself to my task i found a difficulty in proceeding with it which i had never experienced before in spite of my efforts to fix my thoughts on the matter in hand they wandered away with the strangest persistency in the one direction of sir percival and the count and all the interest which i tried to concentrate on my journal centred instead in that private interview between them which had been put off all through the day and which was now to take place in the silence and solitude of the night in this perverse state of my mind the recollection of what had passed since the morning would not come back to me and there was no resource but to close my journal and to get away from it for a little while i opened the door which led from my bedroom into my sittingroom and having passed through pulled it to again to prevent any accident in case of draught with the candle left on the dressing table my sittingroom window was wide open and i leaned out listlessly to look at the night it was dark and quiet neither moon nor stars were visible there was a smell like rain in the still heavy air and i put my hand out of window no the rain was only threatening it had not come yet i remained leaning on the windowsill for nearly a quarter of an hour looking out absently into the black darkness and hearing nothing except now and then the voices of the servants or the distant sound of a closing door in the lower part of the house just as i was turning away wearily from the window to go back to the bedroom and make a second attempt to complete the unfinished entry in my journal i smelt the odour of tobaccosmoke stealing towards me on the heavy night air the next moment i saw a tiny red spark advancing from the farther end of the house in the pitch darkness i heard no footsteps and i could see nothing but the spark it travelled along in the night passed the window at which i was standing and stopped opposite my bedroom window inside which i had left the light burning on the dressingtable the spark remained stationary for a moment then moved back again in the direction from which it had advanced as i followed its progress i saw a second red spark larger than the first approaching from the distance the two met together in the darkness remembering who smoked cigarettes and who smoked cigars i inferred immediately that the count had come out first to look and listen under my window and that sir percival had afterwards joined him they must both have been walking on the lawn or i should certainly have heard sir percivals heavy footfall though the counts soft step might have escaped me even on the gravel walk i waited quietly at the window certain that they could neither of them see me in the darkness of the room whats the matter i heard sir percival say in a low voice why dont you come in and sit down i want to see the light out of that window replied the count softly what harm does the light do it shows she is not in bed yet she is sharp enough to suspect something and bold enough to come downstairs and listen if she can get the chance patience percival patience humbug youre always talking of patience i shall talk of something else presently my good friend you are on the edge of your domestic precipice and if i let you give the women one other chance on my sacred word of honour they will push you over it what the devil do you mean we will come to our explanations percival when the light is out of that window and when i have had one little look at the rooms on each side of the library and a peep at the staircase as well they slowly moved away and the rest hemselves restlessly in her lap marian rose when i came in with a silent distress in her face waited for a moment to see if laura would look up at my approach whispered to me try if you can rouse her and left the room i sat down in the vacant chair gently unclasped the poor worn restless fingers and took both her hands in mine what are you thinking of laura tell me my darling try and tell me what it is she struggled with herself and raised her eyes to mine i cant feel happy she said i cant help thinking she stopped bent forward a little and laid her head on my shoulder with a terrible mute helplessness that struck me to the heart try to tell me i repeated gently try to tell me why you are not happy i am so useless i am such a burden on both of you she answered with a weary hopeless sigh you work and get money walter and marian helps you why is there nothing i can do you will end in liking marian better than you like me you will because i am so helpless oh dont dont dont treat me like a child i raised her head and smoothed away the tangled hair that fell over her face and kissed her my poor faded flower my lost afflicted sister you shall help us laura i said you shall begin my darling today she looked at me with a feverish eagerness with a breathless interest that made me tremble for the new life of hope which i had called into being by those few words i rose and set her drawing materials in order and placed them near her again you know that i work and get money by drawing i said now you have taken such pains now you are so much improved you shall begin to work and get money too try to finish this little sketch as nicely and prettily as you can when it is done i will take it away with me and the same person will buy it who buys all that i do you shall keep your own earnings in your own purse and marian shall come to you to help us as often as she comes to me think how useful you are going to make yourself to both of us and you will soon be as happy laura as the day is long her face grew eager and brightened into a smile in the moment while it lasted in the moment when she again took up the pencils that had been laid aside she almost looked like the laura of past days i had rightly interpreted the first signs of a new growth and strength in her mind unconsciously expressing themselves in the notice she had taken of the occupations which filled her sisters life and mine marian when i told her what had passed saw as i saw that she was longing to assume her own little position of importance to raise herself in her own estimation and in ours and from that day we tenderly helped the new ambition which gave promise of the hopeful happier future that might now not be far off her drawings as she finished them or tried to finish them were placed in my hands marian took them from me and hid them carefully and i set aside a little weekly tribute from my earnings to be offered to her as the price paid by strangers for the poor faint valueless sketches of which i was the only purchaser it was hard sometimes to maintain our innocent deception when she proudly brought out her purse to contribute her share towards the expenses and wondered with serious interest whether i or she had earned the most that week i have all those hidden drawings in my possession still they are my treasures beyond price the dear remembrances that i love to keep alive the friends in past adversity that my heart will never part from my tenderness never forget am i trifling here with the necessities of my task am i looking forward to the happier time which my narrative has not yet reached yes back again back to the days of doubt and dread when the spirit within me struggled hard for its life in the icy stillness of perpetual suspense i have paused and rested for a while on my forward course it is not perhaps time wasted if the friends who read these pages have paused and rested too i took the first opportunity i could find of speaking to marian in private and of communicating to her the result of the inquiries which i had made that morning she seemed to share the opinion on the subject of my proposed journey to welmingham which mrs clements had already expressed to me surely walter she said you hardly know enough yet to give you any hope of claiming mrs cathericks confidence is it wise to proceed to these extremities before you have really exhausted all safer and simpler means of attaining your object when you told me that sir percival and the count were the only two people in existence who knew the exact date of lauras journey you forgot and i forgot that there was a third person who must surely know it i mean mrs rubelle would it not be far easier and far less dangerous to insist on a confession from her than to force it from sir percival it might be easier i replied but we are not aware of the full extent of mrs rubelles connivance and interest in the conspiracy and we are therefore not certain that the date has been impressed on her mind as it has been assuredly impressed on the minds of sir percival and the count it is too late now to waste the time on mrs rubelle which may be allimportant to the discovery of the one assailable point in sir percivals life are you thinking a little too seriously marian of the risk i may run in returning to hampshire are you beginning to doubt whether sir percival glyde may not in the end be more than a match for me he will not be more than your match she replied decidedly because he will not be helped in resisting you by the impenetrable wickedness of the count what has led you to that conclusion i replied in some surprise my own knowledge of sir percivals obstinacy and impatience of the counts control she answered i believe he will insist on meeting you singlehanded just as he insisted at first on acting for himself at blackwater park the time for suspecting the counts interference will be the time when you have sir percival at your mercy his own interests will then be directly threatened and he will act walter to terrible purpose in his own defence we may deprive him of his weapons beforehand i said some of the particulars i have heard from mrs clements may yet be turned to account against him and other means of strengthening the case may be at our disposal there are passages in mrs michelsons narrative which show that the count found it necessary to place himself in communication with mr fairlie and there may be circumstances which compromise him in that proceeding while i am away marian write to mr fairlie and say that you want an answer describing exactly what passed between the count and himself and informing you also of any particulars that may have come to his knowledge at the same time in connection with his niece tell him that the statement you request will sooner or later be insisted on if he shows any reluctance to furnish you with it of his own accord the letter shall be written walter but are you really determined to go to welmingham absolutely determined i will devote the next two days to earning what we want for the week to come and on the third day i go to hampshire when the third day came i was ready for my journey as it was possible that i might be absent for some little time i arranged with marian that we were to correspond every day of course addressing each other by assumed names for cautions sake as long as i heard from her regularly i should assume that nothing was wrong but if the morning came and brought me no letter my return to london would take place as a matter of course by the first train i contrived to reconcile laura to my departure by telling her that i was going to the country to find new purchasers for her drawings and for mine and i left her occupied and happy marian followed me downstairs to the street door remember what anxious hearts you leave here she whispered as we stood together in the passage remember all the hopes that hang on your safe return if strange things happen to you on this journey if you and sir percival meet what makes you think we shall meet i asked i dont know i have fears and fancies that i cannot account for laugh at them walter if you like but for gods sake keep your temper if you come in contact with that man never fear marian i answer for my selfcontrol with those words we parted i walked briskly to the station there was a glow of hope in me there was a growing conviction in my mind that my journey this time would not be taken in vain it was a fine clear cold morning my nerves were firmly strung and i felt all the strength of my resolution stirring in me vigorously from head to foot as i crossed the railway platform and looked right and left among the people congregated on it to search for any faces among them that i knew the doubt occurred to me whether it might not have been to my advantage if i had adopted a disguise before setting out for hampshire but there was something so repellent to me in the idea something so meanly like the common herd of spies and informers in the mere act of adopting a disguise that i dismissed the question from consideration almost as soon as it had risen in my mind even as a mere matter of expediency the proceeding was doubtful in the extreme if i tried the experiment at home the landlord of the house would sooner or later discover me and would have his suspicions aroused immediately if i tried it away from home the same persons might see me by the commonest accident with the disguise and without it and i should in that way be inviting the notice and distrust which it was my most pressing interest to avoid in my own character i had acted thus far and in my own character i was resolved to continue to the end the train left me at welmingham early in the afternoon is there any wilderness of sand in the deserts of arabia is there any prospect of desolation among the ruins of palestine which can rival the repelling effect on the eye and the depressing influence on the mind of an english country town in the first stage of its existence and in the transition state of its prosperity i asked myself that question as i passed through the clean desolation the neat ugliness the prim torpor of the streets of welmingham and the tradesmen who stared after me from their lonely shops the trees that drooped helpless in their arid exile of unfinished crescents and squares the dead house carcasses that waited in vain for the vivifying human element to animate them with the breath of life every creature that i saw every object that i passed seemed to answer with one accord the deserts of arabia are innocent of our civilised desolation the ruins of palestine are incapable of our modern gloom i inquired my way to the quarter of the town in which mrs catherick lived and on reaching it found myself in a square of small houses one story high there was a bare little plot of grass in the middle protected by a cheap wire fence an elderly nursemaid and two children were standing in a corner of the enclosure looking at a lean goat tethered to the grass two footpassengers were talking together on one side of the pavement before the houses and an idle little boy was leading an idle little dog along by a string on the other i heard the dull tinkling of a piano at a distance accompanied by the intermittent knocking of a hammer nearer at hand these were all the sights and sounds of life that encountered me when i entered the square i walked at once to the door of number thirteen the number of mrs cathericks house and knocked without waiting to consider beforehand how i might best present myself when i got in the first necessity was to see mrs catherick i could then judge from my own observation of the safest and easiest manner of approaching the object of my visit the door was opened by a melancholy middleaged woman servant i gave her my card and asked if i could see mrs catherick the card was taken into the front parlour and the servant returned with a message requesting me to mention what my business was say if you please that my business relates to mrs cathericks daughter i replied this was the best pretext i could think of on the spur of the moment to account for my visit the servant again retired to the parlour again returned and this time begged me with a look of gloomy amazement to walk in i entered a little room with a flaring paper of the largest pattern on the walls chairs tables cheffonier and sofa all gleamed with the glutinous brightness of cheap upholstery on the largest table in the middle of the room stood a smart bible placed exactly in the centre on a red and yellow woollen mat and at the side of the table nearest to the window with a little knittingbasket on her lap and a wheezing bleareyed old spaniel crouched at her feet there sat an elderly woman wearing a black net cap and a black silk gown and having slatecoloured mittens on her hands her irongrey hair hung in heavy bands on either side of her face her dark eyes looked straight forward with a hard defiant implacable stare she had full square cheeks a long firm chin and thick sensual colourless lips her figure was stout and sturdy and her manner aggressively selfpossessed this was mrs catherick you have come to speak to me about my daughter she said before i could utter a word on my side be so good as to mention what you have to say the tone of her voice was as hard as defiant as implacable as the expression of her eyes she pointed to a chair and looked me all over attentively from head to foot as i sat down in it i saw that my only chance with this woman was to speak to her in her own tone and to meet her at the outset of our interview on her own ground you are aware i said that your daughter has been lost i am perfectly aware of it have you felt any apprehension that the misfortune of her loss might be followed by the misfortune of her death yes have you come here to tell me she is dead i have why she put that extraordinary question without the slightest change in her voice her face or her manner she could not have appeared more perfectly unconcerned if i had told her of the death of the goat in the enclosure outside why i repeated do you ask why i come here to tell you of your daughters death yes what interest have you in me or in her how do you come to know anything about my daughter in this way i met her on the night when she escaped from the asylum and i assisted her in reaching a place of safety you did very wrong i am sorry to hear her mother say so her mother does say so how do you know she is dead i am not at liberty to say how i know it but i do know it are you at liberty to say how you found out my address certainly i got your address from mrs clements mrs clements is a foolish woman did she tell you to come here she did not then i ask you again why did you come as she was determined to have her answer i gave it to her in the plainest possible form i came i said because i thought anne cathericks mother might have some natural interest in knowing whether she was alive or dead just so said mrs catherick with additional selfpossession had you no other motive i hesitated the right answer to that question was not easy to find at a moments notice if you have no other motive she went on deliberately taking off her slatecoloured mittens and rolling them up i have only to thank you for your visit and to say that i will not detain you here any longer your information would be more satisfactory if you were willing to explain how you became possessed of it however it justifies me i suppose in going into mourning there is not much alteration necessary in my dress as you see when i have changed my mittens i shall be all in black she searched in the pocket of her gown drew out a pair of black lace mittens put them on with the stoniest and steadiest composure and then quietly crossed her hands in her lap i wish you good morning she said the cool contempt of her manner irritated me into directly avowing that the purpose of my visit had not been answered yet i have another motive in coming here i said ah i thought so remarked mrs catherick your daughters death what did she die of of disease of the heart yes go on your daughters death has been made the pretext for inflicting serious injury on a person who is very dear to me two men have been concerned to my certain knowledge in doing that wrong one of them is sir percival glyde indeed i looked attentively to see if she flinched at the sudden mention of that name not a muscle of her stirred the hard defiant implacable stare in her eyes never wavered for an instant you may wonder i went on how the event of your daughters death can have been made the means of inflicting injury on another person no said mrs catherick i dont wonder at all this appears to be your affair you are interested in my affairs i am not interested in yours you may ask then i persisted why i mention the matter in your presence yes i do ask that i mention it because i am determined to bring sir percival glyde to account for the wickedness he has committed what have i to do with your determination you shall hear there are certain events in sir percivals past life which it is necessary for my purpose to be fully acquainted with you know them and for that reason i come to you what events do you mean events that occurred at old welmingham when your husband was parishclerk at that place and before the time when your daughter was born i had reached the woman at last through the barrier of impenetrable reserve that she had tried to set up between us i saw her temper smouldering in her eyes as plainly as i saw her hands grow restless then unclasp themselves and begin mechanically smoothing her dress over her knees what do you know of those events she asked all that mrs clements could tell me i answered there was a momentary flush on her firm square face a momentary stillness in her restless hands which seemed to betoken a coming outburst of anger that might throw her off her guard but no she mastered the rising irritation leaned back in her chair crossed her arms on her broad bosom and with a smile of grim sarcasm on her thick lips looked at me as steadily as ever ah i begin to understand it all now she said her tamed and disciplined anger only expressing itself in the elaborate mockery of her tone and manner you have got a grudge of your own against sir percival glyde and i must help you to wreak it i must tell you this that and the other about sir percival and myself must i yes indeed you have been prying into my private affairs you think you have found a lost woman to deal with who lives here on sufferance and who will do anything you ask for fear you may injure her in the opinions of the townspeople i see through you and your precious speculation i do and it amuses me ha ha she stopped for a moment her arms tightened over her bosom and she laughed to herself a hard harsh angry laugh you dont know how i have lived in this place and what i have done in this place mr whatsyourname she went on ill tell you before i ring the bell and have you shown out i came here a wronged woman i came here robbed of my character and determined to claim it back ive been years and years about it and i have claimed it back i have matched the respectable people fairly and openly on their own ground if they say anything against me now they must say it in secret they cant say it they darent say it openly i stand high enough in this town to be out of your reach the clergyman bows to me aha you didnt bargain for that when you came here go to the church and inquire about me you will find mrs catherick has her sitting like the rest of them and pays the rent on the day its due go to the townhall theres a petition lying there a petition of the respectable inhabitants against allowing a circus to come and perform here and corrupt our morals yes our morals i signed that petition this morning go to the booksellers shop the clergymans wednesday evening lectures on justification by faith are publishing there by subscription im down on the list the doctors wife only put a shilling in the plate at our last charity sermon i put halfacrown mr churchwarden soward held the plate and bowed to me ten years ago he told pigrum the chemist i ought to be whipped out of the town at the carts tail is your mother alive has she got a better bible on her table than i have got on mine does she stand better with her tradespeople than i do with mine has she always lived within her income i have always lived within mine ah there is the clergyman coming along the square look mr whatsyourname look if you please she started up with the activity of a young woman went to the window waited till the clergyman passed and bowed to him solemnly the clergyman ceremoniously raised his hat and walked on mrs catherick returned to her chair and looked at me with a grimmer sarcasm than ever there she said what do you think of that for a woman with a lost character how does your speculation look now the singular manner in which she had chosen to assert herself the extraordinary practical vindication of her position in the town which she had just offered had so perplexed me that i listened to her in silent surprise i was not the less resolved however to make another effort to throw her off her guard if the womans fierce temper once got beyond her control and once flamed out on me she might yet say the words which would put the clue in my hands how does your speculation look now she repeated exactly as it looked when i first came in i answered i dont doubt the position you have gained in the town and i dont wish to assail it even if i could i came here because sir percival glyde is to my certain knowledge your enemy as well as mine if i have a grudge against him you have a grudge against him too you may deny it if you like you may distrust me as much as you please you may be as angry as you will but of all the women in england you if you have any sense of injury are the woman who ought to help me to crush that man crush him for yourself she said then come back here and see what i say to you she spoke those words as she had not spoken yet quickly fiercely vindictively i had stirred in its lair the serpent hatred of years but only for a moment like a lurking reptile it leaped up at me as she eagerly bent forward towards the place in which i was sitting like a lurking reptile it dropped out of sight again as she instantly resumed her former position in the chair you wont trust me i said no you are afraid do i look as if i was you are afraid of sir percival glyde am i her colour was rising and her hands were at work again smoothing her gown i pressed the point farther and farther home i went on without allowing her a moment of delay sir percival has a high position in the world i said it would be no wonder if you were afraid of him sir percival is a powerful man a baronet the possessor of a fine estate the descendant of a great family she amazed me beyond expression by suddenly bursting out laughing yes she repeated in tones of the bitterest steadiest contempt a baronet the possessor of a fine estate the descendant of a great family yes indeed a great family especially by the mothers side there was no time to reflect on the words that had just escaped her there was only time to feel that they were well worth thinking over the moment i left the house i am not here to dispute with you about family questions i said i know nothing of sir percivals mother and you know as little of sir percival himself she interposed sharply i advise you not to be too sure of that i rejoined i know some things about him and i suspect many more what do you suspect ill tell you what i dont suspect i dont suspect him of being annes father she started to her feet and came close up to me with a look of fury how dare you talk to me about annes father how dare you say who was her father or who wasnt she broke out her face quivering her voice trembling with passion the secret between you and sir percival is not that secret i persisted the mystery which darkens sir percivals life was not born with your daughters birth and has not died with your daughters death she drew back a step go she said and pointed sternly to the door there was no thought of the child in your heart or in his i went on determined to press her back to her last defences there was no bond of guilty love between you and him when you held those stolen meetings when your husband found you whispering together under the vestry of the church her pointing hand instantly dropped to her side and the deep flush of anger faded from her face while i spoke i saw the change pass over her i saw that hard firm fearless self possessed woman quail under a terror which her utmost resolution was not strong enough to resist when i said those five last words the vestry of the church for a minute or more we stood looking at each other in silence i spoke first do you still refuse to trust me i asked she could not call the colour that had left it back to her face but she had steadied her voice she had recovered the defiant selfpossession of her manner when she answered me i do refuse she said do you still tell me to go yes go and never come back i walked to the door waited a moment before i opened it and turned round to look at her again i may have news to bring you of sir percival which you dont expect i said and in that case i shall come back there is no news of sir percival that i dont expect except she stopped her pale face darkened and she stole back with a quiet stealthy catlike step to her chair except the news of his death she said sitting down again with the mockery of a smile just hovering on her cruel lips and the furtive light of hatred lurking deep in her steady eyes as i opened the door of the room to go out she looked round at me quickly the cruel smile slowly widened her lips she eyed me with a strange stealthy interest from head to foot an unutterable expectation showed itself wickedly all over her face was she speculating in the secrecy of her own heart on my youth and strength on the force of my sense of injury and the limits of my selfcontrol and was she considering the lengths to which they might carry me if sir percival and i ever chanced to meet the bare doubt that it might be so drove me from her presence and silenced even the common forms of farewell on my lips without a word more on my side or on hers i left the room as i opened the outer door i saw the same clergyman who had already passed the house once about to pass it again on his way back through the square i waited on the doorstep to let him go by and looked round as i did so at the parlour window mrs catherick had heard his footsteps approaching in the silence of that lonely place and she was on her feet at the window again waiting for him not all the strength of all the terrible passions i had roused in that womans heart could loosen her desperate hold on the one fragment of social consideration which years of resolute effort had just dragged within her grasp there she was again not a minute after i had left her placed purposely in a position which made it a matter of common courtesy on the part of the clergyman to bow to her for a second time he raised his hat once more i saw the hard ghastly face behind the window soften and light up with gratified pride i saw the head with the grim black cap bend ceremoniously in return the clergyman had bowed to her and in my presence twice in one day ix i left the house feeling that mrs catherick had helped me a step forward in spite of herself before i had reached the turning which led out of the square my attention was suddenly aroused by the sound of a closing door behind me i looked round and saw an undersized man in black on the door step of a house which as well as i could judge stood next to mrs cathericks place of abode next to it on the side nearest to me the man did not hesitate a moment about the direction he should take he advanced rapidly towards the turning at which i had stopped i recognised him as the lawyers clerk who had preceded me in my visit to blackwater park and who had tried to pick a quarrel with me when i asked him if i could see the house i waited where i was to ascertain whether his object was to come to close quarters and speak on this occasion to my surprise he passed on rapidly without saying a word without even looking up in my face as he went by this was such a complete inversion of the course of proceeding which i had every reason to expect on his part that my curiosity or rather my suspicion was aroused and i determined on my side to keep him cautiously in view and to discover what the business might be in which he was now employed without caring whether he saw me or not i walked after him he never looked back and he led me straight through the streets to the railway station the train was on the point of starting and two or three passengers who were late were clustering round the small opening through which the tickets were issued i joined them and distinctly heard the lawyers clerk demand a ticket for the blackwater station i satisfied myself that he had actually left by the train before i came away there was only one interpretation that i could place on what i had just seen and heard i had unquestionably observed the man leaving a house which closely adjoined mrs cathericks residence he had been probably placed there by sir percivals directions as a lodger in anticipation of my inquiries leading me sooner or later to communicate with mrs catherick he had doubtless seen me go in and come out and he had hurried away by the first train to make his report at blackwater park to which place sir percival would naturally betake himself knowing what he evidently knew of my movements in order to be ready on the spot if i returned to hampshire before many days were over there seemed every likelihood now that he and i might meet whatever result events might be destined to produce i resolved to pursue my own course straight to the end in view without stopping or turning aside for sir percival or for any one the great responsibility which weighed on me heavily in london the responsibility of so guiding my slightest actions as to prevent them from leading accidentally to the discovery of lauras place of refuge was removed now that i was in hampshire i could go and come as i pleased at welmingham and if i chanced to fail in observing any necessary precautions the immediate results at least would affect no one but myself when i left the station the winter evening was beginning to close in there was little hope of continuing my inquiries after dark to any useful purpose in a neighbourhood that was strange to me accordingly i made my way to the nearest hotel and ordered my dinner and my bed this done i wrote to marian to tell her that i was safe and well and that i had fair prospects of success i had directed her on leaving home to address the first letter she wrote to me the letter i expected to receive the next morning to the postoffice welmingham and i now begged her to send her second days letter to the same address i could easily receive it by writing to the postmaster if i happened to be away from the town when it arrived the coffeeroom of the hotel as it grew late in the evening became a perfect solitude i was left to reflect on what i had accomplished that afternoon as uninterruptedly as if the house had been my own before i retired to rest i had attentively thought over my extraordinary interview with mrs catherick from beginning to end and had verified at my leisure the conclusions which i had hastily drawn in the earlier part of the day the vestry of old welmingham church was the startingpoint from which my mind slowly worked its way back through all that i had heard mrs catherick say and through all i had seen mrs catherick do at the time when the neighbourhood of the vestry was first referred to in my presence by mrs clements i had thought it the strangest and most unaccountable of all places for sir percival to select for a clandestine meeting with the clerks wife influenced by this impression and by no other i had mentioned the vestry of the church before mrs catherick on pure speculation it represented one of the minor peculiarities of the story which occurred to me while i was speaking i was prepared for her answering me confusedly or angrily but the blank terror that seized her when i said the words took me completely by surprise i had long before associated sir percivals secret with the concealment of a serious crime which mrs catherick knew of but i had gone no further than this now the womans paroxysm of terror associated the crime either directly or indirectly with the vestry and convinced me that she had been more than the mere witness of it she was also the accomplice beyond a doubt what had been the nature of the crime surely there was a contemptible side to it as well as a dangerous side or mrs catherick would not have repeated my own words referring to sir percivals rank and power with such marked disdain as she had certainly displayed it was a contemptible crime then and a dangerous crime and she had shared in it and it was associated with the vestry of the church the next consideration to be disposed of led me a step farther from this point mrs cathericks undisguised contempt for sir percival plainly extended to his mother as well she had referred with the bitterest sarcasm to the great family he had descended from especially by the mothers side what did this mean there appeared to be only two explanations of it either his mothers birth had been low or his mothers reputation was damaged by some hidden flaw with which mrs catherick and sir percival were both privately acquainted i could only put the first explanation to the test by looking at the register of her marriage and so ascertaining her maiden name and her parentage as a preliminary to further inquiries on the other hand if the second case supposed were the true one what had been the flaw in her reputation remembering the account which marian had given me of sir percivals father and mother and of the suspiciously unsocial secluded life they had both led i now asked myself whether it might not be possible that his mother had never been married at all here again the register might by offering written evidence of the marriage prove to me at any rate that this doubt had no foundation in truth but where was the register to be found at this point i took up the conclusions which i had previously formed and the same mental process which had discovered the locality of the concealed crime now lodged the register also in the vestry of old welmingham church these were the results of my interview with mrs catherick these were the various considerations all steadily converging to one point which decided the course of my proceedings on the next day the morning was cloudy and lowering but no rain fell i left my bag at the hotel to wait there till i called for it and after inquiring the way set forth on foot for old welmingham church it was a walk of rather more than two miles the ground rising slowly all the way on the highest point stood the church an ancient weatherbeaten building with heavy buttresses at its sides and a clumsy square tower in front the vestry at the back was built out from the church and seemed to be of the same age round the building at intervals appeared the remains of the village which mrs clements had described to me as her husbands place of abode in former years and which the principal inhabitants had long since deserted for the new town some of the empty houses had been dismantled to their outer walls some had been left to decay with time and some were still inhabited by persons evidently of the poorest class it was a dreary scene and yet in the worst aspect of its ruin not so dreary as the modern town that i had just left here there was the brown breezy sweep of surrounding fields for the eye to repose on here the trees leafless as they were still varied the monotony of the prospect and helped the mind to look forward to summertime and shade as i moved away from the back of the church and passed some of the dismantled cottages in search of a person who might direct me to the clerk i saw two men saunter out after me from behind a wall the tallest of the two a stout muscular man in the dress of a gamekeeper was a stranger to me the other was one of the men who had followed me in london on the day when i left mr kyrles office i had taken particular notice of him at the time and i felt sure that i was not mistaken in identifying the fellow on this occasion neither he nor his companion attempted to speak to me and both kept themselves at a respectful distance but the motive of their presence in the neighbourhood of the church was plainly apparent it was exactly as i had supposed sir percival was already prepared for me my visit to mrs catherick had been reported to him the evening before and those two men had been placed on the lookout near the church in anticipation of my appearance at old welmingham if i had wanted any further proof that my investigations had taken the right direction at last the plan now adopted for watching me would have supplied it i walked on away from the church till i reached one of the inhabited houses with a patch of kitchen garden attached to it on which a labourer was at work he directed me to the clerks abode a cottage at some little distance off standing by itself on the outskirts of the forsaken village the clerk was indoors and was just putting on his greatcoat he was a cheerful familiar loudlytalkative old man with a very poor opinion as i soon discovered of the place in which he lived and a happy sense of superiority to his neighbours in virtue of the great personal distinction of having once been in london its well you came so early sir said the old man when i had mentioned the object of my visit i should have been away in ten minutes more parish business sir and a goodish long trot before its all done for a man at my age but bless you im strong on my legs still as long as a man dont give at his legs theres a deal of work left in him dont you think so yourself sir he took his keys down while he was talking from a hook behind the fireplace and locked his cottage door behind us nobody at home to keep house for me said the clerk with a cheerful sense of perfect freedom from all family encumbrances my wifes in the churchyard there and my children are all married a wretched place this isnt it sir but the parish is a large one every man couldnt get through the business as i do its learning does it and ive had my share and a little more i can talk the queens english god bless the queen and thats more than most of the people about here can do youre from london i suppose sir ive been in london a matter of fiveand twenty year ago whats the news there now if you please chattering on in this way he led me back to the vestry i looked about to see if the two spies were still in sight they were not visible anywhere after having discovered my application to the clerk they had probably concealed themselves where they could watch my next proceedings in perfect freedom the vestry door was of stout old oak studded with strong nails and the clerk put his large heavy key into the lock with the air of a man who knew that he had a difficulty to encounter and who was not quite certain of creditably conquering it im obliged to bring you this way sir he said because the door from the vestry to the church is bolted on the vestry side we might have got in through the church otherwise this is a perverse lock if ever there was one yet its big enough for a prisondoor its been hampered over and over again and it ought to be changed for a new one ive mentioned that to the churchwarden fifty times over at least hes always saying ill see about it and he never does see ah its a sort of lost corner this place not like london is it sir bless you we are all asleep here we dont march with the times after some twisting and turning of the key the heavy lock yielded and he opened the door the vestry was larger than i should have supposed it to be judging from the outside only it was a dim mouldy melancholy old room with a low raftered ceiling round two sides of it the sides nearest to the interior of the church ran heavy wooden presses wormeaten and gaping with age hooked to the inner corner of one of these presses hung several surplices all bulging out at their lower ends in an irreverentlooking bundle of limp drapery below the surplices on the floor stood three packing cases with the lids half off half on and the straw profusely bursting out of their cracks and crevices in every direction behind them in a corner was a litter of dusty papers some large and rolled up like architects plans some loosely strung together on files like bills or letters the room had once been lighted by a small side window but this had been bricked up and a lantern skylight was now substituted for it the atmosphere of the place was heavy and mouldy being rendered additionally oppressive by the closing of the door which led into the church this door also was composed of solid oak and was bolted at the top and bottom on the vestry side we might be tidier mightnt we sir said the cheerful clerk but when youre in a lost corner of a place like this what are you to do why look here now just look at these packingcases there theyve been for a year or more ready to go down to london there they are littering the place and there theyll stop as long as the nails hold them together ill tell you what sir as i said before this is not london we are all asleep here bless you we dont march with the times what is there in the packingcases i asked bits of old wood carvings from the pulpit and panels from the chancel and images from the organloft said the clerk portraits of the twelve apostles in wood and not a whole nose among em all broken and wormeaten and crumbling to dust at the edges as brittle as crockery sir and as old as the church if not older and why were they going to london to be repaired thats it sir to be repaired and where they were past repair to be copied in sound wood but bless you the money fell short and there they are waiting for new subscriptions and nobody to subscribe it was all done a year ago sir six gentlemen dined together about it at the hotel in the new town they made speeches and passed resolutions and put their names down and printed off thousands of prospectuses beautiful prospectuses sir all flourished over with gothic devices in red ink saying it was a disgrace not to restore the church and repair the famous carvings and so on there are the prospectuses that couldnt be distributed and the architects plans and estimates and the whole correspondence which set everybody at loggerheads and ended in a dispute all down together in that corner behind the packingcases the money dribbled in a little at first but what can you expect out of london there was just enough you know to pack the broken carvings and get the estimates and pay the printers bill and after that there wasnt a halfpenny left there the things are as i said before we have nowhere else to put them nobody in the new town cares about accommodating us were in a lost corner and this is an untidy vestry and whos to help it thats what i want to know my anxiety to examine the register did not dispose me to offer much encouragement to the old mans talkativeness i agreed with him that nobody could help the untidiness of the vestry and then suggested that we should proceed to our business without more delay ay ay the marriageregister to be sure said the clerk taking a little bunch of keys from his pocket how far do you want to look back sir marian had informed me of sir percivals age at the time when we had spoken together of his marriage engagement with laura she had then described him as being fortyfive years old calculating back from this and making due allowance for the year that had passed since i had gained my information i found that he must have been born in eighteen hundred and four and that i might safely start on my search through the register from that date i want to begin with the year eighteen hundred and four i said which way after that sir asked the clerk forwards to our time or backwards away from us backwards from eighteen hundred and four he opened the door of one of the presses the press from the side of which the surplices were hanging and produced a large volume bound in greasy brown leather i was struck by the insecurity of the place in which the register was kept the door of the press was warped and cracked with age and the lock was of the smallest and commonest kind i could have forced it easily with the walkingstick i carried in my hand is that considered a sufficiently secure place for the register i inquired surely a book of such importance as this ought to be protected by a better lock and kept carefully in an iron safe well now thats curious said the clerk shutting up the book again just after he had opened it and smacking his hand cheerfully on the cover those were the very words my old master was always saying years and years ago when i was a lad why isnt the register meaning this register here under my hand why isnt it kept in an iron safe if ive heard him say that once ive heard him say it a hundred times he was the solicitor in those days sir who had the appointment of vestryclerk to this church a fine hearty old gentleman and the most particular man breathing as long as he lived he kept a copy of this book in his office at knowlesbury and had it posted up regular from time to time to correspond with the fresh entries here you would hardly think it but he had his own appointed days once or twice in every quarter for riding over to this church on his old white pony to check the copy by the register with his own eyes and hands how do i know he used to say how do i know that the register in this vestry may not be stolen or destroyed why isnt it kept in an iron safe why cant i make other people as careful as i am myself some of these days there will be an accident happen and when the registers lost then the parish will find out the value of my copy he used to take his pinch of snuff after that and look about him as bold as a lord ah the like of him for doing business isnt easy to find now you may go to london and not match him even there which year did you say sir eighteen hundred and what eighteen hundred and four i replied mentally resolving to give the old man no more opportunities of talking until my examination of the register was over the clerk put on his spectacles and turned over the leaves of the register carefully wetting his finger and thumb at every third page there it is sir said he with another cheerful smack on the open volume theres the year you want as i was ignorant of the month in which sir percival was born i began my backward search with the early part of the year the registerbook was of the oldfashioned kind the entries being all made on blank pages in manuscript and the divisions which separated them being indicated by ink lines drawn across the page at the close of each entry i reached the beginning of the year eighteen hundred and four without encountering the marriage and then travelled back through december eighteen hundred and three through november and october through no not through september also under the heading of that month in the year i found the marriage i looked carefully at the entry it was at the bottom of a page and was for want of room compressed into a smaller space than that occupied by the marriages above the marriage immediately before it was impressed on my attention by the circumstance of the bridegrooms christian name being the same as my own the entry immediately following it on the top of the next page was noticeable in another way from the large space it occupied the record in this case registering the marriages of two brothers at the same time the register of the marriage of sir felix glyde was in no respect remarkable except for the narrowness of the space into which it was compressed at the bottom of the page the information about his wife was the usual information given in such cases she was described as cecilia jane elster of parkview cottages knowlesbury only daughter of the late patrick elster esq formerly of bath i noted down these particulars in my pocketbook feeling as i did so both doubtful and disheartened about my next proceedings the secret which i had believed until this moment to be within my grasp seemed now farther from my reach than ever what suggestions of any mystery unexplained had arisen out of my visit to the vestry i saw no suggestions anywhere what progress had i made towards discovering the suspected stain on the reputation of sir percivals mother the one fact i had ascertained vindicated her reputation fresh doubts fresh difficulties fresh delays began to open before me in interminable prospect what was i to do next the one immediate resource left to me appeared to be this i might institute inquiries about miss elster of knowlesbury on the chance of advancing towards the main object of my investigation by first discovering the secret of mrs cathericks contempt for sir percivals mother have you found what you wanted sir said the clerk as i closed the registerbook yes i replied but i have some inquiries still to make i suppose the clergyman who officiated here in the year eighteen hundred and three is no longer alive no no sir he was dead three or four years before i came here and that was as long ago as the year twentyseven i got this place sir persisted my talkative old friend through the clerk before me leaving it they say he was driven out of house and home by his wife and shes living still down in the new town there i dont know the rights of the story myself all i know is i got the place mr wansborough got it for me the son of my old master that i was tell you of hes a free pleasant gentleman as ever lived rides to the hounds keeps his pointers and all that hes vestryclerk here now as his father was before him did you not tell me your former master lived at knowlesbury i asked calling to mind the long story about the precise gentleman of the old school with which my talkative friend had wearied me before he opened the registerbook yes to be sure sir replied the clerk old mr wansborough lived at knowlesbury and young mr wansborough lives there too you said just now he was vestryclerk like his father before him i am not quite sure that i know what a vestryclerk is dont you indeed sir and you come from london too every parish church you know has a vestryclerk and a parishclerk the parishclerk is a man like me except that ive got a deal more learning than most of them though i dont boast of it the vestryclerk is a sort of an appointment that the lawyers get and if theres any business to be done for the vestry why there they are to do it its just the same in london every parish church there has got its vestryclerk and you may take my word for it hes sure to be a lawyer then young mr wansborough is a lawyer i suppose of course he is sir a lawyer in high street knowlesbury the old offices that his father had before him the number of times ive swept those offices out and seen the old gentleman come trotting in to business on his white pony looking right and left all down the street and nodding to everybody bless you he was a popular character hed have done in london how far is it to knowlesbury from this place a long stretch sir said the clerk with that exaggerated idea of distances and that vivid perception of difficulties in getting from place to place which is peculiar to all country people nigh on five mile i can tell you it was still early in the forenoon there was plenty of time for a walk to knowlesbury and back again to welmingham and there was no person probably in the town who was fitter to assist my inquiries about the character and position of sir percivals mother before her marriage than the local solicitor resolving to go at once to knowlesbury on foot i led the way out of the vestry thank you kindly sir said the clerk as i slipped my little present into his hand are you really going to walk all the way to knowlesbury and back well youre strong on your legs too and what a blessing that is isnt it theres the road you cant miss it i wish i was going your way its pleasant to meet with gentlemen from london in a lost corner like this one hears the news wish you goodmorning sir and thank you kindly once more we parted as i left the church behind me i looked back and there were the two men again on the road below with a third in their company that third person being the short man in black whom i had traced to the railway the evening before the three stood talking together for a little while then separated the man in black went away by himself towards welmingham the other two remained together evidently waiting to follow me as soon as i walked on i proceeded on my way without letting the fellows see that i took any special notice of them they caused me no conscious irritation of feeling at that moment on the contrary they rather revived my sinking hopes in the surprise of discovering the evidence of the marriage i had forgotten the inference i had drawn on first perceiving the men in the neighbourhood of the vestry their reappearance reminded me that sir percival had anticipated my visit to old welmingham church as the next result of my interview with mrs catherick otherwise he would never have placed his spies there to wait for me smoothly and fairly as appearances looked in the vestry there was something wrong beneath them there was something in the registerbook for aught i knew that i had not discovered yet x once out of sight of the church i pressed forward briskly on my way to knowlesbury the road was for the most part straight and level whenever i looked back over it i saw the two spies steadily following me for the greater part of the way they kept at a safe distance behind but once or twice they quickened their pace as if with the purpose of overtaking me then stopped consulted together and fell back again to their former position they had some special object evidently in view and they seemed to be hesitating or differing about the best means of accomplishing it i could not guess exactly what their design might be but i felt serious doubts of reaching knowlesbury without some mischance happening to me on the way these doubts were realised i had just entered on a lonely part of the road with a sharp turn at some distance ahead and had just concluded calculating by time that i must be getting near to the town when i suddenly heard the steps of the men close behind me before i could look round one of them the man by whom i had been followed in london passed rapidly on my left side and hustled me with his shoulder i had been more irritated by the manner in which he and his companion had dogged my steps all the way from old welmingham than i was myself aware of and i unfortunately pushed the fellow away smartly with my open hand he instantly shouted for help his companion the tall man in the gamekeepers clothes sprang to my right side and the next moment the two scoundrels held me pinioned between them in the middle of the road the conviction that a trap had been laid for me and the vexation of knowing that i had fallen into it fortunately restrained me from making my position still worse by an unavailing struggle with two men one of whom would in all probability have been more than a match for me singlehanded i repressed the first natural movement by which i had attempted to shake them off and looked about to see if there was any person near to whom i could appeal a labourer was at work in an adjoining field who must have witnessed all that had passed i called to him to follow us to the town he shook his head with stolid obstinacy and walked away in the direction of a cottage which stood back from the high road at the same time the men who held me between them declared their intention of charging me with an assault i was cool enough and wise enough now to make no opposition drop your hold of my arms i said and i will go with you to the town the man in the gamekeepers dress roughly refused but the shorter man was sharp enough to look to consequences and not to let his companion commit himself by unnecessary violence he made a sign to the other and i walked on between them with my arms free we reached the turning in the road and there close before us were the suburbs of knowlesbury one of the local policemen was walking along the path by the roadside the men at once appealed to him he replied that the magistrate was then sitting at the townhall and recommended that we should appear before him immediately we went on to the townhall the clerk made out a formal summons and the charge was preferred against me with the customary exaggeration and the customary perversion of the truth on such occasions the magistrate an illtempered man with a sour enjoyment in the exercise of his own power inquired if any one on or near the road had witnessed the assault and greatly to my surprise the complainant admitted the presence of the labourer in the field i was enlightened however as to the object of the admission by the magistrates next words he remanded me at once for the production of the witness expressing at the same time his willingness to take bail for my reappearance if i could produce one responsible surety to offer it if i had been known in the town he would have liberated me on my own recognisances but as i was a total stranger it was necessary that i should find responsible bail the whole object of the stratagem was now disclosed to me it had been so managed as to make a remand necessary in a town where i was a perfect stranger and where i could not hope to get my liberty on bail the remand merely extended over three days until the next sitting of the magistrate but in that time while i was in confinement sir percival might use any means he pleased to embarrass my future proceedings perhaps to screen himself from detection altogether without the slightest fear of any hindrance on my part at the end of the three days the charge would no doubt be withdrawn and the attendance of the witness would be perfectly useless my indignation i may almost say my despair at this mischievous check to all further progress so base and trifling in itself and yet so disheartening and so serious in its probable results quite unfitted me at first to reflect on the best means of extricating myself from the dilemma in which i now stood i had the folly to call for writing materials and to think of privately communicating my real position to the magistrate the hopelessness and the imprudence of this proceeding failed to strike me before i had actually written the opening lines of the letter it was not till i had pushed the paper away not till i am ashamed to say i had almost allowed the vexation of my helpless position to conquer me that a course of action suddenly occurred to my mind which sir percival had probably not anticipated and which might set me free again in a few hours i determined to communicate the situation in which i was placed to mr dawson of oak lodge i had visited this gentlemans house it may be remembered at the time of my first inquiries in the blackwater park neighbourhood and i had presented to him a letter of introduction from miss halcombe in which she recommended me to his friendly attention in the strongest terms i now wrote referring to this letter and to what i had previously told mr dawson of the delicate and dangerous nature of my inquiries i had not revealed to him the truth about laura having merely described my errand as being of the utmost importance to private family interests with which miss halcombe was concerned using the same caution still i now accounted for my presence at knowlesbury in the same manner and i put it to the doctor to say whether the trust reposed in me by a lady whom he well knew and the hospitality i had myself received in his house justified me or not in asking him to come to my assistance in a place where i was quite friendless i obtained permission to hire a messenger to drive away at once with my letter in a conveyance which might be used to bring the doctor back immediately oak lodge was on the knowlesbury side of blackwater the man declared he could drive there in forty minutes and could bring mr dawson back in forty more i directed him to follow the doctor wherever he might happen to be if he was not at home and then sat down to wait for the result with all the patience and all the hope that i could summon to help me it was not quite halfpast one when the messenger departed before halfpast three he returned and brought the doctor with him mr dawsons kindness and the delicacy with which he treated his prompt assistance quite as a matter of course almost overpowered me the bail required was offered and accepted immediately before four oclock on that afternoon i was shaking hands warmly with the good old doctor a free man again in the streets of knowlesbury mr dawson hospitably invited me to go back with him to oak lodge and take up my quarters there for the night i could only reply that my time was not my own and i could only ask him to let me pay my visit in a few days when i might repeat my thanks and offer to him all the explanations which i felt to be only his due but which i was not then in a position to make we parted with friendly assurances on both sides and i turned my steps at once to mr wansboroughs office in the high street time was now of the last importance the news of my being free on bail would reach sir percival to an absolute certainty before night if the next few hours did not put me in a position to justify his worst fears and to hold him helpless at my mercy i might lose every inch of the ground i had gained never to recover it again the unscrupulous nature of the man the local influence he possessed the desperate peril of exposure with which my blindfold inquiries threatened him all warned me to press on to positive discovery without the useless waste of a single minute i had found time to think while i was waiting for mr dawsons arrival and i had well employed it certain portions of the conversation of the talkative old clerk which had wearied me at the time now recurred to my memory with a new significance and a suspicion crossed my mind darkly which had not occurred to me while i was in the vestry on my way to knowlesbury i had only proposed to apply to mr wansborough for information on the subject of sir percivals mother my object now was to examine the duplicate register of old welmingham church mr wansborough was in his office when i inquired for him he was a jovial redfaced easylooking man more like a country squire than a lawyer and he seemed to be both surprised and amused by my application he had heard of his fathers copy of the register but had not even seen it himself it had never been inquired after and it was no doubt in the strong room among other papers that had not been disturbed since his fathers death it was a pity mr wansborough said that the old gentleman was not alive to hear his precious copy asked for at last he would have ridden his favourite hobby harder than ever now how had i come to hear of the copy was it through anybody in the town i parried the question as well as i could it was impossible at this stage of the investigation to be too cautious and it was just as well not to let mr wansborough know prematurely that i had already examined the original register i described myself therefore as pursuing a family inquiry to the object of which every possible saving of time was of great importance i was anxious to send certain particulars to london by that days post and one look at the duplicate register paying of course the necessary fees might supply what i required and save me a further journey to old welmingham i added that in the event of my subsequently requiring a copy of the original register i should make application to mr wansboroughs office to furnish me with the document after this explanation no objection was made to producing the copy a clerk was sent to the strong room and after some delay returned with the volume it was of exactly the same size as the volume in the vestry the only difference being that the copy was more smartly bound i took it with me to an unoccupied desk my hands were trembling my head was burning hot i felt the necessity of concealing my agitation as well as i could from the persons about me in the room before i ventured on opening the book on the blank page at the beginning to which i first turned were traced some lines in faded ink they contained these words copy of the marriage register of welmingham parish church executed under my orders and afterwards compared entry by entry with the original by myself signed robert wansborough vestryclerk below this note there was a line added in another handwriting as follows extending from the first of january to the thirtieth of june i turned to the month of september eighteen hundred and three i found the marriage of the man whose christian name was the same as my own i found the double register of the marriages of the two brothers and between these entries at the bottom of the page nothing not a vestige of the entry which recorded the marriage of sir felix glyde and cecilia jane elster in the register of the church my heart gave a great bound and throbbed as if it would stifle me i looked again i was afraid to believe the evidence of my own eyes no not a doubt the marriage was not there the entries on the copy occupied exacty the same places on the page as the entries in the original the last entry on one page recorded the marriage of the man with my christian name below it there was a blank space a space evidently left because it was too narrow to contain the entry of the marriages of the two brothers which in the copy as in the original occupied the top of the next page that space told the whole story there it must have remained in the church register from eighteen hundred and three when the marriages had been solemnised and the copy had been made to eighteen hundred and twentyseven when sir percival appeared at old welmingham here at knowlesbury was the chance of committing the forgery shown to me in the copy and there at old welmingham was the forgery committed in the register of the church my head turned giddy i held by the desk to keep myself from falling of all the suspicions which had struck me in relation to that desperate man not one had been near the truth the idea that he was not sir percival glyde at all that he had no more claim to the baronetcy and to blackwater park than the poorest labourer who worked on the estate had never once occurred to my mind at one time i had thought he might be anne cathericks father at another time i had thought he might have been anne cathericks husband the offence of which he was really guilty had been from first to last beyond the widest reach of my imagination the paltry means by which the fraud had been effected the magnitude and daring of the crime that it represented the horror of the consequences involved in its discovery overwhelmed me who could wonder now at the bruterestlessness of the wretchs life at his desperate alternations between abject duplicity and reckless violence at the madness of guilty distrust which had made him imprison anne catherick in the asylum and had given him over to the vile conspiracy against his wife on the bare suspicion that the one and the other knew his terrible secret the disclosure of that secret might in past years have hanged him might now transport him for life the disclosure of that secret even if the sufferers by his deception spared him the penalties of the law would deprive him at one blow of the name the rank the estate the whole social existence that he had usurped this was the secret and it was mine a word from me and house lands baronetcy were gone from him for ever a word from me and he was driven out into the world a nameless penniless friendless outcast the mans whole future hung on my lips and he knew it by this time as certainly as i did that last thought steadied me interests far more precious than my own depended on the caution which must now guide my slightest actions there was no possible treachery which sir percival might not attempt against me in the danger and desperation of his position he would be staggered by no risks he would recoil at no crime he would literally hesitate at nothing to save himself i considered for a minute my first necessity was to secure positive evidence in writing of the discovery that i had just made and in the event of any personal misadventure happening to me to place that evidence beyond sir percivals reach the copy of the register was sure to be safe in mr wansboroughs strong room but the position of the original in the vestry was as i had seen with my own eyes anything but secure in this emergency i resolved to return to the church to apply again to the clerk and to take the necessary extract from the register before i slept that night i was not then aware that a legallycertified copy was necessary and that no document merely drawn out by myself could claim the proper importance as a proof i was not aware of this and my determination to keep my present proceedings a secret prevented me from asking any questions which might have procured the necessary information my one anxiety was the anxiety to get back to old welmingham i made the best excuses i could for the discomposure in my face and manner which mr wansborough had already noticed laid the necessary fee on his table arranged that i should write to him in a day or two and left the office with my head in a whirl and my blood throbbing through my veins at fever heat it was just getting dark the idea occurred to me that i might be followed again and attacked on the highroad my walkingstick was a light one of little or no use for purposes of defence i stopped before leaving knowlesbury and bought a stout country cudgel short and heavy at the head with this homely weapon if any one man tried to stop me i was a match for him if more than one attacked me i could trust to my heels in my schooldays i had been a noted runner and i had not wanted for practice since in the later time of my experience in central america i started from the town at a brisk pace and kept the middle of the road a small misty rain was falling and it was impossible for the first half of the way to make sure whether i was followed or not but at the last half of my journey when i supposed myself to be about two miles from the church i saw a man run by me in the rain and then heard the gate of a field by the roadside shut to sharply i kept straight on with my cudgel ready in my hand my ears on the alert and my eyes straining to see through the mist and the darkness before i had advanced a hundred yards there was a rustling in the hedge on my right and three men sprang out into the road i drew aside on the instant to the footpath the two foremost men were carried beyond me before they could check themselves the third was as quick as lightning he stopped half turned and struck at me with his stick the blow was aimed at hazard and was not a severe one it fell on my left shoulder i returned it heavily on his head he staggered back and jostled his two companions just as they were both rushing at me this circumstance gave me a moments start i slipped by them and took to the middle of the road again at the top of my speed the two unhurt men pursued me they were both good runners the road was smooth and level and for the first five minutes or more i was conscious that i did not gain on them it was perilous work to run for long in the darkness i could barely see the dim black line of the hedges on either side and any chance obstacle in the road would have thrown me down to a certainty ere long i felt the ground changing it descended from the level at a turn and then rose again beyond downhill the men rather gained on me but uphill i began to distance them the rapid regular thump of their feet grew fainter on my ear and i calculated by the sound that i was far enough in advance to take to the fields with a good chance of their passing me in the darkness diverging to the footpath i made for the first break that i could guess at rather than see in the hedge it proved to be a closed gate i vaulted over and finding myself in a field kept across it steadily with my back to the road i heard the men pass the gate still running then in a minute more heard one of them call to the other to come back it was no matter what they did now i was out of their sight and out of their hearing i kept straight across the field and when i had reached the farther extremity of it waited there for a minute to recover my breath it was impossible to venture back to the road but i was determined nevertheless to get to old welmingham that evening neither moon nor stars appeared to guide me i only knew that i had kept the wind and rain at my back on leaving knowlesbury and if i now kept them at my back still i might at least be certain of not advancing altogether in the wrong direction proceeding on this plan i crossed the country meeting with no worse obstacles than hedges ditches and thickets which every now and then obliged me to alter my course for a little while until i found myself on a hillside with the ground sloping away steeply before me i descended to the bottom of the hollow squeezed my way through a hedge and got out into a lane having turned to the right on leaving the road i now turned to the left on the chance of regaining the line from which i had wandered after following the muddy windings of the lane for ten minutes or more i saw a cottage with a light in one of the windows the garden gate was open to the lane and i went in at once to inquire my way before i could knock at the door it was suddenly opened and a man came running out with a lighted lantern in his hand he stopped and held it up at the sight of me we both started as we saw each other my wanderings had led me round the outskirts of the village and had brought me out at the lower end of it i was back at old welmingham and the man with the lantern was no other than my acquaintance of the morning the parish clerk his manner appeared to have altered strangely in the interval since i had last seen him he looked suspicious and confused his ruddy cheeks were deeply flushed and his first words when he spoke were quite unintelligible to me where are the keys he asked have you taken them what keys i repeated i have this moment come from knowlesbury what keys do you mean the keys of the vestry lord save us and help us what shall i do the keys are gone do you hear cried the old man shaking the lantern at me in his agitation the keys are gone how when who can have taken them i dont know said the clerk staring about him wildly in the darkness ive only just got back i told you i had a long days work this morning i locked the door and shut the window down its open now the windows open look somebody has got in there and taken the keys he turned to the casement window to show me that it was wide open the door of the lantern came loose from its fastening as he swayed it round and the wind blew the candle out instantly get another light i said and let us both go to the vestry together quick quick i hurried him into the house the treachery that i had every reason to expect the treachery that might deprive me of every advantage i had gained was at that moment perhaps in process of accomplishment my impatience to reach the church was so great that i could not remain inactive in the cottage while the clerk lit the lantern again i walked out down the garden path into the lane before i had advanced ten paces a man approached me from the direction leading to the church he spoke respectfully as we met i could not see his face but judging by his voice only he was a perfect stranger to me i beg your pardon sir percival he began i stopped him before he could say more the darkness misleads you i said i am not sir percival the man drew back directly i thought it was my master he muttered in a confused doubtful way you expected to meet your master here i was told to wait in the lane with that answer he retraced his steps i looked back at the cottage and saw the clerk coming out with the lantern lighted once more i took the old mans arm to help him on the more quickly we hastened along the lane and passed the person who had accosted me as well as i could see by the light of the lantern he was a servant out of livery whos that whispered the clerk does he know anything about the keys we wont wait to ask him i replied we will go on to the vestry first the church was not visible even by daytime until the end of the lane was reached as we mounted the rising ground which led to the building from that point one of the village children a boy came close up to us attracted by the light we carried and recognised the clerk i say measter said the boy pulling officiously at the clerks coat there be summun up yander in the church i heerd un lock the door on hisself i heerd un strike a loight wi a match the clerk trembled and leaned against me heavily come come i said encouragingly we are not too late we will catch the man whoever he is keep the lantern and follow me as fast as you can i mounted the hill rapidly the dark mass of the churchtower was the first object i discerned dimly against the night sky as i turned aside to get round to the vestry i heard heavy footsteps close to me the servant had ascended to the church after us i dont mean any harm he said when i turned round on him im only looking for my master the tones in which he spoke betrayed unmistakable fear i took no notice of him and went on the instant i turned the corner and came in view of the vestry i saw the lanternskylight on the roof brilliantly lit up from within it shone out with dazzling brightness against the murky starless sky i hurried through the churchyard to the door as i got near there was a strange smell stealing out on the damp night air i heard a snapping noise inside i saw the light above grow brighter and brighter a pane of the glass cracked i ran to the door and put my hand on it the vestry was on fire before i could move before i could draw my breath after that discovery i was horrorstruck by a heavy thump against the door from the inside i heard the key worked violently in the lock i heard a mans voice behind the door raised to a dreadful shrillness screaming for help the servant who had followed me staggered back shuddering and dropped to his knees oh my god he said its sir percival as the words passed his lips the clerk joined us and at the same moment there was another and a last grating turn of the key in the lock the lord have mercy on his soul said the old man he is doomed and dead he has hampered the lock i rushed to the door the one absorbing purpose that had filled all my thoughts that had controlled all my actions for weeks and weeks past vanished in an instant from my mind all remembrance of the heartless injury the mans crimes had inflicted of the love the innocence the happiness he had pitilessly laid waste of the oath i had sworn in my own heart to summon him to the terrible reckoning that he deserved passed from my memory like a dream i remembered nothing but the horror of his situation i felt nothing but the natural human impulse to save him from a frightful death try the other door i shouted try the door into the church the locks hampered youre a dead man if you waste another moment on it there had been no renewed cry for help when the key was turned for the last time there was no sound now of any kind to give token that he was still alive i heard nothing but the quickening crackle of the flames and the sharp snap of the glass in the skylight above i looked round at my two companions the servant had risen to his feet he had taken the lantern and was holding it up vacantly at the door terror seemed to have struck him with downright idiocy he waited at my heels he followed me about when i moved like a dog the clerk sat crouched up on one of the tombstones shivering and moaning to himself the one moment in which i looked at them was enough to show me that they were both helpless hardly knowing what i did acting desperately on the first impulse that occurred to me i seized the servant and pushed him against the vestry wall stoop i said and hold by the stones i am going to climb over you to the roof i am going to break the skylight and give him some air the man trembled from head to foot but he held firm i got on his back with my cudgel in my mouth seized the parapet with both hands and was instantly on the roof in the frantic hurry and agitation of the moment it never struck me that i might let out the flame instead of letting in the air i struck at the skylight and battered in the cracked loosened glass at a blow the fire leaped out like a wild beast from its lair if the wind had not chanced in the position i occupied to set it away from me my exertions might have ended then and there i crouched on the roof as the smoke poured out above me with the flame the gleams and flashes of the light showed me the servants face staring up vacantly under the wall the clerk risen to his feet on the tombstone wringing his hands in despair and the scanty population of the village haggard men and terrified women clustered beyond in the churchyard all appearing and disappearing in the red of the dreadful glare in the black of the choking smoke and the man beneath my feet the man suffocating burning dying so near us all so utterly beyond our reach the thought half maddened me i lowered myself from the roof by my hands and dropped to the ground the key of the church i shouted to the clerk we must try it that way we may save him yet if we can burst open the inner door no no no cried the old man no hope the church key and the vestry key are on the same ring both inside there oh sir hes past saving hes dust and ashes by this time theyll see the fire from the town said a voice from among the men behind me theres a ingine in the town theyll save the church i called to that man he had his wits about him i called to him to come and speak to me it would be a quarter of an hour at least before the town engine could reach us the horror of remaining inactive all that time was more than i could face in defiance of my own reason i persuaded myself that the doomed and lost wretch in the vestry might still be lying senseless on the floor might not be dead yet if we broke open the door might we save him i knew the strength of the heavy lock i knew the thickness of the nailed oak i knew the hopelessness of assailing the one and the other by ordinary means but surely there were beams still left in the dismantled cottages near the church what if we got one and used it as a batteringram against the door the thought leaped through me like the fire leaping out of the shattered skylight i appealed to the man who had spoken first of the fireengine in the town have you got your pickaxes handy yes they had and a hatchet and a saw and a bit of rope yes yes yes i ran down among the villagers with the lantern in my hand five shillings apiece to every man who helps me they started into life at the words that ravenous second hunger of poverty the hunger for money roused them into tumult and activity in a moment two of you for more lanterns if you have them two of you for the pickaxes and the tools the rest after me to find the beam they cheered with shrill starveling voices they cheered the women and the children fled back on either side we rushed in a body down the churchyard path to the first empty cottage not a man was left behind but the clerk the poor old clerk standing on the flat tombstone sobbing and wailing over the church the servant was still at my heels his white helpless panicstricken face was close over my shoulder as we pushed into the cottage there were rafters from the torndown floor above lying loose on the ground but they were too light a beam ran across over our heads but not out of reach of our arms and our pickaxes a beam fast at each end in the ruined wall with ceiling and flooring all ripped away and a great gap in the roof above open to the sky we attacked the beam at both ends at once god how it held how the brick and mortar of the wall resisted us we struck and tugged and tore the beam gave at one end it came down with a lump of brickwork after it there was a scream from the women all huddled in the doorway to look at us a shout from the men two of them down but not hurt another tug all together and the beam was loose at both ends we raised it and gave the word to clear the doorway now for the work now for the rush at the door there is the fire streaming into the sky streaming brighter than ever to light us steady along the churchyard path steady with the beam for a rush at the door one two three and off out rings the cheering again irrepressibly we have shaken it already the hinges must give if the lock wont another run with the beam one two three and off its loose the stealthy fire darts at us through the crevice all round it another and a last rush the door falls in with a crash a great hush of awe a stillness of breathless expectation possesses every living soul of us we look for the body the scorching heat on our faces drives us back we see nothing above below all through the room we see nothing but a sheet of living fire where is he whispered the servant staring vacantly at the flames hes dust and ashes said the clerk and the books are dust and ashes and oh sirs the church will be dust and ashes soon those were the only two who spoke when they were silent again nothing stirred in the stillness but the bubble and the crackle of the flames hark a harsh rattling sound in the distance then the hollow beat of horses hoofs at full gallop then the low roar the all predominant tumult of hundreds of human voices clamouring and shouting together the engine at last the people about me all turned from the fire and ran eagerly to the brow of the hill the old clerk tried to go with the rest but his strength was exhausted i saw him holding by one of the tombstones save the church he cried out faintly as if the firemen could hear him already save the church the only man who never moved was the servant there he stood his eyes still fastened on the flames in a changeless vacant stare i spoke to him i shook him by the arm he was past rousing he only whispered once more where is he in ten minutes the engine was in position the well at the back of the church was feeding it and the hose was carried to the doorway of the vestry if help had been wanted from me i could not have afforded it now my energy of will was gone my strength was exhausted the turmoil of my thoughts was fearfully and suddenly stilled now i knew that he was dead i stood useless and helpless looking looking looking into the burning room i saw the fire slowly conquered the brightness of the glare faded the steam rose in white clouds and the smouldering heaps of embers showed red and black through it on the floor there was a pause then an advance all together of the firemen and the police which blocked up the doorway then a consultation in low voices and then two men were detached from the rest and sent out of the churchyard through the crowd the crowd drew back on either side in dead silence to let them pass after a while a great shudder ran through the people and the living lane widened slowly the men came back along it with a door from one of the empty houses they carried it to the vestry and went in the police closed again round the doorway and men stole out from among the crowd by twos and threes and stood behind them to be the first to see others waited near to be the first to hear women and children were among these last the tidings from the vestry began to flow out among the crowd they dropped slowly from mouth to mouth till they reached the place where i was standing i heard the questions and answers repeated again and again in low eager tones all round me have they found him yes where against the door on his face which door the door that goes into the church his head was against it he was down on his face is his face burnt no yes it is no scorched not burnt he lay on his face i tell you who was he a lord they say no not a lord sir something sir means knight and baronight too no yes it does what did he want in there no good you may depend on it did he do it on purpose burn himself on purpose i dont mean himself i mean the vestry is he dreadful to look at dreadful not about the face though no no not so much about the face dont anybody know him theres a man says he does who a servant they say but hes struck stupidlike and the police dont believe him dont anybody else know who it is hush the loud clear voice of a man in authority silenced the low hum of talking all round me in an instant where is the gentleman who tried to save him said the voice here sir here he is dozens of eager faces pressed about me dozens of eager arms parted the crowd the man in authority came up to me with a lantern in his hand this way sir if you please he said quietly i was unable to speak to him i was unable to resist him when he took my arm i tried to say that i had never seen the dead man in his lifetime that there was no hope of identifying him by means of a stranger like me but the words failed on my lips i was faint and silent and helpless do you know him sir i was standing inside a circle of men three of them opposite to me were holding lanterns low down to the ground their eyes and the eyes of all the rest were fixed silently and expectantly on my face i knew what was at my feet i knew why they were holding the lanterns so low to the ground can you identify him sir my eyes dropped slowly at first i saw nothing under them but a coarse canvas cloth the dripping of the rain on it was audible in the dreadful silence i looked up along the cloth and there at the end stark and grim and black in the yellow light there was his dead face so for the first and last time i saw him so the visitation of god ruled it that he and i should meet xi the inquest was hurried for certain local reasons which weighed with the coroner and the town authorities it was held on the afternoon of the next day i was necessarily one among the witnesses summoned to assist the objects of the investigation my first proceeding in the morning was to go to the postoffice and inquire for the letter which i expected from marian no change of circumstances however extraordinary could affect the one great anxiety which weighed on my mind while i was away from london the mornings letter which was the only assurance i could receive that no misfortune had happened in my absence was still the absorbing interest with which my day began to my relief the letter from marian was at the office waiting for me nothing had happened they were both as safe and as well as when i had left them laura sent her love and begged that i would let her know of my return a day beforehand her sister added in explanation of this message that she had saved nearly a sovereign out of her own private purse and that she had claimed the privilege of ordering the dinner and giving the dinner which was to celebrate the day of my return i read these little domestic confidences in the bright morning with the terrible recollection of what had happened the evening before vivid in my memory the necessity of sparing laura any sudden knowledge of the truth was the first consideration which the letter suggested to me i wrote at once to marian to tell her what i have told in these pages presenting the tidings as gradually and gently as i could and warning her not to let any such thing as a newspaper fall in lauras way while i was absent in the case of any other woman less courageous and less reliable i might have hesitated before i ventured on unreservedly disclosing the whole truth but i owed it to marian to be faithful to my past experience of her and to trust her as i trusted herself my letter was necessarily a long one it occupied me until the time came for proceeding to the inquest the objects of the legal inquiry were necessarily beset by peculiar complications and difficulties besides the investigation into the manner in which the deceased had met his death there were serious questions to be settled relating to the cause of the fire to the abstraction of the keys and to the presence of a stranger in the vestry at the time when the flames broke out even the identification of the dead man had not yet been accomplished the helpless condition of the servant had made the police distrustful of his asserted recognition of his master they had sent to knowlesbury overnight to secure the attendance of witnesses who were well acquainted with the personal appearance of sir percival glyde and they had communicated the first thing in the morning with blackwater park these precautions enabled the coroner and jury to settle the question of identity and to confirm the correctness of the servants assertion the evidence offered by competent witnesses and by the discovery of certain facts being subsequently strengthened by an examination of the dead mans watch the crest and the name of sir percival glyde were engraved inside it the next inquiries related to the fire the servant and i and the boy who had heard the light struck in the vestry were the first witnesses called the boy gave his evidence clearly enough but the servants mind had not yet recovered the shock inflicted on it he was plainly incapable of assisting the objects of the inquiry and he was desired to stand down to my own relief my examination was not a long one i had not known the deceased i had never seen him i was not aware of his presence at old welmingham and i had not been in the vestry at the finding of the body all i could prove was that i had stopped at the clerks cottage to ask my way that i had heard from him of the loss of the keys that i had accompanied him to the church to render what help i could that i had seen the fire that i had heard some person unknown inside the vestry trying vainly to unlock the door and that i had done what i could from motives of humanity to save the man other witnesses who had been acquainted with the deceased were asked if they could explain the mystery of his presumed abstraction of the keys and his presence in the burning room but the coroner seemed to take it for granted naturally enough that i as a total stranger in the neighbourhood and a total stranger to sir percival glyde could not be in a position to offer any evidence on these two points the course that i was myself bound to take when my formal examination had closed seemed clear to me i did not feel called on to volunteer any statement of my own private convictions in the first place because my doing so could serve no practical purpose now that all proof in support of any surmises of mine was burnt with the burnt register in the second place because i could not have intelligibly stated my opinion my unsupported opinion without disclosing the whole story of the conspiracy and producing beyond a doubt the same unsatisfactory effect an the mind of the coroner and the jury which i had already produced on the mind of mr kyrle in these pages however and after the time that has now elapsed no such cautions and restraints as are here described need fetter the free expression of my opinion i will state briefly before my pen occupies itself with other events how my own convictions lead me to account for the abstraction of the keys for the outbreak of the fire and for the death of the man the news of my being free on bail drove sir percival as i believe to his last resources the attempted attack on the road was one of those resources and the suppression of all practical proof of his crime by destroying the page of the register on which the forgery had been committed was the other and the surest of the two if i could produce no extract from the original book to compare with the certified copy at knowlesbury i could produce no positive evidence and could threaten him with no fatal exposure all that was necessary to the attainment of his end was that he should get into the vestry unperceived that he should tear out the page in the register and that he should leave the vestry again as privately as he had entered it on this supposition it is easy to understand why he waited until nightfall before he made the attempt and why he took advantage of the clerks absence to possess himself of the keys necessity would oblige him to strike a light to find his way to the right register and common caution would suggest his locking the door on the inside in case of intrusion on the part of any inquisitive stranger or on my part if i happened to be in the neighbourhood at the time i cannot believe that it was any part of his intention to make the destruction of the register appear to be the result of accident by purposely setting the vestry on fire the bare chance that prompt assistance might arrive and that the books might by the remotest possibility be saved would have been enough on a moments consideration to dismiss any idea of this sort from his mind remembering the quantity of combustible objects in the vestry the straw the papers the packingcases the dry wood the old wormeaten presses all the probabilities in my estimation point to the fire as the result of an accident with his matches or his light his first impulse under these circumstances was doubtless to try to extinguish the flames and failing in that his second impulse ignorant as he was of the state of the lock had been to attempt to escape by the door which had given him entrance when i had called to him the flames must have reached across the door leading into the church on either side of which the presses extended and close to which the other combustible objects were placed in all probability the smoke and flame confined as they were to the room had been too much for him when he tried to escape by the inner door he must have dropped in his death swoon he must have sunk in the place where he was found just as i got on the roof to break the skylight window even if we had been able afterwards to get into the church and to burst open the door from that side the delay must have been fatal he would have been past saving long past saving by that time we should only have given the flames free ingress into the church the church which was now preserved but which in that event would have shared the fate of the vestry there is no doubt in my mind there can be no doubt in the mind of any one that he was a dead man before ever we got to the empty cottage and worked with might and main to tear down the beam this is the nearest approach that any theory of mine can make towards accounting for a result which was visible matter of fact as i have described them so events passed to us outside as i have related it so his body was found the inquest was adjourned over one day no explanation that the eye of the law could recognise having been discovered thus far to account for the mysterious circumstances of the case it was arranged that more witnesses should be summoned and that the london solicitor of the deceased should be invited to attend a medical man was also charged with the duty of reporting on the mental condition of the servant which appeared at present to debar him from giving any evidence of the least importance he could only declare in a dazed way that he had been ordered on the night of the fire to wait in the lane and that he knew nothing else except that the deceased was certainly his master my own impression was that he had been first used without any guilty knowledge on his own part to ascertain the fact of the clerks absence from home on the previous day and that he had been afterwards ordered to wait near the church but out of sight of the vestry to assist his master in the event of my escaping the attack on the road and of a collision occurring between sir percival and myself it is necessary to add that the mans own testimony was never obtained to confirm this view the medical report of him declared that what little mental faculty he possessed was seriously shaken nothing satisfactory was extracted from him at the adjourned inquest and for aught i know to the contrary he may never have recovered to this day i returned to the hotel at welmingham so jaded in body and mind so weakened and depressed by all that i had gone through as to be quite unfit to endure the local gossip about the inquest and to answer the trivial questions that the talkers addressed to me in the coffeeroom i withdrew from my scanty dinner to my cheap garretchamber to secure myself a little quiet and to think undisturbed of laura and marian if i had been a richer man i would have gone back to london and would have comforted myself with a sight of the two dear faces again that night but i was bound to appear if called on at the adjourned inquest and doubly bound to answer my bail before the magistrate at knowlesbury our slender resources had suffered already and the doubtful future more doubtful than ever now made me dread decreasing our means unnecessarily by allowing myself an indulgence even at the small cost of a double railway journey in the carriages of the second class the next day the day immediately following the inquest was left at my own disposal i began the morning by again applying at the postoffice for my regular report from marian it was waiting for me as before and it was written throughout in good spirits i read the letter thankfully and then set forth with my mind at ease for the day to go to old welmingham and to view the scene of the fire by the morning light what changes met me when i got there through all the ways of our unintelligible world the trivial and the terrible walk hand in hand together the irony of circumstances holds no mortal catastrophe in respect when i reached the church the trampled condition of the burialground was the only serious trace left to tell of the fire and the death a rough hoarding of boards had been knocked up before the vestry doorway rude caricatures were scrawled on it already and the village children were fighting and shouting for the possession of the best peephole to see through on the spot where i had heard the cry for help from the burning room on the spot where the panicstricken servant had dropped on his knees a fussy flock of poultry was now scrambling for the first choice of worms after the rain and on the ground at my feet where the door and its dreadful burden had been laid a workmans dinner was waiting for him tied up in a yellow basin and his faithful cur in charge was yelping at me for coming near the food the old clerk looking idly at the slow commencement of the repairs had only one interest that he could talk about now the interest of escaping all blame for his own part on account of the accident that had happened one of the village women whose white wild face i remembered the picture of terror when we pulled down the beam was giggling with another woman the picture of inanity over an old washingtub there is nothing serious in mortality solomon in all his glory was solomon with the elements of the contemptible lurking in every fold of his robes and in every corner of his palace as i left the place my thoughts turned not for the first time to the complete overthrow that all present hope of establishing lauras identity had now suffered through sir percivals death he was gone and with him the chance was gone which had been the one object of all my labours and all my hopes could i look at my failure from no truer point of view than this suppose he had lived would that change of circumstance have altered the result could i have made my discovery a marketable commodity even for lauras sake after i had found out that robbery of the rights of others was the essence of sir percivals crime could i have offered the price of my silence for his confession of the conspiracy when the effect of that silence must have been to keep the right heir from the estates and the right owner from the name impossible if sir percival had lived the discovery from which in my ignorance of the true nature of the secret i had hoped so much could not have been mine to suppress or to make public as i thought best for the vindication of lauras rights in common honesty and common honour i must have gone at once to the stranger whose birthright had been usurped i must have renounced the victory at the moment when it was mine by placing my discovery unreservedly in that strangers hands and i must have faced afresh all the difficulties which stood between me and the one object of my life exactly as i was resolved in my heart of hearts to face them now i returned to welmingham with my mind composed feeling more sure of myself and my resolution than i had felt yet on my way to the hotel i passed the end of the square in which mrs catherick lived should i go back to the house and make another attempt to see her no that news of sir percivals death which was the last news she ever expected to hear must have reached her hours since all the proceedings at the inquest had been reported in the local paper that morning there was nothing i could tell her which she did not know already my interest in making her speak had slackened i remembered the furtive hatred in her face when she said there is no news of sir percival that i dont expect except the news of his death i remembered the stealthy interest in her eyes when they settled on me at parting after she had spoken those words some instinct deep in my heart which i felt to be a true one made the prospect of again entering her presence repulsive to me i turned away from the square and went straight back to the hotel some hours later while i was resting in the coffeeroom a letter was placed in my hands by the waiter it was addressed to me by name and i found on inquiry that it had been left at the bar by a woman just as it was near dusk and just before the gas was lighted she had said nothing and she had gone away again before there was time to speak to her or even to notice who she was i opened the letter it was neither dated nor signed and the handwriting was palpably disguised before i had read the first sentence however i knew who my correspondent was mrs catherick the letter ran as follows i copy it exactly word for word the story continued by mrs catherick sir you have not come back as you said you would no matter i know the news and i write to tell you so did you see anything particular in my face when you left me i was wondering in my own mind whether the day of his downfall had come at last and whether you were the chosen instrument for working it you were and you have worked it you were weak enough as i have heard to try and save his life if you had succeeded i should have looked upon you as my enemy now you have failed i hold you as my friend your inquiries frightened him into the vestry by night your inquiries without your privity and against your will have served the hatred and wreaked the vengeance of threeandtwenty vears thank you sir in spite of yourself i owe something to the man who has done this how can i pay my debt if i was a young woman still i might say come put your arm round my waist and kiss me if you like i should have been fond enough of you even to go that length and you would have accepted my invitation you would sir twenty years ago but i am an old woman now well i can satisfy your curiosity and pay my debt in that way you had a great curiosity to know certain private affairs of mine when you came to see me private affairs which all your sharpness could not look into without my help private affairs which you have not discovered even now you shall discover them your curiosity shall be satisfied i will take any trouble to please you my estimable young friend you were a little boy i suppose in the year twentyseven i was a handsome young woman at that time living at old welmingham i had a contemptible fool for a husband i had also the honour of being acquainted never mind how with a certain gentleman never mind whom i shall not call him by his name why should i it was not his own he never had a name you know that by this time as well as i do it will be more to the purpose to tell you how he worked himself into my good graces i was born with the tastes of a lady and he gratified them in other words he admired me and he made me presents no woman can resist admiration and presents especially presents provided they happen to be just the thing she wants he was sharp enough to know that most men are naturally he wanted something in return all men do and what do you think was the something the merest trifle nothing but the key of the vestry and the key of the press inside it when my husbands back was turned of course he lied when i asked him why he wished me to get him the keys in that private way he might have saved himself the trouble i didnt believe him but i liked my presents and i wanted more so i got him the keys without my husbands knowledge and i watched him without his own knowledge once twice four times i watched him and the fourth time i found him out i was never overscrupulous where other peoples affairs were concerned and i was not overscrupulous about his adding one to the marriages in the register on his own account of course i knew it was wrong but it did no harm to me which was one good reason for not making a fuss about it and i had not got a gold watch and chain which was another still better and he had promised me one from london only the day before which was a third best of all if i had known what the law considered the crime to be and how the law punished it i should have taken proper care of myself and have exposed him then and there but i knew nothing and i longed for the gold watch all the conditions i insisted on were that he should take me into his confidence and tell me everything i was as curious about his affairs then as you are about mine now he granted my conditions why you will see presently this put in short is what i heard from him he did not willingly tell me all that i tell you here i drew some of it from him by persuasion and some of it by questions i was determined to have all the truth and i believe i got it he knew no more than any one else of what the state of things really was between his father and mother till after his mothers death then his father confessed it and promised to do what he could for his son he died having done nothing not having even made a will the son who can blame him wisely provided for himself he came to england at once and took possession of the property there was no one to suspect him and no one to say him nay his father and mother had always lived as man and wife none of the few people who were acquainted with them ever supposed them to be anything else the right person to claim the property if the truth had been known was a distant relation who had no idea of ever getting it and who was away at sea when his father died he had no difficulty so far he took possession as a matter of course but he could not borrow money on the property as a matter of course there were two things wanted of him before he could do this one was a certificate of his birth and the other was a certificate of his parents marriage the certificate of his birth was easily got he was born abroad and the certificate was there in due form the other matter was a difficulty and that difficulty brought him to old welmingham but for one consideration he might have gone to knowlesbury instead his mother had been living there just before she met with his father living under her maiden name the truth being that she was really a married woman married in ireland where her husband had illused her and had afterwards gone off with some other person i give you this fact on good authority sir felix mentioned it to his son as the reason why he had not married you may wonder why the son knowing that his parents had met each other at knowlesbury did not play his first tricks with the register of that church where it might have been fairly presumed his father and mother were married the reason was that the clergyman who did duty at knowlesbury church in the year eighteen hundred and three when according to his birth certificate his father and mother ought to have been married was alive still when he took possession of the property in the new year of eighteen hundred and twentyseven this awkward circumstance forced him to extend his inquiries to our neighbourhood there no such danger existed the former clergyman at our church having been dead for some years old welmingham suited his purpose as well as knowlesbury his father had removed his mother from knowlesbury and had lived with her at a cottage on the river a little distance from our village people who had known his solitary ways when he was single did not wonder at his solitary ways when he was supposed to be married if he had not been a hideous creature to look at his retired life with the lady might have raised suspicions but as things were his hiding his ugliness and his deformity in the strictest privacy surprised nobody he lived in our neighbourhood till he came in possession of the park after three or four and twenty years had passed who was to say the clergyman being dead that his marriage had not been as private as the rest of his life and that it had not taken place at old welmingham church so as i told you the son found our neighbourhood the surest place he could choose to set things right secretly in his own interests it may surprise you to hear that what he really did to the marriage register was done on the spur of the moment done on second thoughts his first notion was only to tear the leaf out in the right year and month to destroy it privately to go back to london and to tell the lawyers to get him the necessary certificate of his fathers marriage innocently referring them of course to the date on the leaf that was gone nobody could say his father and mother had not been married after that and whether under the circumstances they would stretch a point or not about lending him the money he thought they would he had his answer ready at all events if a question was ever raised about his right to the name and the estate but when he came to look privately at the register for himself he found at the bottom of one of the pages for the year eighteen hundred and three a blank space left seemingly through there being no room to make a long entry there which was made instead at the top of the next page the sight of this chance altered all his plans it was an opportunity he had never hoped for or thought of and he took it you know how the blank space to have exactly tallied with his birth certificate ought to have occurred in the july part of the register it occurred in the september part instead however in this case if suspicious questions were asked the answer was not hard to find he had only to describe himself as a seven months child i was fool enough when he told me his story to feel some interest and some pity for him which was just what he calculated on as you will see i thought him hardly used it was not his fault that his father and mother were not married and it was not his fathers and mothers fault either a more scrupulous woman than i was a woman who had not set her heart on a gold watch and chain would have found some excuses for him at all events i held my tongue and helped to screen what he was about he was some time getting the ink the right colour mixing it over and over again in pots and bottles of mine and some time afterwards in practising the handwriting but he succeeded in the end and made an honest woman of his mother after she was dead in her grave so far i dont deny that he behaved honourably enough to myself he gave me my watch and chain and spared no expense in buying them both were of superior workmanship and very expensive i have got them still the watch goes beautifully you said the other day that mrs clements had told you everything she knew in that case there is no need for me to write about the trumpery scandal by which i was the sufferer the innocent sufferer i positively assert you must know as well as i do what the notion was which my husband took into his head when he found me and my finegentleman acquaintance meeting each other privately and talking secrets together but what you dont know is how it ended between that same gentleman and myself you shall read and see how he behaved to me the first words i said to him when i saw the turn things had taken were do me justice clear my character of a stain on it which you know i dont deserve i dont want you to make a clean breast of it to my husband only tell him on your word of honour as a gentleman that he is wrong and that i am not to blame in the way he thinks i am do me that justice at least after all i have done for you he flatly refused in so many words he told me plainly that it was his interest to let my husband and all my neighbours believe the falsehood because as long as they did so they were quite certain never to suspect the truth i had a spirit of my own and i told him they should know the truth from my lips his reply was short and to the point if i spoke i was a lost woman as certainly as he was a lost man yes it had come to that he had deceived me about the risk i ran in helping him he had practised on my ignorance he had tempted me with his gifts he had interested me with his story and the result of it was that he made me his accomplice he owned this coolly and he ended by telling me for the first time what the frightful punishment really was for his offence and for any one who helped him to commit it in those days the law was not so tenderhearted as i hear it is now murderers were not the only people liable to be hanged and women convicts were not treated like ladies in undeserved distress i confess he frightened me the mean impostor the cowardly blackguard do you understand now how i hated him do you understand why i am taking all this trouble thankfully taking it to gratify the curiosity of the meritorious young gentleman who hunted him down well to go on he was hardly fool enough to drive me to downright desperation i was not the sort of woman whom it was quite safe to hunt into a corner he knew that and wisely quieted me with proposals for the future i deserved some reward he was kind enough to say for the service i had done him and some compensation he was so obliging as to add for what i had suffered he was quite willing generous scoundrel to make me a handsome yearly allowance payable quarterly on two conditions first i was to hold my tongue in my own interests as well as in his secondly i was not to stir away from welmingham without first letting him know and waiting till i had obtained his permission in my own neighbourhood no virtuous female friends would tempt me into dangerous gossiping at the teatable in my own neighbourhood he would always know where to find me a hard condition that second one but i accepted it what else was i to do i was left helpless with the prospect of a coming incumbrance in the shape of a child what else was i to do cast myself on the mercy of my runaway idiot of a husband who had raised the scandal against me i would have died first besides the allowance was a handsome one i had a better income a better house over my head better carpets on my floors than half the women who turned up the whites of their eyes at the sight of me the dress of virtue in our parts was cotton print i had silk so i accepted the conditions he offered me and made the best of them and fought my battle with my respectable neighbours on their own ground and won it in course of time as you saw yourself how i kept his secret and mine through all the years that have passed from that time to this and whether my late daughter anne ever really crept into my confidence and got the keeping of the secret too are questions i dare say to which you are curious to find an answer well my gratitude refuses you nothing i will turn to a fresh page and give you the answer immediately but you must excuse one thing you must excuse my beginning mr hartright with an expression of surprise at the interest which you appear to have felt in my late daughter it is quite unaccountable to me if that interest makes you anxious for any particulars of her early life i must refer you to mrs clements who knows more of the subject than i do pray understand that i do not profess to have been at all overfond of my late daughter she was a worry to me from first to last with the additional disadvantage of being always weak in the head you like candour and i hope this satisfies you there is no need to trouble you with many personal particulars relating to those past times it will be enough to say that i observed the terms of the bargain on my side and that i enjoyed my comfortable income in return paid quarterly now and then i got away and changed the scene for a short time always asking leave of my lord and master first and generally getting it he was not as i have already told you fool enough to drive me too hard and he could reasonably rely on my holding my tongue for my own sake if not for his one of my longest trips away from home was the trip i took to limmeridge to nurse a halfsister there who was dying she was reported to have saved money and i thought it as well in case any accident happened to stop my allowance to look after my own interests in that direction as things turned out however my pains were all thrown away and i got nothing because nothing was to be had i had taken anne to the north with me having my whims and fancies occasionally about my child and getting at such times jealous of mrs clements influence over her i never liked mrs clements she was a poor emptyheaded spiritless woman what you call a born drudge and i was now and then not averse to plaguing her by taking anne away not knowing what else to do with my girl while i was nursing in cumberland i put her to school at limmeridge the lady of the manor mrs fairlie a remarkably plainlooking woman who had entrapped one of the handsomest men in england into marrying her amused me wonderfully by taking a violent fancy to my girl the consequence was she learnt nothing at school and was petted and spoilt at limmeridge house among other whims and fancies which they taught her there they put some nonsense into her head about always wearing white hating white and liking colours myself i determined to take the nonsense out of her head as soon as we got home again strange to say my daughter resolutey resisted me when she had got a notion once fixed in her mind she was like other half witted people as obstinate as a mule in keeping it we quarrelled finely and mrs clements not liking to see it i suppose offered to take anne away to live in london with her i should have said yes if mrs clements had not sided with my daughter about her dressing herself in white but being determined she should not dress herself in white and disliking mrs clements more than ever for taking part against me i said no and meant no and stuck to no the consequence was my daughter remained with me and the consequence of that in its turn was the first serious quarrel that happened about the secret the circumstance took place long after the time i have just been writing of i had been settled for years in the new town and was steadily living down my bad character and slowly gaining ground among the respectable inhabitants it helped me forward greatly towards this object to have my daughter with me her harmlessness and her fancy for dressing in white excited a certain amount of sympathy i left off opposing her favourite whim on that account because some of the sympathy was sure in course of time to fall to my share some of it did fall i date my getting a choice of the two best sittings to let in the church from that time and i date the clergymans first bow from my getting the sittings well being settled in this way i received a letter one morning from that highly born gentleman now deceased in answer to one of mine warning him according to agreement of my wishing to leave the town for a little change of air and scene the ruffianly side of him must have been uppermost i suppose when he got my letter for he wrote back refusing me in such abominably insolent language that i lost all command over myself and abused him in my daughters presence as a low impostor whom i could ruin for life if i chose to open my lips and let out his secret i said no more about him than that being brought to my senses as soon as those words had escaped me by the sight of my daughters face looking eagerly and curiously at mine i instantly ordered her out of the room until i had composed myself again my sensations were not pleasant i can tell you when i came to reflect on my own folly anne had been more than usually crazy and queer that year and when i thought of the chance there might be of her repeating my words in the town and mentioning his name in connection with them if inquisitive people got hold of her i was finely terrified at the possible consequences my worst fears for myself my worst dread of what he might do led me no farther than this i was quite unprepared for what really did happen only the next day on that next day without any warning to me to expect him he came to the house his first words and the tone in which he spoke them surly as it was showed me plainly enough that he had repented already of his insolent answer to my application and that he had come in a mighty bad temper to try and set matters right again before it was too late seeing my daughter in the room with me i had been afraid to let her out of my sight after what had happened the day before he ordered her away they neither of them liked each other and he vented the illtemper on her which he was afraid to show to me leave us he said looking at her over his shoulder she looked back over her shoulder and waited as if she didnt care to go do you hear he roared out leave the room speak to me civilly says she getting red in the face turn the idiot out says he looking my way she had always had crazy notions of her own about her dignity and that word idiot upset her in a moment before i could interfere she stepped up to him in a fine passion beg my pardon directly says she or ill make it the worse for you ill let out your secret i can ruin you for life if i choose to open my lips my own words repeated exactly from what i had said the day before repeated in his presence as if they had come from herself he sat speechless as white as the paper i am writing on while i pushed her out of the room when he recovered himself no i am too respectable a woman to mention what he said when he recovered himself my pen is the pen of a member of the rectors congregation and a subscriber to the wednesday lectures on justification by faith how can you expect me to employ it in writing bad language suppose for yourself the raging swearing frenzy of the lowest ruffian in england and let us get on together as fast as may be to the way in which it all ended it ended as you probably guess by this time in his insisting on securing his own safety by shutting her up i tried to set things right i told him that she had merely repeated like a parrot the words she had heard me say and that she knew no particulars whatever because i had mentioned none i explained that she had affected out of crazy spite against him to know what she really did not know that she only wanted to threaten him and aggravate him for speaking to her as he had just spoken and that my unlucky words gave her just the chance of doing mischief of which she was in search i referred him to other queer ways of hers and to his own experience of the vagaries of halfwitted people it was all to no purpose he would not believe me on my oath he was absolutely certain i had betrayed the whole secret in short he would hear of nothing but shutting her up under these circumstances i did my duty as a mother no pauper asylum i said i wont have her put in a pauper asylum a private establishment if you please i have my feelings as a mother and my character to preserve in the town and i will submit to nothing but a private establishment of the sort which my genteel neighbours would choose for afflicted relatives of their own those were my words it is gratifying to me to reflect that i did my duty though never overfond of my late daughter i had a proper pride about her no pauper stain thanks to my firmness and resolution ever rested on my child having carried my point which i did the more easily in consequence of the facilities offered by private asylums i could not refuse to admit that there were certain advantages gained by shutting her up in the first place she was taken excellent care of being treated as i took care to mention in the town on the footing of a lady in the second place she was kept away from welmingham where she might have set people suspecting and inquiring by repeating my own incautious words the only drawback of putting her under restraint was a very slight one we merely turned her empty boast about knowing the secret into a fixed delusion having first spoken in sheer crazy spitefulness against the man who had offended her she was cunning enough to see that she had seriously frightened him and sharp enough afterwards to discover that he was concerned in shutting her up the consequence was she flamed out into a perfect frenzy of passion against him going to the asylum and the first words she said to the nurses after they had quieted her were that she was put in confinement for knowing his secret and that she meant to open her lips and ruin him when the right time came she may have said the same thing to you when you thoughtlessly assisted her escape she certainly said it as i heard last summer to the unfortunate woman who married our sweettempered nameless gentleman lately deceased if either you or that unlucky lady had questioned my daughter closely and had insisted on her explaining what she really meant you would have found her lose all her selfimportance suddenly and get vacant and restless and confused you would have discovered that i am writing nothing here but the plain truth she knew that there was a secret she knew who was connected with it she knew who would suffer by its being known and beyond that whatever airs of importance she may have given herself whatever crazy boasting she may have indulged in with strangers she never to her dying day knew more have i satisfied your curiosity i have taken pains enough to satisfy it at any rate there is really nothing else i have to tell you about myself or my daughter my worst responsibilities so far as she was concerned were all over when she was secured in the asylum i had a form of letter relating to the circumstances under which she was shut up given me to write in answer to one miss halcombe who was curious in the matter and who must have heard plenty of lies about me from a certain tongue well accustomed to the telling of the same and i did what i could afterwards to trace my runaway daughter and prevent her from doing mischief by making inquiries myself in the neighbourhood where she was falsely reported to have been seen but these and other trifles like them are of little or no interest to you after what you have heard already so far i have written in the friendliest possible spirit but i cannot close this letter without adding a word here of serious remonstrance and reproof addressed to yourself in the course of your personal interview with me you audaciously referred to my late daughters parentage on the fathers side as if that parentage was a matter of doubt this was highly improper and very ungentlemanlike on your part if we see each other again remember if you please that i will allow no liberties to be taken with my reputation and that the moral atmosphere of welmingham to use a favourite expression of my friend the rectors must not be tainted by loose conversation of any kind if you allow yourself to doubt that my husband was annes father you personally insult me in the grossest manner if you have felt and if you still continue to feel an unhallowed curiosity on this subject i recommend you in your own interests to check it at once and for ever on this side of the grave mr hartright whatever may happen on the other that curiosity will never be gratified perhaps after what i have just said you will see the necessity of writing me an apology do so and i will willingly receive it i will afterwards if your wishes point to a second interview with me go a step farther and receive you my circumstances only enable me to invite you to tea not that they are at all altered for the worse by what has happened i have always lived as i think i told you well within my income and i have saved enough in the last twenty years to make me quite comfortable for the rest of my life it is not my intention to leave welmingham there are one or two little advantages which i have still to gain in the town the clergyman bows to me as you saw he is married and his wife is not quite so civil i propose to join the dorcas society and i mean to make the clergymans wife bow to me next if you favour me with your company pray understand that the conversation must be entirely on general subjects any attempted reference to this letter will be quite useless i am determined not to acknowledge having written it the evidence has been destroyed in the fire i know but i think it desirable to err on the side of caution nevertheless on this account no names are mentioned here nor is any signature attached to these lines the handwriting is disguised throughout and i mean to deliver the letter myself under circumstances which will prevent all fear of its being traced to my house you can have no possible cause to complain of these precautions seeing that they do not affect the information i here communicate in consideration of the special indulgence which you have deserved at my hands my hour for tea is halfpast five and my buttered toast waits for nobody the story continued by walter hartright i my first impulse after reading mrs cathericks extraordinary narrative was to destroy it the hardened shameless depravity of the whole composition from beginning to end the atrocious perversity of mind which persistently associated me with a calamity for which i was in no sense answerable and with a death which i had risked my life in trying to avert so disgusted me that i was on the point of tearing the letter when a consideration suggested itself which warned me to wait a little before i destroyed it this consideration was entirely unconnected with sir percival the information communicated to me so far as it concerned him did little more than confirm the conclusions at which i had already arrived he had committed his offence as i had supposed him to have committed it and the absence of all reference on mrs cathericks part to the duplicate register at knowlesbury strengthened my previous conviction that the existence of the book and the risk of detection which it implied must have been necessarily unknown to sir percival my interest in the question of the forgery was now at an end and my only object in keeping the letter was to make it of some future service in clearing up the last mystery that still remained to baffle me the parentage of anne catherick on the fathers side there were one or two sentences dropped in her mothers narrative which it might be useful to refer to again when matters of more immediate importance allowed me leisure to search for the missing evidence i did not despair of still finding that evidence and i had lost none of my anxiety to discover it for i had lost none of my interest in tracing the father of the poor creature who now lay at rest in mrs fairlies grave accordingly i sealed up the letter and put it away carefully in my pocketbook to be referred to again when the time came the next day was my last in hampshire when i had appeared again before the magistrate at knowlesbury and when i had attended at the adjourned inquest i should be free to return to london by the afternoon or the evening train my first errand in the morning was as usual to the postoffice the letter from marian was there but i thought when it was handed to me that it felt unusually light i anxiously opened the envelope there was nothing inside but a small strip of paper folded in two the few blotted hurriedlywritten lines which were traced on it contained these words come back as soon as you can i have been obliged to move come to gowers walk fulham number five i will be on the lookout for you dont be alarmed about us we are both safe and well but come back marian the news which those lines contained news which i instantly associated with some attempted treachery on the part of count fosco fairly overwhelmed me i stood breathless with the paper crumpled up in my hand what had happened what subtle wickedness had the count planned and executed in my absence a night had passed since marians note was written hours must elapse still before i could get back to them some new disaster might have happened already of which i was ignorant and here miles and miles away from them here i must remain held doubly held at the disposal of the law i hardly know to what forgetfulness of my obligations anxiety and alarm might not have tempted me but for the quieting influence of my faith in marian my absolute reliance on her was the one earthly consideration which helped me to restrain myself and gave me courage to wait the inquest was the first of the impediments in the way of my freedom of action i attended it at the appointed time the legal formalities requiring my presence in the room but as it turned out not calling on me to repeat my evidence this useless delay was a hard trial although i did my best to quiet my impatience by following the course of the proceedings as closely as i could the london solicitor of the deceased mr merriman was among the persons present but he was quite unable to assist the objects of the inquiry he could only say that he was inexpressibly shocked and astonished and that he could throw no light whatever on the mysterious circumstances of the case at intervals during the adjourned investigation he suggested questions which the coroner put but which led to no results after a patient inquiry which lasted nearly three hours and which exhausted every available source of information the jury pronounced the customary verdict in cases of sudden death by accident they added to the formal decision a statement that there had been no evidence to show how the keys had been abstracted how the fire had been caused or what the purpose was for which the deceased had entered the vestry this act closed the proceedings the legal representative of the dead man was left to provide for the necessities of the interment and the witnesses were free to retire resolved not to lose a minute in getting to knowlesbury i paid my bill at the hotel and hired a fly to take me to the town a gentleman who heard me give the order and who saw that i was going alone informed me that he lived in the neighbourhood of knowlesbury and asked if i would have any objection to his getting home by sharing the fly with me i accepted his proposal as a matter of course our conversation during the drive was naturally occupied by the one absorbing subject of local interest my new acquaintance had some knowledge of the late sir percivals solicitor and he and mr merriman had been discussing the state of the deceased gentlemans affairs and the succession to the property sir percivals embarrassments were so well known all over the county that his solicitor could only make a virtue of necessity and plainly acknowledge them he had died without leaving a will and he had no personal property to bequeath even if he had made one the whole fortune which he had derived from his wife having been swallowed up by his creditors the heir to the estate sir percival having left no issue was a son of sir felix glydes first cousin an officer in command of an east indiaman he would find his unexpected inheritance sadly encumbered but the property would recover with time and if the captain was careful he might be a rich man yet before he died absorbed as i was in the one idea of getting to london this information which events proved to be perfectly correct had an interest of its own to attract my attention i thought it justified me in keeping secret my discovery of sir percivals fraud the heir whose rights he had usurped was the heir who would now have the estate the income from it for the last threeandtwenty years which should properly have been his and which the dead man had squandered to the last farthing was gone beyond recall if i spoke my speaking would confer advantage on no one if i kept the secret my silence concealed the character of the man who had cheated laura into marrying him for her sake i wished to conceal it for her sake still i tell this story under feigned names i parted with my chance companion at knowlesbury and went at once to the townhall as i had anticipated no one was present to prosecute the case against me the necessary formalities were observed and i was discharged on leaving the court a letter from mr dawson was put into my hand it informed me that he was absent on professional duty and it reiterated the offer i had already received from him of any assistance which i might require at his hands i wrote back warmly acknowledging my obligations to his kindness and apologising for not expressing my thanks personally in consequence of my immediate recall on pressing business to town half an hour later i was speeding back to london by the express train ii it was between nine and ten oclock before i reached fulham and found my way to gowers walk both laura and marian came to the door to let me in i think we had hardly known how close the tie was which bound us three together until the evening came which united us again we met as if we had been parted for months instead of for a few days only marians face was sadly worn and anxious i saw who had known all the danger and borne all the trouble in my absence the moment i looked at her lauras brighter looks and better spirits told me how carefully she had been spared all knowledge of the dreadful death at welmingham and of the true reason of our change of abode the stir of the removal seemed to have cheered and interested her she only spoke of it as a happy thought of marians to surprise me on my return with a change from the close noisy street to the pleasant neighbourhood of trees and fields and the river she was full of projects for the future of the drawings she was to finish of the purchasers i had found in the country who were to buy them of the shillings and sixpences she had saved till her purse was so heavy that she proudly asked me to weigh it in my own hand the change for the better which had been wrought in her during the few days of my absence was a surprise to me for which i was quite unprepared and for all the unspeakable happiness of seeing it i was indebted to marians courage and to marians love when laura had left us and when we could speak to one another without restraint i tried to give some expression to the gratitude and the admiration which filled my heart but the generous creature would not wait to hear me that sublime self forgetfulness of women which yields so much and asks so little turned all her thoughts from herself to me i had only a moment left before posttime she said or i should have written less abruptly you look worn and weary walter i am afraid my letter must have seriously alarmed you only at first i replied my mind was quieted marian by my trust in you was i right in attributing this sudden change of place to some threatened annoyance on the part of count fosco perfectly right she said i saw him yesterday and worse than that walter i spoke to him spoke to him did he know where we lived did he come to the house he did to the house but not upstairs laura never saw him laura suspects nothing i will tell you how it happened the danger i believe and hope is over now yesterday i was in the sittingroom at our old lodgings laura was drawing at the table and i was walking about and setting things to rights i passed the window and as i passed it looked out into the street there on the opposite side of the way i saw the count with a man talking to him did he notice you at the window no at least i thought not i was too violently startled to be quite sure who was the other man a stranger not a stranger walter as soon as i could draw my breath again i recognised him he was the owner of the lunatic asylum was the count pointing out the house to him no they were talking together as if they had accidentally met in the street i remained at the window looking at them from behind the curtain if i had turned round and if laura had seen my face at that momentthank god she was absorbed over her drawing they soon parted the man from the asylum went one way and the count the other i began to hope they were in the street by chance till i saw the count come back stop opposite to us again take out his cardcase and pencil write something and then cross the road to the shop below us i ran past laura before she could see me and said i had forgotten something upstairs as soon as i was out of the room i went down to the first landing and waited i was determined to stop him if he tried to come upstairs he made no such attempt the girl from the shop came through the door into the passage with his card in her hand a large gilt card with his name and a coronet above it and these lines underneath in pencil dear lady yes the villain could address me in that way still dear lady one word i implore you on a matter serious to us both if one can think at all in serious difficulties one thinks quick i felt directly that it might be a fatal mistake to leave myself and to leave you in the dark where such a man as the count was concerned i felt that the doubt of what he might do in your absence would be ten times more trying to me if i declined to see him than if i consented ask the gentleman to wait in the shop i said i will be with him in a moment i ran upstairs for my bonnet being determined not to let him speak to me indoors i knew his deep ringing voice and i was afraid laura might hear it even in the shop in less than a minute i was down again in the passage and had opened the door into the street he came round to meet me from the shop there he was in deep mourning with his smooth bow and his deadly smile and some idle boys and women near him staring at his great size his fine black clothes and his large cane with the gold knob to it all the horrible time at blackwater came back to me the moment i set eyes on him all the old loathing crept and crawled through me when he took off his hat with a flourish and spoke to me as if we had parted on the friendliest terms hardly a day since you remember what he said i cant repeat it walter you shall know directly what he said about you but i cant repeat what he said to me it was worse than the polite insolence of his letter my hands tingled to strike him as if i had been a man i only kept them quiet by tearing his card to pieces under my shawl without saying a word on my side i walked away from the house for fear of laura seeing us and he followed protesting softly all the way in the first bystreet i turned and asked him what he wanted with me he wanted two things first if i had no objection to express his sentiments i declined to hear them secondly to repeat the warning in his letter i asked what occasion there was for repeating it he bowed and smiled and said he would explain the explanation exactly confirmed the fears i expressed before you left us i told you if you remember that sir percival would be too headstrong to take his friends advice where you were concerned and that there was no danger to be dreaded from the count till his own interests were threatened and he was roused into acting for himself i recollect marian well so it has really turned out the count offered his advice but it was refused sir percival would only take counsel of his own violence his own obstinacy and his own hatred of you the count let him have his way first privately ascertaining in case of his own interests being threatened next where we lived you were followed walter on returning here after your first journey to hampshire by the lawyers men for some distance from the railway and by the count himself to the door of the house how he contrived to escape being seen by you he did not tell me but he found us out on that occasion and in that way having made the discovery he took no advantage of it till the news reached him of sir percivals death and then as i told you he acted for himself because he believed you would next proceed against the dead mans partner in the conspiracy he at once made his arrangements to meet the owner of the asylum in london and to take him to the place where his runaway patient was hidden believing that the results whichever way they ended would be to involve you in interminable legal disputes and difficulties and to tie your hands for all purposes of offence so far as he was concerned that was his purpose on his own confession to me the only consideration which made him hesitate at the last moment yes it is hard to acknowledge it walter and yet i must i was the only consideration no words can say how degraded i feel in my own estimation when i think of it but the one weak point in that mans iron character is the horrible admiration he feels for me i have tried for the sake of my own selfrespect to disbelieve it as long as i could but his looks his actions force on me the shameful conviction of the truth the eyes of that monster of wickedness moistened while he was speaking to me they did walter he declared that at the moment of pointing out the house to the doctor he thought of my misery if i was separated from laura of my responsibility if i was called on to answer for effecting her escape and he risked the worst that you could do to him the second time for my sake all he asked was that i would remember the sacrifice and restrain your rashness in my own interests interests which he might never be able to consult again i made no such bargain with him i would have died first but believe him or not whether it is true or false that he sent the doctor away with an excuse one thing is certain i saw the man leave him without so much as a glance at our window or even at our side of the way i believe it marian the best men are not consistent in good why should the worst men be consistent in evil at the same time i suspect him of merely attempting to frighten you by threatening what he cannot really do i doubt his power of annoying us by means of the owner of the asylum now that sir percival is dead and mrs catherick is free from all control but let me hear more what did the count say of me he spoke last of you his eyes brightened and hardened and his manner changed to what i remember it in past times to that mixture of pitiless resolution and mountebank mockery which makes it so impossible to fathom him warn mr hartright he said in his loftiest manner he has a man of brains to deal with a man who snaps his big fingers at the laws and conventions of society when he measures himself with me if my lamented friend had taken my advice the business of the inquest would have been with the body of mr hartright but my lamented friend was obstinate see i mourn his loss inwardly in my soul outwardly on my hat this trivial crape expresses sensibilities which i summon mr hartright to respect they may be transformed to immeasurable enmities if he ventures to disturb them let him be content with what he has got with what i leave unmolested for your sake to him and to you say to him with my compliments if he stirs me he has fosco to deal with in the english of the popular tongue i inform him fosco sticks at nothing dear lady good morning his cold grey eyes settled on my face he took off his hat solemnly bowed bareheaded and left me without returning without saying more last words he turned at the corner of the street and waved his hand and then struck it theatrically on his breast i lost sight of him after that he disappeared in the opposite direction to our house and i ran back to laura before i was indoors again i had made up my mind that we must go the house especially in your absence was a place of danger instead of a place of safety now that the count had discovered it if i could have felt certain of your return i should have risked waiting till you came back but i was certain of nothing and i acted at once on my own impulse you had spoken before leaving us of moving into a quieter neighbourhood and purer air for the sake of lauras health i had only to remind her of that and to suggest surprising you and saving you trouble by managing the move in your absence to make her quite as anxious for the change as i was she helped me to pack up your things and she has arranged them all for you in your new workingroom here what made you think of coming to this place my ignorance of other localities in the neighbourhood of london i felt the necessity of getting as far away as possible from our old lodgings and i knew something of fulham because i had once been at school there i despatched a messenger with a note on the chance that the school might still be in existence it was in existence the daughters of my old mistress were carrying it on for her and they engaged this place from the instructions i had sent it was just posttime when the messenger returned to me with the address of the house we moved after dark we came here quite unobserved have i done right walter have i justified your trust in me i answered her warmly and gratefully as i really felt but the anxious look still remained on her face while i was speaking and the first question she asked when i had done related to count fosco i saw that she was thinking of him now with a changed mind no fresh outbreak of anger against him no new appeal to me to hasten the day of reckoning escaped her her conviction that the mans hateful admiration of herself was really sincere seemed to have increased a hundredfold her distrust of his unfathomable cunning her inborn dread of the wicked energy and vigilance of all his faculties her voice fell low her manner was hesitating her eyes searched into mine with an eager fear when she asked me what i thought of his message and what i meant to do next after hearing it not many weeks have passed marian i answered since my interview with mr kyrle when he and i parted the last words i said to him about laura were these her uncles house shall open to receive her in the presence of every soul who followed the false funeral to the grave the lie that records her death shall be publicly erased from the tombstone by the authority of the head of the family and the two men who have wronged her shall answer for their crime to me though the justice that sits in tribunals is powerless to pursue them one of those men is beyond mortal reach the other remains and my resolution remains her eyes lit up her colour rose she said nothing but i saw all her sympathies gathering to mine in her face i dont disguise from myself or from you i went on that the prospect before us is more than doubtful the risks we have run already are it may be trifles compared with the risks that threaten us in the future but the venture shall be tried marian for all that i am not rash enough to measure myself against such a man as the count before i am well prepared for him i have learnt patience i can wait my time let him believe that his message has produced its effect let him know nothing of us and hear nothing of us let us give him full time to feel secure his own boastful nature unless i seriously mistake him will hasten that result this is one reason for waiting but there is another more important still my position marian towards you and towards laura ought to be a stronger one than it is now before i try our last chance she leaned near to me with a look of surprise how can it be stronger she asked i will tell you i replied when the time comes it has not come yet it may never come at all i may be silent about it to laura for ever i must be silent now even to you till i see for myself that i can harmlessly and honourably speak let us leave that subject there is another which has more pressing claims on our attention you have kept laura mercifully kept her in ignorance of her husbands death oh walter surely it must be long yet before we tell her of it no marian better that you should reveal it to her now than that accident which no one can guard against should reveal it to her at some future time spare her all the details break it to her very tenderly but tell her that he is dead you have a reason walter for wishing her to know of her husbands death besides the reason you have just mentioned i have a reason connected with that subject which must not be mentioned between us yet which may never be mentioned to laura at all she dwelt on the last words meaningly when i answered her in the affirmative i dwelt on them too her face grew pale for a while she looked at me with a sad hesitating interest an unaccustomed tenderness trembled in her dark eyes and softened her firm lips as she glanced aside at the empty chair in which the dear companion of all our joys and sorrows had been sitting i think i understand she said i think i owe it to her and to you walter to tell her of her husbands death she sighed and held my hand fast for a moment then dropped it abruptly and left the room on the next day laura knew that his death had released her and that the error and the calamity of her life lay buried in his tomb his name was mentioned among us no more thenceforward we shrank from the slightest approach to the subject of his death and in the same scrupulous manner marian and i avoided all further reference to that other subject which by her consent and mine was not to be mentioned between us yet it was not the less present in our minds it was rather kept alive in them by the restraint which we had imposed on ourselves we both watched laura more anxiously than ever sometimes waiting and hoping sometimes waiting and fearing till the time came by degrees we returned to our accustomed way of life i resumed the daily work which had been suspended during my absence in hampshire our new lodgings cost us more than the smaller and less convenient rooms which we had left and the claim thus implied on my increased exertions was strengthened by the doubtfulness of our future prospects emergencies might yet happen which would exhaust our little fund at the bankers and the work of my hands might be ultimately all we had to look to for support more permanent and more lucrative employment than had yet been offered to me was a necessity of our position a necessity for which i now diligently set myself to provide it must not be supposed that the interval of rest and seclusion of which i am now writing entirely suspended on my part all pursuit of the one absorbing purpose with which my thoughts and actions are associated in these pages that purpose was for months and months yet never to relax its claims on me the slow ripening of it still left me a measure of precaution to take an obligation of gratitude to perform and a doubtful question to solve the measure of precaution related necessarily to the count it was of the last importance to ascertain if possible whether his plans committed him to remaining in england or in other words to remaining within my reach i contrived to set this doubt at rest by very simple means his address in st johns wood being known to me i inquired in the neighbourhood and having found out the agent who had the disposal of the furnished house in which he lived i asked if number five forest road was likely to be let within a reasonable time the reply was in the negative i was informed that the foreign gentleman then residing in the house had renewed his term of occupation for another six months and would remain in possession until the end of june in the following year we were then at the beginning of december only i left the agent with my mind relieved from all present fear of the counts escaping me the obligation i had to perform took me once more into the presence of mrs clements i had promised to return and to confide to her those particulars relating to the death and burial of anne catherick which i had been obliged to withhold at our first interview changed as circumstances now were there was no hindrance to my trusting the good woman with as much of the story of the conspiracy as it was necessary to tell i had every reason that sympathy and friendly feeling could suggest to urge on me the speedy performance of my promise and i did conscientiously and carefully perform it there is no need to burden these pages with any statement of what passed at the interview it will be more to the purpose to say that the interview itself necessarily brought to my mind the one doubtful question still remaining to be solved the question of anne cathericks parentage on the fathers side a multitude of small considerations in connection with this subject trifling enough in themselves but strikingly important when massed together had latterly led my mind to a conclusion which i resolved to verify i obtained marians permission to write to major donthorne of varneck hall where mrs catherick had lived in service for some years previous to her marriage to ask him certain questions i made the inquiries in marians name and described them as relating to matters of personal history in her family which might explain and excuse my application when i wrote the letter i had no certain knowledge that major donthorne was still alive i despatched it on the chance that he might be living and able and willing to reply after a lapse of two days proof came in the shape of a letter that the major was living and that he was ready to help us the idea in my mind when i wrote to him and the nature of my inquiries will be easily inferred from his reply his letter answered my questions by communicating these important facts in the first place the late sir percival glyde of blackwater park had never set foot in varneck hall the deceased gentleman was a total stranger to major donthorne and to all his family in the second place the late mr philip fairlie of limmeridge house had been in his younger days the intimate friend and constant guest of major donthorne having refreshed his memory by looking back to old letters and other papers the major was in a position to say positively that mr philip fairlie was staying at varneck hall in the month of august eighteen hundred and twenty six and that he remained there for the shooting during the month of september and part of october following he then left to the best of the majors belief for scotland and did not return to varneck hall till after a lapse of time when he reappeared in the character of a newlymarried man taken by itself this statement was perhaps of little positive value but taken in connection with certain facts every one of which either marian or i knew to be true it suggested one plain conclusion that was to our minds irresistible knowing now that mr philip fairlie had been at varneck hall in the autumn of eighteen hundred and twentysix and that mrs catherick had been living there in service at the same time we knew also first that anne had been born in june eighteen hundred and twentyseven secondly that she had always presented an extraordinary personal resemblance to laura and thirdly that laura herself was strikingly like her father mr philip fairlie had been one of the notoriously handsome men of his time in disposition entirely unlike his brother frederick he was the spoilt darling of society especially of the women an easy lighthearted impulsive affectionate man generous to a fault constitutionally lax in his principles and notoriously thoughtless of moral obligations where women were concerned such were the facts we knew such was the character of the man surely the plain inference that follows needs no pointing out read by the new light which had now broken upon me even mrs cathericks letter in despite of herself rendered its mite of assistance towards strengthening the conclusion at which i had arrived she had described mrs fairlie in writing to me as plainlooking and as having entrapped the handsomest man in england into marrying her both assertions were gratuitously made and both were false jealous dislike which in such a woman as mrs catherick would express itself in petty malice rather than not express itself at all appeared to me to be the only assignable cause for the peculiar insolence of her reference to mrs fairlie under circumstances which did not necessitate any reference at all the mention here of mrs fairlies name naturally suggests one other question did she ever suspect whose child the little girl brought to her at limmeridge might be marians testimony was positive on this point mrs fairlies letter to her husband which had been read to me in former days the letter describing annes resemblance to laura and acknowledging her affectionate interest in the little stranger had been written beyond all question in perfect innocence of heart it even seemed doubtful on consideration whether mr philip fairlie himself had been nearer than his wife to any suspicion of the truth the disgracefully deceitful circumstances under which mrs catherick had married the purpose of concealment which the marriage was intended to answer might well keep her silent for cautions sake perhaps for her own prides sake also even assuming that she had the means in his absence of communicating with the father of her unborn child as this surmise floated through my mind there rose on my memory the remembrance of the scripture denunciation which we have all thought of in our time with wonder and with awe the sins of the fathers shall be visited on the children but for the fatal resemblance between the two daughters of one father the conspiracy of which anne had been the innocent instrument and laura the innocent victim could never have been planned with what unerring and terrible directness the long chain of circumstances led down from the thoughtless wrong committed by the father to the heartless injury inflicted on the child these thoughts came to me and others with them which drew my mind away to the little cumberland churchyard where anne catherick now lay buried i thought of the bygone days when i had met her by mrs fairlies grave and met her for the last time i thought of her poor helpless hands beating on the tombstone and her weary yearning words murmured to the dead remains of her protectress and her friend oh if i could die and be hidden and at rest with you little more than a year had passed since she breathed that wish and how inscrutably how awfully it had been fulfilled the words she had spoken to laura by the shores of the lake the very words had now come true oh if i could only be buried with your mother if i could only wake at her side when the angels trumpet sounds and the graves give up their dead at the resurrection through what mortal crime and horror through what darkest windings of the way down to death the lost creature had wandered in gods leading to the last home that living she never hoped to reach in that sacred rest i leave her in that dread companionship let her remain undisturbed so the ghostly figure which has haunted these pages as it haunted my life goes down into the impenetrable gloom like a shadow she first came to me in the loneliness of the night like a shadow she passes away in the loneliness of the dead iii four months elapsed april came the month of spring the month of change the course of time had flowed through the interval since the winter peacefully and happily in our new home i had turned my long leisure to good account had largely increased my sources of employment and had placed our means of subsistence on surer grounds freed from the suspense and the anxiety which had tried her so sorely and hung over her so long marians spirits rallied and her natural energy of character began to assert itself again with something if not all of the freedom and the vigour of former times more pliable under change than her sister laura showed more plainly the progress made by the healing influences of her new life the worn and wasted look which had prematurely aged her face was fast leaving it and the expression which had been the first of its charms in past days was the first of its beauties that now returned my closest observations of her detected but one serious result of the conspiracy which had once threatened her reason and her life her memory of events from the period of her leaving blackwater park to the period of our meeting in the burialground of limmeridge church was lost beyond all hope of recovery at the slightest reference to that time she changed and trembled still her words became confused her memory wandered and lost itself as helplessly as ever here and here only the traces of the past lay deep too deep to be effaced in all else she was now so far on the way to recovery that on her best and brightest days she sometimes looked and spoke like the laura of old times the happy change wrought its natural result in us both from their long slumber on her side and on mine those imperishable memories of our past life in cumberland now awoke which were one and all alike the memories of our love gradually and insensibly our daily relations towards each other became constrained the fond words which i had spoken to her so naturally in the days of her sorrow and her suffering faltered strangely on my lips in the time when my dread of losing her was most present to my mind i had always kissed her when she left me at night and when she met me in the morning the kiss seemed now to have dropped between us to be lost out of our lives our hands began to tremble again when they met we hardly ever looked long at one another out of marians presence the talk often flagged between us when we were alone when i touched her by accident i felt my heart beating fast as it used to beat at limmeridge house i saw the lovely answering flush glowing again in her cheeks as if we were back among the cumberland hills in our past characters of master and pupil once more she had long intervals of silence and thoughtfulness and denied she had been thinking when marian asked her the question i surprised myself one day neglecting my work to dream over the little watercolour portrait of her which i had taken in the summerhouse where we first met just as i used to neglect mr fairlies drawings to dream over the same likeness when it was newly finished in the bygone time changed as all the circumstances now were our position towards each other in the golden days of our first companionship seemed to be revived with the revival of our love it was as if time had drifted us back on the wreck of our early hopes to the old familiar shore to any other woman i could have spoken the decisive words which i still hesitated to speak to her the utter helplessness of her position her friendless dependence on all the forbearing gentleness that i could show her my fear of touching too soon some secret sensitiveness in her which my instinct as a man might not have been fine enough to discover these considerations and others like them kept me selfdistrustfully silent and yet i knew that the restraint on both sides must be ended that the relations in which we stood towards one another must be altered in some settled manner for the future and that it rested with me in the first instance to recognise the necessity for a change the more i thought of our position the harder the attempt to alter it appeared while the domestic conditions on which we three had been living together since the winter remained undisturbed i cannot account for the capricious state of mind in which this feeling originated but the idea nevertheless possessed me that some previous change of place and circumstances some sudden break in the quiet monotony of our lives so managed as to vary the home aspect under which we had been accustomed to see each other might prepare the way for me to speak and might make it easier and less embarrassing for laura and marian to hear with this purpose in view i said one morning that i thought we had all earned a little holiday and a change of scene after some consideration it was decided that we should go for a fortnight to the seaside on the next day we left fulham for a quiet town on the south coast at that early season of the year we were the only visitors in the place the cliffs the beach and the walks inland were all in the solitary condition which was most welcome to us the air was mild the prospects over hill and wood and down were beautifully varied by the shifting april light and shade and the restless sea leapt under our windows as if it felt like the land the glow and freshness of spring i owed it to marian to consult her before i spoke to laura and to be guided afterwards by her advice on the third day from our arrival i found a fit opportunity of speaking to her alone the moment we looked at one another her quick instinct detected the thought in my mind before i could give it expression with her customary energy and directness she spoke at once and spoke first you are thinking of that subject which was mentioned between us on the evening of your return from hampshire she said i have been expecting you to allude to it for some time past there must be a change in our little household walter we cannot go on much longer as we are now i see it as plainly as you do as plainly as laura sees it though she says nothing how strangely the old times in cumberland seem to have come back you and i are together again and the one subject of interest between us is laura once more i could almost fancy that this room is the summerhouse at limmeridge and that those waves beyond us are beating on our seashore i was guided by your advice in those past days i said and now marian with reliance tenfold greater i will be guided by it again she answered by pressing my hand i saw that she was deeply touched by my reference to the past we sat together near the window and while i spoke and she listened we looked at the glory of the sunlight shining on the majesty of the sea whatever comes of this confidence between us i said whether it ends happily or sorrowfully for me lauras interests will still be the interests of my life when we leave this place on whatever terms we leave it my determination to wrest from count fosco the confession which i failed to obtain from his accomplice goes back with me to london as certainly as i go back myself neither you nor i can tell how that man may turn on me if i bring him to bay we only know by his own words and actions that he is capable of striking at me through laura without a moments hesitation or a moments remorse in our present position i have no claim on her which society sanctions which the law allows to strengthen me in resisting him and in protecting her this places me at a serious disadvantage if i am to fight our cause with the count strong in the consciousness of lauras safety i must fight it for my wife do you agree to that marian so far to every word of it she answered i will not plead out of my own heart i went on i will not appeal to the love which has survived all changes and all shocks i will rest my only vindication of myself for thinking of her and speaking of her as my wife on what i have just said if the chance of forcing a confession from the count is as i believe it to be the last chance left of publicly establishing the fact of lauras existence the least selfish reason that i can advance for our marriage is recognised by us both but i may be wrong in my conviction other means of achieving our purpose may be in our power which are less uncertain and less dangerous i have searched anxiously in my own mind for those means and i have not found them have you no i have thought about it too and thought in vain in all likelihood i continued the same questions have occurred to you in considering this difficult subject which have occurred to me ought we to return with her to limmeridge now that she is like herself again and trust to the recognition of her by the people of the village or by the children at the school ought we to appeal to the practical test of her handwriting suppose we did so suppose the recognition of her obtained and the identity of the handwriting established would success in both those cases do more than supply an excellent foundation for a trial in a court of law would the recognition and the handwriting prove her identity to mr fairlie and take her back to limmeridge house against the evidence of her aunt against the evidence of the medical certificate against the fact of the funeral and the fact of the inscription on the tomb no we could only hope to succeed in throwing a serious doubt on the assertion of her death a doubt which nothing short of a legal inquiry can settle i will assume that we possess what we have certainly not got money enough to carry this inquiry on through all its stages i will assume that mr fairlies prejudices might be reasoned away that the false testimony of the count and his wife and all the rest of the false testimony might be confuted that the recognition could not possibly be ascribed to a mistake between laura and anne catherick or the handwriting be declared by our enemies to be a clever fraud all these are assumptions which more or less set plain probabilities at defiance but let them pass and let us ask ourselves what would be the first consequence or the first questions put to laura herself on the subject of the conspiracy we know only too well what the consequence would be for we know that she has never recovered her memory of what happened to her in london examine her privately or examine her publicly she is utterly incapable of assisting the assertion of her own case if you dont see this marian as plainly as i see it we will go to limmeridge and try the experiment tomorrow i do see it walter even if we had the means of paying all the law expenses even if we succeeded in the end the delays would be unendurable the perpetual suspense after what we have suffered already would be heartbreaking you are right about the hopelessness of going to limmeridge i wish i could feel sure that you are right also in determining to try that last chance with the count is it a chance at all beyond a doubt yes it is the chance of recovering the lost date of lauras journey to london without returning to the reasons i gave you some time since i am still as firmly persuaded as ever that there is a discrepancy between the date of that journey and the date on the certificate of death there lies the weak point of the whole conspiracy it crumbles to pieces if we attack it in that way and the means of attacking it are in possession of the count if i succeed in wresting them from him the object of your life and mine is fulfilled if i fail the wrong that laura has suffered will in this world never be redressed do you fear failure yourself walter i dare not anticipate success and for that very reason marian i speak openly and plainly as i have spoken now in my heart and my conscience i can say it lauras hopes for the future are at their lowest ebb i know that her fortune is gone i know that the last chance of restoring her to her place in the world lies at the mercy of her worst enemy of a man who is now absolutely unassailable and who may remain unassailable to the end with every worldly advantage gone from her with all prospect of recovering her rank and station more than doubtful with no clearer future before her than the future which her husband can provide the poor drawingmaster may harmlessly open his heart at last in the days of her prosperity marian i was only the teacher who guided her hand i ask for it in her adversity as the hand of my wife marians eyes met mine affectionately i could say no more my heart was full my lips were trembling in spite of myself i was in danger of appealing to her pity i got up to leave the room she rose at the same moment laid her hand gently on my shoulder and stopped me walter she said i once parted you both for your good and for hers wait here my brother wait my dearest best friend till laura comes and tells you what i have done now for the first time since the farewell morning at limmeridge she touched my forehead with her lips a tear dropped on my face as she kissed me she turned quickly pointed to the chair from which i had risen and left the room i sat down alone at the window to wait through the crisis of my life my mind in that breathless interval felt like a total blank i was conscious of nothing but a painful intensity of all familiar perceptions the sun grew blinding bright the white sea birds chasing each other far beyond me seemed to be flitting before my face the mellow murmur of the waves on the beach was like thunder in my ears the door opened and laura came in alone so she had entered the breakfastroom at limmeridge house on the morning when we parted slowly and falteringly in sorrow and in hesitation she had once approached me now she came with the haste of happiness in her feet with the light of happiness radiant in her face of their own accord those dear arms clasped themselves round me of their own accord the sweet lips came to meet mine my darling she whispered we may own we love each other now her head nestled with a tender contentedness on my bosom oh she said innocently i am so happy at last ten days later we were happier still we were married iv the course of this narrative steadily flowing on bears me away from the morningtime of our married life and carries me forward to the end in a fortnight more we three were back in london and the shadow was stealing over us of the struggle to come marian and i were careful to keep laura in ignorance of the cause that had hurried us back the necessity of making sure of the count it was now the beginning of may and his term of occupation at the house in forest road expired in june if he renewed it and i had reasons shortly to be mentioned for anticipating that he would i might be certain of his not escaping me but if by any chance he disappointed my expectations and left the country then i had no time to lose in arming myself to meet him as i best might in the first fulness of my new happiness there had been moments when my resolution faltered moments when i was tempted to be safely content now that the dearest aspiration of my life was fulfilled in the possession of lauras love for the first time i thought faintheartedly of the greatness of the risk of the adverse chances arrayed against me of the fair promise of our new life and of the peril in which i might place the happiness which we had so hardly earned yes let me own it honestly for a brief time i wandered in the sweet guiding of love far from the purpose to which i had been true under sterner discipline and in darker days innocently laura had tempted me aside from the hard path innocently she was destined to lead me back again at times dreams of the terrible past still disconnectedly recalled to her in the mystery of sleep the events of which her waking memory had lost all trace one night barely two weeks after our marriage when i was watching her at rest i saw the tears come slowly through her closed eyelids i heard the faint murmuring words escape her which told me that her spirit was back again on the fatal journey from blackwater park that unconscious appeal so touching and so awful in the sacredness of her sleep ran through me like fire the next day was the day we came back to london the day when my resolution returned to me with tenfold strength the first necessity was to know something of the man thus far the true story of his life was an impenetrable mystery to me i began with such scanty sources of information as were at my own disposal the important narrative written by mr frederick fairlie which marian had obtained by following the directions i had given to her in the winter proved to be of no service to the special object with which i now looked at it while reading it i reconsidered the disclosure revealed to me by mrs clements of the series of deceptions which had brought anne catherick to london and which had there devoted her to the interests of the conspiracy here again the count had not openly committed himself here again he was to all practical purpose out of my reach i next returned to marians journal at blackwater park at my request she read to me again a passage which referred to her past curiosity about the count and to the few particulars which she had discovered relating to him the passage to which i allude occurs in that part of her journal which delineates his character and his personal appearance she describes him as not having crossed the frontiers of his native country for years past as anxious to know if any italian gentlemen were settled in the nearest town to blackwater park as receiving letters with all sorts of odd stamps on them and one with a large officiallooking seal on it she is inclined to consider that his long absence from his native country may be accounted for by assuming that he is a political exile but she is on the other hand unable to reconcile this idea with the reception of the letter from abroad bearing the large official looking seal letters from the continent addressed to political exiles being usually the last to court attention from foreign postoffices in that way the considerations thus presented to me in the diary joined to certain surmises of my own that grew out of them suggested a conclusion which i wondered i had not arrived at before i now said to myself what laura had once said to marian at blackwater park what madame fosco had overheard by listening at the door the count is a spy laura had applied the word to him at hazard in natural anger at his proceedings towards herself i applied it to him with the deliberate conviction that his vocation in life was the vocation of a spy on this assumption the reason for his extraordinary stay in england so long after the objects of the conspiracy had been gained became to my mind quite intelligible the year of which i am now writing was the year of the famous crystal palace exhibition in hyde park foreigners in unusually large numbers had arrived already and were still arriving in england men were among us by hundreds whom the ceaseless distrustfulness of their governments had followed privately by means of appointed agents to our shores my surmises did not for a moment class a man of the counts abilities and social position with the ordinary rank and file o foreign spies i suspected him of holding a position of authority of being entrusted by the government which he secretly served with the organisation and management of agents specially employed in this country both men and women and i believed mrs rubelle who had been so opportunely found to act as nurse at blackwater park to be in all probability one of the number assuming that this idea of mine had a foundation in truth the position of the count might prove to be more assailable than i had hitherto ventured to hope to whom could i apply to know something more of the mans history and of the man himself than i knew now in this emergency it naturally occurred to my mind that a countryman of his own on whom i could rely might be the fittest person to help me the first man whom i thought of under these circumstances was also the only italian with whom i was intimately acquainted my quaint little friend professor pesca the professor has been so long absent from these pages that he has run some risk of being forgotten altogether it is the necessary law of such a story as mine that the persons concerned in it only appear when the course of events takes them up they come and go not by favour of my personal partiality but by right of their direct connection with the circumstances to be detailed for this reason not pesca alone but my mother and sister as well have been left far in the background of the narrative my visits to the hampstead cottage my mothers belief in the denial of lauras identity which the conspiracy had accomplished my vain efforts to overcome the prejudice on her part and on my sisters to which in their jealous affection for me they both continued to adhere the painful necessity which that prejudice imposed on me of concealing my marriage from them till they had learnt to do justice to my wife all these little domestic occurrences have been left unrecorded because they were not essential to the main interest of the story it is nothing that they added to my anxieties and embittered my disappointments the steady march of events has inexorably passed them by for the same reason i have said nothing here of the consolation that i found in pescas brotherly affection for me when i saw him again after the sudden cessation of my residence at limmeridge house i have not recorded the fidelity with which my warm hearted little friend followed me to the place of embarkation when i sailed for central america or the noisy transport of joy with which he received me when we next met in london if i had felt justified in accepting the offers of service which he made to me on my return he would have appeared again long ere this but though i knew that his honour and his courage were to be implicitly relied on i was not so sure that his discretion was to be trusted and for that reason only i followed the course of all my inquiries alone it will now be sufficiently understood that pesca was not separated from all connection with me and my interests although he has hitherto been separated from all connection with the progress of this narrative he was as true and as ready a friend of mine still as ever he had been in his life before i summoned pesca to my assistance it was necessary to see for myself what sort of man i had to deal with up to this time i had never once set eyes on count fosco three days after my return with laura and marian to london i set forth alone for forest road st johns wood between ten and eleven oclock in the morning it was a fine day i had some hours to spare and i thought it likely if i waited a little for him that the count might be tempted out i had no great reason to fear the chance of his recognising me in the daytime for the only occasion when i had been seen by him was the occasion on which he had followed me home at night no one appeared at the windows in the front of the house i walked down a turning which ran past the side of it and looked over the low garden wall one of the back windows on the lower floor was thrown up and a net was stretched across the opening i saw nobody but i heard in the room first a shrill whistling and singing of birds then the deep ringing voice which marians description had made familiar to me come out on my little finger my pretpretpretties cried the voice come out and hop upstairs one two three and up three two one and down one two three twittwittwittweet the count was exercising his canaries as he used to exercise them in marians time at blackwater park i waited a little while and the singing and the whistling ceased come kiss me my pretties said the deep voice there was a responsive twittering and chirping a low oily laugh a silence of a minute or so and then i heard the opening of the house door i turned and retraced my steps the magnificent melody of the prayer in rossinis moses sung in a sonorous bass voice rose grandly through the suburban silence of the place the front garden gate opened and closed the count had come out he crossed the road and walked towards the western boundary of the regents park i kept on my own side of the way a little behind him and walked in that direction also marian had prepared me for his high stature his monstrous corpulence and his ostentatious mourning garments but not for the horrible freshness and cheerfulness and vitality of the man he carried his sixty years as if they had been fewer than forty he sauntered along wearing his hat a little on one side with a light jaunty step swinging his big stick humming to himself looking up from time to time at the houses and gardens on either side of him with superb smiling patronage if a stranger had been told that the whole neighbourhood belonged to him that stranger would not have been surprised to hear it he never looked back he paid no apparent attention to me no apparent attention to any one who passed him on his own side of the road except now and then when he smiled and smirked with an easy paternal good humour at the nurserymaids and the children whom he met in this way he led me on till we reached a colony of shops outside the western terraces of the park here he stopped at a pastrycooks went in probably to give an order and came out again immediately with a tart in his hand an italian was grinding an organ before the shop and a miserable little shrivelled monkey was sitting on the instrument the count stopped bit a piece for himself out of the tart and gravely handed the rest to the monkey my poor little man he said with grotesque tenderness you look hungry in the sacred name of humanity i offer you some lunch the organgrinder piteously put in his claim to a penny from the benevolent stranger the count shrugged his shoulders contemptuously and passed on we reached the streets and the better class of shops between the new road and oxford street the count stopped again and entered a small opticians shop with an inscription in the window announcing that repairs were neatly executed inside he came out again with an operaglass in his hand walked a few paces on and stopped to look at a bill of the opera placed outside a music sellers shop he read the bill attentively considered a moment and then hailed an empty cab as it passed him opera box office he said to the man and was driven away i crossed the road and looked at the bill in my turn the performance announced was lucrezia borgia and it was to take place that evening the operaglass in the counts hand his careful reading of the bill and his direction to the cabman all suggested that he proposed making one of the audience i had the means of getting an admission for myself and a friend to the pit by applying to one of the scenepainters attached to the theatre with whom i had been well acquainted in past times there was a chance at least that the count might be easily visible among the audience to me and to any one with me and in this case i had the means of ascertaining whether pesca knew his countryman or not that very night this consideration at once decided the disposal of my evening i procured the tickets leaving a note at the professors lodgings on the way at a quarter to eight i called to take him with me to the theatre my little friend was in a state of the highest excitement with a festive flower in his buttonhole and the largest operaglass i ever saw hugged up under his arm are you ready i asked rightallright said pesca we started for the theatre v the last notes of the introduction to the opera were being played and the seats in the pit were all filled when pesca and i reached the theatre there was plenty of room however in the passage that ran round the pit precisely the position best calculated to answer the purpose for which i was attending the performance i went first to the barrier separating us from the stalls and looked for the count in that part of the theatre he was not there returning along the passage on the lefthand side from the stage and looking about me attentively i discovered him in the pit he occupied an excellent place some twelve or fourteen seats from the end of a bench within three rows of the stalls i placed myself exactly on a line with him pesca standing by my side the professor was not yet aware of the purpose for which i had brought him to the theatre and he was rather surprised that we did not move nearer to the stage the curtain rose and the opera began throughout the whole of the first act we remained in our position the count absorbed by the orchestra and the stage never casting so much as a chance glance at us not a note of donizettis delicious music was lost on him there he sat high above his neighbours smiling and nodding his great head enjoyingly from time to time when the people near him applauded the close of an air as an english audience in such circumstances always will applaud without the least consideration for the orchestral movement which immediately followed it he looked round at them with an expression of compassionate remonstrance and held up one hand with a gesture of polite entreaty at the more refined passages of the singing at the more delicate phases of the music which passed unapplauded by others his fat hands adorned with perfectlyfitting black kid gloves softly patted each other in token of the cultivated appreciation of a musical man at such times his oily murmur of approval bravo braaaa hummed through the silence like the purring of a great cat his immediate neighbours on either side hearty ruddyfaced people from the country basking amazedly in the sunshine of fashionable london seeing and hearing him began to follow his lead many a burst of applause from the pit that night started from the soft comfortable patting of the blackgloved hands the mans voracious vanity devoured this implied tribute to his local and critical supremacy with an appearance of the highest relish smiles rippled continuously over his fat face he looked about him at the pauses in the music serenely satisfied with himself and his fellowcreatures yes yes these barbarous english people are learning something from me here there and everywhere i fosco am an influence that is felt a man who sits supreme if ever face spoke his face spoke then and that was its language the curtain fell on the first act and the audience rose to look about them this was the time i had waited for the time to try if pesca knew him he rose with the rest and surveyed the occupants of the boxes grandly with his operaglass at first his back was towards us but he turned round in time to our side of the theatre and looked at the boxes above us using his glass for a few minutes then removing it but still continuing to look up this was the moment i chose when his full face was in view for directing pescas attention to him do you know that man i asked which man my friend the tall fat man standing there with his face towards us pesca raised himself on tiptoe and looked at the count no said the professor the big fat man is a stranger to me is he famous why do you point him out because i have particular reasons for wishing to know something of him he is a countryman of yours his name is count fosco do you know that name not i walter neither the name nor the man is known to me are you quite sure you dont recognise him look again look carefully i will tell you why i am so anxious about it when we leave the theatre stop let me help you up here where you can see him better i helped the little man to perch himself on the edge of the raised dais upon which the pitseats were all placed his small stature was no hindrance to him here he could see over the heads of the ladies who were seated near the outermost part of the bench a slim lighthaired man standing by us whom i had not noticed before a man with a scar on his left cheek looked attentively at pesca as i helped him up and then looked still more attentively following the direction of pescas eyes at the count our conversation might have reached his ears and might as it struck me have roused his curiosity meanwhile pesca fixed his eyes earnestly on the broad full smiling face turned a little upward exactly opposite to him no he said i have never set my two eyes on that big fat man before in all my life as he spoke the count looked downwards towards the boxes behind us on the pit tier the eyes of the two italians met the instant before i had been perfectly satisfied from his own reiterated assertion that pesca did not know the count the instant afterwards i was equally certain that the count knew pesca knew him and more surprising still feared him as well there was no mistaking the change that passed over the villains face the leaden hue that altered his yellow complexion in a moment the sudden rigidity of all his features the furtive scrutiny of his cold grey eyes the motionless stillness of him from head to foot told their own tale a mortal dread had mastered him body and soul and his own recognition of pesca was the cause of it the slim man with the scar on his cheek was still close by us he had apparently drawn his inference from the effect produced on the count by the sight of pesca as i had drawn mine he was a mild gentlemanlike man looking like a foreigner and his interest in our proceedings was not expressed in anything approaching to an offensive manner for my own part i was so startled by the change in the counts face so astounded at the entirely unexpected turn which events had taken that i knew neither what to say or do next pesca roused me by stepping back to his former place at my side and speaking first how the fat man stares he exclaimed is it at me am i famous how can he know me when i dont know him i kept my eye still on the count i saw him move for the first time when pesca moved so as not to lose sight of the little man in the lower position in which he now stood i was curious to see what would happen if pescas attention under these circumstances was withdrawn from him and i accordingly asked the professor if he recognised any of his pupils that evening among the ladies in the boxes pesca immediately raised the large operaglass to his eyes and moved it slowly all round the upper part of the theatre searching for his pupils with the most conscientious scrutiny the moment he showed himself to be thus engaged the count turned round slipped past the persons who occupied seats on the farther side of him from where we stood and disappeared in the middle passage down the centre of the pit i caught pesca by the arm and to his inexpressible astonishment hurried him round with me to the back of the pit to intercept the count before he could get to the door somewhat to my surprise the slim man hastened out before us avoiding a stoppage caused by some people on our side of the pit leaving their places by which pesca and myself were delayed when we reached the lobby the count had disappeared and the foreigner with the scar was gone too come home i said come home pesca to your lodgings i must speak to you in private i must speak directly mysoulblessmysoul cried the professor in a state of the extremest bewilderment what on earth is the matter i walked on rapidly without answering the circumstances under which the count had left the theatre suggested to me that his extraordinary anxiety to escape pesca might carry him to further extremities still he might escape me too by leaving london i doubted the future if i allowed him so much as a days freedom to act as he pleased and i doubted that foreign stranger who had got the start of us and whom i suspected of intentionally following him out with this double distrust in my mind i was not long in making pesca understand what i wanted as soon as we two were alone in his room i increased his confusion and amazement a hundredfold by telling him what my purpose was as plainly and unreservedly as i have acknowledged it here my friend what can i do cried the professor piteously appealing to me with both hands deucewhatthedeuce how can i help you walter when i dont know the man he knows you he is afraid of you he has left the theatre to escape you pesca there must be a reason for this look back into your own life before you came to england you left italy as you have told me yourself for political reasons you have never mentioned those reasons to me and i dont inquire into them now i only ask you to consult your own recollections and to say if they suggest no past cause for the terror which the first sight of you produced in that man to my unutterable surprise these words harmless as they appeared to me produced the same astounding effect on pesca which the sight of pesca had produced on the count the rosy face of my little friend whitened in an instant and he drew back from me slowly trembling from head to foot walter he said you dont know what you ask he spoke in a whisper he looked at me as if i had suddenly revealed to him some hidden danger to both of us in less than one minute of time he was so altered from the easy lively quaint little man of all my past experience that if i had met him in the street changed as i saw him now i should most certainly not have known him again forgive me if i have unintentionally pained and shocked you i replied remember the cruel wrong my wife has suffered at count foscos hands remember that the wrong can never be redressed unless the means are in my power of forcing him to do her justice i spoke in her interests pesca i ask you again to forgive me i can say no more i rose to go he stopped me before i reached the door wait he said you have shaken me from head to foot you dont know how i left my country and why i left my country let me compose myself let me think if i can i returned to my chair he walked up and down the room talking to himself incoherently in his own language after several turns backwards and forwards he suddenly came up to me and laid his little hands with a strange tenderness and solemnity on my breast on your heart and soul walter he said is there no other way to get to that man but the chanceway through me there is no other way i answered he left me again opened the door of the room and looked out cautiously into the passage closed it once more and came back you won your right over me walter he said on the day when you saved my life it was yours from that moment when you pleased to take it take it now yes i mean what i say my next words as true as the good god is above us will put my life into your hands the trembling earnestness with which he uttered this extraordinary warning carried with it to my mind the conviction that he spoke the truth mind this he went on shaking his hands at me in the vehemence of his agitation i hold no thread in my own mind between that man fosco and the past time which i call back to me for your sake if you find the thread keep it to yourself tell me nothing on my knees i beg and pray let me be ignorant let me be innocent let me be blind to all the future as i am now he said a few words more hesitatingly and disconnectedly then stopped again i saw that the effort of expressing himself in english on an occasion too serious to permit him the use of the quaint turns and phrases of his ordinary vocabulary was painfully increasing the difficulty he had felt from the first in speaking to me at all having learnt to read and understand his native language though not to speak it in the earlier days of our intimate companionship i now suggested to him that he should express himself in italian while i used english in putting any questions which might be necessary to my enlightenment he accepted the proposal in his smoothflowing language spoken with a vehement agitation which betrayed itself in the perpetual working of his features in the wildness and the suddenness of his foreign gesticulations but never in the raising of his voice i now heard the words which armed me to meet the last struggle that is left for this story to record it is only right to mention here that i repeat pescos statement to me with the careful suppressions and alterations which the serious nature of the subject and my own sense of duty to my friend demand my first and last concealments from the reader are those which caution renders absolutely necessary in this portion of the narrative you know nothing of my motive for leaving italy he began except that it was for political reasons if i had been driven to this country by the persecution of my government i should not have kept those reasons a secret from you or from any one i have concealed them because no government authority has pronounced the sentence of my exile you have heard walter of the political societies that are hidden in every great city on the continent of europe to one of those societies i belonged in italy and belong still in england when i came to this country i came by the direction of my chief i was overzealous in my younger time i ran the risk of compromising myself and others for those reasons i was ordered to emigrate to england and to wait i emigrated i have waited i wait still tomorrow i may be called away ten years hence i may be called away it is all one to me i am here i support myself by teaching and i wait i violate no oath you shall hear why presently in making my confidence complete by telling you the name of the society to which i belong all i do is to put my life in your hands if what i say to you now is ever known by others to have passed my lips as certainly as we two sit here i am a dead man he whispered the next words in my ear i keep the secret which he thus communicated the society to which he belonged will be sufficiently individualised for the purpose of these pages if i call it the brotherhood on the few occasions when any reference to the subject will be needed in this place the object of the brotherhood pesca went on is briefly the object of other political societies of the same sort the destruction of tyranny and the assertion of the rights of the people the principles of the brotherhood are two so long as a mans life is useful or even harmless only he has the right to enjoy it but if his life inflicts injury on the wellbeing of his fellowmen from that moment he forfeits the right and it is not only no crime but a positive merit to deprive him of it it is not for me to say in what frightful circumstances of oppression and suffering this society took its rise it is not for you to say you englishmen who have conquered your freedom so long ago that you have conveniently forgotten what blood you shed and what extremities you proceeded to in the conquering it is not for you to say how far the worst of all exasperations may or may not carry the maddened men of an enslaved nation the iron that has entered into our souls has gone too deep for you to find it leave the refugee alone laugh at him distrust him open your eyes in wonder at that secret self which smoulders in him sometimes under the everyday respectability and tranquillity of a man like me sometimes under the grinding poverty the fierce squalor of men less lucky less pliable less patient than i am but judge us not in the time of your first charles you might have done us justice the long luxury of your own freedom has made you incapable of doing us justice now all the deepest feelings of his nature seemed to force themselves to the surface in those words all his heart was poured out to me for the first time in our lives but still his voice never rose still his dread of the terrible revelation he was making to me never left him so far he resumed you think the society like other societies its object in your english opinion is anarchy and revolution it takes the life of a bad king or a bad minister as if the one and the other were dangerous wild beasts to be shot at the first opportunity i grant you this but the laws of the brotherhood are the laws of no other political society on the face of the earth the members are not known to one another there is a president in italy there are presidents abroad each of these has his secretary the presidents and the secretaries know the members but the members among themselves are all strangers until their chiefs see fit in the political necessity of the time or in the private necessity of the society to make them known to each other with such a safeguard as this there is no oath among us on admittance we are identified with the brotherhood by a secret mark which we all bear which lasts while our lives last we are told to go about our ordinary business and to report ourselves to the president or the secretary four times a year in the event of our services being required we are warned if we betray the brotherhood or if we injure it by serving other interests that we die by the principles of the brotherhood die by the hand of a stranger who may be sent from the other end of the world to strike the blow or by the hand of our own bosomfriend who may have been a member unknown to us through all the years of our intimacy sometimes the death is delayed sometimes it follows close on the treachery it is our first business to know how to wait our second business to know how to obey when the word is spoken some of us may wait our lives through and may not be wanted some of us may be called to the work or to the preparation for the work the very day of our admission i myself the little easy cheerful man you know who of his own accord would hardly lift up his handkerchief to strike down the fly that buzzes about his face i in my younger time under provocation so dreadful that i will not tell you of it entered the brotherhood by an impulse as i might have killed myself by an impulse i must remain in it now it has got me whatever i may think of it in my better circumstances and my cooler manhood to my dying day while i was still in italy i was chosen secretary and all the members of that time who were brought face to face with my president were brought face to face also with me i began to understand him i saw the end towards which his extraordinary disclosure was now tending he waited a moment watching me earnestly watching till he had evidently guessed what was passing in my mind before he resumed you have drawn your own conclusion already he said i see it in your face tell me nothing keep me out of the secret of your thoughts let me make my one last sacrifice of myself for your sake and then have done with this subject never to return to it again he signed to me not to answer him rose removed his coat and rolled up the shirtsleeve on his left arm i promised you that this confidence should be complete he whispered speaking close at my ear with his eyes looking watchfully at the door whatever comes of it you shall not reproach me with having hidden anything from you which it was necessary to your interests to know i have said that the brotherhood identifies its members by a mark that lasts for life see the place and the mark on it for yourself he raised his bare arm and showed me high on the upper part of it and in the inner side a brand deeply burnt in the flesh and stained of a bright bloodred colour i abstain from describing the device which the brand represented it will be sufficient to say that it was circular in form and so small that it would have been completely covered by a shilling coin a man who has this mark branded in this place he said covering his arm again is a member of the brotherhood a man who has been false to the brotherhood is discovered sooner or later by the chiefs who know him presidents or secretaries as the case may be and a man discovered by the chiefs is dead no human laws can protect him remember what you have seen and heard draw what conclusions you like act as you please but in the name of god whatever you discover whatever you do tell me nothing let me remain free from a responsibility which it horrifies me to think of which i know in my conscience is not my responsibility now for the last time i say it on my honour as a gentleman on my oath as a christian if the man you pointed out at the opera knows me he is so altered or so disguised that i do not know him i am ignorant of his proceedings or his purposes in england i never saw him i never heard the name he goes by to my knowledge before tonight i say no more leave me a little walter i am overpowered by what has happened i am shaken by what i have said let me try to be like myself again when we meet next he dropped into a chair and turning away from me hid his face in his hands i gently opened the door so as not to disturb him and spoke my few parting words in low tones which he might hear or not as he pleased i will keep the memory of tonight in my heart of hearts i said you shall never repent the trust you have reposed in me may i come to you tomorrow may i come as early as nine oclock yes walter he replied looking up at me kindly and speaking in english once more as if his one anxiety now was to get back to our former relations towards each other come to my little bit of breakfast before i go my ways among the pupils that i teach goodnight pesca goodnight my friend vi my first conviction as soon as i found myself outside the house was that no alternative was left me but to act at once on the information i had received to make sure of the count that night or to risk the loss if i only delayed till the morning of lauras last chance i looked at my watch it was ten oclock not the shadow of a doubt crossed my mind of the purpose for which the count had left the theatre his escape from us that evening was beyond all question the preliminary only to his escape from london the mark of the brotherhood was on his arm i felt as certain of it as if he had shown me the brand and the betrayal of the brotherhood was on his conscience i had seen it in his recognition of pesca it was easy to understand why that recognition had not been mutual a man of the counts character would never risk the terrible consequences of turning spy without looking to his personal security quite as carefully as he looked to his golden reward the shaven face which i had pointed out at the opera might have been covered by a beard in pescas time his dark brown hair might be a wig his name was evidently a false one the accident of time might have helped him as well his immense corpulence might have come with his later years there was every reason why pesca should not have known him again every reason also why he should have known pesca whose singular personal appearance made a marked man of him go where he might i have said that i felt certain of the purpose in the counts mind when he escaped us at the theatre how could i doubt it when i saw with my own eyes that he believed himself in spite of the change in his appearance to have been recognised by pesca and to be therefore in danger of his life if i could get speech of him that night if i could show him that i too knew of the mortal peril in which he stood what result would follow plainly this one of us must be master of the situation one of us must inevitably be at the mercy of the other i owed it to myself to consider the chances against me before i confronted them i owed it to my wife to do all that lay in my power to lessen the risk the chances against me wanted no reckoning up they were all merged in one if the count discovered by my own avowal that the direct way to his safety lay through my life he was probably the last man in existence who would shrink from throwing me off my guard and taking that way when he had me alone within his reach the only means of defence against him on which i could at all rely to lessen the risk presented themselves after a little careful thinking clearly enough before i made any personal acknowledgment of my discovery in his presence i must place the discovery itself where it would be ready for instant use against him and safe from any attempt at suppression on his part if i laid the mine under his feet before i approached him and if i left instructions with a third person to fire it on the expiration of a certain time unless directions to the contrary were previously received under my own hand or from my own lips in that event the counts security was absolutely dependent upon mine and i might hold the vantage ground over him securely even in his own house this idea occurred to me when i was close to the new lodgings which we had taken on returning from the seaside i went in without disturbing any one by the help of my key a light was in the hall and i stole up with it to my workroom to make my preparations and absolutely to commit myself to an interview with the count before either laura or marian could have the slightest suspicion of what i intended to do a letter addressed to pesca represented the surest measure of precaution which it was now possible for me to take i wrote as follows the man whom i pointed out to you at the opera is a member of the brotherhood and has been false to his trust put both these assertions to the test instantly you know the name he goes by in england his address is no forest road st johns wood on the love you once bore me use the power entrusted to you without mercy and without delay against that man i have risked all and lost all and the forfeit of my failure has been paid with my life i signed and dated these lines enclosed them in an envelope and sealed it up on the outside i wrote this direction keep the enclosure unopened until nine oclock tomorrow morning if you do not hear from me or see me before that time break the seal when the clock strikes and read the contents i added my initials and protected the whole by enclosing it in a second sealed envelope addressed to pesca at his lodgings nothing remained to be done after this but to find the means of sending my letter to its destination immediately i should then have accomplished all that lay in my power if anything happened to me in the counts house i had now provided for his answering it with his life that the means of preventing his escape under any circumstances whatever were at pescas disposal if he chose to exert them i did not for an instant doubt the extraordinary anxiety which he had expressed to remain unenlightened as to the counts identity or in other words to be left uncertain enough about facts to justify him to his own conscience in remaining passive betrayed plainly that the means of exercising the terrible justice of the brotherhood were ready to his hand although as a naturally humane man he had shrunk from plainly saying as much in my presence the deadly certainty with which the vengeance of foreign political societies can hunt down a traitor to the cause hide himself where he may had been too often exemplified even in my superficial experience to allow of any doubt considering the subject only as a reader of newspapers cases recurred to my memory both in london and in paris of foreigners found stabbed in the streets whose assassins could never be traced of bodies and parts of bodies thrown into the thames and the seine by hands that could never be discovered of deaths by secret violence which could only be accounted for in one way i have disguised nothing relating to myself in these pages and i do not disguise here that i believed i had written count foscos deathwarrant if the fatal emergency happened which authorised pesca to open my enclosure i left my room to go down to the ground floor of the house and speak to the landlord about finding me a messenger he happened to be ascending the stairs at the time and we met on the landing his son a quick lad was the messenger he proposed to me on hearing what i wanted we had the boy upstairs and i gave him his directions he was to take the letter in a cab to put it into professor pescas own hands and to bring me back a line of acknowledgment from that gentleman returning in the cab and keeping it at the door for my use it was then nearly halfpast ten i calculated that the boy might be back in twenty minutes and that i might drive to st johns wood on his return in twenty minutes more when the lad had departed on his errand i returned to my own room for a little while to put certain papers in order so that they might be easily found in case of the worst the key of the old fashioned bureau in which the papers were kept i sealed up and left it on my table with marians name written on the outside of the little packet this done i went downstairs to the sitting room in which i expected to find laura and marian awaiting my return from the opera i felt my hand trembling for the first time when i laid it on the lock of the door no one was in the room but marian she was reading and she looked at her watch in surprise when i came in how early you are back she said you must have come away before the opera was over yes i replied neither pesca nor i waited for the end where is laura she had one of her bad headaches this evening and i advised her to go to bed when we had done tea i left the room again on the pretext of wishing to see whether laura was asleep marians quick eyes were beginning to look inquiringly at my face marians quick instinct was beginning to discover that i had something weighing on my mind when i entered the bedchamber and softly approached the bedside by the dim flicker of the nightlamp my wife was asleep we had not been married quite a month yet if my heart was heavy if my resolution for a moment faltered again when i looked at her face turned faithfully to my pillow in her sleep when i saw her hand resting open on the coverlid as if it was waiting unconsciously for mine surely there was some excuse for me i only allowed myself a few minutes to kneel down at the bedside and to look close at her so close that her breath as it came and went fluttered on my face i only touched her hand and her cheek with my lips at parting she stirred in her sleep and murmured my name but without waking i lingered for an instant at the door to look at her again god bless and keep you my darling i whispered and left her marian was at the stairhead waiting for me she had a folded slip of paper in her hand the landlords son has brought this for you she said he has got a cab at the door he says you ordered him to keep it at your disposal quite right marian i want the cab i am going out again i descended the stairs as i spoke and looked into the sitting room to read the slip of paper by the light on the table it contained these two sentences in pescas handwriting your letter is received if i dont see you before the time you mention i will break the seal when the clock strikes i placed the paper in my pocketbook and made for the door marian met me on the threshold and pushed me back into the room where the candlelight fell full on my face she held me by both hands and her eyes fastened searchingly on mine i see she said in a low eager whisper you are trying the last chance tonight yes the last chance and the best i whispered back not alone oh walter for gods sake not alone let me go with you dont refuse me because im only a woman i must go i will go ill wait outside in the cab it was my turn now to hold her she tried to break away from me and get down first to the door if you want to help me i said stop here and sleep in my wifes room tonight only let me go away with my mind easy about laura and i answer for everything else come marian give me a kiss and show that you have the courage to wait till i come back i dared not allow her time to say a word more she tried to hold me again i unclasped her hands and was out of the room in a moment the boy below heard me on the stairs and opened the halldoor i jumped into the cab before the driver could get off the box forest road st johns wood i called to him through the front window double fare if you get there in a quarter of an hour ill do it sir i looked at my watch eleven oclock not a minute to lose the rapid motion of the cab the sense that every instant now was bringing me nearer to the count the conviction that i was embarked at last without let or hindrance on my hazardous enterprise heated me into such a fever of excitement that i shouted to the man to go faster and faster as we left the streets and crossed st johns wood road my impatience so completely overpowered me that i stood up in the cab and stretched my head out of the window to see the end of the journey before we reached it just as a church clock in the distance struck the quarter past we turned into the forest road i stopped the driver a little away from the counts house paid and dismissed him and walked on to the door as i approached the garden gate i saw another person advancing towards it also from the direction opposite to mine we met under the gas lamp in the road and looked at each other i instantly recognised the lighthaired foreigner with the scar on his cheek and i thought he recognised me he said nothing and instead of stopping at the house as i did he slowly walked on was he in the forest road by accident or had he followed the count home from the opera i did not pursue those questions after waiting a little till the foreigner had slowly passed out of sight i rang the gate bell it was then twenty minutes past eleven late enough to make it quite easy for the count to get rid of me by the excuse that he was in bed the only way of providing against this contingency was to send in my name without asking any preliminary questions and to let him know at the same time that i had a serious motive for wishing to see him at that late hour accordingly while i was waiting i took out my card and wrote under my name on important business the maidservant answered the door while i was writing the last word in pencil and asked me distrustfully what i pleased to want be so good as to take that to your master i replied giving her the card i saw by the girls hesitation of manner that if i had asked for the count in the first instance she would only have followed her instructions by telling me he was not at home she was staggered by the confidence with which i gave her the card after staring at me in great perturbation she went back into the house with my message closing the door and leaving me to wait in the garden in a minute or so she reappeared her masters compliments and would i be so obliging as to say what my business was take my compliments back i replied and say that the business cannot be mentioned to any one but your master she left me again again returned and this time asked me to walk in i followed her at once in another moment i was inside the counts house vii there was no lamp in the hall but by the dim light of the kitchen candle which the girl had brought upstairs with her i saw an elderly lady steal noiselessly out of a back room on the ground floor she cast one viperish look at me as i entered the hall but said nothing and went slowly upstairs without returning my bow my familiarity with marians journal sufficiently assured me that the elderly lady was madame fosco the servant led me to the room which the countess had just left i entered it and found myself face to face with the count he was still in his evening dress except his coat which he had thrown across a chair his shirtsleeves were turned up at the wrists but no higher a carpetbag was on one side of him and a box on the other books papers and articles of wearing apparel were scattered about the room on a table at one side of the door stood the cage so well known to me by description which contained his white mice the canaries and the cockatoo were probably in some other room he was seated before the box packing it when i went in and rose with some papers in his hand to receive me his face still betrayed plain traces of the shock that had overwhelmed him at the opera his fat cheeks hung loose his cold grey eyes were furtively vigilant his voice look and manner were all sharply suspicious alike as he advanced a step to meet me and requested with distant civility that i would take a chair you come here on business sir he said i am at a loss to know what that business can possibly he the unconcealed curiosity with which he looked hard in my face while he spoke convinced me that i had passed unnoticed by him at the opera he had seen pesca first and from that moment till he left the theatre he had evidently seen nothing else my name would necessarily suggest to him that i had not come into his house with other than a hostile purpose towards himself but he appeared to be utterly ignorant thus far of the real nature of my errand i am fortunate in finding you here tonight i said you seem to be on the point of taking a journey is your business connected with my journey in some degree in what degree do you know where i am going to no i only know why you are leaving london he slipped by me with the quickness of thought locked the door and put the key in his pocket you and i mr hartright are excellently well acquainted with one another by reputation he said did it by any chance occur to you when you came to this house that i was not the sort of man you could trifle with it did occur to me i replied and i have not come to trifle with you i am here on a matter of life and death and if that door which you have locked was open at this moment nothing you could say or do would induce me to pass through it i walked farther into the room and stood opposite to him on the rug before the fireplace he drew a chair in front of the door and sat down on it with his left arm resting on the table the cage with the white mice was close to him and the little creatures scampered out of their sleepingplace as his heavy arm shook the table and peered at him through the gaps in the smartly painted wires on a matter of life and death he repeated to himself those words are more serious perhaps than you think what do you mean what i say the perspiration broke out thickly on his broad forehead his left hand stole over the edge of the table there was a drawer in it with a lock and the key was in the lock his finger and thumb closed over the key but did not turn it so you know why i am leaving london he went on tell me the reason if you please he turned the key and unlocked the drawer as he spoke i can do better than that i replied i can show you the reason if you like how can you show it you have got your coat off i said roll up the shirtsleeve on your left arm and you will see it there the same livid leaden change passed over his face which i had seen pass over it at the theatre the deadly glitter in his eyes shone steady and straight into mine he said nothing but his left hand slowly opened the tabledrawer and softly slipped into it the harsh grating noise of something heavy that he was moving unseen to me sounded for a moment then ceased the silence that followed was so intense that the faint ticking nibble of the white mice at their wires was distinctly audible where i stood my life hung by a thread and i knew it at that final moment i thought with his mind i felt with his fingers i was as certain as if i had seen it of what he kept hidden from me in the drawer wait a little i said you have got the door locked you see i dont move you see my hands are empty wait a little i have something more to say you have said enough he replied with a sudden composure so unnatural and so ghastly that it tried my nerves as no outbreak of violence could have tried them i want one moment for my own thoughts if you please do you guess what i am thinking about perhaps i do i am thinking he remarked quietly whether i shall add to the disorder in this room by scattering your brains about the fireplace if i had moved at that moment i saw in his face that he would have done it i advise you to read two lines of writing which i have about me i rejoined before you finally decide that question the proposal appeared to excite his curiosity he nodded his head i took pescas acknowledgment of the receipt of my letter out of my pocketbook handed it to him at arms length and returned to my former position in front of the fireplace he read the lines aloud your letter is received if i dont hear from you before the time you mention i will break the seal when the clock strikes another man in his position would have needed some explanation of those words the count felt no such necessity one reading of the note showed him the precaution that i had taken as plainly as if he had been present at the time when i adopted it the expression of his face changed on the instant and his hand came out of the drawer empty i dont lock up my drawer mr hartright he said and i dont say that i may not scatter your brains about the fireplace yet but i am a just man even to my enemy and i will acknowledge beforehand that they are cleverer brains than i thought them come to the point sir you want something of me i do and i mean to have it on conditions on no conditions his hand dropped into the drawer again bah we are travelling in a circle he said and those clever brains of yours are in danger again your tone is deplorably imprudent sir moderate it on the spot the risk of shooting you on the place where you stand is less to me than the risk of letting you out of this house except on conditions that i dictate and approve you have not got my lamented friend to deal with now you are face to face with fosco if the lives of twenty mr hartrights were the steppingstones to my safety over all those stones i would go sustained by my sublime indifference self balanced by my impenetrable calm respect me if you love your own life i summon you to answer three questions before you open your lips again hear them they are necessary to this interview answer them they are necessary to me he held up one finger of his right hand first question he said you come here possessed of information which may be true or may be false where did you get it i decline to tell you no matter i shall find out if that information is true mind i say with the whole force of my resolution if you are making your market of it here by treachery of your own or by treachery of some other man i note that circumstance for future use in my memory which forgets nothing and proceed he held up another finger second question those lines you invited me to read are without signature who wrote them a man whom i have every reason to depend on and whom you have every reason to fear my answer reached him to some purpose his left hand trembled audibly in the drawer how long do you give me he asked putting his third question in a quieter tone before the clock strikes and the seal is broken time enough for you to come to my terms i replied give me a plainer answer mr hartright what hour is the clock to strike nine tomorrow morning nine tomorrow morning yes yes your trap is laid for me before i can get my passport regulated and leave london it is not earlier i suppose we will see about that presently i can keep you hostage here and bargain with you to send for your letter before i let you go in the meantime be so good next as to mention your terms you shall hear them they are simple and soon stated you know whose interests i represent in coming here he smiled with the most supreme composure and carelessly waved his right hand i consent to hazard a guess he said jeeringly a ladys interests of course my wifes interests he looked at me with the first honest expression that had crossed his face in my presence an expression of blank amazement i could see that i sank in his estimation as a dangerous man from that moment he shut up the drawer at once folded his arms over his breast and listened to me with a smile of satirical attention you are well enough aware i went on of the course which my inquiries have taken for many months past to know that any attempted denial of plain facts will be quite useless in my presence you are guilty of an infamous conspiracy and the gain of a fortune of ten thousand pounds was your motive for it he said nothing but his face became overclouded suddenly by a lowering anxiety keep your gain i said his face lightened again immediately and his eyes opened on me in wider and wider astonishment i am not here to disgrace myself by bargaining for money which has passed through your hands and which has been the price of a vile crime gently mr hartright your moral claptraps have an excellent effect in england keep them for yourself and your own countrymen if you please the ten thousand pounds was a legacy left to my excellent wife by the late mr fairlie place the affair on those grounds and i will discuss it if you like to a man of my sentiments however the subject is deplorably sordid i prefer to pass it over i invite you to resume the discussion of your terms what do you demand in the first place i demand a full confession of the conspiracy written and signed in my presence by yourself he raised his finger again one he said checking me off with the steady attention of a practical man in the second place i demand a plain proof which does not depend on your personal asseveration of the date at which my wife left blackwater park and travelled to london so so you can lay your finger i see on the weak place he remarked composedly any more at present no more good you have mentioned your terms now listen to mine the responsibility to myself of admitting what you are pleased to call the conspiracy is less perhaps upon the whole than the responsibility of laying you dead on that hearthrug let us say that i meet your proposal on my own conditions the statement you demand of me shall be written and the plain proof shall be produced you call a letter from my late lamented friend informing me of the day and hour of his wifes arrival in london written signed and dated by himself a proof i suppose i can give you this i can also send you to the man of whom i hired the carriage to fetch my visitor from the railway on the day when she arrived his orderbook may help you to your date even if his coachman who drove me proves to be of no use these things i can do and will do on conditions i recite them first condition madame fosco and i leave this house when and how we please without interference of any kind on your part second condition you wait here in company with me to see my agent who is coming at seven oclock in the morning to regulate my affairs you give my agent a written order to the man who has got your sealed letter to resign his possession of it you wait here till my agent places that letter unopened in my hands and you then allow me one clear halfhour to leave the house after which you resume your own freedom of action and go where you please third condition you give me the satisfaction of a gentleman for your intrusion into my private affairs and for the language you have allowed yourself to use to me at this conference the time and place abroad to be fixed in a letter from my hand when i am safe on the continent and that letter to contain a strip of paper measuring accurately the length of my sword those are my terms inform me if you accept them yes or no the extraordinary mixture of prompt decision farsighted cunning and mountebank bravado in this speech staggered me for a moment and only for a moment the one question to consider was whether i was justified or not in possessing myself of the means of establishing lauras identity at the cost of allowing the scoundrel who had robbed her of it to escape me with impunity i knew that the motive of securing the just recognition of my wife in the birthplace from which she had been driven out as an impostor and of publicly erasing the lie that still profaned her mothers tombstone was far purer in its freedom from all taint of evil passion than the vindictive motive which had mingled itself with my purpose from the first and yet i cannot honestly say that my own moral convictions were strong enough to decide the struggle in me by themselves they were helped by my remembrance of sir percivals death how awfully at the last moment had the working of the retribution there been snatched from my feeble hands what right had i to decide in my poor mortal ignorance of the future that this man too must escape with impunity because he escaped me i thought of these things perhaps with the superstition inherent in my nature perhaps with a sense worthier of me than superstition it was hard when i had fastened my hold on him at last to loosen it again of my own accord but i forced myself to make the sacrifice in plainer words i determined to be guided by the one higher motive of which i was certain the motive of serving the cause of laura and the cause of truth i accept your conditions i said with one reservation on my part what reservation may that be he asked it refers to the sealed letter i answered i require you to destroy it unopened in my presence as soon as it is placed in your hands my object in making this stipulation was simply to prevent him from carrying away written evidence of the nature of my communication with pesca the fact of my communication he would necessarily discover when i gave the address to his agent in the morning but he could make no use of it on his own unsupported testimony even if he really ventured to try the experiment which need excite in me the slightest apprehension on pescas account i grant your reservation he replied after considering the question gravely for a minute or two it is not worth dispute the letter shall be destroyed when it comes into my hands he rose as he spoke from the chair in which he had been sitting opposite to me up to this time with one effort he appeared to free his mind from the whole pressure on it of the interview between us thus far ouf he cried stretching his arms luxuriously the skirmish was hot while it lasted take a seat mr hartright we meet as mortal enemies hereafter let us like gallant gentlemen exchange polite attentions in the meantime permit me to take the liberty of calling for my wife he unlocked and opened the door eleanor he called out in his deep voice the lady of the viperish face came in madame fosco mr hartright said the count introducing us with easy dignity my angel he went on addressing his wife will your labours of packing up allow you time to make me some nice strong coffee i have writing business to transact with mr hartright and i require the full possession of my intelligence to do justice to myself madame fosco bowed her head twice once sternly to me once submissively to her husband and glided out of the room the count walked to a writingtable near the window opened his desk and took from it several quires of paper and a bundle of quill pens he scattered the pens about the table so that they might lie ready in all directions to be taken up when wanted and then cut the paper into a heap of narrow slips of the form used by professional writers for the press i shall make this a remarkable document he said looking at me over his shoulder habits of literary composition are perfectly familiar to me one of the rarest of all the intellectual accomplishments that a man can possess is the grand faculty of arranging his ideas immense privilege i possess it do you he marched backwards and forwards in the room until the coffee appeared humming to himself and marking the places at which obstacles occurred in the arrangement of his ideas by striking his forehead from time to time with the palm of his hand the enormous audacity with which he seized on the situation in which i placed him and made it the pedestal on which his vanity mounted for the one cherished purpose of selfdisplay mastered my astonishment by main force sincerely as i loathed the man the prodigious strength of his character even in its most trivial aspects impressed me in spite of myself the coffee was brought in by madame fosco he kissed her hand in grateful acknowledgment and escorted her to the door returned poured out a cup of coffee for himself and took it to the writingtable may i offer you some coffee mr hartright he said before he sat down i declined what you think i shall poison you he said gaily the english intellect is sound so far as it goes he continued seating himself at the table but it has one grave defect it is always cautious in the wrong place he dipped his pen in the ink placed the first slip of paper before him with a thump of his hand on the desk cleared his throat and began he wrote with great noise and rapidity in so large and bold a hand and with such wide spaces between the lines that he reached the bottom of the slip in not more than two minutes certainly from the time when he started at the top each slip as he finished it was paged and tossed over his shoulder out of his way on the floor when his first pen was worn out that went over his shoulder too and he pounced on a second from the supply scattered about the table slip after slip by dozens by fifties by hundreds flew over his shoulders on either side of him till he had snowed himself up in paper all round his chair hour after hour passed and there i sat watching there he sat writing he never stopped except to sip his coffee and when that was exhausted to smack his forehead from time to time one oclock struck two three four and still the slips flew about all round him still the untiring pen scraped its way ceaselessly from top to bottom of the page still the white chaos of paper rose higher and higher all round his chair at four oclock i heard a sudden splutter of the pen indicative of the flourish with which he signed his name bravo he cried springing to his feet with the activity of a young man and looking me straight in the face with a smile of superb triumph done mr hartright i he announced with a selfrenovating thump of his fist on his broad breast done to my own profound satisfaction to your profound astonishment when you read what i have written the subject is exhausted the man fosco is not i proceed to the arrangement of my slips to the revision of my slips to the reading of my slips addressed emphatically to your private ear four oclock has just struck good arrangement revision reading from four to five short snooze of restoration for myself from five to six final preparations from six to seven affair of agent and sealed letter from seven to eight at eight en route behold the programme he sat down crosslegged on the floor among his papers strung them together with a bodkin and a piece of string revised them wrote all the titles and honours by which he was personally distinguished at the head of the first page and then read the manuscript to me with loud theatrical emphasis and profuse theatrical gesticulation the reader will have an opportunity ere long of forming his own opinion of the document it will be sufficient to mention here that it answered my purpose he next wrote me the address of the person from whom he had hired the fly and handed me sir percivals letter it was dated from hampshire on the th of july and it announced the journey of lady glyde to london on the th thus on the very day the th when the doctors certificate declared that she had died in st johns wood she was alive by sir percivals own showing at blackwater and on the day after she was to take a journey when the proof of that journey was obtained from the flyman the evidence would be complete a quarterpast five said the count looking at his watch time for my restorative snooze i personally resemble napoleon the great as you may have remarked mr hartright i also resemble that immortal man in my power of commanding sleep at will excuse me one moment i will summon madame fosco to keep you from feeling dull knowing as well as he did that he was summoning madame fosco to ensure my not leaving the house while he was asleep i made no reply and occupied myself in tying up the papers which he had placed in my possession the lady came in cool pale and venomous as ever amuse mr hartright my angel said the count he placed a chair for her kissed her hand for the second time withdrew to a sofa and in three minutes was as peacefully and happily asleep as the most virtuous man in existence madame fosco took a book from the table sat down and looked at me with the steady vindictive malice of a woman who never forgot and never forgave i have been listening to your conversation with my husband she said if i had been in his place i would have laid you dead on the hearthrug with those words she opened her book and never looked at me or spoke to me from that time till the time when her husband woke he opened his eyes and rose from the sofa accurately to an hour from the time when he had gone to sleep i feel infinitely refreshed he remarked eleanor my good wife are you all ready upstairs that is well my little packing here can be completed in ten minutes my travellingdress assumed in ten minutes more what remains before the agent comes he looked about the room and noticed the cage with his white mice in it ah he cried piteously a last laceration of my sympathies still remains my innocent pets my little cherished children what am i to do with them for the present we are settled nowhere for the present we travel incessantly the less baggage we carry the better for ourselves my cockatoo my canaries and my little mice who will cherish them when their good papa is gone he walked about the room deep in thought he had not been at all troubled about writing his confession but he was visibly perplexed and distressed about the far more important question of the disposal of his pets after long consideration he suddenly sat down again at the writingtable an idea he exclaimed i will offer my canaries and my cockatoo to this vast metropolis my agent shall present them in my name to the zoological gardens of london the document that describes them shall be drawn out on the spot he began to write repeating the words as they flowed from his pen number one cockatoo of transcendent plumage attraction of himself to all visitors of taste number two canaries of unrivalled vivacity and intelligence worthy of the garden of eden worthy also of the garden in the regents park homage to british zoology offered by fosco the pen spluttered again and the flourish was attached to his signature count you have not included the mice said madame fosco he left the table took her hand and placed it on his heart all human resolution eleanor he said solemnly has its limits my limits are inscribed on that document i cannot part with my white mice bear with me my angel and remove them to their travelling cage upstairs admirable tenderness said madame fosco admiring her husband with a last viperish look in my direction she took up the cage carefully and left the room the count looked at his watch in spite of his resolute assumption of composure he was getting anxious for the agents arrival the candles had long since been extinguished and the sunlight of the new morning poured into the room it was not till five minutes past seven that the gate bell rang and the agent made his appearance he was a foreigner with a dark beard mr hartright monsieur rubelle said the count introducing us he took the agent a foreign spy in every line of his face if ever there was one yet into a corner of the room whispered some directions to him and then left us together monsieur rubelle as soon as we were alone suggested with great politeness that i should favour him with his instructions i wrote two lines to pesca authorising him to deliver my sealed letter to the bearer directed the note and handed it to monsieur rubelle the agent waited with me till his employer returned equipped in travelling costume the count examined the address of my letter before he dismissed the agent i thought so he said turning on me with a dark look and altering again in his manner from that moment he completed his packing and then sat consulting a travelling map making entries in his pocketbook and looking every now and then impatiently at his watch not another word addressed to myself passed his lips the near approach of the hour for his departure and the proof he had seen of the communication established between pesca and myself had plainly recalled his whole attention to the measures that were necessary for securing his escape a little before eight oclock monsieur rubelle came back with my unopened letter in his hand the count looked carefully at the superscription and the seal lit a candle and burnt the letter i perform my promise he said but this matter mr hartright shall not end here the agent had kept at the door the cab in which he had returned he and the maidservant now busied themselves in removing the luggage madame fosco came downstairs thickly veiled with the travelling cage of the white mice in her hand she neither spoke to me nor looked towards me her husband escorted her to the cab follow me as far as the passage he whispered in my ear i may want to speak to you at the last moment i went out to the door the agent standing below me in the front garden the count came back alone and drew me a few steps inside the passage remember the third condition he whispered you shall hear from me mr hartright i may claim from you the satisfaction of a gentleman sooner than you think for he caught my hand before i was aware of him and wrung it hard then turned to the door stopped and came back to me again one word more he said confidentially when i last saw miss halcombe she looked thin and ill i am anxious about that admirable woman take care of her sir with my hand on my heart i solemnly implore you take care of miss halcombe those were the last words he said to me before he squeezed his huge body into the cab and drove off the agent and i waited at the door a few moments looking after him while we were standing together a second cab appeared from a turning a little way down the road it followed the direction previously taken by the counts cab and as it passed the house and the open garden gate a person inside looked at us out of the window the stranger at the opera again the foreigner with a scar on his left cheek you wait here with me sir for half an hour more said monsieur rubelle i do we returned to the sittingroom i was in no humour to speak to the agent or to allow him to speak to me i took out the papers which the count had placed in my hands and read the terrible story of the conspiracy told by the man who had planned and perpetrated it the story continued by isidor ottavio baldassare fosco count of the holy roman empire knight grand cross of the order of the brazen crown perpetual archmaster of the rosicrucian masons of mesopotamia attached in honorary capacities to societies musical societies medical societies philosophical and societies general benevolent throughout europe etc etc etc the counts narrative in the summer of eighteen hundred and fifty i arrived in england charged with a delicate political mission from abroad confidential persons were semiofficially connected with me whose exertions i was authorised to direct monsieur and madame rubelle being among the number some weeks of spare time were at my disposal before i entered on my functions by establishing myself in the suburbs of london curiosity may stop here to ask for some explanation of those functions on my part i entirely sympathise with the request i also regret that diplomatic reserve forbids me to comply with it i arranged to pass the preliminary period of repose to which i have just referred in the superb mansion of my late lamented friend sir percival glyde he arrived from the continent with his wife i arrived from the continent with mine england is the land of domestic happiness how appropriately we entered it under these domestic circumstances the bond of friendship which united percival and myself was strengthened on this occasion by a touching similarity in the pecuniary position on his side and on mine we both wanted money immense necessity universal want is there a civilised human being who does not feel for us how insensible must that man be or how rich i enter into no sordid particulars in discussing this part of the subject my mind recoils from them with a roman austerity i show my empty purse and percivals to the shrinking public gaze let us allow the deplorable fact to assert itself once for all in that manner and pass on we were received at the mansion by the magnificent creature who is inscribed on my heart as marian who is known in the colder atmosphere of society as miss halcombe just heaven with what inconceivable rapidity i learnt to adore that woman at sixty i worshipped her with the volcanic ardour of eighteen all the gold of my rich nature was poured hopelessly at her feet my wife poor angel my wife who adores me got nothing but the shillings and the pennies such is the world such man such love what are we i ask but puppets in a show box oh omnipotent destiny pull our strings gently dance us mercifully off our miserable little stage the preceding lines rightly understood express an entire system of philosophy it is mine i resume the domestic position at the commencement of our residence at blackwater park has been drawn with amazing accuracy with profound mental insight by the hand of marian herself pass me the intoxicating familiarity of mentioning this sublime creature by her christian name accurate knowledge of the contents of her journal to which i obtained access by clandestine means unspeakably precious to me in the remembrance warns my eager pen from topics which this essentially exhaustive woman has already made her own the interests interests breathless and immense with which i am here concerned begin with the deplorable calamity of marians illness the situation at this period was emphatically a serious one large sums of money due at a certain time were wanted by percival i say nothing of the modicum equally necessary to myself and the one source to look to for supplying them was the fortune of his wife of which not one farthing was at his disposal until her death bad so far and worse still farther on my lamented friend had private troubles of his own into which the delicacy of my disinterested attachment to him forbade me from inquiring too curiously i knew nothing but that a woman named anne catherick was hidden in the neighbourhood that she was in communication with lady glyde and that the disclosure of a secret which would be the certain ruin of percival might be the result he had told me himself that he was a lost man unless his wife was silenced and unless anne catherick was found if he was a lost man what would become of our pecuniary interests courageous as i am by nature i absolutely trembled at the idea the whole force of my intelligence was now directed to the finding of anne catherick our money affairs important as they were admitted of delay but the necessity of discovering the woman admitted of none i only knew her by description as presenting an extraordinary personal resemblance to lady glyde the statement of this curious fact intended merely to assist me in identifying the person of whom we were in search when coupled with the additional information that anne catherick had escaped from a madhouse started the first immense conception in my mind which subsequently led to such amazing results that conception involved nothing less than the complete transformation of two separate identities lady glyde and anne catherick were to change names places and destinies the one with the other the prodigious consequences contemplated by the change being the gain of thirty thousand pounds and the eternal preservation of sir percivals secret my instincts which seldom err suggested to me on reviewing the circumstances that our invisible anne would sooner or later return to the boathouse at the blackwater lake there i posted myself previously mentioning to mrs michelson the housekeeper that i might be found when wanted immersed in study in that solitary place it is my rule never to make unnecessary mysteries and never to set people suspecting me for want of a little seasonable candour on my part mrs michelson believed in me from first to last this ladylike person widow of a protestant priest overflowed with faith touched by such superfluity of simple confidence in a woman of her mature years i opened the ample reservoirs of my nature and absorbed it all i was rewarded for posting myself sentinel at the lake by the appearance not of anne catherick herself but of the person in charge of her this individual also overflowed with simple faith which i absorbed in myself as in the case already mentioned i leave her to describe the circumstances if she has not done so already under which she introduced me to the object of her maternal care when i first saw anne catherick she was asleep i was electrified by the likeness between this unhappy woman and lady glyde the details of the grand scheme which had suggested themselves in outline only up to that period occurred to me in all their masterly combination at the sight of the sleeping face at the same time my heart always accessible to tender influences dissolved in tears at the spectacle of suffering before me i instantly set myself to impart relief in other words i provided the necessary stimulant for strengthening anne catherick to perform the journey to london the best years of my life have been passed in the ardent study of medical and chemical science chemistry especially has always had irresistible attractions for me from the enormous the illimitable power which the knowledge of it confers chemists i assert it emphatically might sway if they pleased the destinies of humanity let me explain this before i go further mind they say rules the world but what rules the mind the body follow me closely here lies at the mercy of the most omnipotent of all potentates the chemist give me fosco chemistry and when shakespeare has conceived hamlet and sits down to execute the conception with a few grains of powder dropped into his daily food i will reduce his mind by the action of his body till his pen pours out the most abject drivel that has ever degraded paper under similar circumstances revive me the illustrious newton i guarantee that when he sees the apple fall he shall eat it instead of discovering the principle of gravitation neros dinner shall transform nero into the mildest of men before he has done digesting it and the morning draught of alexander the great shall make alexander run for his life at the first sight of the enemy the same afternoon on my sacred word of honour it is lucky for society that modern chemists are by incomprehensible good fortune the most harmless of mankind the mass are worthy fathers of families who keep shops the few are philosophers besotted with admiration for the sound of their own lecturing voices visionaries who waste their lives on fantastic impossibilities or quacks whose ambition soars no higher than our corns thus society escapes and the illimitable power of chemistry remains the slave of the most superficial and the most insignificant ends why this outburst why this withering eloquence because my conduct has been misrepresented because my motives have been misunderstood it has been assumed that i used my vast chemical resources against anne catherick and that i would have used them if i could against the magnificent marian herself odious insinuations both all my interests were concerned as will be seen presently in the preservation of anne cathericks life all my anxieties were concentrated on marians rescue from the hands of the licensed imbecile who attended her and who found my advice confirmed from first to last by the physician from london on two occasions only both equally harmless to the individual on whom i practised did i summon to myself the assistance of chemical knowledge on the first of the two after following marian to the inn at blackwater studying behind a convenient waggon which hid me from her the poetry of motion as embodied in her walk i availed myself of the services of my invaluable wife to copy one and to intercept the other of two letters which my adored enemy had entrusted to a discarded maid in this case the letters being in the bosom of the girls dress madame fosco could only open them read them perform her instructions seal them and put them back again by scientific assistance which assistance i rendered in a halfounce bottle the second occasion when the same means were employed was the occasion to which i shall soon refer of lady glydes arrival in london never at any other time was i indebted to my art as distinguished from myself to all other emergencies and complications my natural capacity for grappling singlehanded with circumstances was invariably equal i affirm the allpervading intelligence of that capacity at the expense of the chemist i vindicate the man respect this outburst of generous indignation it has inexpressibly relieved me en route let us proceed having suggested to mrs clement or clements i am not sure which that the best method of keeping anne out of percivals reach was to remove her to london having found that my proposal was eagerly received and having appointed a day to meet the travellers at the station and to see them leave it i was at liberty to return to the house and to confront the difficulties which still remained to be met my first proceeding was to avail myself of the sublime devotion of my wife i had arranged with mrs clements that she should communicate her london address in annes interests to lady glyde but this was not enough designing persons in my absence might shake the simple confidence of mrs clements and she might not write after all who could i find capable of travelling to london by the train she travelled by and of privately seeing her home i asked myself this question the conjugal part of me immediately answered madame fosco after deciding on my wifes mission to london i arranged that the journey should serve a double purpose a nurse for the suffering marian equally devoted to the patient and to myself was a necessity of my position one of the most eminently confidential and capable women in existence was by good fortune at my disposal i refer to that respectable matron madame rubelle to whom i addressed a letter at her residence in london by the hands of my wife on the appointed day mrs clements and anne catherick met me at the station i politely saw them off i politely saw madame fosco off by the same train the last thing at night my wife returned to blackwater having followed her instructions with the most unimpeachable accuracy she was accompanied by madame rubelle and she brought me the london address of mrs clements after events proved this last precaution to have been unnecessary mrs clements punctually informed lady glyde of her place of abode with a wary eye on future emergencies i kept the letter the same day i had a brief interview with the doctor at which i protested in the sacred interests of humanity against his treatment of marians case he was insolent as all ignorant people are i showed no resentment i deferred quarrelling with him till it was necessary to quarrel to some purpose my next proceeding was to leave blackwater myself i had my london residence to take in anticipation of coming events i had also a little business of the domestic sort to transact with mr frederick fairlie i found the house i wanted in st johns wood i found mr fairlie at limmeridge cumberland my own private familiarity with the nature of marians correspondence had previously informed me that she had written to mr fairlie proposing as a relief to lady glydes matrimonial embarrassments to take her on a visit to her uncle in cumberland this letter i had wisely allowed to reach its destination feeling at the time that it could do no harm and might do good i now presented myself before mr fairlie to support marians own proposal with certain modifications which happily for the success of my plans were rendered really inevitable by her illness it was necessary that lady glyde should leave blackwater alone by her uncles invitation and that she should rest a night on the journey at her aunts house the house i had in st johns wood by her uncles express advice to achieve these results and to secure a note of invitation which could be shown to lady glyde were the objects of my visit to mr fairlie when i have mentioned that this gentleman was equally feeble in mind and body and that i let loose the whole force of my character on him i have said enough i came saw and conquered fairlie on my return to blackwater park with the letter of invitation i found that the doctors imbecile treatment of marians case had led to the most alarming results the fever had turned to typhus lady glyde on the day of my return tried to force herself into the room to nurse her sister she and i had no affinities of sympathy she had committed the unpardonable outrage on my sensibilities of calling me a spy she was a stumblingblock in my way and in percivals but for all that my magnanimity forbade me to put her in danger of infection with my own hand at the same time i offered no hindrance to her putting herself in danger if she had succeeded in doing so the intricate knot which i was slowly and patiently operating on might perhaps have been cut by circumstances as it was the doctor interfered and she was kept out of the room i had myself previously recommended sending for advice to london this course had been now taken the physician on his arrival confirmed my view of the case the crisis was serious but we had hope of our charming patient on the fifth day from the appearance of the typhus i was only once absent from blackwater at this time when i went to london by the morning train to make the final arrangements at my house in st johns wood to assure myself by private inquiry that mrs clements had not moved and to settle one or two little preliminary matters with the husband of madame rubelle i returned at night five days afterwards the physician pronounced our interesting marian to be out of all danger and to be in need of nothing but careful nursing this was the time i had waited for now that medical attendance was no longer indispensable i played the first move in the game by asserting myself against the doctor he was one among many witnesses in my way whom it was necessary to remove a lively altercation between us in which percival previously instructed by me refused to interfere served the purpose in view i descended on the miserable man in an irresistible avalanche of indignation and swept him from the house the servants were the next encumbrances to get rid of again i instructed percival whose moral courage required perpetual stimulants and mrs michelson was amazed one day by hearing from her master that the establishment was to be broken up we cleared the house of all the servants but one who was kept for domestic purposes and whose lumpish stupidity we could trust to make no embarrassing discoveries when they were gone nothing remained but to relieve ourselves of mrs michelson a result which was easily achieved by sending this amiable lady to find lodgings for her mistress at the seaside the circumstances were now exactly what they were required to be lady glyde was confined to her room by nervous illness and the lumpish housemaid i forget her name was shut up there at night in attendance on her mistress marian though fast recovering still kept her bed with mrs rubelle for nurse no other living creatures but my wife myself and percival were in the house with all the chances thus in our favour i confronted the next emergency and played the second move in the game the object of the second move was to induce lady glyde to leave blackwater unaccompanied by her sister unless we could persuade her that marian had gone on to cumberland first there was no chance of removing her of her own free will from the house to produce this necessary operation in her mind we concealed our interesting invalid in one of the uninhabited bedrooms at blackwater at the dead of night madame fosco madame rubelle and myself percival not being cool enough to be trusted accomplished the concealment the scene was picturesque mysterious dramatic in the highest degree by my directions the bed had been made in the morning on a strong movable framework of wood we had only to lift the framework gently at the head and foot and to transport our patient where we pleased without disturbing herself or her bed no chemical assistance was needed or used in this case our interesting marian lay in the deep repose of convalescence we placed the candles and opened the doors beforehand i in right of my great personal strength took the head of the framework my wife and madame rubelle took the foot i bore my share of that inestimably precious burden with a manly tenderness with a fatherly care where is the modern rembrandt who could depict our midnight procession alas for the arts alas for this most pictorial of subjects the modern rembrandt is nowhere to be found the next morning my wife and i started for london leaving marian secluded in the uninhabited middle of the house under care of madame rubelle who kindly consented to imprison herself with her patient for two or three days before taking our departure i gave percival mr fairlies letter of invitation to his niece instructing her to sleep on the journey to cumberland at her aunts house with directions to show it to lady glyde on hearing from me i also obtained from him the address of the asylum in which anne catherick had been confined and a letter to the proprietor announcing to that gentleman the return of his runaway patient to medical care i had arranged at my last visit to the metropolis to have our modest domestic establishment ready to receive us when we arrived in london by the early train in consequence of this wise precaution we were enabled that same day to play the third move in the game the getting possession of anne catherick dates are of importance here i combine in myself the opposite characteristics of a man of sentiment and a man of business i have all the dates at my fingers ends on wednesday the th of july i sent my wife in a cab to clear mrs clements out of the way in the first place a supposed message from lady glyde in london was sufficient to obtain this result mrs clements was taken away in the cab and was left in the cab while my wife on pretence of purchasing something at a shop gave her the slip and returned to receive her expected visitor at our house in st johns wood it is hardly necessary to add that the visitor had been described to the servants as lady glyde in the meanwhile i had followed in another cab with a note for anne catherick merely mentioning that lady glyde intended to keep mrs clements to spend the day with her and that she was to join them under care of the good gentleman waiting outside who had already saved her from discovery in hampshire by sir percival the good gentleman sent in this note by a street boy and paused for results a door or two farther on at the moment when anne appeared at the house door and closed it this excellent man had the cab door open ready for her absorbed her into the vehicle and drove off pass me here one exclamation in parenthesis how interesting this is on the way to forest road my companion showed no fear i can be paternal no man more so when i please and i was intensely paternal on this occasion what titles i had to her confidence i had compounded the medicine which had done her good i had warned her of her danger from sir percival perhaps i trusted too implicitly to these titles perhaps i underrated the keenness of the lower instincts in persons of weak intellect it is certain that i neglected to prepare her sufficiently for a disappointment on entering my house when i took her into the drawingroom when she saw no one present but madame fosco who was a stranger to her she exhibited the most violent agitation if she had scented danger in the air as a dog scents the presence of some creature unseen her alarm could not have displayed itself more suddenly and more causelessly i interposed in vain the fear from which she was suffering i might have soothed but the serious heart disease under which she laboured was beyond the reach of all moral palliatives to my unspeakable horror she was seized with convulsions a shock to the system in her condition which might have laid her dead at any moment at our feet the nearest doctor was sent for and was told that lady glyde required his immediate services to my infinite relief he was a capable man i represented my visitor to him as a person of weak intellect and subject to delusions and i arranged that no nurse but my wife should watch in the sickroom the unhappy woman was too ill however to cause any anxiety about what she might say the one dread which now oppressed me was the dread that the false lady glyde might die before the true lady glyde arrived in london i had written a note in the morning to madame rubelle telling her to join me at her husbands house on the evening of friday the th with another note to percival warning him to show his wife her uncles letter of invitation to assert that marian had gone on before her and to despatch her to town by the midday train on the th also on reflection i had felt the necessity in anne cathericks state of health of precipitating events and of having lady glyde at my disposal earlier than i had originally contemplated what fresh directions in the terrible uncertainty of my position could i now issue i could do nothing but trust to chance and the doctor my emotions expressed themselves in pathetic apostrophes which i was just selfpossessed enough to couple in the hearing of other people with the name of lady glyde in all other respects fosco on that memorable day was fosco shrouded in total eclipse she passed a bad night she awoke worn out but later in the day she revived amazingly my elastic spirits revived with her i could receive no answers from percival and madame rubelle till the morning of the next day the th in anticipation of their following my directions which accident apart i knew they would do i went to secure a fly to fetch lady glyde from the railway directing it to be at my house on the th at two oclock after seeing the order entered in the book i went on to arrange matters with monsieur rubelle i also procured the services of two gentlemen who could furnish me with the necessary certificates of lunacy one of them i knew personally the other was known to monsieur rubelle both were men whose vigorous minds soared superior to narrow scruples both were labouring under temporary embarrassments both believed in me it was past five oclock in the afternoon before i returned from the performance of these duties when i got back anne catherick was dead dead on the th and lady glyde was not to arrive in london till the th i was stunned meditate on that fosco stunned it was too late to retrace our steps before my return the doctor had officiously undertaken to save me all trouble by registering the death on the date when it happened with his own hand my grand scheme unassailable hitherto had its weak place now no efforts on my part could alter the fatal event of the th i turned manfully to the future percivals interests and mine being still at stake nothing was left but to play the game through to the end i recalled my impenetrable calm and played it on the morning of the th percivals letter reached me announcing his wifes arrival by the midday train madame rubelle also wrote to say she would follow in the evening i started in the fly leaving the false lady glyde dead in the house to receive the true lady glyde on her arrival by the railway at three oclock hidden under the seat of the carriage i carried with me all the clothes anne catherick had worn on coming into my house they were destined to assist the resurrection of the woman who was dead in the person of the woman who was living what a situation i suggest it to the rising romance writers of england i offer it as totally new to the wornout dramatists of france lady glyde was at the station there was great crowding and confusion and more delay than i liked in case any of her friends had happened to be on the spot in reclaiming her luggage her first questions as we drove off implored me to tell her news of her sister i invented news of the most pacifying kind assuring her that she was about to see her sister at my house my house on this occasion only was in the neighbourhood of leicester square and was in the occupation of monsieur rubelle who received us in the hall i took my visitor upstairs into a back room the two medical gentlemen being there in waiting on the floor beneath to see the patient and to give me their certificates after quieting lady glyde by the necessary assurances about her sister i introduced my friends separately to her presence they performed the formalities of the occasion briefly intelligently conscientiously i entered the room again as soon as they had left it and at once precipitated events by a reference of the alarming kind to miss halcombes state of health results followed as i had anticipated lady glyde became frightened and turned faint for the second time and the last i called science to my assistance a medicated glass of water and a medicated bottle of smellingsalts relieved her of all further embarrassment and alarm additional applications later in the evening procured her the inestimable blessing of a good nights rest madame rubelle arrived in time to preside at lady glydes toilet her own clothes were taken away from her at night and anne cathericks were put on her in the morning with the strictest regard to propriety by the matronly hands of the good rubelle throughout the day i kept our patient in a state of partiallysuspended consciousness until the dexterous assistance of my medical friends enabled me to procure the necessary order rather earlier than i had ventured to hope that evening the evening of the th madame rubelle and i took our revived anne catherick to the asylum she was received with great surprise but without suspicion thanks to the order and certificates to percivals letter to the likeness to the clothes and to the patients own confused mental condition at the time i returned at once to assist madame fosco in the preparations for the burial of the false lady glyde having the clothes and luggage of the true lady glyde in my possession they were afterwards sent to cumberland by the conveyance which was used for the funeral i attended the funeral with becoming dignity attired in the deepest mourning my narrative of these remarkable events written under equally remarkable circumstances closes here the minor precautions which i observed in communicating with limmeridge house are already known so is the magnificent success of my enterprise so are the solid pecuniary results which followed it i have to assert with the whole force of my conviction that the one weak place in my scheme would never have been found out if the one weak place in my heart had not been discovered first nothing but my fatal admiration for marian restrained me from stepping in to my own rescue when she effected her sisters escape i ran the risk and trusted in the complete destruction of lady glydes identity if either marian or mr hartright attempted to assert that identity they would publicly expose themselves to the imputation of sustaining a rank deception they would be distrusted and discredited accordingly and they would therefore be powerless to place my interests or percivals secret in jeopardy i committed one error in trusting myself to such a blindfold calculation of chances as this i committed another when percival had paid the penalty of his own obstinacy and violence by granting lady glyde a second reprieve from the madhouse and allowing mr hartright a second chance of escaping me in brief fosco at this serious crisis was untrue to himself deplorable and uncharacteristic fault behold the cause in my heart behold in the image of marian halcombe the first and last weakness of foscos life at the ripe age of sixty i make this unparalleled confession youths i invoke your sympathy maidens i claim your tears a word more and the attention of the reader concentrated breathlessly on myself shall be released my own mental insight informs me that three inevitable questions will be asked here by persons of inquiring minds they shall be stated they shall be answered first question what is the secret of madame foscos unhesitating devotion of herself to the fulfilment of my boldest wishes to the furtherance of my deepest plans i might answer this by simply referring to my own character and by asking in my turn where in the history of the world has a man of my order ever been found without a woman in the background selfimmolated on the altar of his life but i remember that i am writing in england i remember that i was married in england and i ask if a womans marriage obligations in this country provide for her private opinion of her husbands principles no they charge her unreservedly to love honour and obey him that is exactly what my wife has done i stand here on a supreme moral elevation and i loftily assert her accurate performance of her conjugal duties silence calumny your sympathy wives of england for madame fosco second question if anne catherick had not died when she did what should i have done i should in that case have assisted wornout nature in finding permanent repose i should have opened the doors of the prison of life and have extended to the captive incurably afflicted in mind and body both a happy release third question on a calm revision of all the circumstances is my conduct worthy of any serious blame most emphatically no have i not carefully avoided exposing myself to the odium of committing unnecessary crime with my vast resources in chemistry i might have taken lady glydes life at immense personal sacrifice i followed the dictates of my own ingenuity my own humanity my own caution and took her identity instead judge me by what i might have done how comparatively innocent how indirectly virtuous i appear in what i really did i announced on beginning it that this narrative would be a remarkable document it has entirely answered my expectations receive these fervid lines my last legacy to the country i leave for ever they are worthy of the occasion and worthy of fosco the story concluded by walter hartright i when i closed the last leaf of the counts manuscript the half hour during which i had engaged to remain at forest road had expired monsieur rubelle looked at his watch and bowed i rose immediately and left the agent in possession of the empty house i never saw him again i never heard more of him or of his wife out of the dark byways of villainy and deceit they had crawled across our path into the same byways they crawled back secretly and were lost in a quarter of an hour after leaving forest road i was at home again but few words sufficed to tell laura and marian how my desperate venture had ended and what the next event in our lives was likely to be i left all details to be described later in the day and hastened back to st johns wood to see the person of whom count fosco had ordered the fly when he went to meet laura at the station the address in my possession led me to some livery stables about a quarter of a mile distant from forest road the proprietor proved to be a civil and respectable man when i explained that an important family matter obliged me to ask him to refer to his books for the purpose of ascertaining a date with which the record of his business transactions might supply me he offered no objection to granting my request the book was produced and there under the date of july th the order was entered in these words brougham to count fosco forest road two oclock john owen i found on inquiry that the name of john owen attached to the entry referred to the man who had been employed to drive the fly he was then at work in the stableyard and was sent for to see me at my request do you remember driving a gentleman in the month of july last from number five forest road to the waterloo bridge station i asked well sir said the man i cant exactly say i do perhaps you remember the gentleman himself can you call to mind driving a foreigner last summer a tall gentleman and remarkably fat the mans face brightened directly i remember him sir the fattest gentleman as ever i see and the heaviest customer as ever i drove yes yes i call him to mind sir we did go to the station and it was from forest road there was a parrot or summat like it screeching in the window the gentleman was in a mortal hurry about the ladys luggage and he gave me a handsome present for looking sharp and getting the boxes getting the boxes i recollected immediately that lauras own account of herself on her arrival in london described her luggage as being collected for her by some person whom count fosco brought with him to the station this was the man did you see the lady i asked what did she look like was she young or old well sir what with the hurry and the crowd of people pushing about i cant rightly say what the lady looked like i cant call nothing to mind about her that i know of excepting her name you remember her name yes sir her name was lady glyde how do you come to remember that when you have forgotten what she looked like the man smiled and shifted his feet in some little embarrassment why to tell you the truth sir he said i hadnt been long married at that time and my wifes name before she changed it for mine was the same as the ladys meaning the name of glyde sir the lady mentioned it herself is your name on your boxes maam says i yes says she my name is on my luggage it is lady glyde come i says to myself ive a bad head for gentlefolks names in general but this one comes like an old friend at any rate i cant say nothing about the time sir it might be nigh on a year ago or it mightnt but i can swear to the stout gentleman and swear to the ladys name there was no need that he should remember the time the date was positively established by his masters orderbook i felt at once that the means were now in my power of striking down the whole conspiracy at a blow with the irresistible weapon of plain fact without a moments hesitation i took the proprietor of the livery stables aside and told him what the real importance was of the evidence of his orderbook and the evidence of his driver an arrangement to compensate him for the temporary loss of the mans services was easily made and a copy of the entry in the book was taken by myself and certified as true by the masters own signature i left the livery stables having settled that john owen was to hold himself at my disposal for the next three days or for a longer period if necessity required it i now had in my possession all the papers that i wanted the district registrars own copy of the certificate of death and sir percivals dated letter to the count being safe in my pocket book with this written evidence about me and with the coachmans answers fresh in my memory i next turned my steps for the first time since the beginning of all my inquiries in the direction of mr kyrles office one of my objects in paying him this second visit was necessarily to tell him what i had done the other was to warn him of my resolution to take my wife to limmeridge the next morning and to have her publicly received and recognised in her uncles house i left it to mr kyrle to decide under these circumstances and in mr gilmores absence whether he was or was not bound as the family solicitor to be present on that occasion in the family interests i will say nothing of mr kyrles amazement or of the terms in which he expressed his opinion of my conduct from the first stage of the investigation to the last it is only necessary to mention that he at once decided on accompanying us to cumberland we started the next morning by the early train laura marian mr kyrle and myself in one carriage and john owen with a clerk from mr kyrles office occupying places in another on reaching the limmeridge station we went first to the farmhouse at todds corner it was my firm determination that laura should not enter her uncles house till she appeared there publicly recognised as his niece i left marian to settle the question of accommodation with mrs todd as soon as the good woman had recovered from the bewilderment of hearing what our errand was in cumberland and i arranged with her husband that john owen was to be committed to the ready hospitality of the farmservants these preliminaries completed mr kyrle and i set forth together for limmeridge house i cannot write at any length of our interview with mr fairlie for i cannot recall it to mind without feelings of impatience and contempt which make the scene even in remembrance only utterly repulsive to me i prefer to record simply that i carried my point mr fairlie attempted to treat us on his customary plan we passed without notice his polite insolence at the outset of the interview we heard without sympathy the protestations with which he tried next to persuade us that the disclosure of the conspiracy had overwhelmed him he absolutely whined and whimpered at last like a fretful child how was he to know that his niece was alive when he was told that she was dead he would welcome dear laura with pleasure if we would only allow him time to recover did we think he looked as if he wanted hurrying into his grave no then why hurry him he reiterated these remonstrances at every available opportunity until i checked them once for all by placing him firmly between two inevitable alternatives i gave him his choice between doing his niece justice on my terms or facing the consequence of a public assertion of her existence in a court of law mr kyrle to whom he turned for help told him plainly that he must decide the question then and there characteristically choosing the alternative which promised soonest to release him from all personal anxiety he announced with a sudden outburst of energy that he was not strong enough to bear any more bullying and that we might do as we pleased mr kyrle and i at once went downstairs and agreed upon a form of letter which was to be sent round to the tenants who had attended the false funeral summoning them in mr fairlies name to assemble in limmeridge house on the next day but one an order referring to the same date was also written directing a statuary in carlisle to send a man to limmeridge churchyard for the purpose of erasing an inscription mr kyrle who had arranged to sleep in the house undertaking that mr fairlie should hear these letters read to him and should sign them with his own hand i occupied the interval day at the farm in writing a plain narrative of the conspiracy and in adding to it a statement of the practical contradiction which facts offered to the assertion of lauras death this i submitted to mr kyrle before i read it the next day to the assembled tenants we also arranged the form in which the evidence should be presented at the close of the reading after these matters were settled mr kyrle endeavoured to turn the conversation next to lauras affairs knowing and desiring to know nothing of those affairs and doubting whether he would approve as a man of business of my conduct in relation to my wifes lifeinterest in the legacy left to madame fosco i begged mr kyrle to excuse me if i abstained from discussing the subject it was connected as i could truly tell him with those sorrows and troubles of the past which we never referred to among ourselves and which we instinctively shrank from discussing with others my last labour as the evening approached was to obtain the narrative of the tombstone by taking a copy of the false inscription on the grave before it was erased the day came the day when laura once more entered the familiar breakfastroom at lummeridge house all the persons assembled rose from their seats as marian and i led her in a perceptible shock of surprise an audible murmur of interest ran through them at the sight of her face mr fairlie was present by my express stipulation with mr kyrle by his side his valet stood behind him with a smellingbottle ready in one hand and a white handkerchief saturated with eaudecologne in the other i opened the proceedings by publicly appealing to mr fairlie to say whether i appeared there with his authority and under his express sanction he extended an arm on either side to mr kyrle and to his valet was by them assisted to stand on his legs and then expressed himself in these terms allow me to present mr hartright i am as great an invalid as ever and he is so very obliging as to speak for me the subject is dreadfully embarrassing please hear him and dont make a noise with those words he slowly sank back again into the chair and took refuge in his scented pockethandkerchief the disclosure of the conspiracy followed after i had offered my preliminary explanation first of all in the fewest and the plainest words i was there present i informed my hearers to declare first that my wife then sitting by me was the daughter of the late mr philip fairlie secondly to prove by positive facts that the funeral which they had attended in limmeridge churchyard was the funeral of another woman thirdly to give them a plain account of how it had all happened without further preface i at once read the narrative of the conspiracy describing it in clear outline and dwelling only upon the pecuniary motive for it in order to avoid complicating my statement by unnecessary reference to sir percivals secret this done i reminded my audience of the date on the inscription in the churchyard the th and confirmed its correctness by producing the certificate of death i then read them sir percivals letter of the th announcing his wifes intended journey from hampshire to london on the th i next showed that she had taken that journey by the personal testimony of the driver of the fly and i proved that she had performed it on the appointed day by the orderbook at the livery stables marian then added her own statement of the meeting between laura and herself at the mad house and of her sisters escape after which i closed the proceedings by informing the persons present of sir percivals death and of my marriage mr kyrle rose when i resumed my seat and declared as the legal adviser of the family that my case was proved by the plainest evidence he had ever heard in his life as he spoke those words i put my arm round laura and raised her so that she was plainly visible to every one in the room are you all of the same opinion i asked advancing towards them a few steps and pointing to my wife the effect of the question was electrical far down at the lower end of the room one of the oldest tenants on the estate started to his feet and led the rest with him in an instant i see the man now with his honest brown face and his irongrey hair mounted on the windowseat waving his heavy ridingwhip over his head and leading the cheers there she is alive and hearty god bless her gi it tongue lads gi it tongue the shout that answered him reiterated again and again was the sweetest music i ever heard the labourers in the village and the boys from the school assembled on the lawn caught up the cheering and echoed it back on us the farmers wives clustered round laura and struggled which should be first to shake hands with her and to implore her with the tears pouring over their own cheeks to bear up bravely and not to cry she was so completely overwhelmed that i was obliged to take her from them and carry her to the door there i gave her into marians care marian who had never failed us yet whose courageous selfcontrol did not fail us now left by myself at the door i invited all the persons present after thanking them in lauras name and mine to follow me to the churchyard and see the false inscription struck off the tombstone with their own eyes they all left the house and all joined the throng of villagers collected round the grave where the statuarys man was waiting for us in a breathless silence the first sharp stroke of the steel sounded on the marble not a voice was heard not a soul moved till those three words laura lady glyde had vanished from sight then there was a great heave of relief among the crowd as if they felt that the last fetters of the conspiracy had been struck off laura herself and the assembly slowly withdrew it was late in the day before the whole inscription was erased one line only was afterwards engraved in its place anne catherick july th i returned to limmeridge house early enough in the evening to take leave of mr kyrle he and his clerk and the driver of the fly went back to london by the night train on their departure an insolent message was delivered to me from mr fairlie who had been carried from the room in a shattered condition when the first outbreak of cheering answered my appeal to the tenantry the message conveyed to us mr fairlies best congratulations and requested to know whether we contemplated stopping in the house i sent back word that the only object for which we had entered his doors was accomplished that i contemplated stopping in no mans house but my own and that mr fairlie need not entertain the slightest apprehension of ever seeing us or hearing from us again we went back to our friends at the farm to rest that night and the next morning escorted to the station with the heartiest enthusiasm and good will by the whole village and by all the farmers in the neighbourhood we returned to london as our view of the cumberland hills faded in the distance i thought of the first disheartening circumstances under which the long struggle that was now past and over had been pursued it was strange to look back and to see now that the poverty which had denied us all hope of assistance had been the indirect means of our success by forcing me to act for myself if we had been rich enough to find legal help what would have been the result the gain on mr kyrles own showing would have been more than doubtful the loss judging by the plain test of events as they had really happened certain the law would never have obtained me my interview with mrs catherick the law would never have made pesca the means of forcing a confession from the count ii two more events remain to be added to the chain before it reaches fairly from the outset of the story to the close while our new sense of freedom from the long oppression of the past was still strange to us i was sent for by the friend who had given me my first employment in wood engraving to receive from him a fresh testimony of his regard for my welfare he had been commissioned by his employers to go to paris and to examine for them a fresh discovery in the practical application of his art the merits of which they were anxious to ascertain his own engagements had not allowed him leisure time to undertake the errand and he had most kindly suggested that it should be transferred to me i could have no hesitation in thankfully accepting the offer for if i acquitted myself of my commission as i hoped i should the result would be a permanent engagement on the illustrated newspaper to which i was now only occasionally attached i received my instructions and packed up for the journey the next day on leaving laura once more under what changed circumstances in her sisters care a serious consideration recurred to me which had more than once crossed my wifes mind as well as my own already i mean the consideration of marians future had we any right to let our selfish affection accept the devotion of all that generous life was it not our duty our best expression of gratitude to forget ourselves and to think only of her i tried to say this when we were alone for a moment before i went away she took my hand and silenced me at the first words after all that we three have suffered together she said there can be no parting between us till the last parting of all my heart and my happiness walter are with laura and you wait a little till there are childrens voices at your fireside i will teach them to speak for me in their language and the first lesson they say to their father and mother shall be we cant spare our aunt my journey to paris was not undertaken alone at the eleventh hour pesca decided that he would accompany me he had not recovered his customary cheerfulness since the night at the opera and he determined to try what a weeks holiday would do to raise his spirits i performed the errand entrusted to me and drew out the necessary report on the fourth day from our arrival in paris the fifth day i arranged to devote to sightseeing and amusements in pescas company our hotel had been too full to accommodate us both on the same floor my room was on the second story and pescas was above me on the third on the morning of the fifth day i went upstairs to see if the professor was ready to go out just before i reached the landing i saw his door opened from the inside a long delicate nervous hand not my friends hand certainly held it ajar at the same time i heard pescas voice saying eagerly in low tones and in his own language i remember the name but i dont know the man you saw at the opera he was so changed that i could not recognise him i will forward the report i can do no more no more need be done answered the second voice the door opened wide and the lighthaired man with the scar on his cheek the man i had seen following count foscos cab a week before came out he bowed as i drew aside to let him pass his face was fearfully pale and he held fast by the banisters as he descended the stairs i pushed open the door and entered pescas room he was crouched up in the strangest manner in a corner of the sofa he seemed to shrink from me when i approached him am i disturbing you i asked i did not know you had a friend with you till i saw him come out no friend said pesca eagerly i see him today for the first time and the last i am afraid he has brought you bad news horrible news walter let us go back to london i dont want to stop here i am sorry i ever came the misfortunes of my youth are very hard upon me he said turning his face to the wall very hard upon me in my later time i try to forget them and they will not forget me we cant return i am afraid before the afternoon i replied would you like to come out with me in the meantime no my friend i will wait here but let us go back today pray let us go back i left him with the assurance that he should leave paris that afternoon we had arranged the evening before to ascend the cathedral of notre dame with victor hugos noble romance for our guide there was nothing in the french capital that i was more anxious to see and i departed by myself for the church approaching notre dame by the riverside i passed on my way the terrible deadhouse of paris the morgue a great crowd clamoured and heaved round the door there was evidently something inside which excited the popular curiosity and fed the popular appetite for horror i should have walked on to the church if the conversation of two men and a woman on the outskirts of the crowd had not caught my ear they had just come out from seeing the sight in the morgue and the account they were giving of the dead body to their neighbours described it as the corpse of a man a man of immense size with a strange mark on his left arm the moment those words reached me i stopped and took my place with the crowd going in some dim foreshadowing of the truth had crossed my mind when i heard pescas voice through the open door and when i saw the strangers face as he passed me on the stairs of the hotel now the truth itself was revealed to me revealed in the chance words that had just reached my ears other vengeance than mine had followed that fated man from the theatre to his own door from his own door to his refuge in paris other vengeance than mine had called him to the day of reckoning and had exacted from him the penalty of his life the moment when i had pointed him out to pesca at the theatre in the hearing of that stranger by our side who was looking for him too was the moment that sealed his doom i remembered the struggle in my own heart when he and i stood face to face the struggle before i could let him escape me and shuddered as i recalled it slowly inch by inch i pressed in with the crowd moving nearer and nearer to the great glass screen that parts the dead from the living at the morgue nearer and nearer till i was close behind the front row of spectators and could look in there he lay unowned unknown exposed to the flippant curiosity of a french mob there was the dreadful end of that long life of degraded ability and heartless crime hushed in the sublime repose of death the broad firm massive face and head fronted us so grandly that the chattering frenchwomen about me lifted their hands in admiration and cried in shrill chorus ah what a handsome man the wound that had killed him had been struck with a knife or dagger exactly over his heart no other traces of violence appeared about the body except on the left arm and there exactly in the place where i had seen the brand on pescas arm were two deep cuts in the shape of the letter t which entirely obliterated the mark of the brotherhood his clothes hung above him showed that he had been himself conscious of his danger they were clothes that had disguised him as a french artisan for a few moments but not for longer i forced myself to see these things through the glass screen i can write of them at no greater length for i saw no more the few facts in connection with his death which i subsequently ascertained partly from pesca and partly from other sources may be stated here before the subject is dismissed from these pages his body was taken out of the seine in the disguise which i have described nothing being found on him which revealed his name his rank or his place of abode the hand that struck him was never traced and the circumstances under which he was killed were never discovered i leave others to draw their own conclusions in reference to the secret of the assassination as i have drawn mine when i have intimated that the foreigner with the scar was a member of the brotherhood admitted in italy after pescas departure from his native country and when i have further added that the two cuts in the form of a t on the left arm of the dead man signified the italian word traditore and showed that justice had been done by the brotherhood on a traitor i have contributed all that i know towards elucidating the mystery of count foscos death the body was identified the day after i had seen it by means of an anonymous letter addressed to his wife he was buried by madame fosco in the cemetery of pere la chaise fresh funeral wreaths continue to this day to be hung on the ornamental bronze railings round the tomb by the countesss own hand she lives in the strictest retirement at versailles not long since she published a biography of her deceased husband the work throws no light whatever on the name that was really his own or on the secret history of his life it is almost entirely devoted to the praise of his domestic virtues the assertion of his rare abilities and the enumeration of the honours conferred on him the circumstances attending his death are very briefly noticed and are summed up on the last page in this sentence his life was one long assertion of the rights of the aristocracy and the sacred principles of order and he died a martyr to his cause iii the summer and autumn passed after my return from paris and brought no changes with them which need be noticed here we lived so simply and quietly that the income which i was now steadily earning sufficed for all our wants in the february of the new year our first child was born a son my mother and sister and mrs vesey were our guests at the little christening party and mrs clements was present to assist my wife on the same occasion marian was our boys godmother and pesca and mr gilmore the latter acting by proxy were his godfathers i may add here that when mr gilmore returned to us a year later he assisted the design of these pages at my request by writing the narrative which appears early in the story under his name and which though first in order of precedence was thus in order of time the last that i received the only event in our lives which now remains to be recorded occurred when our little walter was six months old at that time i was sent to ireland to make sketches for certain forthcoming illustrations in the newspaper to which i was attached i was away for nearly a fortnight corresponding regularly with my wife and marian except during the last three days of my absence when my movements were too uncertain to enable me to receive letters i performed the latter part of my journey back at night and when i reached home in the morning to my utter astonishment there was no one to receive me laura and marian and the child had left the house on the day before my return a note from my wife which was given to me by the servant only increased my surprise by informing me that they had gone to limmeridge house marian had prohibited any attempt at written explanations i was entreated to follow them the moment i came back complete enlightenment awaited me on my arrival in cumberland and i was forbidden to feel the slightest anxiety in the meantime there the note ended it was still early enough to catch the morning train i reached limmeridge house the same afternoon my wife and marian were both upstairs they had established themselves by way of completing my amazement in the little room which had been once assigned to me for a studio when i was employed on mr fairlies drawings on the very chair which i used to occupy when i was at work marian was sitting now with the child industriously sucking his coral upon her lap while laura was standing by the wellremembered drawingtable which i had so often used with the little album that i had filled for her in past times open under her hand what in the name of heaven has brought you here i asked does mr fairlie know marian suspended the question on my lips by telling me that mr fairlie was dead he had been struck by paralysis and had never rallied after the shock mr kyrle had informed them of his death and had advised them to proceed immediately to limmeridge house some dim perception of a great change dawned on my mind laura spoke before i had quite realised it she stole close to me to enjoy the surprise which was still expressed in my face my darling walter she said must we really account for our boldness in coming here i am afraid love i can only explain it by breaking through our rule and referring to the past there is not the least necessity for doing anything of the kind said marian we can be just as explicit and much more interesting by referring to the future she rose and held up the child kicking and crowing in her arms do you know who this is walter she asked with bright tears of happiness gathering in her eyes even my bewilderment has its limits i replied i think i can still answer for knowing my own child child she exclaimed with all her easy gaiety of old times do you talk in that familiar manner of one of the landed gentry of england are you aware when i present this illustrious baby to your notice in whose presence you stand evidently not let me make two eminent personages known to one another mr walter hartright the heir of limmeridge so she spoke in writing those last words i have written all the pen falters in my hand the long happy labour of many months is over marian was the good angel of our lives let marian end our story
