 bluebeard a musical fantasy by kate douglas wiggin dedication to my friend walter damrosch master of the art form so irreverently treated in these pages kate douglas wiggin preface more than a dozen years ago musical scholars and critics began to illuminate the musical darkness of new york with lecturerecitals explanatory of the more abstruse german operas previous to this era no one had ever thought for instance of unfolding the story or the leit motive if there happened to be any in the bohemian girl maritana or martha these and many other delightful but thoroughly thirdclass works unfolded themselves as they went along to the entire satisfaction of a public so unbelievably carefree happy thoughtless childlike uninstructed that it hardly seems as if they could have been our ancestors wagner changed all this at a single blow one could no longer leave ones brains with ones hat in the coatroom when the nibelungen ringappeared learned critics pitifully comprehending the fathomless ignorance of the people began to give lectures on the ring to large audiences mostly of ladies through whom in course of time a certain amount of information percolated and reached the husbands the somewhat circuitous but only possible method by which aesthetic knowledge can be conveyed to the american male women are hopeless idealists it is not enough for them that their brothers or husbands should pay for the seats at the opera and accompany them there clad in irreproachable evening dress not at all they wish them to sit erect keep awake and look intelligent and it is but just to say that many of them succeed in doing so the artform known as the lecturerecital then has succeeded in forcibly educating so large a section of the public that immense audiences gather at the metropolitan opera house onehalf of them at least in a state of such chastened susceptibility and erudition that the tetralogy of wagner has no terrors for them the next move was in behalf of the more cryptic symbolic hectic toxic works of the ultramodern french school which have been so brilliantly illuminated by their protagonists that thousands of women in the larger cities recognize a masters voice whenever one of his themes is played upon the victrola i shall offer my practically priceless manuscript of bluebeard for production in french at the metropolitan and in english at the century opera house meantime mr hammerstein is so impressed with its originality audacity and tragic power that he is laying the cornerstone for a magnificent new building and will open and close it with bluebeard in german if no unforeseen legal complications should prevent it is in preparation for all this activity that i issue this brief but epochmaking little work kate douglas wiggin new york

chorus of bluebeards vassals baritonesandbasses chorus of headless wives sopranosandcontraltos chorus of sheep tenors bluebeard lecturerecital we are proceeding on the supposition that this musicdrama of bluebeard is a posthumous work of richard wagner it is said our authority being a late number of the musical and court journal diefliegendeblatter that a housemaid while tidying one of the rooms in a villa formerly occupied by the wagner family in summer perceived an enormous halo shining persistently over a certain bedstead standing against the wall the said halo absolutely refusing to remove itself when attacked with a featherduster the housemaid thought at first that it was simply an effect of the sunlight but observed subsequently that the halo was just as large fine yellow opaque and circular on dark days as on bright ones consequently on a certain morning when it was so huge and glaring as to be positively offensive to the eye inasmuch as it did not hang over a holy family but over an ordinary and somewhat uncomfortable article of furniture she adopted the courageous feminine expedient of looking underneath the bed where she found this priceless legacy of the master reposing in a hatbox in which it had lain for nearly half a century unsuspected undisturbed if this incident is true it is exquisitely pretty and touching if not it is highly absurd and ridiculous but the same may be said of many hypothetical historical incidents at all events the financial arrangements which followed upon the discovery of the ms and the price demanded for it by the wagnerian housemaid convinces me absolutely of its authenticity to me it is not strange that wagner should choose to immortalize the story of bluebeard for the interesting and inspiring myth has been used in all ages and in all countries it differs slightly in the various versions in some the shade of the villains beard is robinsegg and in others indigo in some the fatal key is bloodstained instead of broken while in the matter of wives the myth varies according to the customs of the locality where it appears in monogamous countries the number of ladies slain is generally six but in bigamous and polygamous countries the interesting victims mount they were always hung high you remember to the number of one hundred and seventeen i ought perhaps to confess to you that there are critics who still deny the authenticity of this work although they concede that it is full of wagners spirit and influence and may have been produced by some ardent follower or pupil one steeped to the eyebrows in mythologic lore and capable of hurling titanic tonal eccentricities against the uncomprehending eardrum of the dull and ignorant herd there are those too who think that some disciple of richard ii strauss not wagner had a hand in the orchestration simply because his sinfonia domestica occupies itself with the same sweet history of the inglenook which is the basis of the bluebeard libretto strausss symphony is worked out along more tranquil lines to be sure but it is only the history of a single day of married life and a day arbitrarily chosen by the composer it is conceivable that there may have been other days the incredulous ones urge that wagner would never have been drawn to the bluebeard myth as a foundation for a libretto but for myself i regard its selection as a probable reaction violent no doubt from the composition of parsifal in parsifal the central themes and the unavoidable conclusion are derived from outgrown beliefs that have long since ceased to influence the heart of mankind parsifal is medieval mystic rapt devout its ideals are those of celibacy and asceticism the products of an age whose theories and practices as regards sexrelationships can have no echo in modern civilization what more natural than that wagner should fling himself for mental and emotional relief into a story throbbing with human love and marriage neither would some calm domestic drama serve some story of the nursery or hearthstone dealing with the relations of one fond husband and father one doting mother and child as a contrast to the asceticism and celibacy of parsifal we have in bluebeard rampant and tropical polygamy fervent untiring connubialism the ardent and susceptible solomon might have been a more dignified hero one would think but although he could furnish wives enough to properly fill the stage his domestic life was not nearly as varied as thrilling and as upset as bluebeards whose story makes a wellnigh invincible appeal to manager artists and subscribers alike and for that matter is as likely to be popular with boxholders as with the gallerygods this master work enunciates the world law that woman symbolized by fatima seventh wife singing actress is determined to marry once at any cost and that man symbolized by bluebeard baritone is determined if he marries at all to marry as thoroughly and as often as possible it holds up to scorn the marriage of ambition and convenience on the one hand but on the other pursues with wrath and vengeance the lawbreaker the indiscriminate lovewinner the wifecollector and wifeslayer and although women still have a strange and persistent fancy for marriage they might sometimes avoid it if they realized that a violent death were the price we must first study the musical construction of the overture with which the musicdrama opens as it is well known that wagner in his preludes prepares the spectators mind for the impressions that are to follow several of the leading motives appear in this vorspiel and must be appreciated to be understood first we have the blaubartmotiv bluebeard motive this is a theme whose giant march gives us in rhythmic thunders the terrible power of the hero blaubartmotiv the blaubartmotiv should be constantly kept in mind as it is a clue to much of the later action being introduced whenever bluebeard budges an inch from his doorstep we do not hear in it the majestic grandeur of the wotan or walsungen motifs and why simply because it was not intended to illustrate godlike power but bruteforce now if this were all we had no more to say but listen immerwiederheirathen motiv what does this portend this entrance of another theme written for the treble clef played with the right hand but mysteriously interwoven with the bass what but that bluebeard is not to be the sole personage in this musicdrama and we judge the stranger to be a female on account of the overwhelming circumstantial evidence just given bluebeard when first introduced you remember the movement one of somber grandeur leading upward to vague desire was alone and lonely certainly the first probably the second if his mood were that of settled despair typical of a widower determined never to marry again no matter what the provocation the last note of the phrase would have been projected downward but as you must have perceived the melody terminates in a tone of something like hope there is no assurance in it do not misunderstand me there is no particular lady projected in the musical text that would have been indelicate for we do not know at the moment precisely the date when bluebeard hung up his last wife but there is a groping discontent at the opening of the drama we have not been informed whether bluebeard has ever been married at all or only a few times but we feel that he craves companionship and we know when we hear this immerwiederheirathenmotiv always about to marry again motive that he secures it the sex created expressly to furnish companionship will go on doing so even if it has to be hung up in the process look again at the second theme the immerwiederheirathenmotiv always about to marry again motive do you note a mysterious reflection of the first theme in it certainly it would be evident even to a chattering operaparty of the highest social circles but why is this asks the sordid american business man who goes to the musicdrama absolutely unfitted in mind and body to solve its great psychological questions not because wagner could not have evolved a dozen leitmotive for every measure but for a more exquisitely refined and subtle reason the wife is often found to be more or less a reflection of her husband especially in germany therefore an entirely new and original motive would have been out of place it is this extraordinary insight into the human mind which brings us to the feet of the master in reverential awe and it detracts nothing from his fame that his themes descriptive of average femininity would have been quite different had he written them for the women of this epoch the world moves rapidly this motive slips with a series of imperceptible musical glides into the siebentefraumotiv seventh wife motive bluebeard enters well in advance fatima contrapuntally obedient coming in a little behind siebentefrau motiv this fatima or seventh wife motive seems to be written in a curiously low key if we conceive it to be the index to the character of a soprano heroine but let us look further what are the two principal personages in the musicdrama to be to each other if enemies the phrase would have been written thus separation of octaves if acquaintances thus separation of octaves if friends thus separation of octave if lovers thus separation of less than one octave the ardent and tropical treble note leaving its own proper sphere and nestling cozily down in the bass staff but the hero and heroine of the musicdrama were husband and wife therefore the phrases are intertwined sufficiently for propriety but not too closely for pleasure we might also say considering fatimas probable fate that we cannot wonder that she sings in a low key and the exceedingly involved contrapuntal complications in which the motive terminates hint perhaps at wagners opinion on the momentous questionis marriage a failure next we have the bruderhochzurossmotiv brothers on a high horse motive announced by sparkling tetrazzini chromatics always at sixes and sevens darting and dashing centaurlike in semidemiquavers like horses manes and tails mounting skyward whinnyingly fatimas brothers have come to make a wedding visit to their beloved sister whom they believe happily united to a nobleman of high degree they have also come because in a musicdrama action is demanded and choruses are desirable being noisy impressive popular comparatively cheap and the participants less temperamental in character than soloists therefore more easily managed bruder hoch zu ross motiv with devilmaycare speed if you miss some of the wonderful sinuosity some of the musical curvatures of the similar horses in a hurry motive in die walkure i can only suggest that the brothers mounts were not as the fleet steeds of the gods fatimas people were living in genteel poverty and the family horses were doubtless somewhat emaciated therefore the musical realist could not in honesty depict them other than in an angular rather than curved movement the overture next takes up the arrival of the brothers who as the music plainly assures us dismount feed their steeds perform a simple toilette at the stableyard pump and then come suddenly upon bluebeard whose frenzy for disposing of fresh wives is as sudden and as allabsorbing as his desire to annex them at the moment of the brothers opportune arrival bluebeard is on the point of severing fatimas relations with the world the brothers advance a cloud of dust envelops them they rush forward dealing telling blows and the frantic bleating of fleeing sheep is heard in a wild doubletonguing of the united brass instruments very effective especially in the open air though a little trying to nervous ladies in the front rows of an operahouse this is the celebrated kilkennischekatzenmotiv motive of mortal combat it is a syncopated movement and when given at the piano is to be played furiously first with one hand and then with the other till the performer is quite weary kilkennische katzen motiv ad infinitum until one is deceased we find all through these measures most peculiar phrases introduced by halfformed musical rhythms which are a presentiment of the mental unrest and nervous prostration of fatima who does not know whether bluebeard will kill the brothers or the brothers will kill bluebeard she has never been an operagoer and does not realize that there are inexorable laws in these matters and that the villain always dies that he agrees in his contract to die no matter how healthy he may be no matter how much he dislikes it nor how slight the provocation however this scene is made notable by the famous suspense motive one hundred and seventeen bars of doubt given by the big brasses and contrabassoons there is much in this sort of programme music that is not easily intelligible to a young man who having purchased an admission ticket is wandering from back to back of one operabox after another but when fully comprehended these special phrases are replete with emotion and insight several motives are so dexterously woven into one gush of melody that they cannot be disentangled by any ordinary method and have to be wrenched apart by the enthusiast who employs when milder means fail a sort of intellectual dynamite to extricate the meaning from the score with the aid of this lecture which is better than an eartrumpet and a magnifyingglass we can however trace a schwertmotiv sword motive showing the weapons used in the combat the gluckseligkeitmotiv felicity motive well named for we must remember that fatima is witnessing the duel from the castle window her heart beating high at the prospect of widowhood and toward the end the famous ausgespieltmotiv motive of spent strength and spilled blood gluckseligkeit motiv ausgespielt motiv the ausgespieltmotiv is written in four flats but as a matter of fact only one person is flat viz bluebeard who has just been slain by mustapha the other three flats must refer to the sheep accidentally hit by the younger brothers who aim for bluebeard but miss him being indifferent marksmen why does the union of these motive bruderhochzuross brothers on a high horse kilkennischekatzen mortal combat schwert sword gluckseligkeit felicity of fatima and ausgespielt spent strength and spilled blood when blended in one majestically discordant whole produce upon us a feeling of profound grief mingled with hysterical mirth ensemble motiv blaubartschwertgluckseligkeitleichen and why do the measures grow more and more sad as they melt into the touching blutaufdemmondmotiv bloodonthemoon motive blut auf dem mond motiv slowly and with infinite pathos simply because in a mortal combat somebody is invariably wounded and sometimes killed wagner sang of human life as it is not as it might could would or should be from the blutaufdemmondmotiv bloodonthemoon motive we glide at once into a dirge the leichen or corpse motive one of those superb funeral marches with which we are familiar in the other musicdramas of wagner for the master though not an irishman is never so happy as on these funeral occasions leichen motiv if any brainless and bigoted boxholder should ask why the blaubart motiv is repeated in this funeral march i ask him in return how he expects otherwise to know who is killed will he take the trouble to reflect that these are the motives of the vorspiel and that the curtain has not yet risen on the musicdrama but why he asks do we hear an undercurrent of mirth pulsating joyously through the prevailing sadness of this leichenmotiv or funeral march simply because we cannot be expected to feel the same unmixed grief at the death of a wifemurderer as at the death of a wifepreserver ah where shall we find again so subtle a reading of the throbbing heart of humanity the schwertmotiv mingles again with the haunting strains of the halfsad halfglad leichenmotiv until the vorspiel ends abruptly with a single note of ineffable meaning thus tod und holle motiv off the keyboard to the left this is very interesting to the student and means much if it means anything the sword of the elder brother mustapha has gone through bluebeard if not the swords of the other brothers this you say might not have been necessarily fatal since those hardy ruffians of a bygone age were proof against many a stab but in this case the sword of the heroic mustapha was accompanied by the killing schwert motiv consequently the villain is dead but what has become of him we have the one clue only which will be known by all students in future as the todundholle motiv just given above bluebeard has gone where we will not follow him unless we are obliged is this asserting too much alas it is only too evident if it had been wagners intention to refer to the glorious immortality of a godlike hero we should have had the exquisite strains of a heavenly harp thus rising arpeggios or the whir of angels wings thus trills off the righthand end of the keyboard and a final significant note thus a good inches above the treble staff stretch the keyboard a little if necessary and play a half if there is not room for a whole note whose piercing sweetness and dizzy altitude would have symbolized heaven or at least walhalla alas it is all too plain we have this inch below the bass staff enough in itself to show his whereabouts and as if that were not enough this verdammungsmotiv allegro frantico dissonances and inches below the bass staff to show that he is uncomfortable it will be interesting for the student to note the difference between the verdammungsmotiv of bluebeard and the damnation motive of wagners earlier opera tannhauser damnation motive both are strong tragic and powerful but the sins of bluebeard are gross and those of tannhauser subtle consequently the peril of each is foreshadowed in its own way it being very clear that bluebeards fate is final while tannhauser as we know is saved by the spiritual influence of elizabeth a very different lady indeed from the frivolous and mercenary fatima the plot of this musicdrama itself is made beautifully clear by this vorspiel and lecturerecital so that even a mother and child at a matinee can follow the tonepictures without difficulty but the libretto which is a remarkable specimen of wagners alliterative verse only helps the more to rivet attention and compel admiration i have given you an idea of the brief overture and the opera itself opens with a somber recitative descriptive or symbolic of the dark ages of juvenile literature recitative the dark ages of juvenile literature do not afford a chronicle of greater atrocity than that furnished by a very glum grim gruesome gory but connubiallyminded gentleman whose ugly blue beard was a perfect monstrosity he also had an unfortunate predilection for leading unattached ladies to the altar constantly marrying wives six wives successively one after another on a regular railroad of matrimonial velocity but finding them intoto all very soso determined to turn each one of them into a good woman by cutting off her head as a punishment for the most unmitigatedly determined and persevering female curiosity with naivete but to our tale the tale introduces the lovely luckless fatima sitting at her cottage window dreaming the dreams of girlhood she has received bluebeards message of love and is awaiting his coming as the hero of her hearts romance this traum theme is almost precisely like the guileless fool motive of parsifal and the application to fatima is unmistakable aria within sight of his castle a short hours ride an impecunious old lady lived two marriageable and impecunious daughters beside whom bluebeard had seen and at loves highest pitch sent to say he would marry he didnt care which sent to say he would marry he didnt care which we now have bluebeards triumphal journey toward fatimas cottage from whence he is to bring her as his bride if this brutal bigamist had any preference it was for anne fatimas younger sister but he knew that it was only a matter of a few weeks anyway so there is not the slightest hint in the music of anything but the tempered joy with which the accustomed bridegroom approaches the familiar altar we have the blaubart motiv again here and we must not be disturbed to find it heralded thus noisily and fussily repeated deep notes we find the same thing later on this is merely an introductory phrase the losgehenlassenmotiv see me getting ready to go motive here we note wagners sublime regard for truth and realism does bluebeard go does anybody go without getting ready to go certainly not yet they have gone for years whenever they liked in the shiftless operas of the italian school without the least preparation they would even come back before they went if it were any more pleasing pictorial or melodious it took a heroic genius like that of wagner to return to the simple eternal truth of things we have a striking example here of wagners power of modifying and inverting a motive carrying it from key to key giving it forwards and backwards upside down and otherendto according to the feeling he wishes it to express whether it be love rage desire impatience ardor or what not the losgehenlassenmotiv is simplicity itself when it first appears in c major see motive but bluebeards exits are many partly because his entrances are so numerous and for every exit this motive conveys a new meaning bluebeard is always getting ready to go but with what different purposes in mind he goes for pastime and for passion he goes for wooing and for wantoning for marriage and for murder he goes in d sharp with pomp pride and power and we can distinguish the tread of his servants feet the clatter of arms and the hurrying together of his escort and retinue he goes again in b flat minor stealthily and unattended the orchestra giving the motive with muted violins and subdued brass we seem to hear naught but the soft padpad of his felt bedroom slippers on the marble steps and we murmur to one another what does he propose to do now we have next the dragon elephant and tiger motive the dragon motive being intentionally reminiscent of the one in siegfried there is not in the entire range of modern music anything more impressive than this splendid journey of a barbaric prince toward his chosen victim no stage picture could be more dazzling than the one brought before the minds eye in the majestic munificent measures that herald the pageant aria and true to his message the lover did come with cymbals and horns and a big indian drum the measures that follow these describe the tiger swinging on behind the triumphal cab this is a delicious whimsicality and the music is as gay and sportive as anything in die meistersinger aria and an elephant huge to his cab was confined how the character of bluebeard stands out in these passages bluebeard morbid erotic megalophonous megalomaniac with his grandiose air and outlandish accoutrements it seems odd that rumors of his matrimonial past had not reached fatima for the libretto tells us authorized operahouse edition not the one sold on the sidewalk that his castle was only an hours ride distant in any event one would think the sight of the lovers approach with lions and elephants in attendance and a tiger hanging on behind the chariot might have shown fatima that although bluebeard might be admirable as an advance agent for a menagerie he would hardly be a pleasant fireside companion however it was the old story moved by love ambition poverty ennui or what not fatima lost her head as all bluebeards previous wives had done both before and after marriage and left the humble home of her childhood for the unknown castle simple chords give us this information thus semplice piano for the humble home agitato fortissimo for the unknown castle then comes the liebesgrussmotiv loves greeting motive no single instrument can give this exquisite theme the whole symphony of human nature seems to rise and spread its wings in a glorious harmony of pairs and twos of a kind melting in passionate octaves and triplets the groping ardent distracted thwarted but ever protesting bass set against a coquettish evasive yet timidly yielding treble the occasional introduction of a mysterious minor in the midst of a wellauthenticated major gives us an intimation that wooing is not an exact science next come the hochzeitsreiseundflitterwochenmotive the bridal tour and honeymoon motives here are harp glissandos here are voices soaring voices roaring voices darting voices floating weaving an audible embroidery of sound they make up the most exquisitely tender scene of the opera and arc especially interesting to us in america since they are built upon one of our national songs this can only be regarded as a flattering recognition of our support of german opera in this country aria midst the treasures of his palaces deelighted to roam sister anne with fair fatima explored their new home home home sweet sweet home theres no place like home when a maids too poor to roam it is later on in this act that we have the celebrated hope motive a marvelous series of tonepictures so novel and sensational that many boxholders are expected to drop in at tenthirty for the excitement of this one brief scene the motive wanders from key to key hoping that in the end it will hit off the right one fatima is hoping to find her ideal in bluebeard sister anne is hoping to get a handsomer husband than fatimas bluebeard is hoping that sister anne will be his eighth spouse and hoping that there will be room to hang her in the hidden chamber in which his deceased wives are already pressed for room all this is reflected in the voices of the singers together with many other emotions they hope that they will be able to come in just enough after or enough before the usual time of entrance to rivet the conductors attention that they will be preserved from falling into one anothers parts that they will not be drowned by the orchestra that they will be able to mount the dizzying heights of a precipitous chromatic scale and manage an unrehearsed descent in fifths on the halfnotes something that always causes intense joy in an uneducated audience especially when it is unsuccessful this scene runs the gamut of human emotion the universe is mirrored in it first one of the themes which we have noted and then another is sounded bringing to the bearers mind all the crucial moments of bluebeards strange perverted wifepursuing life as well as all the aspirations and disappointments of fatimas ambitious but checkered career all the while that this complicated web of motives is being woven out of unresolved dissonances the thirty first violins keep on playing the same three notes in everprecipitated rhythms this is radical audacious and effective the notes are g flat a sharp and b natural and the world reels as we hear them everything is ours in this scene orchestration vocalization dramatization characterization gesticulation auditory inflammation cacophonation demoralization adumbration there is an abrupt change of key after the honeymoon motive from sweetest major to a piercing minor this is exquisitely sincere and symbolic though it is a point too delicate to be perceived save by musicians who have married but have not been able to hang up their wives the libretto goes on to say the honeymoon passed when a letter one day upon urgent affairs called lord bluebeard away to inspection sweet love all my castle i leave but remember with this key be on the quivive it is not a natural key think of that my swords in the key of one sharp and thats flat then he half drew his blade and it was sharp and flat from this point the musicdrama hastens tragically to a close we have bluebeards sudden and feigned journey introduced by a pompous march of great originality march pomposo decrescendosempre p pp ppp then we have the fatal curiosity of fatima and her sister anne we must extenuate here nor aught set down in malice remembering that wagner knew only the women of his own day before the sex was uplifted and purified by the vote and he naturally depicted them with the manengendered vices that were then a part of their unhappy heritage this neugierdemotiv curiosity motive is made up of agitated sharply accentuated sixteenth notes played with incredible vivacity and culminating in a terrifying orchestral crash where entrance is made into the hidden chamber with its famous tableau so eloquent of the polygamous instinct of man an instinct only kept in subjection by the most stringent laws and the most militant domestic discipline antifeminist aria but fatima said to the keyhole lets creep there can be no harm just in one little peep we are women besides there are none to behold us if he wished us to leave it he shouldnt have told us it is these inexcusable lines which have caused the feminist party to boycott and perhaps rightly any operahouse in which this drama is given urging that they contain an insult which can be wiped out only with blood or ballots i sympathize with this feeling yet as i said before there are extenuating circumstances wagner was born a hundred years ago in his time the hand of woman though white was flabby and inert from years of darning patching stirring the pot buttoning and unbuttoning feeding and spanking mans perennial progeny he had no conception how that frail hand would be steadied and strengthened by dropping the ballot into the box how curiosity vanity parasitic coquetry lack of logic overweening interest in millinery and inability to balance a checkbook how these weaknesses would vanish under the inspiring influences of municipal politics therefore i feel disposed to forgive him and to attribute to him not absolute and deliberate insult so much as a kind of patronizing persiflage in this case however feminists will say that the great wagner undoubtedly and regrettably overreached himself here is just a hint of the theme a paltry parasitic midvictorian motive curiosity aria curiosity conquerd the key was applied and with thunder most awful the door opened wide now comes the much discussed chorus of headless wives which is a distinct prophecy of debussy you have noted in late musical criticisms allusions to the ghosts of themes used in pelleas and melisande soundwraiths wandering in air here we have the same thing and employed with exquisite appropriateness the ladies hanging in the secret chamber are mere bodies their heads being decidedly off stage when the door is opened the wives begin to sing ala debussy the ghostly effect being secured by the fact that it is not of course the presentbodies but the absentheads that are supposed to be singing the melodic wraiths float from the key of g flat i use key in the oldfashioned sense for the word like the thing itself is fast disappearing through one and four sharps back to two and three flats employing all signatures but that of c major six sets of severed vocal organs meandering in space would hardly use the natural key then we have the opening of the mysterious door the unexpected return of bluebeard the hysterics of the illfated sisters with plenty of shrieking and swooning motives and then the celebrated hammelfleisch or mutton motive where sister anne from her post in the high tower observes for a long time nothing but sheep but alas sister anne only saw a few sheep then nothing now there is the thrilling and opportune arrival of the brothers on their high horses the mortal combat the death of the villain by the schwertmotiv the joyous funeral march and then the superb duet between mustapha the eldest brother and fatima the illfated heroine we get astonishing color contrasts in the last scene as each character is allotted a different set of instruments as accompaniment bluebeard has six sackbuts a trumpet a violdamore and a chinese temple gong fatima three lutes an archlute and a pianola mustapha a bassdrum and a harpsichord and sister anne a pair of virginals an exquisite touch this to bluebeards servants are allotted barrelorgans accordions jewsharps mandolins bagpipes and triangles all this gives a tonal splendor that simply beggars description when the combat is over and bluebeards immense body is prone and lifeless in the dust wagner suddenly leaves tragedy and gives us a melodious duet between the brother and sister on the theme what can equal a brothers love this duet and finale unite to form a masterpiece a deserved rebuke to any cynic who may consider that wagner could not adopt the enervating methods of the italian school if he desired his cadenzas here are miracles of compressed technique and although the melody is conventional the music itself is never for a moment simple or intelligible suggested arrangement of orchestra for presentation of bluebeardfirst violins union prompters private first violins nonunion parlour conductor organ horns flutes harps pianola second violins lutes mandolins arch lutes kettledrums battery zithers mouth organs megaphones chinese temple gong guitars double bassoons banjos tuba trombones woodwinds drums bagpipes sackbuts triangles virginals viol damore bflat cornet exit to fire escape accordions fatima singing actress whose part here is written almost entirely in appoggiaturas and mustapha baritone hold the stage the one who draws the largest salary occupying the center and the other standing wherever he can find room mustapha taking care to descend as low in his scale as fatima ascends high in hers and vying with her in exceeding the speedlimit sings oh rahahahapture several times varied by what can ehehehequal a brothers love then using the same words they sing as much as possible in unison to the end of the scene which closes with a fantasy of capricious arabesques and a series of trills on notes seldom heard from any but the highestpriced human lips ah what joywhat rap ture what can e qual a brothers love oh joyoh joyoh joy cadenza according to the skill of the performer whether wagner followed the italian school in this case in sarcasm or because he believed it was fitting considering the subject can never be known though we remember that he was at one time a great admirer of bellini but the result is a melodious and restful ending to a tragedy which were it carried to the end in unbroken gloom mystery and carnage would be too terrible and too vast for human endurance and human comprehension yet let us be just the libretto is full of barbaric brutalities it is replete with blood and carnage but although bluebeard was emphatically not a nice person and his vices cannot be condoned and although fatima was wrong in marrying for an establishment and most culpable in yielding to her curiosity still virtue triumphs in the end the story as a whole is fairly murmurous with morality sending young men and women to their homes impressed with the risks and snares involved in bigamy and polygamy and giving them an added sense of the security and gravity of the marriage tie when sparingly used
