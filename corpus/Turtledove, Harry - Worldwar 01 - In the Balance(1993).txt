of america first edition january i worldwar in the balance fleetlord atvar strode briskly into the command station of the invasion fleet bannership th emperor hetto officers stiffened in their seats as he came in but for the way his eye turrets swiveled in their sockets one to the left the other to the right he ignored them yet had any been so foolish as to omit the proper respect tie would have noticed and remembered shiplord kirel his body paint less elaborate only than atvars joined him at the projector as atvar did every morning he said let us examine the target kirel served the fleetlord by touching the control with his own index claw a blue and gray and white sphere sprang into being a perfect representation of a lifebearing world floating in space all the officers turned both eyes toward the hologram atvar as was his custom walked around the projector to view it from all sides kirel followed him when they were back where they had begun atvar ran out a bifurcated tongue coldlooking place the fleetlord said as he usually did cold and wet yet it will serve the race and the emperor kirel replied when he spoke those words the rest of the officers returned to their assigned tasks the morning ritual was over kirel went on pity such a hot white star as tosev has hatched so chilly an egg pity indeed atvar agreed that chilly world revolved around a star more than twice as bright as the sun under which hed been raised unfortunately it did so toward the outer edge of the biosphere not only did tosev have too much free water it even had frozen water on the ground here and there in the empires three current worlds frozen water was rare outside the laboratory kirel said even if tosev is colder on average than what were used to fleetlord we wont have any real trouble living there and parts will be very pleasant he opened his jaws slightly to display small sharp even teeth and the natives should give us no difficulty by the emperor thats true though his sovereign was lightyears worldwar in the balance away atvar automatically cast both eyes down to the floor for a moment so did kirel then atvar opened his jaws too sharing the shiplords amusement show me the picture sequence from the probe once more it shall be done kirel poked delicately at the projector controls tosev vanished to be replaced by a typical inhabitant a biped with a redbrown skin rather taller than a typical male of the race the biped wore a strip of cloth round its midsection and carried a bow and several stonetipped arrows black fur sprouted from the top of its head the biped vanished another took its place this one swaddled from head to foot in robes of dirty grayish tan a curved iron sword hung from a leather belt at its waist beside it stood a brownfurred riding animal with a long neck and a hump on its back atvar pointed to the furry animal then to the bipeds robes even the native creatures have to protect themselves from tosev s atrocious climate he ran a hand down the smooth glistening scales of his arm more bipeds appeared in holographic projection some with black skins some golden brown some a reddish color so light it was almost pink as the sequence moved on kirel opened his jaws in amusement once more he pointed to the projector behold now the fearsome warrior of tosev hold that image let everyone look closely at it atvar commanded it shall be done kirel stopped the flow of images every officer in the command station swiveled one eye toward the image though most kept the other on the tasks before them atvar laughed silently as he studied the tosevite fighter this native belonged to the pinkish race though only one hand and his face were visible to testify to that protective gear covered the rest of him almost as crehensively as had the earlier bipeds robes a pointed iron helmet w several dents sat on top of his head he wore a suit of rather rusty mail that reached almost to his knees and heavy leather boots below them a flimsy coat of bluish stuff helped keep the sun off the mail the animal the biped rode a somewhat more graceful relative of the humped creature looked bored with the whole business an ironheaded spear projected upward from the bipeds seat his other armament included a straight sword a knife and a shield with a cross painted on it how well do you think his kind is likely to stand up to bullets armored fighting vehicles aircraft atvar asked rhetorically the officers all laughed looking forward to an easy conquest to adding a fourth planet and solar system to the dominions of the emperor not to be outdone in enthusiasm by his commander kirel added these are recent images too they date back only about sixteen hundred years he paused to poke at a calculator that would be about eight hundred of tosev s revolutions and how much my fellow warriors how much can a world change in a mere eight hundred revolutions harry turtledove the officers laughed again more widely this time atvar laughed with them the history of the race was more than a hundred thousand years deep the ssumaz dynasty had held the throne for almost half that time ever since techniques for ensuring male heirs were worked out under the ssumaz emperors the race took rabotev twentyeight thousand years ago and seized halless i eighteen thousand years after that now it was tosev s turn the pace of conquest was quickening atvar thought carry on servants of the emperor the fleetlord said the officers stiffened once more as he left the command station he was back in his suite busy with the infinite minutiae that accompanied command when his door buzzer squawked he looked up from the computer screen with a start no one was scheduled to interrupt him at this time and the race did not lightly break routine emergency in space was improbable in the extreme but who would dare disturb him for anything less enter he growled the junior officer who came into the suite looked nervous his tail stump twitched and his eyes swiveled quickly now this way now that as if he were scanning the room for danger exalted fleetlord kinsmale of the emperor as you know we draw very near the tosev system he said his voice hardly louder than a whisper i had better know that atvar said with heavy sarcasm yyes exalted fleetlord the junior officer almost on the point of bolting visibly gathered himself before continuing exalted fleetlord i am subleader erewlo in the communications section for the past few ships days i have detected unusual radio transmissions coming from that system these appear to be artificial in nature and and now he had to force himself to go on and face atvars certain wrath from tiny doppler shifts in the signal frequency appear to be emanating from tosev in fact the fleetlord was too startled to be furious that is ridiculous he said how dare you presume to tell me that the animalriding savages our probes photographed have moved in the historic swivel of an eye turret up to electronics when we required tens of millennia for the same advance exalted fleetlord i presume nothing erewlo quavered i merely report to you anomalous data which may be of import to our mission and therefore to the race get out atvar said his voice flat and deadly dangerous erewlo fled the fleetlord glared after him the report was ridiculous on the face of it the race changed but slowly in tiny sensible increments though both the rabotevs and the hallessi were conquered before they developed radio they had had comparably long comparably leisurely developments surely that was the norm among intelligent races atvar spoke to his computer the data the subleader had mentioned worldwar in the balance came up on his screen he studied them asked the machine for their implications the implications were as erewlo had said with a probability that approached one those were artificial radio signals coming from tosev the fleetlord snarled a command the computer was not anatomically equipped to obey if the natives of tosev had somehow stumbled across radio what else did they know just as the hologram of tosev had looked like a world floating in space so the world itself seen through an armorglass window resembled nothing so much as a holographic image but to get round to its other side now atvar would have to wait for the th emperor hetto to finish half an orbit the fleetlord glared down at the planet below he had been glaring at it ever since the fleet arrived one of his own years before no one in all the vast history of the race had ever been handed such a poisonous dilemma the assembled shiplords stood waiting for atvar to give them their orders his the responsibility his the rewards and the risks the natives of tosev are more technologically advanced than we believed they would be when we undertook this expedition he said seeing if gross understatement would pry a reaction from them as one they dipped their heads slightly in assent atvar tightened his jaws would that he might bite down on his officers necks they were going to give him no help at all his the responsibility he could not even ask the emperor for instructions a message home would take twentyfour home years to arrive the reply another twentyfour the invasion foould go back into cold sleep and wait but who could say what the tites would have invented by then atvar said the tosevites appear at the moment to be fighting several wars among themselves history tells us their disunity will work to our advantage ancient history he thought the empire had had a single rule so long that no one had any practice playing on the politics of disunion but the manuals said such a thing was possible and the manuals generally knew what they were talking about kirel assumed the stooping posture of respect a polite way to show he wished to speak atvar turned both eyes on him relieved someone would say at least part of what he thought the shiplord of the th emperor hetto said is it certain we can successfully overcome the tosevites fleetlord along with radio and radar they have aircraft of their own as well as armored fighting vehicles our probes have shown them clearly but these weapons are far inferior to ours of similar types the probes also show this clearly that was straha shiplord of the th emperor yower he ranked next highest among the shiplords after kirel and wanted to surpass him one day harry turtledove they started to scatter an instant before she thumbed the firing button mounted on top of her stick the two shvak machine guns attached under the lower wing of the biplane added their roar to the racket of the fivecylinder radial engine ludmila let the guns chatter as she zoomed low above the fire as it dimmed behind her she looked back over her shoulder to see what she had accomplished a couple of germans lay sprawled in the dirt one motionless the other writhing like a fence lizard in the grasp of a cat khorosho ludmila said softly triumph drowned terror ochen khorosho it was very good every blow against the fascists helped drive them backor at least hindered them from coming farther forward flashes from out of the darkness from two places then three not fire firearms terror came roaring back ludmila gave the kukuruznik all the meager power it had a rifle bullet cracked past her head horridly close the muzzle flashes continued behind her but after a few seconds she was out of range she let the biplane climb so she could look for another target the breeze that whistled in over the windscreen of the open cockpit dried the stinking fearfilled sweat on her forehead and under her arms the trouble with the germans was that they were too good at their trade of murder and destruction they could have had only a few seconds warning before her plane swooped on them out of the night but instead of running and hiding theyd run and then fought back and almost killed her she shuddered again though they were kilometers behind her now when theyd first betrayed the treaty of peace and friendship and invaded the soviet union shed been confident the red army would quickly throw them back but defeat and retreat followed retreat and defeat bombers appeared over kiev broadwinged heinkels dorniers skinny as flying pencils graceful junkerss stukas that screamed like damned souls as they stooped hawklike on their targets they roamed as they would no soviet fighters came up to challenge them once in rossosh out of the german grasp ludmila happened to mention to a harried clerk that shed gone through osoaviakhim flight training two days later she found herself enrolled in the soviet air force she still wondered whether the man did it for the sake of the country or to save himself the trouble of finding her someplace to sleep too late to worry about that now whole regiments of women pilots flew nightharassment missions against the fascist invaders one day ludmila thought i will graduate to a real fighter instead of my u several women had become aces downing more than five german planes apiece for now though the reliable old wheatcutter would do well enough worldwar in the balance she spotted another fire off in the distance the kukuruznik banked swung toward it planes roared low overhead the red suns under their wings and on the sides of their fuselages might have been painted from blood machine guns spat flame the bullets kicked up dust and splashed in the water like the first big drops of a rainstorm liu han had been swimming and bathing when she heard the japanese fighters with a moan of terror she thrust herself all the way under until her toes sank deep into the slimy mud bottom of the stream she held her breath until the need for air drove her to the surface once more gasped in a quick breath sank when she had to come up again she tossed her head to get the long straight black hair out of her eyes then quickly looked around the fighters had vanished as quickly as they appeared but she knew the japanese soldiers would not be far behind chinese troops had retreated through her village the day before falling back toward hankow a few swift strokes and she was at the bank of the stream she scrambled up dried herself with a few quick strokes of a rough cotton towel put on her robe and sandals and took a couple of steps away from the water another drone of motors this one higher and farther away than the fighters a whistle in the air that belonged to no bird the bomb exploded less than a hundred yards from liu the blast lifted her like a toy and flung her back into the stream stunned halfdeafened she thrashed in the water she breathed in a great gulp of it coughing choking retching she thrust her head up into the precious air gasped out a prayer to the buddha amituofo help me ore bombs fell all around earth leapt into the air in fountains so pect and beautiful and transient they almost made her forget the destruction they represented the noise of each explosion slapped her in the face more like a blow physically felt than a sound metal fragments of bomb casing squealed wildly as they flew a couple of them splashed into the stream not far from liu she moaned again the year before a bomb fragment had torn her father in two the explosions moved farther away on toward the village awkwardly robe clinging to her arms and legs and hindering her every motion she swam back to the bank staggered out onto land once more no point drying herself now not when her damp towel was covered with earth she automatically picked it up and started home praying again to the amida buddha that her home still stood bomb craters pocked the fields here and there men and women lay beside them torn and twisted in death the dirt road liu saw was untouched the bombers had left it intact for the japanese army to use she wished for a cigarette shed had a pack of babies in her pocket harry turtledove but they were soaked now water dripped from her hair into her eyes when she saw columns of smoke rising into the sky she began to run her sandals went flapsquelch flapsquelch against her feet ahead in the direction of the village she heard shouts and screams but with her ears still ringing she could not make out words people stared as she ran up even in the midst of disaster her first thought was embarrassment at the way the wet cloth of her robe molded itself to her body even the small swellings of her nipples were plainly visible paying to see a womans body was a euphemism for visiting a whore no one so much as had to pay to see lius but in the chaos that followed the japanese air attack a mere womans body proved a small concern absurdly some of the people in the village instead of being terrified and filled with dread like liu capered about as if in celebration she called has everyone here gone crazy old sun no no the tailor shouted back do you know what the eastern devils bombs did can you guess an enormous grin showed his almosttoothless gums i would say they missed everything but liu paused gestured at the rising smoke i see that cannot be so almost as good old sun hugged himself with glee no even better nearly all their bombs fell right on the yamen the yamen liu gaped then started to laugh herself oh what a pity the walled enclosure of the yamen housed the county heads residence his audience hall the jail the court that sent people there the treasury and other government departments tang wen lan the county head was notoriously corrupt as were most of his clerks secretaries and servants isnt it sad i think ill go home and put on white for tangs funeral old sun said hes dead liu exclaimed i thought a man as wicked as that would live forever hes dead old sun said positivelythe ghost lifeistransient is taking him to the next world right now if deaths messenger can find enough pieces to carry one bomb landed square on the office where he was taking bribes no one will squeeze us any more how sad how terrible his elastic features twisted into a mask of mirthful mourning that belonged in a pantomime show yi min the local apothecary was less sanguine than old sun wait until the eastern dwarfs come the japanese will make stupid dead tang wen lan seem like a prince of generosity he had to leave us enough rice to get through to next year so he could squeeze us again the japanese will keep it all for themselves they dont care whether we live or die too much of china had learned that to its sorrow however rapacious and inept the government of chiang kaishek had proved itself places worldwar in the balance under japanese rule suffered worse for one thing as yi min had said the invaders took for themselves first and left only what they did not want to the chinese they controlled for another while they were rapacious they were not inept like locusts when they swept a province clean of rice they swept it clean liu said shall we run away then a peasant without his plot is nothing old sun said if i am to starve i would sooner starve at home than somewhere on the road far from my ancestors graves several other villagers agreed yi min said but what if it is a choice between living on the road and dying by the graves of your ancestors what then old sun while the two men argued liu han walked on into the village sure enough it was as old sun had said the yamen was a smoking ruin its walls smashed down here and there as if by a giants kicks the flagpole had been broken like a broomstraw the kuomintang flag white star in a blue field on red lay crumpled in the dirt through a gap in the wrecked wall liu han stared in at tang wen lans office if the county head had been in there when the bomb landed old sun was surely right in thinking him dead nothing was left of the building but a hole in the ground and some thatch blown off the roof another bomb had landed on the jail whatever the crimes for which the prisoners had been confined theyd suffered the maximum penalty shrieks said some were suffering still villagers were already going through the yamen scavenging what they could and dragging out bodies and pieces of bodies the thick meaty smell of blood fought with those of smoke andhly upturned earth liu han shuddered thinking how easily others i have been smelling her blood right now her own house stood a couple of blocks beyond the yamen she saw smoke rising from that direction but thought nothing of it no one willingly believes disaster can befall her not even when she rounded the last corner and saw the bomb crater where the house had stood did she credit her own eyes less was left here than at the county heads office i have no home the thought took several seconds to register and hardly seemed to mean anything even after liu formed it she stared down at the ground dully wondering what to do next something small and dirty lay by her left foot she recognized it in the same slow sluggish way she had realized her house was gone it was her little sons hand no sign of the rest of him remained she stooped and picked up the hand just as if he were there not merely a mutilated fragment the flesh was still warm against hers she heard a loud cry and needed a little while to know it came from her own throat the cry went on and on seemingly without her when she tried to stop she found she couldnt harry turtledove slowly slowly it stopped being the only sound in her universe other noises penetrated cheerful poppoppops like strings of firecrackers going off but they were not firecrackers they were rifles japanese soldiers were on the way david goldfarb watched the green glow of the radar screen at dover station waiting for the swarm of moving blips that would herald the return of the british bomber armada he turned to the fellow technician beside him im sure as hell gladder to be looking for our planes coming back than i was year before last watching every german in the whole wide world heading straight for london you can say that again jerome jones rubbed his weary eyes it was a bit dicey there for a while wasnt it just a bit yes goldfarb leaned back in his uncomfortable chair hunched his shoulders something in his neck went snap he grunted with relief then grunted again as he thought about jones reply hed lived surrounded by british reserve all his twentythree years even learned to imitate it but it still seemed unnatural to him his newlywed parents had fled to london to escape polish pogroms a little before the start of the first world war a stiff upper lip was not part of the scanty baggage theyd brought with them they shouted at each other and eventually at david and his brothers and sister sometimes angrily more often lovingly but always at full throttle hed never learned at home to hold back which made the trick all the harder anywhere else the reminiscent smile hed worn for a moment quickly faded by the news dribbling out pogroms rolled through poland again worse under the nazis than ever under the tsars when hitler swallowed czechoslovakia saul goldfarb had written to his own brothers and sisters and cousins in warsaw urging them to get out of poland while they could no one left a few months later it was too late to leave a blip on the screen snapped him out of his unhappy reverie blimey jones breathed kings english cast aside in surprise lookit that bugger go im looking goldfarb said he kept on looking too until the target disappeared again it didnt take long he sighed now well have to fill out a pixie report third one this week jones observed bloody pixiesre getting busier whatever the hell they are whatever goldfarb echoed for the past several months radars in englandand he gathered unofficially the united states as well had been showing phantom aircraft flying impossibly high and even more impossibly fast feet and better than miles an hour were the numbers hed heard most often he said i used to think they came from worldwar in the balance something wrong in the circuits somewhere ive seen enough now though that i have trouble believing it what else could they be jones still belonged to the circuitryproblem school he fired off the big guns of its argument they arent ours they dont belong to the yanks and if they were jerrys theyd be dropping things on our heads what does that leave men from mars laugh all you like goldfarb said stubbornly if theres something wrong in the machinerys guts why cant the boffins find it and fix it crikey i dont think even the blokes who invented this beast know what all it can and cant do jones retorted since that was unquestionably true goldfarb didnt respond to it directly instead he said so why has the machinery only started finding pixies now why didnt they show up on the screens from the first day if the boffins cant figure it out how do you expect me to know jones said pull out a bloody pixie report form will you with luck we can get it done before we spot the bombers then we wont have to worry about it tomorrow right goldfarb sometimes thought that if the germans had managed to cross the channel and invade england the british could have penned them behind walls of paper and then buried them in more the pigeonholes under the console at which he sat held enough requisitions directives and reports to baffle the most subtle bureaucrat for years nor was the pixie report blurrily printed on coarse shoddy paper properly called by a name anywhere near so simple the raf had instead produced a document titled incident oapparent anomalous detјction of highspeed highaltitude target lest the form fall into german hands it fere mentioned that the anomalous detections apparent detections arb corrected himself took place by means of radar as if jerry doesnt know weve got it he thought he found a stub of pencil filled in the name of the station the date time and bearing and perceived velocity of the contact then stuck the form in a manila folder taped to the side of the radar screen the folder stuck there by the base co was labeled mxa reports with an attitude like that the co would never see promotion again jones grunted in satisfaction as if hed filled out the form himself he said off it goes to london tomorrow yes so they can compare it to others theyve got and work out alti tude and such from the figures goldfarb said they wouldnt bother with that if it were just in the circuits now would they dont ask me what theyll do in london jones said an attitude goldfarb also found sensible jones went on id be happier believing the pixies were real if anyone ever saw one anywhere but there he pointed at the radar screen so would i goldfarb admitted but look at the trouble weve had harry turtledove even with the ju the widespan reconnaissance bombers had been flying over southern england for months usually above feet so high that spitfires had enormous trouble climbing up to intercept them jerome jones remained unconvinced the junkers is just a jerry crate its got a good ceiling yes but its slow and easy to shoot down once we get to it its not like that superman bloke in the yank funny books faster than a speeding bullet i know i m just saying we cant see a plane that high up even if its there and if its going that fast even a spotter with binoculars doesnt have long to search before its gone what we need are binoculars slaved to the radar so one could know precisely where to look as he spoke goldfarb wondered if that was practical and how to go about setting it up if it was he got so lost in his own scheme that he didnt really notice the blip on the radar screen for a moment then jones said pixies again sure enough the radar was reporting more of the mysterious targets joness voice changed theyre acting peculiar too right they are goldfarb stared at the screen mentally translating its picture into aircraft he wondered if ones who thought of pixies as something peculiar going on inside the radar set did the samel theyre showing up as slower than they ever did before and there are more of them jones said lots more he turned to goldfarb no one looked healthy by the green glow of the cathoderay tube but now he seemed especially pale the line of his david niven mustache was the sole color in his thin sharpfeatured face david i think they must be real goldfarb recognized what was in his voice it was fear ilunger crackled like fire in moishe russies belly hed thought lean times and high holy days fasts had taught him what hunger meant but theyd no more prepared him for the warsaw ghetto than a picture of a lake taught a man to swim long black coat flapping about him like a moving piece of the night he scurried from one patch of deep shadow to the next it was long past curfew which had begun at nine if a german saw him he would live only so long as he still amused his tormentor fear dilated his nostrils at every breath made him suck in great draughts of the fetid ghetto air but hunger drove harder than fear and after all he could become the object of a germans sport at any hour of the day or night for any reason or none only four days before the nazis had fallen on the jews who came to the leszno street courthouse to pay their taxes taxes the nazis themselves imposed they robbed the jews not only of what they claimed was i h but also of anything else they happened to have on their persons the robbery came blows and kicks as if to remind the jews in whose clawed grip they lay not that i needed reminding russie whispered aloud he was a native of wolynska street and had been in the ghetto since warsaw surrendered to the germans not many had lasted through two and a half years of hell he wondered how much longer he would last hed been a medical student before september he could diagnose his own symptoms easily enough loose teeth and tender gums warned of the onset of scurvy poor night vision meant vitamin a deficiency the diarrhea could have had a dozen fathers and starvation needed no doctor to give it a name the hundreds of thousands of jews packed into four square kilometers had all too intimate an acquaintance with it the one advantage of being so thin was that his coat went round him nearly twice hed liked it better when it was a proper fit his furtive movements became even more cautious as he drew near harry turtledove the wall the red bricks went up twice as high as a man with barbed wire strung above them to keep the boldest adventurer from climbing over however much he wanted to russie did not aim to try that instead he whirled the sack he carried around and around like an olympic hammerthrower then flung it toward the polish side of the wall the sack flew up and over heart pounding russie listened to it land he had padded the silver candlestick with rags so it hit with a soft dull thump instead of a clatter he strained to catch the sound of footfalls on the other side he was at the poles mercy now if the fellow simply wanted to steal the candlestick he could if he had hope of more hed keep the bargain theyd made in leszno street waiting stretched like the lengths of wire on the wall and had as many spikes try as he would russie could hear nothing from the other side maybe the germans had arrested the pole then the precious candlestick would lie abandoned till some passerby came upon it and russie would have squandered one of his last remaining resources for nothing a soft plop on the cobblestones not far away russie sprinted over the rags that bound up the tattered remnants of his shoes made hardly a sound he held his hat on with one hand as he grew thinner even his head seemed to have shrunk he snatched up the bag dashed back toward darkness even as he ran the rich intoxicating odor of meat flooded his senses made his mouth gush with saliva he fumbled at the drawstring reached inside his spidery fingers closed round the chunk gauged its size and weight not the half a kilo hed been promised but not far from it hed expected the pole to cheat worse what recourse did a jew have perhaps he could complain to the ss sick and starving though he was the thought raised black laughter in him he drew out his hand licked the salt and fat that clung to it water filled his eyes as well as his mouth his wife rivka and their son reuven might live a little longer too late for their little sarah too late for his wifes parents and his own father but the three of them might go on he smacked his lips part of the sweetness on his tongue came from the meats being spoiled the rest because it was pork the rabbis in the ghetto had long since relaxed the prohibitions against forbidden food but russie still felt guilty every time it passed his lips some jews chose to starve sooner than break the law had he been alone in the ghetto russie might have followed that way but while he had others to care for he would live if he could hed talk it over with god when he got the chance how best to use the meat he wondered soup was the only answer it would last for several days that way and make rotten potatoes and moldy cabbage tolerable only a tiny part of him remembered the dim dead worldwar in the balance days before the war when he would have turned aside in scorn from rotten potatoes and moldy cabbage instead of wolfing them down and wishing for more he reached into a coat pocket now his spitwet fist closed on a wad of zlotys enough to bribe a jewish policeman if he had to the banknotes were good for little else mere money was rarely enough to buy food not in the ghetto i have to get back he reminded himself under his breath if he was not at his sewing machine in the factory fifteen minutes after curfew lifted some other scrawny jew would praise god for having the chance to take his place and if he was there but too worn to meet his quota of german uniform trousers he would not keep his sewing machine long his narrow clever hands were made for taking a pulse or removing an appendix but their agility with bobbin and cloth was what kept him and part of his family alive he wondered how long he would be allowed to maintain even the hellish life he led he did not so much fear the random murder that stalked the ghetto on german jackboots but just that day whispers had slithered from bench to bench at the factory the lublin ghetto they said had ceased to be thousands of jews taken away and everyone filled in his own and according to his nightmares russies and was something like a meatpacking plant with people going through instead of cattle he prayed that he was wrong that god would never allow such an abomination but too many prayers had fallen on deaf ears too many jews lay dead on sidewalks until at last like cordwood they were piled up and hauled away lord of abraham isaac and jacob he murmured softly i beg you me a sign that you have not forsaken your chosen people like tens of thousands of his fellow sufferers he sent up that prayer at all hours of the day and night sent it up because it was the only thing he could do to affect his horrid fate i beg you lord he murmured again give me a sign all at once noon came to the warsaw ghetto in the middle of the night moishe russie stared in disbelieving wonder at the sunhot point of light blazing in the stillblack sky parachute flare he thought remembering the german bombardment of his city but it was no flare whatever it was it was bigger and brighter than any flare by itself lighting the whole of the ghetto maybe the whole of warsaw or the whole of polandbright as day it hung unmoving in the sky as no flare could slowly slowly slowly the point of light became a smudge began to fade from eyesearing actinic violet to white and yellow and orange the brilliance of noon gave way little by little to sunset and then to twilight the two or three startled birds that burst into song fell silent again as if embarrassed at being fooled harry turtledove their sweet notes were in any case all but drowned by the cries from the ghetto and beyond cries of wonder and fear russie heard german voices with fear in them he had not heard german voices with fear in them since the nazis forced the jews into the ghetto he had not imagined he could hear such voices somehow that made them all the sweeter tears poured from his dazzled eyes ran down his dirty hollow cheeks into the curls of his beard he sagged against a torn poster that said piwo he wondered how long it had been since beer came into the ghetto but none of that mattered not in any real sense of the word he had asked god for a sign and god gave him one he did not know how he could pay god back but he promised to spend the rest of his life finding out fleetlord atvar stood before the holographic projection of tosev as he watched points of light blinked into being here and there above the worlds ridiculously small landmasses he wondered if once tosev came under the dominion of the race manipulation of plate tectonics might bring up more usable territory that was a question for the future though for five hundred years hence or five thousand or twentyfive thousand eventually when everything was decided and planned down to the last detail the race would act that way had served it well for centuries piled on centuries atvar was uneasily aware he lacked the luxury of time hed expected to enjoy it but the tosevites having somehow developed with indecent haste the rudiments of an industrial civilization posed a greater challenge to his forces than he or anyone else back home had anticipated if he failed to meet the challenge only his failure would be remembered accordingly it was with some concern that he turned to shiplord kirel and said these devices were properly placed it is so fleetlord kirel replied all placing vessels report success and have returned safely to the fleet instruments confirm proper targeting of the thermonuclear devices and their simultaneous ignition above the principal radio communications centers of tosev excellent atvar knew the tosevites had no way to reach even a fraction of the altitude of the placing vessels nevertheless actually hearing that matters had proceeded as designed was always a relief their systems should be thoroughly scrambled then as the exalted fleetlord says kirel agreed better still many parts of those systems should be permanently destroyed unshielded transistors and microprocessors are extremely vulnerable to electromagnetic pulse and since the tosevites have no nuclearpower of their own they will never have seen the necessity for shielding excellent atvar repeated our own shielded aircraft meanwhile should have rare sport against them while they writhe like roadscuttlers worldwar in the balance with fractured vertebrae we should have no problem clearing areas for landing and once our troops are on the ground conquest becomes inevitable saying the words brought fresh confidence to the commander nothing reassured the race more than a plan that was going well kirel said may it please the exalted fleetlord as we land shall we broadcast demands for surrender to be picked up by whatever receivers remain intact down below that was not part of the plan as formulated of course the plan as formulated went back in its essentials to the days when no one thought the tosevites had any technology worth mentioning nevertheless atvar felt an almost instinctive reluctance to deviate from it he said no let them come to us they will surrender soon enough when they feel the weight of our metal it shall be done as the fleetlord wishes kirel said formally atvar knew the shiplord had ambition of his own and that kirel would make careful note of any and all mistakes and failures especially those he had argued against let kirel do as he would atvar felt sure this was no mistake flight leader teerts stared in disbelieving wonder at the headup display reflected against the inside of his windshield never in training had he imagined sorties in such a targetrich environment the great herd of tosevite aircraft crawled along below and ahead of him blissfully unaware he was so much as in their solar system the voice of one of the other two pilots in the flight rang in the audio button taped to his hearing diaphragm pity we have no more killers to gn to this area theyd enjoy themselves before he answered teerts checked the radio frequency as ordered it wasnt one the tosevites used relaxing he answered were taking on an entire world rolvar we dont have enough killers to knock down all the native junk at once well just have to do the best we can with what we have that best gave every sign of being spectacular all six of his missiles had already selected targets from the herd he ripplefired them one after another his killercraft bucked slightly under him as the missiles dropped away their motors kicked in and spat orange flame they sprinted downward toward the ungainly tosevite flying machines even had the locals known they were under attack they could have done little not when his missiles had ten times the speed of their aircraft the headup display showed his salvo and those of his wingmates streaking home then suddenly teerts needed no headup display to gauge what was happening gouts of fire suddenly filled the darkness below as aircraft tumbled out of the sky harry turtledove rolvar yowled in teerts audio button look at them fall every shot a clean hit killercraft pilots were chosen for aggressiveness teerts had won flightleader paint because he also kept track of details after a glance at the display he said i show only seventeen kills either a missile was defective or two went after the same target who cares said gefron the other member of the flight gefron would not make flight leader if he lived to be a thousand even counting by doublelength tosevite years he was a good pilot though he went on we still have our cannon lets use them right teerts led the flight down into gun range the natives still didnt know what had happened to them but they knew something horrible had like a flock of frenni beset by wild botor they were scattering doing their feeble best to get out of harms way teerts jaws opened in mirth their best would not suffice his engines changed pitch as they breathed thicker air servos squealed adjusting the sweep of his wings his speed dropped to little more than that of sound a target filled his windshield he stabbed the firing button with the thumbclaw of his stick hand the nose of his plane disappeared for a moment in the glare of the muzzle blast when his vision cleared the tosevite aircraft one wing sheared away was already spinning out of control toward the ground hed never been among so many aircraft in his life he bled off still more speed to avoid collision another target another burst another kill a few moments later another and another off to one side he saw brief spurts of flame he turned one eye that way a tosevite aircraft was shooting back at him he abstractly admired the natives courage once pacified they would serve the race well they werent even bad pilots given the limitations of the lumbering aircraft they flew they were maneuvering with everything they had trying to break contact and escape but that was his choice not theirs he shot out the front of the aircraft pack began to circle back toward it for another run as he did so a flash on the headup display made him slew both eyes toward it somewhere out there in the night a native aircraft with better performance than those of the herd was turning in his direction and away from it an escorting killercraft an enemy who thought him a better target teerts neither knew nor cared whoever the native was hed pay for his presumption teerts cannon was radarcontrolled he fired a burst flames sprang from the tosevite killercraft at the same moment it shot back at him the shells fell short the native all afire now plunged out of the sky teerts raked the stampeding herd of aircraft twice more before his am worldwar in the balance munition ran low rolvar and gefron had also done all the damage they could they streaked for low orbital pickup soon enough the race would have landing strips on the ground then the slaughter of tosevite aircraft would be great indeed easy as a female in the middle of her season gefron exulted theyre brave enough though rolvar said a couple of their killercraft came right for me i might even have a hole or two im not so sure i got both of them either theyre so little and slow theyre a lot more maneuverable than i am i know i got mine teerts said well snatch some sleep and then come down and do it again his flightmates hissed approval one second the lancaster below and to the right of george bagnalls was flying along serenely as you please the next it exploded in midair for a moment bagnall saw men and pieces of machine hang suspended as if on strings from heaven then they were gone jesus he said fervently i think the whole ruddy worlds gone mad first that great light in the sky lit us up like a milliard star shells all at once didnt it ken embry agreed i wonder how the devil jerry managed that if it had stayed lit much longer every bloody nazi fighter in the world would have been able to spy us up here another lanc blew up not far away what was that bagnall demanded anybody see a jerry plane none of the gunners answered neither did the bombaimer embry spoke to the radioman any better luck there ted not a bit of it edward lane answered ever since that light im ng nothing but hash on every frequency bloody ballsup thats what it is embry said as if to italicize his words two more bombers went up in flames his voice rose to near a scream whats doing that its not flak and its not planes so what the hell is it next to the pilot bagnall shivered in his seat flying missions over germany was frightening enough in and of itself but when lancs started getting blown out of the sky for no reason at all his heart shrank to a small frozen lump in his chest his head turned this way and that trying to see what the devil was murdering his friends beyond the polished perspex the night remained inscrutable then the big heavy lancaster shook in the air for an instant like a leaf on a rippling stream even through the growl of the planes four merlins he heard a shrieking roar that made every hair on his body try to stand erect a lean sharkshape swept past impossibly swift impossibly graceful two huge exhausts glared like the red eyes of a beast of prey one harry turtledove gunner had enough presence of mind to fire at it but it vanished ahead of the lanc in the blink of an eye did you see that ken embry asked in a tiny voice i think so bagnall answered as cautiously he wasnt quite sure he believed in the terrible apparition himself where did the germans come up with it cant be german the pilot said we know what they have same as they know about us my dad in a spitfire above the somme is likelier than a jerry in that well if hes not a german who the devil is he bagnall asked damned if i know and i dont care to hang about and learn in case he decides to come back embry banked away from the track of the impossible fighter ground flak bagnall said as he watched the altimeter unwind embry ignored him he shut up feeling foolish when set against this monster that swept bombers from the sky like a charwoman wielding her broom against spilled salt ground flak was hardly worth worrying about jens larssens thumb throbbed fiercely the nail was already turning black he suspected hed lose it he scowled as darkly as his fair sunny features allowed he was a physicist damn it not a carpenter what hurt worse than his maimed digit was the snickers from the young punks who made up most of the work crew that was building strange things in the west stands of stagg field the evening sun at his back he tramped along fiftyseventh street toward the quadrangle club his appetite wasnt what it had been before hed tried driving his thumbnail into a twoby four but food and coffee kept him going in place of sleep as soon as hed gulped his meal hed be back at the pile again hammering away this time with luck a little more carefully he sucked in a lungful of muggy chicago air having been born and raised in san francisco he wondered why three million people chose to live in a place that was too hot and sticky half the time and too damned cold most of the rest they have to be crazy he said aloud a student going the other way gave him an odd look he felt himself flush dressed as he was in a dirty undershirt and a pair of chinos he didnt look like anyone who belonged on the university of chicago campus let alone a faculty member hed draw more looks in the quadrangle club too bad for the latin professors in their motheaten harris tweeds he thought he walked past cobb gate the grotesques carved on the big stone pile that was the northern entrance to hull court always made him smile bob worldwar in the balance any pond surrounded on three sides by the hull biological laboratories was a nice place to sit and read when he had the time lately he hadnt had the time very often he was coming up to mitchell tower when his shadow disappeared one second it stretched out ahead of him all fine and proper the next it was gone the tower modeled after that of magdalen college at oxford was suddenly bathed in harsh white light larssen stared up into the sky the glowing spot there grew and faded and changed color as he watched everyone around was pointing at it and exclaiming whats that what could it be have you ever seen anything like that in all your life people stuck their heads out of windows and came running outside to see the physicist watched and gaped with everyone else little by little the new light dimmed and his old familiar shadow reasserted itself before it had fully recovered larssen wheeled and began running back the way he had come he dodged past dozens of people who were still just standing and gawking wheres the fire buddy one of them yelled he didnt answer he just ran harder toward stagg field the fire was in the sky he knew what sort of fire it had to be too the fire he and his colleagues were seeking to call forth from the uranium atom so far no atomic pile in the united states had even managed a selfsustaining chain reaction the crew in the west stands was trying to put together one that would no one in his most horrid nightmares imagined the germans had already devised not just a pile but a bomb even if the uranium atom had first been split in germany in as he ran larssen wondered how the nazis had exploded a bomb over chicago so far as he knew their planes if dnt reach even new york or that matter he wondered why the germans had set off their bomb so high overhead too high really for it to do any damage maybe he thought they had it aboard some oceanbestriding rocket like the ones the pulp magazines talked about but no one had dreamed the germans could do that either nothing about the bomb made any rational sense the dreadful thing was up there though and had to be german it surely wasnt american or english larssen had an even more horrid thought what if it was japanese he didnt think the laps had the knowhow to build an atomic bomb but he hadnt thought they had the knowhow to bomb pearl harbor so devastatingly well or to take the philippines or guam or wake or hong kong and singapore and burma from the british or practically drive the royal navy out of the indian ocean or the further he went the longer the melancholy list in his head grew maybe it is the goddamn japs he said and ran harder than ever harry turtledove sam yeager had the curtain closed over the train window by his seat to keep the westering sun out of bobby fiores eyes while his roommate slept in his younger days he would have resented that having grown up without traveling more than a couple of days ride from his folks farm he was wild to see as much of the country as he could when he started playing ball train and bus windows were his openings on a wider world ive seen the country all right he muttered hed rolled through just about every piece of it with swings into canada and mexico to boot rubbernecking for one more swing through the staid flatlands of illinois no longer meant as much as it once had he remembered the sun rising over the arid mountains near salt lake city shining off the lake and the white salt flats straight into his dazzled eyes now that had been scenery worth looking at hed carry the picture to his grave with him fields and barns and ponds just couldnt compete though he wouldnt have lived in salt lake city for joe dimaggios salary well maybe for dimaggios salary he thought a lot of the commodores had headed off to the dining car across the aisle joe sullivan was staring out the window with the same avidity yeager had known in his early days the pitchers lips moved as he softly read a burma shave sign to himself that made yeager smile sullivan needed to lather up maybe twice a week suddenly bright light streamed in through the windows on the pitchers side of the car he craned his neck funny thing in the sky he reported looks like a fourth of july firework but its an awful damn bright one mutt daniels was sitting on that side of the train too awful damn bright one is right the manager said never seen one like that in all my born days it just keeps hangin up there dont seem to move atall kind of pretty matter of fact the light went from white to yellow to orange to red fading little by little over several minutes yeager thought about getting up and having a look at where it was coming from he might have done it if sullivan hadnt compared it to something youd see on the fourth of july ever since the fourth when he broke his ankle hed had no use for fireworks he stuck his nose back into his astounding the rising sun snuck under heinrich jagers eyelids pried his eyes open he groaned shook a few of the cobwebs out of his head got slowly to his feet moving as if every joint in his body were rusty he got in line for breakfast more kasha stew his nose told him he shrugged it would keep him full no more lights in the sky he asked ernst riecke who looked as tired as he felt worldwarin the balance no sir the captain answered i dont know if i should have bothered you but you did the right thing jager said mentally adding even if it did cost me another hour in my blanket i dont know what the devil that was it looked like one of our recognition flares but it was a million times as big and bright and it didnt fall either it stayed in one place till it went out i wonder what it was one of ivans tricks maybe riecke suggested maybe but jager didnt believe it if it was though he should have followed it up no bombers no artillery if the russians were trying something it didnt work like the rest of the tankmen jager gulped down his stew when everyone was fed he reluctantly sent the field kitchen on its way he hated to part with it but it wouldnt be able to keep up with the tanks one after another the panzer iiis rumbled into life the whole company let out a cheer when the motor of the twelfth tank caught jager shouted as loud as anybody he didnt think theyd be facing enemy armor today but you never could tell in russia and if not today then one day before too long he clambered up into the turret of the tank he personally commanded radioed division headquarters to see if orders had changed since yesterday no we still want you to shift to map square b the signal lieutenant answered how do you read my transmission by the way well enough jager said why we had some trouble earlier the signalman answered after that explosion in the sky reception went into the toilet for a while glad it i trouble you me o out to jager said he unfolded his map studied it if he was where he thought he was he and his panzers needed to make about twenty kilometers to get to where they were supposed to be he leaned down into the crew compartment of the tank called to the driver lets go east east it is dieter schmidt put the panzer iii into gear the roar of the maybach hltr engine changed pitch the tank began to roll ahead chewing two lines through the grass and dirt of the steppe the engine went up the scale and down up and down as schmidt worked his way through the six forward speeds of the gearbox the dustbin cupola at the back of the turret gave a decent view even when closed down like any tank commander worth his black coveralls jager left it open and stood up in it whenever he could not only could he see more than even through good periscopes the air was fresher and cooler and the racket less or at least different he traded being surrounded by engine rumble for the iron clash and rattle of the spare wheels and tracks lashed to the tanks rear deck harry turtledove he frowned a little if the german logistics train were better run he wouldnt have had to carry his own spares to make sure they were there when he needed them but the eastern front ran more than three thousand kilometers from the baltic to the black sea expecting the high foreheads who were out of harms way to care what happened to any one tank commander was too much to hope for the panzers rolled through the detritus of battle past graves hastily dug in the rich dark soil of the ukraine past stinking bloated russian corpses still unburied past wrecked trucks and tanks of both the wehrmacht and the red army german engineers swarmed over those like flies over the corpses salvaging whatever they could the gently rolling country stretched in all directions as far as the eye could see not even wars wounds scarred it too severely sometimes when jager looked out across that sea of green his dozen tanks seemed all alone he grinned when off in the distance he spied a german infantry company once or twice planes buzzed by overhead that made him grin more widely somewhere east of izyum ivan was going to catch hell a noise like the end of the world the panzer a couple of hundred meters to his right went up in a fireball one second it was there the next nothing but red and yellow flame and a column of black greasy smoke mounting to the sky a moment later came the barks of secondary explosions as the tanks ammunition began going off the fiveman crew couldnt have known what hit them jager told himself that anyhow as he dove down inside the turret what the fuck was that asked georg schultz the gunner had heard the blast through thick steel and through the racket of his own tanks motor joachims tank just went up jager answered must have hit a minebut the ivans arent supposed to have laid any mines around here his voice showed his doubt the explosion had been very violent for a mine maybe if the blast went up into the gas tank the captain thought no sooner had the idea crossed his mind then another panzer went up with an even louder detonation than the first jesus schultz shouted he stared fearfully at the metal floor of the tank as if wondering when a whitehot jet of flame would burst through it jager grabbed for the radio that linked him with the rest of the company hit the allhands frequency all halt he bawled were hitting mines he shouted the order forward to dieter schmidt then stood up in the cupola to make sure it was being obeyed the ten surviving tanks of the company did stop the rest of the commanders bounced up just like jager each of them trying to see what was going on but for two blazing hulks nothing seemed out of the ordinary worldwar in the balance jager was about to call divisional headquarters to ask for a sapper detachment when a lance of fire tore across the sky and blew the turret clean off one of the stopped panzers the oily chassis promptly began to burn cursing his own mistake jager let himself fall back into the turret he grabbed the radio screamed get moving theyre rockets from the air not mines the ivans must have found some way to mount katyushas on their groundattack planes if we stay where we are were sitting ducks he didnt need to relay the order to schmidt this time his panzer iii was already lurching ahead the engine roaring flat out only as the captain went up into the cupola again did he consciously realize the trail of fire in the sky had come from the west from behind him turn the turret around he yelled and cursed the hydraulics as the heavy dome of metal ever so slowly began to traverse a couple of the other commanders had been more alert their tanks turrets were already slewing to the rear jager turned that way himself as he did so a fourth panzer was hit in the engine compartment flames began to spurt turret doors flew open men started bailing out one two three commander gunner loader fire washed over the whole tank the driver and hull gunner never had a chance the company commander frantically scanned the sky where was the stormovik the armored russian attack plane that was likeliest to be carrying katyusha rockets his heart leapt when he spotted a flying shape the coaxial mm machine guns of the companys fasterreacting panzers spat flame at it they werent likely to hurt it but might keep the pilot from making a low firing run hey didnt here he came jager got ready to throw himself behind turrets armor the instant the stormoviks guns started shooting back tten as the plane drew swiftly nearer he noticed it wasnt a stormovik and when it fired its whole blunt nose went yellowwhite with the muzzle blast dust fountained around two more panzers both of them stopped dead smoke poured from them along with the reek of flaming gas and oil and cordite jagers nose caught the roastpork stink of burning human flesh the airplane passed overhead almost close enough to touch in spite of everything jager stared at it in disbelief it was almost the size of a medium bomber and had no propeller he could see it bore neither the german cross and swastika nor the soviet star in fact it bore no device at all on its camouflaged wings and body and it did not roar like every other airplane he had ever known it shrieked as if its motive power came from damned souls then it was gone vanishing into the east more swiftly than any fighter jager knew he gaped after it mouth fallen open in most harry turtledove unofficerlike fashion one pass and half his company was flaming wreckage like his own ernst rieckes panzer had survived the onslaught it came rattling over riecke was standing up in his cupola the captains face bore the same expression of stunned disbelief jager knew his own did what riecke had to try twice before he could get the words out what the devil was that i dont know jager found an even worse question what if it comes back the japanese were looting the village theyd already shot a couple of people for protesting when their possessions were hauled away the bodies lay as mute warnings in the square beside the ruined wall of the yamen as if they did not suffice the invading soldiers swaggered around with fixed bayonets ready to spit anyone who gave them so much as a hard look liu han had done her best to make herself invisible to the japanese she knew how they recruited their pleasure battalions ashes grayed her hair charcoal added not just filth but also lines to her face giving her the look of a much older woman grief made it easy for her to assume the stooped posture of the elderly she wandered aimlessly around the edges of the village in part to keep away from the soldiers in part because with home and family gone she had nothing better to do because she kept away from the noisy chaos that engulfed invaders and townsfolk alike she might have been the first to hear the thuttering in the air her head came up in fright more bombers on the way but surely not not when the village already lay under the japanese boot or could they be chinese planes if the kuomintang government wanted to hold hankow it would need to fight back with everything it had and the noise was growing from the south fear and excitement warred within liu han she wanted the japanese dead but did she wish to die with them in spite of her anguish she decided she wanted to live stoop forgotten she ran for the woods the farther from the village when bombs began to fall the better the drone of approaching aircraft swelled in her ears she threw herself down in a tangle of bushes and ferns by then the planes were almost overhead she stared up at them through tree branches despite anguish and terror her eyes went wide the planes she was used to had graceful birdlike bodies these flying things looked more like dragonflies they were angular awkwardseeming with landing gear projecting from their bodies tike insect legs and they had no wings if anything save magic kept them in the air it was the whirling disk above each of them they hovered in midair like dragonflies too liu han had never heard worldwar in the balance of an airplane that could do such a thing but then all she knew of airplanes was the death and devastation they brought there these dragonfly planes proved no exception as they hung in the sky they fired machine guns and rockets into liu hans poor bleeding village screams pierced the rattle of gunfire and the crash of explosions so did the deep harsh cries of the japanese soldiers liu shuddered to hear them they reminded her of the baying of wolves seeing the invaders lashed with such pitiless fire almost made her forget the ruination of her village then a machine gun began to chatter inside the ruins of the yamen the japanese were doing their best to fight back tracer bullets drew fiery lines up toward the dragonfly planes two rockets snarled groundward a roar a flash of light and the machine gun fell silent forgetting she was supposed to be in hiding liu han let out a delighted screech with chaos all around who was likely to hear one more screech a couple of dragonfly planes settled toward the ground floating through the air as light as windborne snow doors opened in their sides as they touched down liu han saw motion inside them holding her breath she waited for soldiers to leap out and finish slaughtering the japanese could they really be men of the kuomintang liu han hadnt imagined that her country boasted such marvelous airplanes maybe they came from america the americans were supposed to be the most clever of all the foreign devils when it came to machines and they were fighting the japanese too liu han had seen an american once a big fat christian missionary who spoke bad chinese hed sounded very fierce she remembered she imagined big fierce american soldiers springing out of the dragonfly planes each with a sparkling bayonet half as long as he was tall she hd herself with glee at the delicious thought ielmeted soldiers began springing out of the dragonfly plane they were not big fierce americans they were not chinese troops either liu hans glee turned to horror in the space of a single breath the chinese commonly called foreigners devils just a moment before liu han had been thinking about american devils but here were devils in truth they were shorter than people and skinnier their greenbrown hides glistened in the afternoon sun like snakeskin they had no noses instead the bottom parts of their faces were pulled out in short muzzles liu han thought first of cats then of lizards the devils had tails too short blunt ones that hung a third of the way down to their knees liu han rubbed her eyes hard but when she opened them again the devils were still there she moaned deep in her throat the devils did not move like people either liu han thought of lizards again the devils motion had something of that same loosejoined skitter to it and when they were still they were absolutely still in a way no human save a meditating monk could match they did not act like monks they had things that looked like guns in harry turtledove their hands the things were guns they started firing into the village and what guns instead of the bang bang bang of ordinary rifles the devils weapons spat streams of bullets like machine guns despite their barrage despite the rockets and gunfire from the dragonfly planes japanese soldiers in the village kept shooting the devils on the ground advanced against the invaders some rushing forward while others covered them had she been attacked by such monsters liu han knew she would have either given up at once or fled the japanese did neither they fought on until they were all killed it did not take long by the time the little battle ended the whole village was on fire peering through a screen of brush liu han saw the townsfolk those who still lived scattering in all directions save toward her the dragonfly planes on the ground were a potent argument against running that way after a few minutes a couple of villagers did come toward the dragonfly planes chiwied along by the devils with guns one of those devils lay on the grass just outside the houses the blood that splashed its scaly hide was red as a mans liu han rubbed her eyes again she hadnt thought devils could bleed some of the hovering dragonfly planes flew off to the north before long they began firing again good liu han thought theyre killing more japanese with resistance in the village and the village itself destroyed the little scaly devils on the ground began prowling about as if to make sure no more enemies lurked nearby when one came in her direction liu hah frantically tried to bury herself under leaves and branches if the amida buddha was kind the devil would not see her the compassionate buddha must have been looking somewhere else the scaly devil yelled something in whatever language devils used among themselves liu han shivered under her makeshift shelter but did not come out then the devils gun roared bullets snarled through the branches around her the devil yelled again she knew it could have killed her had it cared to so maybe it was ordering her to give up she stood up raised her hands above her head pplease dont shoot me master devil she quavered when the devil spoke once more she saw it had lots of small pointed teeth and a long forked tongue like a lizards one of its eyes kept looking at her the other unnervingly swiveled this way and that when liu han took a step toward the devil it sprang backward and raised its gun in clear warning she realized it barely came to her shoulder are you afraid of me she said the idea of a devils knowing fear was so absurd that she wanted to laugh in spite of all the disasters of this dreadful day the little scaly devil didnt act as if it was funny it gestured with the gun pointing back toward the dragonfly planes some other villagers were worldwar in the balance already being marched aboard them liu han knew she had no choice but to go in that direction as she walked past the devil it stepped back to make sure she didnt come within arms length if it wasnt afraid of her liu han couldnt figure out why it was so cautious before she climbed up the ramp into the dragonfly plane another devil tied her hands together in front of her it followed her inside then motioned her into a seat with its gun the seat was uncomfortable being both the wrong shape for her backside and too small she had to draw her knees up to her chin to fit her legs into a space that would have been fine for one of the little scaly devils in the seat beside her sat yi min who looked even more cramped than she felt the apothecary looked up dully as she joined him his face was bloody from a cut by one eye so they got you too did they he said yes liu han answered by village standards yi min was an educated man so she asked him what sort of devils are these ive never seen or heard of anything like them neither have i he said in fact i hardly believed in devils i thought they were superstitious rubbish they the little scaly devil with the gun said something it put one hand over its muzzle holding its toothy mouth closed then it pointed to liu han and yi min after it did that two or three times she figured out that it didnt want them to talk she set a hand over her own mouth the devil made a noise like a bubbling pot and sat down liu han decided shed satisfied it the dragonfly planes engine began to roar the blades that sprouted from the top of it started spinning first slowly then faster and faster until tlooked like one of the flickering disks shed noticed above the dragd planes when she was still out in the woods without warning the machine climbed into the air liu hans stomach lurched she let out a frightened involuntary squeak the little scaly devil swung both its turreted eyes toward her sorry master devil she said it kept on glaring she realized shed made a new mistake clapped a hand to her mouth to try to set it right the devil made that boiling noise again let its eyes wander away had she room she would have sagged with relief she looked out the little window by yi min through it she could see frighteningly far below the burning ruins of her village then the dragonfly plane spun in the air and flew off taking her away from everything she had ever known the train had just rolled south past dixon when everything went to hell sam yeager read the last letter in his astounding set the magazine down on the seat beside him bobby fiore had woken up and was back in harry turtledove the dining car yeager hoped hed finish soon he was getting sleepy himself but how could he doze off when his roommate was going to step over him or on him any time now stymied by a complete lack of facts the decatur commodores had given up arguing about what the light in the sky had been several of them were sleeping some with caps or hats over their eyes to keep out the overhead lights yeager yawned stretched thought about doing the same thing maybe hed be out by the time bobby got back hed just decided he would go to sleep when something roared past overhead so loud it woke up everyone who had been resting yeager leaned over and jammed his face against the window wondering if hed see an airplane go down in flames that roar sounded as if it had come from just above the train and hed never heard a healthy engine sound anything like it sure enough a moment later a tremendous bang came from in front of the train and then another one even leuder jesus yeager said softly on the other side of the aisle joe sullivan crossed himself while yeagers head was still ringing from the explosions the train hit the brakes for all they were worth he slammed into the seat in front of him iron screamed as wheels clenched track sparks shot up high enough for him to see them through the window the brakes were not worth enough the passenger car suddenly flipped onto its side yeager dropped like a stone landed on top of sullivan the pitcher yelled yeager yelled too as his head hit what had been the far wall of the car and was now abruptly the floor his teeth dug into his lip the hot metallic taste of blood filled his mouth he ran his tongue around in there luckily his dentures hadnt broken through the cries of his teammates and the other people in the car he listened to the rest of the train derailing the receding string of crashes and bumps made him think of an earthquake bought on the installment plan he tested each limb as he untangled himself from joe sullivan you all right kid he asked i dont know my shoulder sullivan clutched the injured part his eyes were wide with fear as well as pain it was his throwing arm i think maybe wed better get out of here if we can come on in the darkness yeager walked back toward the rear of the car across what had been window frames sullivan didnt follow yeager hardly noticed he was stepping as carefully as he could some of the windows were broken and he didnt want to slice his leg on jagged glass that you sam mutt daniels asked as he went by it took more than a derailment to make him sound anything but slow and relaxed yeah its me yeager listened to the moans and to one woman who worldwar in the balance kept letting out little screams every few seconds i think we got some hurt people here mutt reckon youre right the manager said how the hell we supposed to put a team together tomorrow when shit like this happens to us youre a baseball man mutt yeager said the crash had driven all thoughts of tomorrows game out of his head he decided not to tell daniels about joe sullivans shoulder poor mutt would find out soon enough the sliding door to the next car back had sprung off its track when the train went sideways it gaped open yeager pulled himself up into the doorway he sniffed the outside air didnt smell smoke he didnt see any fire either one thing to be thankful for anyway he thought especially when a man at the front of the car yelled somebody here hurt his neck bad dont move him three people said at once mutt daniels scrambled up beside yeager the manager had a tougher time of it being both shorter and rounder than his ballplayer he said wonder what the hell we hit if it was that plane thered be burning yeager cocked his head that screaming roar was still in the sky which meant the plane hadnt crashed after all but in that case where had the explosions come from the scream got louder as if the crazysounding airplane was coming back just when it made yeager want to scream too a new noise joined it a deep rapidly repeated bark the derailed train shook under yeager and daniels as shells slammed into it glass tinkled screams redoubled holy jesus god its the gerps shootin us up the manager shouted he hadnt known whether to say germans or japs and came out with both ace through the railing of the little platform between cars yeager watched the airplane whosever it was flash past overhead it went by so fast it was just an unidentifiable streak in the sky the roar of its engines beat at him faded then began to grow again its coming back he said with all the screaming and yelling up and down the length of the train that should have come out as a bellow instead it was hardly more than a whisper as if the louder he said it the more likely it was to be true he said it loud enough to convince mutt daniels the manager paused to stick his head back into the passenger car and yell yall better git out while ycan then he took his own advice and jumped off the train his shoes scraped on the graveled roadbed then clumped more quietly as he reached the soft dirt of the fields yeager hesitated a moment more but the rising shriek in the sky got him moving he leapt down landed heavily for an instant he thought he was going to take another fall on that ankle of his but he managed to catch his balance and stay upright young corn plants beat against his legs harry turtledove as he ran between the rows their sweet moist smell took him back to his boyhood mutt daniels tackled him lay on top of him in the dirt what the hell you doin mutt he demanded indignantly ii hes comin back for another pass you dont want to give him no movin target to shoot at daniels said learned that in france back in nineteen an eighteen hadnt thought about it in twentyodd years but the stink of blood and shit in that there car brought it right back up to the top o my mind oh so yeager wasnt the only one whod had an odor jog his memory his dredgedup piece of past seemed happier than mutts though the planes gun cut loose just then lashing the derailed train with another whip of fire yeager buried his face in the cool damp earth beside him daniels did the same thing the enemy airplane streaked away this time it did not sound as if it was coming back jesus mutt said cautiously getting up on hands and knees never thought id be under artillery fire again though thats just a squirrel gun if you set it alongside what the germans threw at us yeager gaped at his manager he hadnt imagined there could be anything worse than what hed just been through he tried to pull himself together weve got to get the people out of there mutt he said his legs wobbled under him when he stood up that made him angry hed never been shot at before and didnt understand what reaction could do reckon youre right daniels said good lords own miracle the whole trains not on fire he looked at his hands son of a bitch i got the shakes aint done that since nineteen an eighteen neither yeager looked at his hands too now they were steady enough but that wasnt what he noticed about them though night had come he could see them clearly the train might not have been set afire but the northern horizon was ablaze two big cement plants in dixon were going up in flames and most of the rest of the town seemed to be burning too the red flickering light showed yeager more people scrambling out of the derailed train and others standing in the cornfield like him and mutt he looked down toward the locomotive and saw at once why the train had overturned the engine and the coal car behind it had tumbled into a bomb crater mutt daniels head made that same slow incredulous traverse from north to south saw this sot of thing plenty of times in france my grandpappy talked about what it was like in the states war i never reckoned the us of a would get it like this though yeager hadnt started thinking about the whole united states yet the ruined train in front of him was disaster enough to fill his mind for the moment he started toward it repeating we got to help those people mutt worldwar in the balance daniels took a couple of steps with him then grabbed him by the sleeve and held him back i hear more planes comin mebbe we dont wanna get too close to a big target sure enough a new drone was in the air or rather several drones like a swarm of deepvoice bees they didnt sound like the screaming monster that had bombed the track and shot up the train maybe theyre ours yeager said hopefully mebbe the drones got louder daniels went on yall can do what you want sam but i aint gonna get out in the open till i see the stars painted on their sides you get shot at from the air oncet or twice you plumb lose the taste for it the manager squatted ducked under the corn yeager walked a little closer to the train more slowly with each stride he still wanted to rescue the people there but daniels caution made a solid kind of sense and the closer those droning engines got the less they sounded like the airplanes with which yeager was familiar he got down on his belly if he was wrong to take cover hed cost himself and the injured people on the train a minute or two but if he was right he rolled onto his side so he could look up through the cornstalks bent green leaves by the sound the approaching airplanes were hardly moving in fact by the sound they werent moving at all just hanging in midair but thats impossible yeager thought then he saw one of the aircraft lit up against the night by dixons burning cement factories the briefest glimpse told him it was no american plane it hardly looked like a plane at all more like a flying polliwog then yeager noticed the spinning disk above it his mind seized on the hovering gyros in heinleins if this goes on but what were those flying marvels from a story set far in the future doing in hereandnow illinois nmse oe found the answer a moment later when they opened fire the if the automatic guns sounded like a giant ripping endless sheets of canvas he didnt stick his head up to find out what had happened to the people standing in the cornfield he just thanked his lucky stars and mutt daniels that he hadnt been one of them staying as low as he could he crawled backwards through the plants he hoped their waving above him as he moved wouldnt give him away if it did he hoped the end would be quick and clean he kept backing up wondering all the while when hed bump into mutt surely hed retreated past where the manager had ducked down idiot he muttered under his breath if mutt had an ounce of sense and mutt had a lot more than an ouncehe was getting away from the derailed train too a couple of the gyros settled to earth one on either side of the train the one that landed on the eastern side happened to be directly in front of yeager his curiosity wrestled down his own good sense and he stuck out his head far enough to peer out between the rows of corn he had to know harry turtledove who was attacking the united states germans or japanese theyd regret it his vision path was so narrow that he needed most of a minute to get his first glimpse of an invader when he did he thought the soldier had to be a japhe was too little to be a german then yeager got a better look at the way the figure by the train moved the shape of its head he turned around and crawled through the corn as fast as he could go he wanted to get up and run but that would have drawn the invaders attention for certain he didnt dare do that not now he almost crawled right over mutt daniels who was still retreating slowly and carefully head toward the front watch it boy daniels hissed you want to get the both of us killed i saw them mutt yeager needed all the willpower he possessed to keep his voice low to keep from screaming as a matter of fact he made himself take a deep breath let it out slowly then he continued i saw who got down from those hoverplanes of theirs well who the manager demanded when yeager went no further was it the boches he pronounced it boash or the goddamn japs neither one yeager said got to be one or the other daniels said then he let out a wheezy laugh you aint gonna tell me its the eyetalians are you yeager shook his head he wished he hadnt left his astounding on the train remember that orson welles halloween radio show three four years ago the one about martians that scared the country half out of its shoes sure i remember didnt hear it myself mind but i sure heard about it later but whats that got to do with daniels broke off stared you expect me to believe mutt i swear to god its true the martians have landed for real this time one second bobby fiore was spooning up thin vegetable soup in the dining car of the train hed already spent some time thinking disparaging thoughts about it all right there was a war on so you really couldnt expect much in the way of meat or chicken but vegetable soup didnt have to be dishwater and limp celery give his mother some zucchini carrots maybe a potato or two and just a few spices mind you just a few and shed make you a soup worth eating now the cook here was cheap or lazy or both the next second everything went to pieces fiore heard the same roaring wail in the sky yeager had the same twin blasts then the train slammed on the brakes and then it went off the track fiore flew through the air the side of his head fetched up against the side of a table a silver light flared behind his eyes before everything spiraled down into darkness worldwar in the balance when he woke up he thought hed died and gone to hell he felt like it his head pounded like a drum in a swing band and his vision was blurry and distorted blurry or no the face he saw looked more like a devil than anything else he could think of it sure as hell whispered through his mind didnt belong to any human being hed ever set eyes on the thing had sharper teeth and more of them than a person had any business having and a forked tongue like a snakes to go with them it also had eyes that reminded him of those hed seen on a chameleon in the pittsburgh zoo when he was a kid each in its own little conical mounting with one quite capable of looking north while the other looked south remembering the chameleon was the first thing that made fiore wonder if he truly had ended up in satans country the devil or even a devil should have looked more supernatural and less like a lizard even an african lizard then he noticed he was still in the flipped dining car for that matter he had a butter knife lying on his stomach and a sesameseed roll by one shoe he was certain hell had to have worse pangs than a dining car no matter how bad the soup in this one was had been he corrected himself the well if it wasnt a devil it had to be a thing the thing then pointed what looked like a gun at the butter knife near fiores belly button if he wasnt in hell at the moment he realized he could get there in a hurry he smiled the smile a dog smiles after its lost a fight you want to be careful with that he said and hoped he was right the thing hissed something in reply fourteen years of playing ball all over the united states and with and against players with parents from all over europe and latin america left fiore able to recognize a double handff languages and swear in several of them this wasnt any he knew dything close the thing spoke again and jerked the barrel of the gun that fiore understood he staggered to his feet wondering as he did so whether his abused head would fall off the thing made no effort to help him while he swayed indeed it skittered back to make sure he couldnt reach it if you think im bluffing youre outta your mind he said it ignored him considering that it came up only to the middle of his chest and he needed shoes to make the fiveeight he always claimed maybe it had reason to be nervous of him although he doubted he could have squashed a slug if you gave it a running start at another motion of the gun barrel he started walking forward after three or four steps he came to the body of the colored steward the fellow had a hole in the back of his white mess jacket big enough to throw a cat through pieces of him poked through the hole fiores stomach did a flipflop the gun at his back concentrated his mind remarkably however gulping he walked on only a few people had been in the dining car when it derailed so far harry turtledove as fiore could tell he was the only person left alive he did not count his captor as qualifying the side of the car actually it served as the roof just now was pierced in a dozen places by bullet holes that let in the warm night air fiore shivered only dumb luck had kept him from stopping a round or more than one while he lay unconscious the thing made him scramble out of the dining car more creatures just like it waited outside for no good reason that startled the ballplayer he hadnt imagined there could be more than one of them he saw he wasnt the only person being hustled toward some peculiar gadgets that sat on the ground by the train not until another of them thundered past overhead did he realize they were flying machines they didnt look like any flying machines hed seen before one of the captured people tried to run fiore had also been thinking about that he was glad hed only thought about it when the things he still didnt know what else to call them shot the fleeing man in the back just as their flying machines didnt look like airplanes their guns didnt sound like rifles they sounded like machine guns hed heard machine guns once or twice at fairs after the first world war running away from somebody or even something carrying a machine gun wasnt smart so fiore let himself be herded onto the flying machine and into a toosmall seat a good many of the scaly things joined him but no people the machine took off his stomach gave a lurch different from the one hed felt when he stepp ed over the dead steward hed never been off the ground before the things chattered among themselves as they flew through the night fiore had no idea which way they were going he kept sneaking glances at his watch after about two hours the darkness outside the little window turned light not with daytime but with spots like the ones at a ballpark these spots didnt show bleachers though they showed fiore gaped for the right word spaceships rockets they had to be something like that sam yeager would know for sure he thought and suddenly felt ashamed at teasing his friend over that stupid sciencefiction magazine which turned out not to have been so stupid after all then he wondered if yeager was still alive if he was hed have found out about the martians too he kukuruzniks engine complained about the thin air it was breathing at four thousand meters it was way over its proper cruising altitude up near its ceiling as a matter of fact ludmila gorbunovas lungs complained too the little biplane was not equipped with oxygen and even sitting in the cockpit made her feel as if shed just finished a twentykilometer run she would have gone higher if she could though at such a height the u was hardly more than a speck in the sky but the lizards were proving even more skilled than the fascists at spotting such specks and knocking them down ludmila did not even try to fly directly over the new invaders base planes that did that quite simply never came back the base a giant ringworm on the smooth skin of the steppe was visible enough even at the greater distance an oblique view gave he counted the that formed the of the huge flying towers perimeter ba shook her head counted them again she still got twentyseven that was four more than shed spotted on her last flight the day before yesterday from four thousand meters most things on the ground looked tiny as ants the towers though still bulked large their shadows darkening great strips of grassland they were large too from them poured the impossibly deadly planes and tanks that were wresting great tracts of land not only from the russians who owned it but from the germans as well ludmila still did not know how to feel about that she hated the germans with all her soul but against them one could contend with hope of victory how could mere men fight the lizards and their marvels mere men kept trying even now if the radio was to be believed soviet tank columns were engaging the lizards armor and pushing it back in disarray ludmila wondered if anyone believed the radio any more the year before the radio had said the germans were being pushed back from minsk then from kiev then from smolensk harry turtledove such thoughts were dangerous ludmila knew that too the purges of the thirties had swept through kiev as they had everywhere else in the soviet union one day a teacher would be there the next day vanished you learned not to ask where hed gone not unless you wanted to join him there ludmila shook her head as if to drive the worries out of it she peered down at the ground again squinted to sharpen her vision as much as she could that plume of dust there in the distance she squinted harder yes those are tanks down at the bottom of it may the devils grandmother run away with them she said the kukuruznik had had a radio fitted when ludmila went from night harassment to reconnaissance she did not use it aircraft that used radio around the lizards generally did not last long afterward her information while she thought it important didnt seem worth dying for she banked away from the lizards base she wondered if her own base would still be there when she landed the new invaders like the old pounded every airstrip they could find but the socalled strip had been only a length of smooth steppe and she could find another such strip at need the u didnt need much room in which to set down even when she got to the airstrip she had to circle twice to be sure it was there camouflage nettings and sod roofs disguised the few buildings a couple of kilometers away stood a strip camouflaged not quite so well the lizards had already bombed it twice that was all right or better than all right the planes there were dummies the buildings repaired every night but uninhabited her teeth clicked together as the wheatcutter bounced to a halt ludmila scrambled down to the ground while the prop was still spinning the instant it stopped groundcrew men threw grasscovered nets over the biplane and hauled it away to hide under still more nets which concealed earthen blast barriers ludmila pulled up a corner of the command shacks camouflage net hurried through the doorless entrance let the net fall behind her with netting over all the windows the interior of the shack was gloomy i return comrade major she announced you do comrade pilot major yelena popova said returning her salute you are most skilled or most fortunate or both in the space of a sentence she went from mild greeting to pure business tell me at once what you saw ludmila obeyed major popova scowled when she mentioned the four new flying towers on the ground these creatures swarm onto the soil of the rodina the motherland like locusts yes comrade major and they consume all before them like locusts too ludmila described the column of tanks shed observed the squadron commanders frown never pleasant grew downright worldwar in the balance fearsome this is vital information those above us must learn of it at once i shall use the radio repeat your statement to me that i may be sure to report it accurately as ludmila obeyed major popova wrote down what she said then repeated it back when ludmila nodded to show it was right the major went over to the radio it and its battery were stowed in a wheelbarrow and covered with hay yelena took the wheelbarrow out through the door started in the direction of the dummy airstrip to anyone say a lizard in a plane she looked like a peasant shambling along ludmila watched her slow progress across the plain then the tiny shape that was she disappeared into one of the potemkin sheds she emerged a bare minute later moving much faster than she had on the way over seemingly out of nowhere a rocket slammed into the empty shed flames leapt up from it the deception team would have a lot of work to do tonight ludmila thought after the rocket hit major popova slowed down again ludmila did not blame her weighted down by radio and battery the wheelbarrow was heavy the lizards are very good at picking up radio signals the major said as she arrived at the real airstrip she wiped her forehead her sleeve came away dark with sweat but her eyes narrow and black like a tatars gleamed in triumph even though the breeze was chilly against his muzzle landcruiser driver ussmak preferred moving along unbuttoned when he could the periscopes didnt give him nearly the view he enjoyed with his head out jh es being cooped up in the drivers compartment reminded him too of the coldsleep coffin in which hed hibernated away the years be tween home and tosev he had an audio button taped to one hearing diaphragm better get down ussmak said votal the landcruiser commander airscouts report big ugly landcruisers ahead it shall be done ussmak said and slid back down into his compartment even as he dogged the hatch over his head he wondered why he was bothering the big uglies especially this set that used a red star as its emblem had lots of landcruisers but they werent very good ones or used very well but his commander had given the order so he obeyed that had been ingrained in him since his hatching day gunner telerep said what do you want to bet we dont even get in on the fun our air will probably take them out before theyre in range for us we may have some work votal said the farther away from base we move the thinner our air cover gets and his voice rose to a sudden shout big ugly airplane in his audio button ussmak heard the com harry turtledove mander dive down in the landcruisers turret a roar overhead a couple of shells bouncing off metal and ceramic armor and the natives craft sped away its belly almost scraping the grass two landcruisers in the formation fired missiles after it however fast it was they were faster it tumbled to the ground dust flew from the brown track it plowed through the green brave ussmak thought brave but stupid the tosevites seemed like that tosevite landcruisers telerep said looks like you were right commander i see them votal answered ussmak still didnt being down low in the hull rather than up in the turret that didnt matter votal told him what to do steer ussmak ussmak started turning from north to west yes there they were being big and clumsy themselves the tosevites built big and clumsy though these landcruisers didnt have a bad ballistic shape compared to some others the crews had been briefed about at least their turret armor sloped not that that would help them now gunner votal said loudly hed picked a target then one from among the several that sought to bar his path a moment later he added sabot sabot telerep repeated the automatic loader cranked a round into the breech of the cannon ussmak heard it not only in his audio button but also through his whole body clangclang another metallic noise announced that the breech had closed telerep said up and ready landcruiser front that meant votal had the target tosevite in his sights identified telerep saw it too over ussmaks head the gun tube swung slightly as it moved toward the enemys center of mass fire through his periscopes ussmak saw flame leap from the muzzle of the gun armor shielded him from the roar of the report recoil made the landcruiser seem to hesitate for an instant the aluminum sabots fell away from the tungsten penetrator arrow ussmak did not see that of course a heartbeat later he did see the turret leap off a tosevite landcruiser hit he yelled along with votal and telerep another tosevite was killed this one in a pyrotechnic display of exploding ammunition the big uglies lost whatever formation they were trying to keep some of them stopped as they had to if they hoped to fire accurately their eggs are broken now ussmak thought with cold glee they were easy enough to kill on the move stopped landcruiser front votal said identified telerep answered as the automatic loader clattered into action a tosevite landcruiser spat fire ussmaks jaw opened in a laugh another one down he thought worldwar in the balance and wondered which of the other landcruisers in his unit had scored the kill then wham something smote the glacis plate like a kick in the teeth ussmak votal said you all right yyes the driver answered still more than a little shaken didnt penetrate the emperor be praised or id be splashed all over the inside of the compartment he added to himself the big uglies were doing their best to fight back their best fortunately for ussmak was not good enough he must have been too stunned to listen to the whole command sequence for the big gun fired then he had the satisfaction of watching the landcruiser that had almost killed him start to burn he wondered if any of the crew got out in a way they were guildsmates of his and so deserving of respect on the other hand they were only big uglies and knew not the emperors name when most of the tosevite landcruisers were dead some of the survivors turned tailstump and started to run ussmak laughed again they couldnt outrun cannon shells a funny noise in his audio button sort of a wet splat then a cry of disbelief and rage from telerep votal vo theyve killed the commander ussmaks belly went strange and empty as if hed suddenly been dropped into freefall how could they he demanded of the gunner were slaughtering their landcruisers theyre hardly fighting back any more sniper or i miss my guess telerep said they cant meet us in honest battle so they lie in wait instead hewell make them ussmak said fiercely the emperors pay past learned votals name he is with them now of course he is the gunner answered now shut up and drive will you im going to conn this landcruiser and run the gun too so im too busy to chatter im going to be busier than a onehanded male with the underscale itch as a matter of fact ussmak drove when hed stepped into the starship and slung his gear down beside his coldsleep coffin hed expected the race to overrun tosev without losing a male it wasnt turning out to be so simple not with the big uglies knowing more than anyone had suspected they did but they didnt know enough the race could still drive them as easily as ussmak drove his landcruiser a pinng off the turret steer ussmak telerep shouted i saw the flash the driver obediently turned due west another pinng this one off the glacis plate after taking a hit from a landcruiser cannon ussmak ignored the tiny nuisance he tramped down hard on the accelerator this time harry turtledove hed spotted the muzzle flash too he drove straight toward it the big ugly fired again uselessly then turned and tried to run telerep cut him down with machinegun fire ussmak ran over the carcass smashing it into the grass and dirt his jaws opened wide votal was avenged the landcruiser formation rolled on across the steppe even the smallest noise or flicker of motion in the sky drew heinrich jagers complete and concerned he was too stubborn to admit to a word like fearfulattention this time it was just a linnet flitting past chirping as it went this time he had three tanks left three tanks and a combat group of infantry combat group was the wehrmacht way of describing odds and ends of military meat pressed together in the hope of turning out a sausage sometimes it even worked but when it did the sausage went right back into the meat grinder again another motion across the sky turned out to be another bird jager shook his head he could feel how jumpy he was getting but the lizards aircraft didnt have to be right overhead to kill the company had learned that too to its sorrow he managed something halfway between a laugh and a cough leaned down into the turret i wonder if the ivans felt this naked after we smashed so many of their planes on the ground last year he said if they did they hid it damned well his gunner answered georg schultz wore the ribbon for a wound badge too so do we i hope jager said a squad of infantry was posted on a swell of ground a few hundred meters in front of the tanks one of the foot soldiers turned and waved urgently the signal meant only one thing lizard panzers heading across the steppe jagers testicles tried to crawl up into his belly schultz looked up at him the gunner was dirty and unshaven we must try he said for the fatherland for the fatherland jager echoed given that the alternative was bailing out of his tank and trying to foot it across the ukraine through lizards and partisans both fighting for the fatherland looked like the best bet he had he leaned down into the turret called to dieter schmidt to the prepared position the panzer iii slowly rumbled forward so did the other two survivors of the tank company in slots dug into the reverse slope of the rise they exposed only the tops of their turrets to the enemy jager stood up in the cupola peered ahead with field glasses he took even fewer chances than he had against the russians shrubs tied to his leather headgear broke up his outline he used his free hand to shield the binoculars so no sun reflected off their lenses sure enough there were the lizards eight or ten tanks worth with worldwar in the balance more vehicles scurrying along behind to support them jager recognized the ones with small turrets as troop carriers on the order of the german sdkfz but far more dangerous they could fight his panzers on largely even terms and the lizards tanks you know whats the funny thing georg he said as he lowered himself once more tell me anything funny about the lizards herr major the gunner grunted i will laugh i promise you theyre lousy tankers jager said he was a lousy tankman himself but only in the literal sense of the word no one who was lousy in the metaphorical sense could have lasted almost a year on the eastern front sure enough schultz laughed theyve been good enough to kick our ass its the panzers not the crews jager insisted they have better guns than ours better armor and god only knows how they make engines that dont smoke but tactics pfui he curled his lip in disdain the russians have better sense they just motor along shooting at anything that happens to cross their path they arent even looking this way though its an obvious place for trouble stupid no doubt a run through the panzer lehr training division would improve their skill herr major schultz said dryly bu if the tanks themselves are good enough how good do the tankers have to be jager grunted it was a cogent question in panzer iiis little pimpfs from the hitler youth boys too young to shave could have taken out whole divisions of british tanks from the great war the rhomboidal monsters were too slow to run and too lightly armed to fight hed thought the panzer iii a great tank until he ran up against his first russian t and ohod tank afterward now now he might as well have been in one even ose obsolete rhomboids himself we do what we can georg he said the gunner nodded jager stuck his head out of the cupola again the lizards were trundling happily past his strongpoint no more than five hundred meters away without the slightest idea he was there he glanced over to ernst riecke and uwe tannenwald his other surviving tank commanders and held up one finger both men waved to show they understood hanging around for more than one shot against the lizards was an invitation to a funeral the company commander pointed to one of the troop carriers that one georg he said quietly ja the gunner said he spoke to the loader armorpiercing armorpiercing stefan fuchk echoed he pulled the blacktipped round out of the ammunition rack loaded it into the fivecentimeter gun closed the breech the gunner traversed the turret a few degrees so it bore on the troop harry turtledove carrier he took his eyes away from the gunsight for an instant to make sure fuchs was clear of the recoil then looked back and squeezed the trigger at almost the same time the cannon roared through his field glasses jager saw a hole appear in the troop carriers flank hit he shrieked the carrier slewed sideways stopped it was burning a hatch came down in the rear lizards started bailing out german foot soldiers opened up on them picking them off as they emerged back jager shouted if he waited around to see how the foot soldiers did one of those lizard panzers would blow him to bits already with terrifying speed their turrets were traversing to bear on his position dieter schmidt jammed the tank into reverse it jounced down the low slope so did sergeant tannenwalds ernst riecke was a split second too slow jager watched in dismay as the turret flew off his panzer and crushed an infantryman who was scrambling to get out of the way later jager told himself ill grieve that assumed there would be a later for him at the moment the assumption looked bad one of the things hed learned fighting the russians was to have more than one firing position available whenever he could his second one was at the base of the rise maybe well give em a surprise major schultz said he and fuchs already had another ap round loaded and ready the gun bore on the place where the lizard panzers were likeliest to breast the rise a couple of foot soldiers dashed forward with satchel charges that meant the tanks were close then machine guns chattered furiously an explosion sent up smoke and dirt then another jager hoped the brave men hadnt thrown away their lives for nothing then he had no time for hope or fear for a lizard panzer nosed over the horizon right where hed thought it would the lizards really were lousy tankmen the panzer iiis cannon roared as he drew in breath to yell fire i schultz was an artist with the long gun he put the ap round right in the middle of the tiny bit of belly plate the enemy tank exposed as it came over the rise the glacis plate laughed at even highvelocity fivecentimeter shells the belly plate as on merely human panzers was thinner the shell pierced it the tank stopped theyll have to take the driver out of there with a spoon jager thought two lizards popped out of the turret one after the other the hull machine gun from jagers tank cut them down tannenwalds tank had done almost as well as the company commanders its first shot knocked the track off a lizard panzers road wheels the hit tank swerved out of control a foot soldier ran up to it tossed a potatomasher grenade into the open cupola its small blast was followed an instant later by a big one as the panzers ammunition went off worldwar in the balance more vehicles scurrying along behind to support them jager recognized the ones with small turrets as troop carriers on the order of the german sdkfz but far more dangerous they could fight his panzers on largely even terms and the lizards tanks you know whats the funny thing georg he said as he lowered himself once more

loaded and ready the gun bore on the place where the lizard panzers were likeliest to breast the rise a couple of foot soldiers dashed forward with satchel charges that meant the tanks were close then machine guns chattered furiously an explosion sent up smoke and dirt then another jager hoped the brave men hadnt thrown away their lives for nothing then he had no time for hope or fear for a lizard panzer nosed over the horizon right where hed thought it would the lizards really were lousy tankmen the panzer iiis cannon roared as he drew in breath to yell fire i schultz was an artist with the long gun he put the ap round right in the middle of the tiny bit of belly plate the enemy tank exposed as it came over the rise the glacis plate laughed at even highvelocity fivecentimeter shells the belly plate as on merely human panzers was thinner the shell pierced it the tank stopped theyll have to take the driver out of there with a spoon jager thought two lizards popped out of the turret one after the other the hull machine gun from jagers tank cut them down tannenwalds tank had done almost as well as the company commanders its first shot knocked the track off a lizard panzers road wheels the hit tank swerved out of control a foot soldier ran up to it tossed a potatomasher grenade into the open cupola its small blast was followed an instant later by a big one as the panzers ammunition went off worldwar in the balance back again jager told schmidt already theyd hurt the lizards worse in this engagement than ever before that was important but it would matter only so much if he wound up dead as he probably would as soon as a lizard panzer made it onto the reverse slope of that little rise a scream in the sky death would come even without the lizards tanks then their aircraft were just as deadly jager resigned himself bombs burst all around the other side of the rise the side the lizards were still climbing stuka georg schultz screamed in the voice of a man who knows himself reprieved by god it is jager said he by contrast spoke softly for he could scarcely believe he might yet live a while longer the lizards had taken as dreadful a toll on the luftwaffe as on the wehrmacht but this pilot somehow had still got his divebomber into the air and still had the nerve to fly it straight down the lizards throats more bombs went off in quick succession hed loosed the whole stick only a direct hit would take out a panzer but even experienced tankers had to hesitate before advancing through that sudden storm of explosives the stuka pilot couldnt have been more than a hundred meters off the ground when he pulled out of his dive two of the lizard panzers fired their guided rockets at him but the missiles shot harmlessly past his plane he skimmed away his landing gear just above the waving grass of the steppe get us out of here jager told dieter schmidt the panzer iiis engine roared as the driver obeyed jager felt an itch between his shoulder blades he knew that was stupid if one of the lizards shells got him hed ttead too fast to know it the looked back toward the rise if his tank could make it over the next one before the lizards climbed this one and spotted him he really did have a chance to get away he wouldnt have believed it when the engagement started but it was true he felt a surge of pride his troops had hurt the lizards and not many units could boast of that gott mit uns he thought we might even do it again two lizard panzers came over the rise his own tank was only halfway up the next slope a turret swung his way his eyes went up to the sky seeking praying for another stuka but god lives in only so many machines the lizards didnt even need to slow down to fire less than a heartbeat after the big cannon spat smoke and flame jager felt the mother of all kicks in the arse his trusty panzer which had served so well for so long died under him smoke poured up through the engine vents of the rear deck out out out he screamed he had almost been thrown out on his head only two armored walls and the full weight of the engine had kept harry turtledove the enemy shell out of the fighting compartment once the fire got going nothing would hold that at bay machinegun bullets stitched the air around him as he pulled himself out of the cupola and dove into the tall grass other hatches came open his crew began bailing out with him a bullet struck home with a noise like a slap on a bare wet back somebody shrieked the clean green smell of the weeds through which jager scrambled filled his nostrils he had two somewhat contradictory goals he wanted to put the hulk of the killed tank between himself and the oncoming lizards but he also wanted to get as far away from that hulkand from the lizards as he could the ammunition in the panzer iii was going to start cooking off any minute now maybe any second and the lizards were not likely to be welldisposed toward german tankmen especially a crew that had managed to destroy one of their fancy machines another shell slammed into the panzer iii it went up with a roar stupid jager thought stupid and wasteful that tank was already dead meat meanwhile though machinegun bullets probed the grass they made tiny whispering tictictic sounds as they clipped the leaves jager wondered what kind of sounds he would make if they clipped him the lizards tank rolled majestically past fewer than fifty meters off jager lay facedown and unmoving if the enemy saw him maybe theyd think he was already dead not only was it faster than both his panzer iii and a t it was ghostquiet to boot somewhere a few hundred meters away an mg began to bark bullets ricocheted off the armor of the lizard panzer its machine gun returned fire the panzer itself turned toward the german machinegun position as he crawled in the opposite direction jager almost bumped into georg schultz after an instant of fright the two men grinned at each other good to see you sir the gunner said grin broad and white in his dirty face and you jager answered have you seen fuchs schultzs grin slipped he didnt make it out that was the shriek then jager said the gunner nodded jager went on what about the two up front dont know they found dieter schmidt a few minutes later klaus bauer the hull gunner remained missing we both got out schmidt insisted i dont know what happened to him afterward he didnt say nothing good but the words hung in the air lucky we didnt blow up when we were hit jager said schmidt surprised him by laughing luck hell sir we were just about dry of petrol thats all we had maybe enough for another kilometer or two no more worldwar in the balance oh jager said he started to laugh himself though it wasnt really funny here hed just fought what had to be one of the most successful smallunit actions ever against the lizards and to what result only the final destruction of his tank company how many actions like that could the wehrmacht take before there wasnt any wehrmacht any more for that matter even this action wasnt over yet lizard infantry had been moving up along with their armor jager had a pistol in his holster that he hadnt fired in months schultz and schmidt were both clutching their personal schmeissers submachine guns were better than nothing but they didnt have the range to make proper infantry weapons what now sir schultz asked now we get out of the sack jager said if we can moishe russie held up the bible read from the book of joshua in a loud voice and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city the crowd of jews behind him cheered at his side his wife rivka beamed at him her sweet brown eyes enormous in her thin face their son reuven was even thinner his eyes so like his mothers even bigger a starving child could not help rousing horror and pity in any adult who saw him save perhaps in the warsaw ghetto where the sight had grown so common that even horror and pity failed at last what now reb moishe someone called im no reb he said looking modestly down at the ground no reb several people exclaimed together in tones of disbelief one added who but you asked the lord for a sign and was answered that had run through the ghetto almost before the miraculous light in the j faded every tale with hope in it spread even faster than typhus with only hope to live on the jews made of it a banquet someone else a woman said hes no reb hes a prophet like joshua whose book he reads he made the walls fall down the jews cheered again russie felt his ears grow hot he hadnt made the ghetto walls fall down and he knew it but the bombs that screamed out of the sky and smashed brick to powder seemed to have come from the same people monsters whod touched off the light in the sky hed taken for a signal from on high the only accounts of them in the ghetto came from garbled shortwave reports by the rumors hed heard russie knew the lizards a name he wondered about were bombing fortifications all over the world nowhere though had their explosives done more than in warsaw he wondered whether the lizards thought the nazis had an enemy under siege in the heart of the city if so theyd been right though perhaps harry turtledove not in the way theyd believed whatever their reasons theyd attacked the wall less than a week after they revealed their presence russie remembered the german bombers dropping their endless loads of death almost randomly over warsaw although they had paid special attention to the jewish districts the lizards raid was different even though theyd come at night their bombs hit the wall and only the wall almost as if they were aimed not by men or even lizards but by the hand of the almighty rivka smiled at him remember how we shivered under our blankets when the explosions started going off im not likely to forget russie answered since warsaw surrendered the ghetto hadnt known the sounds of real warfare the dreaded crummp of bombs reminded everyone who had managed to endure since that more straightforward means of death than starvation disease and beatings were loose in the world russie went on and then when the curfew lifted oh when the curfew lifted bombs or no bombs if he didnt get to his sewing machine hed lose his job he knew it and sallied forth at the usual time the streets had seemed to fill with amazing speed that morning people moved along at their usual pace no one who had work would risk losing it and no one without would throw away a chance to find some but somehow everyone managed to stop for a few seconds and gape at one or more than one of the holes torn in the wall that sundered the ghetto from the rest of warsaw russie stood in front of one of those holes now a threemeter stretch where there was no wall as he stepped into the bomb crater the soles of his feet felt every sharp brick fragment through the rags that wrapped them he did not care still holding the holy scriptures before him he walked through the shallow crater and out of the ghetto turning he said jerichos walls could not hold the hebrews out nor can warsaws hold us in the lord has set us free the crowd of jews cheered once more he drank in the shouts of reb moishe reb moishe the more he heard them the better they sounded in his ears god had given him the sign after all someone in the crowd though called the lord may have set us free but has he bothered to tell the nazis the word itself was enough to make people look this way and that in alarm russie among them even without walls the germans could have kept the ghetto sealed by posting machine guns in the streets around it they hadnt done so which seemed to russie another sign of divine intervention he took a short fearful breath as if thinking of germans was enough to conjure them up here came two the crowd behind him started to melt away moishe get back here his wife said urgently worldwar in the balance too late one of the germans an officer by his peaked cap pointed to russie you jew come here he said in peremptory tones his companion an enlisted man had a rifle if russie ran the fellow might shoot and wasnt likely to care whether he hit the man he was aiming for or some other fleeing jew russie took off his hat to the officer an army man he saw with relief not a member of the ss some army men were decent still omitting the gesture of respect the nazis demanded was too dangerous to risk if hed been on the sidewalk he would have stepped down into the street as it was he bent his head and said yessir how can i help you sir in the pure german hed learned in medical school he also did not care to risk angering the man by making him try to follow yiddish or polish what do you make of this the officer he was a major russie saw by his shoulder straps which were embroidered but bore no pips waved at the wreckage of the wall that had surrounded the ghetto russie stayed silent for some time considering the tone of the question germans were like any other folk in that some wanted to hear only that which agreed with what they already thought while others asked in hope of learning something they did not yet know and in that the former type outnumbered the latter by a goodly margin safest to say nothing and say it in a pleasing way safest yes but he found all at once that he could not stomach simple safety not any more not with a german for once asking a question of a jew and sounding as if the answer mattered to him russie held out the bible he was carrying i take this to mean that god has not forgotten us after all under the outthrust rim of his steel helmet the enlisted mans gingersed eyebrows drew together in anger the major however nodded y and thoughtfully you may be right in truth you would require the aid of god to escape from our hands that i know russie did not bother to hide his bitterness with the whole world turned topsyturvy somehow it did not seem wrong for the prisoner to speak his mind to his gaoler the german major nodded again as if thinking along the same lines he said do you know jew the lizards who bombed these walls are not even human beings but creatures from some other world russie shrugged how could it matter to us trapped back in there he halfturned and pointed with his chin into the ghetto and why should it matter to you germans either you named us untermenschen subhumans what difference between subhumans and creatures from some other world he repeated the majors phrase without any real feeling for what it might imply what difference ill tell you what by all accounts the lizards are harry turtledove ugly enough to be untermenschen but they fight like bermenschen like supermen so do the russians by all accounts russie said just standing on the far side of the ghetto wall was making him reckless he got away with it too the german enlisted mans scowl got deeper but the major accepted the gibe with almost british understatement he said the problem with the lizards is rather worse good russie thought if the mysterious lizards ever showed up in person in warsaw the ghetto jews would greet them with open arms no matter how reckless hed grown though he did not say that aloud instead he asked and what sir do you make of this we are still deciding precisely what to make of it the major answered i have as yet no orders ah russie said in combat a german without orders was as deadly as one who had them for german soldiers were endlessly trained to react and seize the initiative when and as they could in matters political though germans without orders were as helpless as so many unweaned babes fearing to take a step in any direction a strange folk russie thought and all the more dangerous for their strangeness he asked then you have no orders to keep us from coming out of the ghetto night wahr that is so the major admitted in the hollow voice of a man who has had too much happen to him too quickly in any case with the lizards having established a base inside the polish general gouvernement the wehrmacht has more to worry about at the moment than you jews thank you sir russie breathed his own sincerity startled him after a moment it angered him as well why should he thank this nazi for deigning to allow him what should have been his by right and indeed the german tempered his own moderation you would likely do well to remember that the ss never has more to worry about than you jews be careful be very careful the cold gray eyes of the silent enlisted man seemed to add be very careful kike we have learned to be careful russie said otherwise we would all be dead by now he wondered how the major would react to that the man merely nodded as at any statement of obvious fact his arm shot up and out in the german salute heil hitler russie could not bring himself to answer with the nazi farewell but the officer had talked to him as man to man not as master to slave he said god keep you safe from the lizards major the german nodded again this time brusquely did a military aboutface and strode away the enlisted man stalked after him they left moishe russie still standing in polish warsaw outside the ghetto moishe are you all right his wife called from the other side of the worldwar in the balance fence she had not fled but reuven was nowhere to be seen a sensible precaution for he was all they had left i am all right he answered wonder in his own voice he repeated the words louder i am all right simply standing in broad daylight on what had been forbidden soil was as intoxicating as purim vodka timidly rivka picked her way across the bomb crater and joined him on the far side of the wall they spoke with you and you took no harm she sounded as amazed as he had maybe even they felt god working through you maybe they did russie said as he slipped his arm around her shoulder an hour earlier he had scoffed at the idea that he a medical student who ate pork if his need was desperate enough might somehow be a prophet now he too began to wonder god had not actively interfered in the affairs of his chosen people since the days of the bible but when since those days had his people been in such peril and why russie thought would god choose him he shook his head who am i to question him he said his will be done it is rivka said proudly through you the lights were off in the auditorium of the mills and petrie memorial center power had been erratic ever since the lizards airplanes started ranging over the midwest the gloomy auditorium was packed nonetheless with youths and men from the village of ashton and with refugees like sam yeager and mutt daniels yeager was acutely aware that hed been wearing the same clothes for several days that he hadnt washed either them or himself any time lately that hed done a lot of walking and running and hiding in them seeing a s d many men as grimy as he and none of them taking any notice of it something of a relief a grimfaced middleaged man in khaki walked across the stage stopped in the center crowd noises ceased as abruptly as if cut off by a switch thank you for being here this morning the man said i want you all to stand and raise your right hands yeager was already standing the auditorium had more men in it than seats he put up his right hand the man in khaki said repeat after me i state your name i samuel william yeager yeager repeated a citizen of the united states do hereby acknowledge to have voluntarily enlisted the eighth day of june as a soldier in the regular army of the united states of america for the period of four years or the duration of this war under the conditions prescribed by law unless sooner discharged by proper authority and do also agree to accept from the united states such bounty pay rations and clothing as are or may be prescribed by law and i do solemnly swear the echoing chorus grew ragged for a moment as a few men said harry turtledove affirm that i will bear true faith and allegiance to the united states of america that i will serve them honestly and faithfully against all their enemies whatsoever and that i will obey the orders of the president of the united states and the orders of the officers appointed over me according to the rules and articles of war an enormous grin stretched across yeagers face it had taken an invasion from mars or wherever the hell the lizards came from but hed made it into the service after all when do we get our guns somebody in the crowd shouted yeager quivered with that same hot eagerness he hadnt yet been to war unless having his train strafed counted but he hadnt been able to shoot back then beside him mutt daniels stood quietly he wasnt eager hed done this before up on the stage the dour recruiting sergeant schneider his name was raised his eyebrows to the silent heavens soldier we dont have that many guns to give or uniforms or much of anything weve been building an army to fight overseas since the japs jumped us and now all this shit lands in our own backyard uhhuh mutt daniels said softly they did the very same thing in the last war grabbed the men fore there was anything for em to fight with i want you to form two lines sergeant schneider said one line for great war veterans over this way the other for everybody else over there move it people and remember youre in the army now lying isnt just a joke any more daniels went over this way toward a table manned by a younger man in khaki a corporal along with most of the men in the auditorium yeager went over there a longer line toward a table behind which schneider himself sat he suspected that mutt and the rest of the veterans would get first crack at whatever rifles became available that was only fair they had the best idea of what to do with them his own line moved much more slowly he chatted with the men in front and in back of him hed come through the hamlet of franklin grove on his way to ashton and heard president roosevelts defiant speech from somewhere in the united states of america he sure can turn a phrase the fellow in front of yeager said this earth is ours this nation is ours no one shall take them from us so help me god thats just what he said yeager said admiringly howd you remember it right on the button like that im a reporter its a trick of the trade the man said he was in his late twenties with sharp foxy features a hairline mustache very blue eyes and sandy hair combed down slick and close to his skull he stuck out a hand names pete thomsen im with the rockford courierjournal worldwar in the balance yeager shook the proffered hand then introduced himself so did the fellow behind him a bald muscular man named otto chase he said i was just heading to the cement works in dixon when they blew up in front of me thats when i got this here he gingerly touched a gash on the top of his head with a blunt forefinger at last yeager stood before sergeant schneider the sergeant paused to sharpen his pencil with a pocket knife then took yeagers name and date of birth married he asked no sir divorced yeager said and made a sour face louise had finally gotten sick of his nomadic ways and when he wouldnt settle down children no sir he said again schneider made a checkmark then said occupation ballplayer he answered which made schneider look up from the form he went on i play played i guessfor the decatur commodores thats my manager over there he pointed to mutt daniels whod already gone through his line and was jawing with several other first world war veterans the recruiting sergeant rubbed his chin what position you play you a pitcher no sir outfield left mostly hmm you throw pretty good though yes sir nothing wrong with my arm yeager said without false modesty he wasnt fast he wasnt the best fielder in the world he was a sucker for a slow curve on the outside corner but by god he could throw okay schneider said youll be able to chuck a grenade farther tltallost i expect he scribbled a note then pmnted n mutt s recno hilf you go over with those fellows weve got some grenades and well be bringing more in if the lizards dont shoot up the trucks anyhow go on now the sergeant raised his voice bjext rather hesitantly yeager walked over to the knot of men with daniels he was a rookie on this team these men many of them plump or balding or gray had seen and done things he hadnt suddenly what they knew was in demand again his own taste of combat had been solely on the receiving end running away from death in the sky like the hordes of bombedout refugees in europe mutt helped some by introducing him around one of the plump gray men there a fellow named fred walters turned out to have played a few weeks of class d ball back around i couldnt cut the mustard and they turned me loose he said you been makin a living at it seventeen years thats pretty fine his admiration also helped make sam feel more at ease harry turtledove and of course they all had the war or rather the wars to talk about with the lizards here are we still fighting the germans and the japs yeager asked adding but for roosevelts speech i havent heard much in the way of news till i got here yesterday me neither mutt daniels ran a hand over his ragged pants and filthy jacket we been on the move the last few days you might say that got him a few wry chuckles several of the men standing there were a lot more bedraggled than he was fred walters by contrast was clean and wellcreased he lived in ashton he said fact of it is nobody really knows what the hell is going on i did hear tell though that a jap fleet heading for hawaii hightailed it back to the land of the rising sun when the lizards bombed tokyo they hit tokyo yeager said first good thing i heard about em they hit berlin too walters said and a lot of other places besides one thing this does said somebody whose name yeager hadnt caught is shoot lendlease right in the head with the damned lizards right here in the middle of the united states we dont have enough for ourselves let alone for anybody else gonna be hard on the limies and the russians daniels observed we gotta worry about ourselves first the other man said heads bobbed up and down yeagers among them the fellow went on plain fact is were short too if we werent we wouldnt be going through this folderol of separating out the ones who know how to fight to make sure they get guns first sergeant schneider over there as much as told me we dont have enough guns for all the men whove joining up here yeager said plain fact is gentlemen we got trouble daniels said thats what the plain fact is and nothing else but heads bobbed up and down again something moving swiftly through the air alarm coursed through david goldfarb as he caught the motion he whipped his binoculars up to his eyes took a longer look relaxed only a sea gull he said relief in his voice which kind jerome jones asked with interest the events of the past few days had turned him into an avid birdwatcher one of the blackheaded ones goldfarb answered indifferently his interest in birds began and ended with poultry he sat in a rickety folding chair of canvas and wood a few feet from the edge of the cliffs of dover where england dropped straight down into the sea an observer might have sat thus a quarter of a century before with the selfsame binoculars maybe even in the selfsame folding chair peering toward europe in hope of spotting zeppelins only the field telephone by the chair was of a model impossible in worldwar in the balance jerome jones laughed when he said that aloud likely is the same folding chair the forms for a new one wont have got to the proper office yet he laughed again this time mirthlessly like the bloody pixie reports i told you the flaw wasnt in the radar goldfarb said that you did and if you keep up with i told you so youll make some nice girl very unhappy one day jones retorted besides dont you wish youd been wrong having taken two solid hits in as many sentences goldfarb answered only with a grunt his eyes traveled back to what had been the radar station that had superseded observers armed with nothing better than field glasses nothing there now but rubble and a faint stench as of meat gone bad the only reason goldfarb could sit out here looking at those ruins was that hed been off duty when the lizard rockets struck home up and down the english coast the story was the same wherever thered been an active radar a rocket came along and took it out that meant only one thing rockets able to home in on radar beams even the new shortwave ones jerry still hadnt figured out whod have thought the lizards could be so much smarter than the germans goldfarb said no matter how much he loathed hitler and the nazis he had a solid respect for the technical ability of the enemy across the channel wireless says we knocked down a couple of their planes over london jones remarked hopefully good goldfarb said any news of that sort was encouraging how many did we lose the commentator did not announce the full score of the match job said military security dont you know oh indeed goldfarb said i wonder if their batsman made his century no doubt its a cricket score set against one footballers might make god help us all theyve not tried a landing here jones said still looking on the bright side its only a very small island goldfarb pictured a world globe in his mind and realized all at once just how small england had to look from space not small enough to keep them from bombing us jones said bitterly he and goldfarb both shook their heads theydhelped their country beat back the most savage air assault the world had ever known then helped start paying the germans back now they were under attack again it hardly seemed fair theres something goldfarb exclaimed pointing he and jones both swung their field glasses toward the moving specks in the sky the specks even through binoculars they were little more than that were harry turtledove southbound ours i think goldfarb said bound for the lizards lair in france lizards and frogs jones laughed at his own wit but quickly sobered i wonder how many of the poor brave buggersil fly back north again after their run worse than the flak over berlin they say i wonder if jerrys hitting back at the lizards too something else occurred to goldfarb if his planes and ours are both trying to hit them at the same time do we shoot at each other too i hope not jones exclaimed wouldnt that be a ballsup it would indeed goldfarb said i hope not too he laughed not altogether comfortably first time in donkeys years ive wished the ger mans anything but a fast trip to the devil the germans theyre human beings stack em against things from mars and i know where my choice lies jones said goldfarb answered with a grunt he was reluctant to concede anything to the nazis he agreed completely with churchills quip that should satan declare war on hitler he would at least give the devil a favorable mention in the house of commons but quips came easy now the whole world faced devils it didnt know britain had allied with red russia when germany invaded germany was worse if the lizards were worse than germany would alliances swing again he scowled im damned if i want to see us in bed with the nazis he wondered again at the fate of his cousins in poland would you rather end up in bed with the lizards jones demanded before it could turn into an argument he added me id rather end up in bed with the barmaid down at the white horse inn that sufficed to distract goldfarb which one he asked daphne or sylvia daphne by choice im rather keen on blondes and she has more to hold on to joness hands illustrated just which parts he had in mind but of course were sylvia to smile at me in exactly the proper fashion redheads are interesting because theyre unusual what they both fancy pilots goldfarb said morosely along with no doubt a great many other nonflying raf men hed had his advances turned into retreats by both girls for that matter so had jerome jones the other radar man said now theres something to say for the lizards at any rate goldfarb raised an interrogative eyebrow jones explained if they keep on as theyve been doing well soon have no pilots left thats not funny goldfarb said as if to contradict himself he started laughing then he choked on his laughter something screamed past overhead at just above treetop height he grabbed for the field telephone cranked as if worldwar in the balance his life depended on it while more lizard planes streaked northwest above him he shouted out his warning over the yowl of their engines if its london again the bastards will be there in a minute jones yelled at the top of his lungs he might as well have been whispering goldfarb had to read his lips goldfarb did his best to sound hopeful doesnt take long to scramble the spitfire squadrons maybe not but we cant catch their planes even if we do manage to get ours up whats worked best is loitering alongside their return routes then striking at them as they go past dogging and pouncing jones said dropping his voice as the lizard aircraft receded in the distance goldfarb raised that eyebrow again his friend went on i did a bit of history at cambridge along with the maths the old byzantines would let the arabs into asia minor you see then wait at the passes for them to come out with their loot ah goldfarb said and did it work sometimes but even when it did of course asia minor took a bit of a hiding yes well weve had hidings before i hope we can ride out another one goldfarb said not that weve much choice in the matter neither of them said much after that goldfarb dug a finger into one ear trying to make it stop ringing he had little luck the lizards engines were just too loud he wondered if the raf was having any luck and wished he could be up in a spitfire himself his abilities didnt lie there though he consoled himself with the thought that hed done what he cby spotting the flight of bombers tie peered south out over the english channel the springtime air almost summer now he reminded himself was sweet and mild and clear the french coast was a low dark smear on the horizon he raised the binoculars to his eyes france leapt closer three years ago that coast had been englands shield then horribly unexpectedly the shield fell over and it served as a base for a thrust at englands heart and now what another thrust at englands heart but one at germanys as well goldfarb wished the lizards would leave his country alone and go after the nazis with everything they had the wish changed the situation about as much as wishes commonly do he sighed its a rum world sure enough aye it is jones looked at his watch our reliefs should be here any minute now when were off shall we head over to the white hose what they call best bitters gone to the dogs since the war gone through their kidneys by the taste of it but theres always daphne to stare at maybe even to chat up why not goldfarb intended to try sylvia again his own taste ran harry turtledove to redheads she wasnt a jewish girl to bring home to his family hed thought a lot more about that since the war started but he didnt aim to marry her however attractive some of the concomitants of that relationship might be he laughed at himself the next interest in him sylvia showed would be her first well he thought she cant very well show interest if im not there to be interesting something else to thank the lizards for jones said if they hadnt smashed up the radar set wed be spending all these idle hours fiddling with it instead of chasing skirt radars all very well but next to skirt right goldfarb said he pointed and here come reg and steven so lets be off as jones got up from his canvas chair he asked can you lend me ten bob goldfarb stared at him he grinned back cheekily confident goldfarb got out his wallet passed over a note if you had the gall with daphne that you do with me with ten bob in my pocket maybe i will come on then there was a war on there were these last few crazed days two wars on but life went on too goldfarb hurried through his report to the next watch crew then hurried off with jerome jones toward the white horse inn i am flying toward my death george bagnall had had that thought every time the lancaster made its ungainly leap off the tarmac for a run into germany now flying against the lizards it was much more tightly focused death lurked in the air over germany yes but random death a flak shell that happened to burst just where you were or a night fighter coming close enough to spot your exhaust going against the lizards death was not random this was bagnalls third sortie into france and he had seen that for himself if the lizards chose your plane you would go down their rockets came after you as if they knew your home address you couldnt run shooting at the missiles did no good to speak of bagnall wanted to hide he glanced over at ken embry the pilots face was set the skin stretched tight across his cheekbones his mouth nothing but a bloodless slash they were coming in low tonight too low to bother with oxygen so embrys whole face was visible going in high just made them better targets the raf had learned that lesson the hard way bagnall sighed pity we couldnt have come down with a case of magneto drop of some such eh youre the engineer mr bagnall embry said arranging a convenient mechanical failure should be your speciality pity i didnt think of it as we were running through the checklists worldwar in the balance bagnall murmured embrys answering grin stretched his mouth wider but did nothing to banish the look of haunted determination from his features like bagnall he knew what the odds were theyd been lucky twice three times if you counted the wild melee in the air over cologne on what everyone was starting to call the night the martians landed but how long could luck hold embry said feels odd flying out of formation it did seem rather like lining up all the ducks to be knocked over one by one bagnall said the first attack on the lizards in which fortunately his lanc had not been involved had been a failure horrific enough to make bomber command change tactics in a hurry something the flight engineer hadnt previously imagined possible and attacking low and dispersed did work better than pouring in high and in formation as if the lizards were nothing but germans to be overwhelmed by sheer numbers bagnalls bomber had made it back to england twice five miles to commencement of target area the navigator announced over the intercom thank you all ken embry said ahead of them streaks of fire began leaping up from the ground fully laden bombers exploded in midair one after another blazing through the night like great orange chrysanthemums of flame they would have been even more beautiful had each one not meant the deaths of so many men bagnall waited for one of those fiery streaks to burn straight for his lanc it hadnt happened yet but embry whooped pounded his thigh with a fist did you see that did ybloody see that one of them missed somebody dodged it sure engh one of the rockets kept flying up and up then went off in a blast not much more impressive than a guy fawkes day firework embry quickly sobered but theres so many that dont miss from his glassedin window in the bottom front of the lancs nose douglas bell said coming up on something that looks like it belongs to the lizards that was good enough for embry commencing bombing run under your direction bombaimer very good bell said steer slightly west toward thatbloody hell i dont know what it is but it never came from earth slightly west straightening my course on the object ahead the pilot acknowledged peering ahead through the perspex bagnall too saw against the horizon the great tower ahead it looked more like a pregnant skyscraper than anythihg else he could think of though even the yankees famous empire state building might have shrunk by comparison for the tower was still harry turtledove miles ahead it assuredly did not belong in the french countryside a good long way south and east of paris it was not the only tower spaceship bagnall supposed the proper word was in the neighborhood either the lizards kept setting down more and more of them and to attack the spaceships themselves was certain death nobody had succeeded in knocking one out nobody had come back from trying either the bombaimer while as brave a man as could be hoped for he was up here after all wasnt he was not actively trying to kill himself he said slightly more to the west if you please sir three degrees or so i think thats the tank park we were told of in the briefing dont you embry and bagnall both leaned forward to look now something big and orderly was going on down on the ground that was certain if it wasnt german it had to belong to the lizards and if it was german bagnall thought well too bad for jerry his eyes flicked over to mbry s the pilot e nodded said i think youre right bombaimer carry on very good bell repeated steady course steady his voice rose to a shout commence bombing the fuselage rattled and groaned as bombs rained down on the target bagnall took a moment to pity the poor french peasants below they were after all his allies now suffering under the double yoke of the nazis and the lizards and some of them were only too likely to die in the bombardment that was at the moment the only hope of getting them free the lanc staggered in the air for a dreadful instant bagnall thought it was hit but it was only plowing through the turbulence kicked up by exploding bombs the plane was usually two or three miles higher above them when they went off lets get out of here embry heeled the bomber over and swung its nose toward england give us a course for home mr whyte saiddue north will do for now ill fine it up momentarily the navigator due north it is i wonder how many will land with us embry said i wonder if well be lucky enough to land bagnall thought he would not give the evil omen strength by speaking it aloud greenyellow tracers zipped past the windscreen too close for comfort along with their rockets the lizards boasted formidable light flak embry threw the lancaster into a series of evasive jinks and jerks that rattled everyones teeth the rear gunner called weve a fighter to starboard looking us over whatever spit was left in bagnalls mouth dried up as his eyes swung rightward but the plane there a deeper blackness against black night was not a lizard jet onlyonly a fockewulf it waggled its wings at the lanc and darted away at a speed the british bomber could not hope to match worldwar in the balance when he breathed again bagnall discovered hed forgotten to for some time then another lizard flak battery started up below with a sound like a giant poking his fist through a tin roof shells slammed into the lancasters left wing flames spurted from both engines there to his subsequent amazement the flight engineer performed exactly as hed been trained a glance at the gauges told him those merlins would never fly again he shut them down shut down the fuel feed to them feathered the props embry flicked a toggle made a face flaps arent responding on that side no hydraulic pressure bagnall said after another check of his struments he watched the pilot fight the controls already the lanc was trying to swing in an anticlockwise circle appears we have a bit of a problem a bit yes embry said nodding look for a field or a road im going to try to set her down still sounding calm he went on sooner pick my time for it than have the aircraft choose for me eh as you say bagnall agreed the pilots couple of sentences told the same story as his own bank of instruments the aircraft would not make it back to england he pointed theres as likely a stretch of highway as were apt to find one thing for the war were not likely to run over uncle pierres citroen right embry raised his voice crew prepare for crash landing mr bagnall lower the landing gear if you please the right wheel descended smoothly without hydraulics the left refused to budge bagnall worked the hand crank from the belly turret a gunner said its down i can see it one thing fewer to worry about embry remarked with what seed to bagnall to be quite excessive good cheer then the pilot added that leaves only two or three hundred thousand unless i miss my count we could be trying this up in normandy where the hedgerows grow right alongside the roadbed bagnall said helpfully embry corrected himself two things fewer you do so relieve my mind george happy to be of service bagnall answered joking about what was going to happen was easier than just sitting back and watching it a forced landing in a damaged aircraft on a french road in the middle of the night without lights was not easy to contemplate in cold blood as if to underscore that embry said aircrew may bail out if they find that preferable to attempting a landing i shall endeavor to remain airborne an extra minute or two to allow them to avail themselves of the opportunity had we suffered this misfortune a month ago i would bail out myself and permit the aircraft to crash thus denying it to the germans as you have seen this evening however that situation has for the mo harry turtledove ment changed if you do intend to parachute please so inform me at this time the intercom stayed silent until someone in the back of the plane said youll get us down all right sir let us hope such touching confidence is not misplaced embry said thank you gentlemen one and all and good luck to you he brought the stick forward reduced power to the two surviving merlins to us bagnall amended the road a dark gray line arrowing through black fields was almost close enough to reach out and touch embry brought the lancs nose up a little cut power still more the bomber met the road with a bump but bagnall had ben through worse landings at swinderby cheers erupted in the intercom then just as the lancaster slowed toward a stop its right wing clipped a telegraph pole it spun clockwise the left landing gear went off the asphalt and into soft dirt it buckled the wing snapped off where the shells had chewed it the stump dug into the ground the aircrafts spars groaned like a man on the rack bagnall wondered if it would flip over it didnt even as it was spinning embry had shut off the engines altogether into sudden silence a second round of cheers rang out thank you friends embry said now at last when it no longer mattered he let himself sound wrung out he turned to bagnall with a tired grin estce que vous parlez francais monsieur hell no bagnall answered they both laughed like schoolboys a metallic rumble echoed through th emperor hetto as the transfer crafts airlock engaged with one of the bannerships docking collars a speaker chimed softly in fleetlord atvars office the tosevite is here exalted fleetlord a junior officer announced fetch him hither atvar said it shall be done atvar hung in midair as he awaited the arrival of the tosevite official hed ordered the spin taken off the bannership when he began receiving natives he was used to freefall while he did not particularly enjoy it he endured it without trouble as did his crew the tosevites however were without space travel finding themselves weightless might fluster them and put them at a disadvantage atvar hoped so at any rate he let his jaws fall open in amusement as he remembered the unfor i native from the empire called deutschland who had lost all his tuch contents luckily while still in the transfer craft that poor befud dled ribbensomething had been in no state even to try to negotiate his empires submission to the empire the door to the office opened an officer charged with learning the ap propriate tosevite dialect floated outside along with the native for whom he would interpret the officer said exalted fleetlord i present to you the emissary of the empire called the soyuz sovietskikh sotzialest icheskikh respublik sssr for short his name is vyacheslav mikhailovich molotov give him my polite greetings atvar answered thinking the tosevite empire was too small to deserve such a big name like most tosevites though the emissary himself was substantially larger than the fleetlord the interpreter talked haltingly in molotovs speech part of the prob lem was that tosevite languages did not fit well in the mouths of the race to atvar all tosevites sounded as if they had their mouths full of pap tosevite languages were also hard for the race because they were so harry turtledove maddeningly irregular they had not spent long millennia being smoothed into efficient rationality and even without those difficulties the languages remained incompletely familiar to the officers assigned to learn them up until the actual landings on tosev theyd had only radio transmissions from which to work the first convenient thing atvar could see about the tosevites possessing radio and comprehension had emerged slowly out of those even with the help of computers programmed to deduce probable word meanings by statistics molotov listened to the fleetlords greeting gave back one of his own unlike the tosevite from deutschland he had sense enough to speak slowly so as not to overwhelm the interpreter also unlike that tosevite he gave no sign of discomfiture at being off his home planet and in freefall for the first time in his life a viewscreen showed a hologram of tosev as it appeared from the th emperor hetto but molotov did not even deign to glance at it through the corrective lenses hooked in front of his flat immobile eyes he stared straight toward atvar the fleetlord approved he had not thought to find such singleness of purpose among these big barbarians molotov spoke again still slowly and without raising his voice the interpreter turned both eye turrets toward atvar in embarrassment the fleetlord should have enjoyed the privilege of first address but what could a big ugly know of proper protocol atvar said never mind his manners just tell me what he says it shall be done exalted fleetlord vyacheslav mikhailovich this is the polite way to address the tosevites who speak ruskii by their own name and that of their father well never mind that the tosevite demands the immediate unconditional withdrawal of all our forces from the land and air belonging to the empire of the sssr oh he does does he the fleetlord let his jaws gape in a guffaw remind him he is in no position to make demands if he occupied home he might have the right to bend us to his will but it is the surrender of the sssr that is under discussion not ours molotov listened to the interpreters translation without changing expression to atvar the tosevites hed seen and met owned extraordinarily mobile features his own facial hide and musculature were far less flexible but this native might have been carved from stone still stubbornly ignoring his surroundings he paused to think then replied we shall not yield we have fought the gitlerites by which he means the deutsch tosevites exalted fleetlord the interpreter explained to a standstill when they expected us to collapse our land is vast our resources widespread we are not to be easily overcome tell him that his vast empire atvar loaded the word with scorn would vanish almost without trace on any of the three worlds of the empire worldwar in the balance molotov again listened thought answered all three of your worlds are not here with you and you seek to conquer not just the sssr but the whole of this world consider if you have not overextended yourselves atvar glared at the impassive tosevite the native might be barbarous but he was no fool a whole worldeven a world with too much water like tosev was a big place bigger than the fleetlord had truly understood until he began this campaign he hadnt expected to face industrialized opposition either nevertheless he and the race had advantages too he bludgeoned molotov with them we strike you as we please but you come to grief whenever you try to hit us back once all your factories are in ruins how do you propose to hit back at all yield now and you will still have something left for your own people molotov wore the same sort of bulky garments most tosevites preferred his face was damp and shiny with water exuded as a metabolic coolant the th emperor hetto was at a temperature comfortable to the race not for natives but he still answered back boldly enough we have many factories we have many men you have won battles against us but you are far from winning your war we will fight on even the gitlerites have more sense than to yield to you as a matter of fact i recently spoke with the foreign minister of deutschland atvar said that tosevite had also been too stubborn to yield until his empire was pounded flat but molotov did not have to know it the native looked intently at the fleetlord and what had he to say since the sssr and deutschland were at war before the race reached tjw it stood to reason that they had little reason to trust each other e discussed the feasibility of deutschlands acknowledging the authority of the emperor atvar answered on speaking of his sovereign he cast down his eyes for a moment so did the interpreter emperor you say i want to be sure i understand you correctly molotov said your nationis headed by a person who rules because he is a member of a family that has ruled for many years before him is that what you tell me yes that is correct atvar said puzzled by the tosevites puzzlement who else would rule an empire the empirebut the emperor the tosevite named stalin i gather is the emperor of your sssr so far as the fleetlord could see molotov still did not change expression nor was his voice anything but its usual mushy monotone but what he said made the interpreter hiss in rage and astonishment and even lash his tail stump back and forth as if in mortal combat the officer mastered himself spoke in molotovs language molotov answered the interpreter trembled slowly he masterod himself even more slowly he turned to atvar harry turtledove he still hesitated to speak what does the big ugly say atvar demanded exalted fleetlord the interpreter stammered this this thing of a tosevite tells me to tell you that the people the people of his sssr that they they executed murdered their emperor and all his family twentyfive years ago that would be about fifty of our years he added remembering his function as translator they murdered their emperor and this stalin this leader of theirs is no emperor at all but the chief of the group of bandits that killed him atvar was a mature disciplined male so he did not show his feelings with a hiss as the interpreter had but he was shocked to the very core of his being imagining a government without an emperor at its head was almost beyond him home had been unified for scores of millennia and even in the distant days before unity had seen only the struggle between one empire and another halless i was a single empire when the race conquered it rabotev had been divided but also among competing empires what other way was there to organize intelligent beings the fleetlord could conceive of none molotov said you should know invader from another world that deutschland has no emperor either nor does the united the interpreter went back and forth with him for a little while then explained he means the empire or notempire i should say in the northern part of the small landmass these tosevites are utterly mad atvar burst out he added you need not translate that but they are by the emperor just saying the name was a comfort it must have to do with the worlds beastly climate and excess water yes exalted fleetlord the interpreter said it may be so but what shall i tell the creature here i dont know atvar felt befouled at even contemplating speech with anyone no matter how alien who was involved in impericide a crime whose existence he had not thought of until this moment all at once cratering the whole world of tosev with nuclear weapons looked much more attractive than it had but the fleet had only a limited number of them against the sort of fight the tosevites were expected to put up even a few would have been more than necessary and with tosev s land surface so limited ruining any of it went against his grain he gathered himself tell this molotov that what he and his bandits did before the race arrived will not concern us unless they refuse to yield and thereby force us to take notice of it but if need be we will avenge their murdered emperor thinking of a murdered emperor the fleetlord knew the first pity hed felt for any tosevite if his threat frightened molotov the big ugly gave no sign of it the native truly was as frozen of countenance as anyone of the race he said worldwar in the balance it is true then that when you speak of an empire you mean it in the exact and literal sense of the word with an emperor and a court and all the trappings of the outworn past of course that is true atvar answered how else would we mean it the enlightened people of the sssr have cast the rule of despots onto the ashheap of history molotov said atvar laughed in his flat face the race has flourished under its emperors for a hundred thousand years what do you know of history when you were savages the last time we looked over your miserable pesthole of a planet the fleetlord heartily wished the tosevites had stayed savages too history may be slow but it is certain molotov said stubbornly one day the inevitable revolution will come to your people too when their economic conditions dictate its necessity i think that day will be soon you are imperialists and imperialism is the last phase of capitalism as marx and lenin have shown the interpreter stumbled through the translation of that last sentence and added i have trouble rendering the natives religious terms into our language exalted fleetlord marx and lenin are gods or prophets in the sssr he spoke briefly with molotov then said prophets vyacheslav mikhailovich knew this lenin himself molotov said lenin led the revolution which overthrew our emperor and established the rule of the people and workers of the sssr i am proud to say i assisted in this worthy task atvar stared at the tosevite in disgust he spoke to the interpreter the bandit i have nothing further to say to him if he and his murdeitll will not yield themselves to us their punishment shall only be the harsher the interpreter slowly haltingly turned the crisp words into the mushy native language molotov answered with one word nyet the fleetlord glanced with one quick flick of an eye at the interpreter to see if that meant what he thought it did get him off this ship atvar snapped i am sorry he comes here under truce or i would treat him as he deserves the idea of wantonly slaughtering an emperor even a tosevite emperor gave him an atavistic urge to bite something molotov by choice though the big ugly looked anything but appetizing the doorway out of atvars office hissed open the interpreter pushed off from the chair whose back hed been holding and shot through it molotov followed more awkwardly the graceless garments he wore flapping about him as soon as he was gone atvar shut the door behind him the rather sharp smell of his body remained like a bad memory the fleetlord turned up the air scrubbers to make it go away harry turtledove while it still lingered he phoned kirel when the shiplords face appeared in his screen he said you will come to my quarters immediately it shall be done exalted fleetlord kirel blanked the screen he was as good as his word when he chimed for admittance atvar let him in then closed the door again kirel asked how fare the talks with the tosevites exalted fleetlord less well than i had hoped atvar let his breath hiss out in a long frustrated sigh all their greatest empires still refuse to acknowledge the glory of the emperor he cast his eyes down in the ritual gesture he would not tell kirel what hed learned from molotov not yet his own pain remained too raw to permit it this is altogether a more difficult task than we looked for when we set out from home kirel said the shiplord had tact he forbore to remind atvar that he had urged a surrender demand before actual ground combat got under way after a moment he went on it has been too many generations since the race fought a real war what do you mean atvar tried to hold sudden suspicion from his voice tactful or not kirel coveted the ornate body paint the fleetlord wore atvar continued we are trained for this mission as well as we could possibly be indeed we are kirel agreed gravely which only made atvar more suspicious but the tosevites are not merely trained they are experienced weapon for weapon we far surpass them in craft on the battlefield though they exceed us that has hurt us again and again i know they are worse foes than i expected them to be even after we learned of their abnormal technological growth not only are they wily as you say they are stubborn i was confident they would break when they realized the advantages we enjoyed over them but they keep fighting as best they can it is so kirel said perhaps already being locked in combat among themselves has given them the discipline they need to carry on against us along with being stubborn they are welltrained and skilled we can continue to smash them for a long time yet one of our landcruisers one of our aircraft is worth anywhere from ten to twenty five of theirs but we have only so many munitions if we cannot overawe them we may face difficulties in my coldest dreams i see our last missile wrecking a clumsy tosevite landcruiser while another such landcruiser rolls out of a factory and toward us of themselves atvars clawed hands twitched as if to tear a foe in front of him that is a cold dream you should have left it in your coffin when you awoke we have set down our factory ships here and there you know as we gain raw materials we shall be able to increase our stocks as you say exalted fleetlord kirel answered he did not say worldwar in the balance presumably because he knew atvar knew it as well as himself that the factories even at top output could not produce in a day more than a small part of the supplies the races armed forces used during that day back on home no one had reckoned that the armada would use as much as it had as if to turn away from that unpleasant reflection atvar said for all the bluster the big ugly envoys show they may yet prove tractable the male from the empire called deutschland despite his sickness showed some comprehension of our might all at once he remembered that molotov had said deutschland was a notempire he wondered queasily if its emperor had been murdered too shiplord kirel said deutschland interesting may i use your screen to show you an image a reconnaissance satellite caught for us yesterday atvar opened his hands wide to show assent kirel punched commands in the th emperor hettos data storage system the screen lit to show green land and grayish sea a spot of fire appeared in one corner of the land not far from a clump of big wood buildings the fire suddenly spread and got brighter then went out more slowly one of our bombing runs atvar asked no let me show it to you again this time in slow motion with maximum magnification and image processing the amplified image came up on the screen atvar stared at it then at kirel that is a missile he said accusingly as if it were the shiplords fault he did not want to believe what he had just seen but kirel said yes exalted fleetlord this is a missile or at least was intended to be one since it exploded on its launching pad we are unable to gain estimates of its range or guidance system if any but to judge from e it appears more likely to be strategic than tactical i presume we have eradicated this site atvar said it was done exalted fleetlord kirel agreed the shiplords doleful voice told atvar what he already knew even though this site was gone the race had no sure way of telling how many others the deutsche possessed until a missile roared toward them and swatting missiles out of the sky was an order of magnitude harder than dealing with these slow clumsy tosevite airplanes even the airplanes were hurting his forces now and again because the big uglies kept sending them out no matter how many got knocked down as kirel had said their courage and skill went some of the way toward making up for their poor technology we have to destroy the factories in which these weapons are produced atvar said yes exalted fleetlord kirel answered not atvar noted it shall be done from the air one factory looked like another destroying all the factories in deutschland was a tall order compared to the size of the planet deutschland was a small empire but harry turtledove even small empires atvar was learning covered a lot of ground the other tosevite empires had factories too how close were they to making missiles the fleetlord did his best to look on the bright side their failure gives us the warning we need we shall not be taken unawares even if they succeed in launching missiles at us we had better not be his tone said our preparations are adequate kirel said he did his best to keep on sounding businesslike and military but his voice had an edge to it that atvar understood perfectly well if that was the bright side it was hardly worth looking for the train chuffed to a halt somewhere on the south russian steppe men in field gray sprang down and went efficiently to work they would have been more efficient still karl becker thought if theyd been allowed to proceed in their usual methodical fashion rather than at a dead run but an order from the fhrer was an order from the fhrer at the dead run they went the ground will not be adequately prepared karl michael arenswald said sadly both men were part of the engineering detachment of heavy artillery battalion dora this is true of course becker said with a fatalistic nod but how many shots are we likely to be able to fire before the lizards descend on us they were sixty kilometers from the lizard base with aircraft though especially the ones the lizards flew sixty kilometers passed in the blink of an eye karl becker was a long way from stupid he recognized a suicide mission when he heard one if arenswald did too he kept it to himself we might even get off half a dozen before they figure out whats happening to them oh quatsch said becker a berliner he jabbed an index finger out at his friend you are a dead man i am a dead man we are all dead men the whole battalion of us the only question left unanswered is whether we can take enough lizards with us to make our deaths worth something sooner or later we are all dead men arenswald laughed well give them a surprise before we go at any rate with luck we may manage that becket admitted we he broke off and started coughing the battalion had a chemical unit attached to it to send up smoke and hide it from view from the air while it was setting up for action some of the smoke came from nothing more sophisticated than flaming buckets of motor oil breathing it was probably doing beckers lungs no good but odds were it wouldnt kill him before he died of other causes he coughed again then ignored it men swarmed over the train like ants special tracks had been laid for the heavy artillery battalion four gently curved arcs each always a con worldwar in the balance stant distance from its neighbors the inner two sets of rails were exactly twenty feet apart crews began moving specially built diesel construction cranes to the outer pair of tracks for aid in the upcoming assembly process looking at all the purposeful activity arenswald laughed again not bad considering how understrength we are the smoke was already turning his face sooty a lot of people we dont need considering we wont be here long when heavy artillery battalion dora came into russia it was accompanied by a security unit that included three hundred infantry and secret police with dogs and by a fourhundredman reinforced flak battalion neither the one nor the other mattered now if the lizards chose to come this way german infantry could not hold them off and the flak battalion could not keep their planes away doras only hope of accomplishing anything was going into action before the enemy noticed it was there and considering what dora was becket laughed too arenswald gave him a curious look he ex iii plained keeping dora a secret is like taking an elephant out of its enclo sure at the berlin tiergarten and walking it out of the zoo without the keepers paying you any mind something to that arenswald waved at the everdenser smoke all around but you see karl we have a very large pocket here we have a very large elephant too becket hopped down from the train and walked between the two center tracks the ones that would have to bear doras weight the tracks were laid with closely spaced cross ties to help strengthen the roadbed but the ground was not nearly so stony as ituld have been that would matter a great deal if dora stayed here a cwhile for the few shots it was likely to get off the ground was less xmportant the next few days passed in a berserk blaze of work with sleep snatched in odd moments often under the train to give some protection in case lizard aircraft did come by the manuals said assembling dora needed a week driven by the lash of fear for the fatherland the heavy ar tillery battalion did it in four and a half days the two pieces of the bottom half of the gun carriage went onto the two central tracks and were aligned with each other they rested on twenty rail trucks again to distribute doras mass as widely as possible becket was part of the crew that hydraulically leveled the lower mount the diesel cranes lifted crossbeams onto the lower mount then placed the twopiece upper mount where it belonged the top of the carriage held doras loading assembly and the trunnion supports it was joined to the lower mount by dozens of heavy bolts becket went down one side of the carriage and arenswald down the other checking that every one was in place harry turtledove they met at the rear grinned exchanged drawings then went up the carriage to check each others sides everything had to work once the shooting started things would go wrong soon enough after that assembly went faster once the carriage was together the trunnions the gun cradle the breech and the barrel sections all were raised to their proper positions when dora was at last complete becker admired the monster gun through blowing smoke carriage and all the centimeter cannon was fifty meters long and eleven meters tall its barrel alone was thirty meters long somewhere far above the smoke becker heard a lizard plane whine past his shoulders slumped his hands made futile fists no god he said almost as a threat not now not when we were so close michael arenswald clapped him on the shoulder theyve flown over us before karl it will be all right youll see no bombs fell on them no guided rockets exploded by the gun carriage a crane lifted from a freight car a seventonne shell slowly swung the great projectile more than five meters long and almost a meter thick onto the loading assembly it didnt look like an artillery shell not to becker it looked like something more primeval as if tyrannosaurus rex had been reincarnated as artillery the breech received the shell was closed with a clang that sounded like a factory noise the whole battalion cheered as the gun barrel slowly rose its tip no doubt projecting out of the smoke screen now laughing arenswald said it reminds me of the worlds biggest prick getting hard thats one hell of a hardon all right becker said the barrel reached an angle of almost fortyfive degrees stopped along with everyone else around becker turned away from it covered his ears opened his mouth the blast was like nothing hed ever imagined it sucked all the air out of his lungs shook him like a terrier shaking a rat stunned he staggered stumbled sat down hard on the ground his head roared he wondered if he would ever hear anything through that oceanic clamor again but he could still see sprawled in the dirt beside him michael arenswald gave a big thumbsup a radar technician on the grounded transport ship th emperor sohrheb stared at the screen in front of him hissed in dismay automatic alarms began to yammer even before breltan shrieked missile incoming a warning had come down that the big uglies were playing with missiles but hed never expected to encounter one of their toys so soon he raised both eye turrets to the ceiling in bemusement the big uglies just werent like the race they were always in a hurry their missile was in a hurry too chewing away the distance to the grounded ships breltans jaws opened again this time in amusement so worldwar in the balance the tosevites had discovered missiles had they well and good but they hadnt yet discovered missiles too could be killed no sooner had that thought crossed his mind than the radars showed missiles leaping up to smash the intruder breltan laughed again said youll have to do better than that big uglies a missile as a rule is a flimsy thing no stronger than it has to be any excess weight degrades performance if another missile or even a fragment hurled from an exploding warhead hits it odds are it will be wrecked the shell from dora however had to be armored to withstand the monstrous force that had sent it on its way a missile exploded a couple of meters from it the fragments bounced off its brass sides another missile struck it a glancing blow before exploding and spun away ruined the shell undisturbed flew on breltan watched the radar screen in disbelief mixed with equal measures of horror and fascination it cant do that he said but it could the tosevite missile shrugged off everything the race threw at it and kept coming coming right at breltan emperor save me he whimpered and dove under his seat in the ap proved position for protection against attack from the air the shell landed about ten meters in front of the th emperor sohrheb just under a tonne of its mass was high explosives the rest in a time measured in microseconds turned to knifeedged redhot frag us of every shape and size like all starships of the invasion fleet the th emperor sohrheb drew its primary power from an atomic pile but like most of the ships that landed on tosev it used a fair part of the energy from that pile to electrolyze water into oxygen and the hydrogen that fueled the races air and ground vehicles when it blew it blew skyhigh no one ever found a trace of breltan or his seat the fireball was big enough to be visible across sixty kilometers when it lit up the northern horizon the men of heavy artillery battalion dora screamed with delight loud enough for karl becker to hear them even with his abused ears hit hit hit he shouted and danced in a clumsy circle with michael arenswald now thats what i call an orgasm arenswald yelled the brigadier commanding the heavy artillery battalion climbed up onto the immense gun carriage megaphone in hand back to it he harry turtledove bawled to his capering crew we want to hit them again before they hit us nothing could have been better calculated to send the battalion back to work at full speed unlike a tank gun dora could not traverse a locomotive attached to the front end of the carriage moved forward a few meters pulling nearly tonnes of cannon and mounting along the curved track into its preplanned next firing position even as the flagman brought the engine to a halt right at the mark painted on the track becket was dashing forward to make sure the gun carriage had remained level after the stress of the round and the move the bubbles in the spirit levels at all four corners of the carriage hadnt stirred a millimeter he waved up to the reloading gang all good here the long barrel lifted a degree or two a crane was already lifting the expended shell casing out of the breech clear below the crane operator shouted men scattered the casing thudded to the ground beside the gun carriage that wasnt the way the manuals said to get rid of such casings but it was the fastest way the crane swung to pick up a new shell karl becker kept an eye on his watch twentynine minutes after dora spoke for the first time the great gun spoke again krefak felt the heat from the burning th emperor sohrheb though his missile battery was posted a good ways away from the luckless starship he was heartily glad of that the blast when the ship went up had taken out several units closer to it krefak also felt the heat from his own commander whod waxed eloquent over his failure to shoot down the big uglies missile hed done everything right he knew he had the battery had intercepted the tosevite projectile at least twice tapes from the radars proved it but how was he supposed to say so with only smoking rubble left where a proud starship had stood mere heartbeats before one of the males at a radar screen let out a frightened hiss the eggless creatures launched another one he exclaimed krefak gaped in shocked surprise once was catastrophe enough but twice he couldnt imagine twice he didnt want to imagine twice his voice rose to a mostunofficerlike screech shoot it down roars from the launchers showed him that the computers hadnt waited for his orders he ran to the screen watched the missiles fly as they had before they went straight to the mark exploded and were gone so far as the tosevite missile was concerned they might as well never have been fired it proceeded inexorably on its ordained course below the radar screen that marked its track through the air was another that evaluated the ground target at which it was aimed no he said softly by the emperors launch more missiles the battery has expended all the ones we had on launchers superior worldwar in the balance sir the male answered helplessly more are coming then he too took a look at where the tosevite missile was heading not the th emperor jossano his eye turrets quivered with fright as he stared at krefak yes with most of our nuclear weapons on board to treachery with colonizing this stinking planet we should have sterilized it to be rid of the tosevites once and for all we his voice was lost in the roar of the ex ploding missile and in the much much bigger roar that subsumed it the th emperor jossano went up in the same sort of blast as had taken the th emperor sohrheb the fission and fusion weapons were stored in the very heart of the ship in a strongly armored chamber it did not save them as the th emperor lossano blew to pieces and burned the explosives that triggered the rapid joining of precisely machined chunks of plutonium began going off as if they were rounds of ammunition in a flaming tank the bombs themselves did not go off the triggering charges did not ignite in the precise order or at the precise rate that required but the casings were wrecked the chunks of plutonium warped out of shape and broken and indeed scattered over a goodly part of the tosevite landscape as explosion after explosion wracked the th emperor jossano they were very likely the most valuable pieces of metal on the face of the earth or would have been had any human being known they were there or what to do with them no human being did not then more screams of glee rose from doras firing crew they did not waste motion dancing at the sight of this new flame on the distant horizon but immediately set to work reloading the centimeter cannon wg ichel arenswald bellowed in beckers ear six didnt i tell you et off six weve been lucky twice becker said thats more than i expected right there maybe well go again third times the charm they say for an instant too long he thought the scream in the sky was part of the way his head rang after the second detonation of the monster gun the locomotive had just finished hauling dora to its next marked firing position becket started over to the gun carriage to see if had stayed level yet again the first bomb blast a few meters behind him hurled him facefirst into that great mountain of metal he felt things break his nose a cheekbone several ribs a hip he opened his mouth to scream another bomb went off this one even closer jens larssens apartment lay a few blocks west of the union stockyards the neighborhood wasnt much but hed still been surprised at how he got the place the incessant chicago wind came from the west cheap harry turtledove that day a couple of days later it started blowing off lake michigan and he understood but it was too late by then hed already signed the lease the wind blew off the lake the day his wife barbara got into town too he still remembered the way her eyes got wide she put the smell into one raised eyebrow and four words essence of terrified cow the wind was blowing off the lake tonight but larssen hardly noticed the rich manure stink he could smell his own fear and barbaras lizard planes were over chicago again hed listened to edward r murrow on crackling shortwave from england listened to that deep raspy voice and its trademark opening this is london such was murrows magic that hed imagined he understood what being a londoner in the blitz was like now he knew better more planes screeched past more bombs fell some by the way the windows rattled quite close by he clung to barbara and she to him under the kitchen table chicago had no shelters hitting the stockyards again she said into his ear he nodded anything with rails the lizards were inhumanly methodical about pasting transportation hubs and chicago was nothing else but it was also close to the landing zone theyd carved out for themselves in downstate illinois missouri and kentucky thanks to both those things the town was taking a heavy pounding only a couple of candles lit the onebedroom apartment their light did not get past the blankets tacked up to serve as blackout curtains the blankets would not have contained electric lights but the power had been off more often than it was on the past few days it made larssen glad for once that he had only an oldfashioned icebox not a fancy electric refrigerator as long as the ice man kept coming around as long as the ice man still had ice his food would stay fresh antiaircraft guns pitifully few and pitifully ineffective added their barks to the cacophony shrapnel pattered down on rooftops like hot metal hail airraid sirens wailed lost souls in the night after a while larssen noticed he heard no more lizard planes though the rest of the fireworks display continued as gunners blazed away at their imaginations i think its over he said this time barbara answered he felt her tremble in his arms for that matter he felt pretty shaky himself one by one sirens fell silent his wife went on i dont know how much more of this i can handle like a tightstretched wire her voice vibrated with hidden stress the english stuck it out he said remembering murrow again god knows how she said i dont she squeezed him even tighter than she had when the bombs were falling being a thoroughly rational young man he opened his mouth to explain to her how bad a beating london had taken and for how long and how the lizards seemed for the moment anyhow to be much more selec i worldwar in the balance tive than the nazis about hitting civilian targets but however thoroughly rational he was the springy firmness of her body locked against his reminded him that he was young instead of explaining he kissed her her mouth came open against his she moaned a little deep in her throat whether from fear or desire or both commingled he never knew she pressed the warm palm of her hand against his hair he rolled on top of her careful even then not to knock his head on the underside of the table when at last their kiss broke he whispered shall we go in the bedroom no she said startling him then she giggled lets do it right here on the floor itll remind me of those times in the backseat of your old chevy all right he said by then too eager to care much where he shifted his weight raise up just a little when she moved he undid the buttons on the back of her blouse and unhooked her bra with one hand he hadnt tried that since they were married but the ease with which he accomplished it said his hand remembered the backseat of the old chevy too he tossed the cotton blouse and bra aside presently he said lift up again he slowly slid her panties down her legs instead of pulling off her skirt he hiked it up that made her laugh again she kissed him long and slow his hands wandered where they would so did hers unbuckling his belt opening his trouser button and with several delicious pauses lowering his zipper he yanked down his pants and jockey shorts just far enough they were both laughing by then laughing still he plunged into her leaving behind for a little while the terror outside the blackedout apartment i should have taken off my shirt he said when they were through w its all sweaty it what about me barbara brought both hands up to his chest made as if to push him vertically away from her he raised up on his elbows and knees and this time did catch the back of his head on the bottom of the kitchen table hard enough to see stars he swore first in english then in the fragments of norwegian hed picked up from his grandfather barbara whose maiden name was baker and who had a couple of severaltimesgreatgrandfathers whod fought in the revolution always thought that was the funniest thing in the world youre in no position to laugh now wench he said and tickled her conveniently bare ribs the linoleum made moist squelching noises under her backside as she tried to wriggle away that set him laughing too he grabbed her they might have begun again but the telephone chose that moment to ring larssen jerked up in surprise he hadnt thought the phone was working and gave himself another crack in the head this time he started harry turtledove out swearing in norwegian trousers flopping around his ankles he hobbled into the bedroom hello he growled annoyed as if it were the callers fault hed knocked his brains loose that is you lens you are all right you and barbara the accented voice on the other end of the line threw ice water on his steam yes dr fermi he said and made a hasty grab for his pants of course fermi could not see him but he was embarrassed even to be talking to the italian physicista dignified man if ever there was one with trousers at halfmast we came through safe again thank you safe fermi echoed bitterly this is a word without meaning in the world today i thought it had one when laura and i came here four years ago but i am wrong but never mind that here is the reason i call szilard says and he is right we must all meet tomorrow and tomorrow early seven oclock he would say six if he could ill be there larssen promised whats up the lizards they are moving toward chicago the words seemed to hang on the wire but they cant lens said though he knew perfectly well they could what the devil was there to stop them fermi understood what he meant you are right they must not if they come here everything we do since we begin is lost too much time lost time we have not to waste even against germany to say nothing of these creatures germany larssen kept his voice flat hed been relieved past all measure when the atomic bomb that exploded above chicago proved not to have a swastika painted on its casing he once more had no idea how far along the nazis were on their own bomb program it would be a hell of a note though for humanity to have to depend on them alone for a weapon with which to do the lizards some real damage he wondered if he would sooner see earth conquered than adolf hitler its savior lust maybe he thought on the line fermi cleared his throat that brought larssen back to the hereandnow ill be there he said again good fermi said i go then many others to call while phones are working i see you in the morning he hung up without saying goodbye larssen sat down on the bed thinking hard his pants slid back down to his ankles he didnt notice his wife walked into the bedroom she carried a candle to light her way outside fireengine sirens rang through the night as their crews fought to douse the fires the lizards had started whats up barbara asked she tossed her blouse and underwear into the wickerwork laundry hamper big meeting tomorrow he answered then repeated fermis grim flews thats not good she said she had no real notion of what he was worldwar in the balance working on under stagg field shed been studying medieval english literature when they met at berkeley but she knew the project was important she asked how are we going to stop them you come up with the answer to that one and you win the sixtyfour dollars she smiled at that then set the candle in a silver stick a wedding present larssen had never thought theyd use on top of the dresser with both hands she took off her skirt and threw it at the hamper she glanced over to him you still havent pulled up your pants i did so he said then had to add lamely they must have fallen down again well shall i put on a nightgown now or not he considered the meeting in the morning was early but if he poured down enough coffee hed get through it okay and barbara naked in the candlelight made him want to forget tomorrow anyhow not he said good this time take your shirt off too nothing was running the next morning when larssen headed for the university of chicago not the buses not the elevated nothing only a few cars crawled cautiously along the street inhibited not only by the gas shortage but also now by the risk of rubble a rifletoting airraid warden in a britishstyle tin hat and a civil defense armband nodded to jens as he walked past the wardens had flowered like weeds after a drought in the panicky weeks following pearl harbor then disappeared almost as quickly when their services proved unnecessary but these days they really were needed this one looked as blnn he hadnt slept in a month his face was covered with graying stub unlit cigarette dangled from the corner of his mouth but he was going on as best he could like everyone else an hours brisk walk got larssen onto the university campus while he supposed that was good for him he also gave some serious thought to trying to get his hands on a bicycle the sooner the better he decided before everyone got the same idea and the price went skyhigh he didnt have two hours to spare every day going back and forth to work eckhart hall stood on the southeast corner of the quadrangle it was a new building having opened in new or not however it didnt boast air conditioning the windows to the commons room were open allowing fresh warm muggy air to replace the stale warm muggy air lready inside in deference to the hour someone had put out a big pot of coffee and a tray of sweet rolls on a table set under those windows larssen made a beeline for that table poured himself a paper cup of coffee gulped it down hot and black then grabbed a roll and got a second cup with the caffeine jolt kicking in he drank this one more slowly harry turtledove but as he carried the coffee and sweet roll to a chair he wondered how long such things would continue to exist in chicago the coffee was imported of course and so were some of the ingredients in the roll the cinnamon certainly how long could commerce continue at even its wartime level with lizard bases scattered over the united states like growing tumors he nodded to enrico fermi one of the two or three men who had beaten him to the meeting the italian physicist was wiping his mouth on a paper napkin the pulp from which it was made was yet another import larssen thought wed best enjoy life while we can the younger man said and explained his reasoning fermi nodded his receding hairline and oval face made him the literal embodiment of the word egghead and also made him look older than his fortyone years his smile now was sweet and rather sad my world has already turned upside down once of late another time seems somehow less distressing and i doubt the lizards concern themselves over my wifes religion brought up comfortably lutheran in a land where one could fairly comfortably be anything jens had never much concerned himself with religion but laura fermi had been a jew in fascist italy the italians were not rabid on the subject like the germans but they had made matters sticky enough for the fermis to be glad to get out i wonder how far along this trail the axis would be if hitler only had the sense to leave some of his brightest people alone and let them work for him larssen said i am not to any great degree a political man but it has always seemed to me that fascism and sense do not mingle fermi said he raised his voice to address a newcomer is this not so leo leo szilard was short and stocky and wore a suit with padded shoulders which emphasized the fact what do you say enrico he asked when fermi repeated himself he screwed up his broad fleshy face in thought before answering authoritarianism in any form makes for bad science i believe for its postulates are not rational the nazis are bad for this yes but anyone who thinks the american government and hence its projects like our socalled metallurgical laboratory here free of such preconceived idiocy is himself an idiot larssen nodded vehemently at that if washington had really believed in what the met lab was doing it would have poured in three times the research money and support from the day einstein first suggested the violent release of atomic energy was possible nodding also helped jens keep a straight face szilard was both brilliant and cultured and expressed himself so but the hungarian scientists accent never failed to remind karssen of bela kugosis in dracula he wondered if szilard had ever seen the movie but lacked the nerve to ask worldwar in the balance more people drifted in by ones and twos szilard looked pointedly at his watch every few minutes his attitude declared that being bombarded by creatures from another planet wasnt a good enough excuse for missing an important meeting finally at about twentyfive after seven he decided he could wait no more he said loudly we have a question to face today in light of the lizards move on chicago what is our proper course shall we abandon our research here and seek some new and safer place to continue it accepting all the loss of time and effort and probably also of material this would entail or shall we seek to persuade the government to defend this city with everything in its power for our sakb knowing the army may well fail and the lizards succeed here as they have so many other places discussion gentlemen gerald sebring said god knows i want an excuse to get out of chicago that occasioned general laughter sebring had been planning to go do some research back in berkeley in early june and incidentally to marry another physicists secretary while he was out there the arrival of the lizards changed his plans as it did so many others come to that laura fermi was still back in new york sebring waited for the chuckles to die down before he went on everything were doing here though feels like its right on the point of coming to fruition isnt that so people wed lose a year maybe more if we had to pull up stakes now i dont think we can afford it i dont think the world can afford it several people nodded larssen stuck up a hand leo szilard saw him aimed a stubby forefinger in his direction he said strikes me this dolt have to be an eitheror proposition we can go on with a lot of our w here at the same time as we get ready to pull out as fast as possible if we have to he found he had trouble baldly saying if the lizards take chicago that is sensible and practical for some of our projects szilard agreed the chemical extraction of plutonium for instance though it requires the most delicate balances can proceed elsewhere not least because we have as yet very little plutonium to extract other lines of research however the pile you are assembling among them tearing it down now would be most unfortunate the more so if that proves unnecessary fermi said our k factor on this one should be above at least perhaps as high as to break off work just when we are at last on the point of achieving a sustained chain reaction that would be very bad his wide mobile mouth twisted to show just how bad he thought it would be besides sebring said where the heck are we likely to stay safe from the lizards anyhow he was far from a handsome man with a long harry turtledove face heavy eyebrows and buck teeth but as usual spoke forcefully and seriously szilard said are we agreed then that while as jens says we take what precautions we can we ought to stay here in chicago as long as that remains possible no one spoke szilard clicked his tongue between his teeth when he continued he sounded angry we are not authoritarians here anyone who thinks leaving wiser tell us why this is so persuade us if you can if you prove right you will have done us great service arthur compton who was in charge of the metallurgical laboratory said i think sebring put it best leo where can we run that the lizards will not follow again no one disagreed that was not because compton headed the project nor because of his formidable physical presence he was tall and lean and sternly handsome and looked more like a barrymore than the nobel prizewinning physicist he was but the rest of the talented crew in the commons room were far too independent to follow a leader simply because he was the leader here though they had all reached the same conclusion szilard saw that he said if it is decided then that chicago must be held we must convince the army of the importance of this as well they will fight to hold chicago anyhow compton said it is the hinge upon which the united states pivots and they know it it is more important than that fermi said quietly with what we do here chicago is the hinge on which the world pivots and the army it does not know that we must send someone to tell them we must send some two szilard said and all at once larssen was certain he and fermi had planned their strategy together ahead of time we must send two and separately in case one meets with misfortune along the way the war is here among us now this can happen sure enough fermi spoke up again as if with the next line of dialogue in an ancient greek play we should send also nativeborn americans officers are more likely to hear them with attention than some foreigner some enemy alien who is not fully to be trusted even now when the lizards true aliens have come larssen was nodding impressed by fermis logic at the same time as he regretted the truths that underlay it when gerald sebring raised a hand and said ill go so will i larssen heard himself saying he blinked in surprise he hadnt known he was going to volunteer until the words were out of his mouth but speaking up turned out to make sense even to him walt zinn can ride herd on the gang of hooligans working on the pile zinn nodded as long as i can keep em out of jail ill get along all right he gave away his canadian origins by saying oat for out then it is settled szilard rubbed his hands in satisfaction fermi worldwar in the balance also looked pleased szilard went on you will leave as soon as possible one of you will go by car larssen that will be you i think gerald you will take the train i hope both of you get to washington safe and sound and i hope washington will still be in human hands when you arrive that sent a nasty chill through larssen he hadnt imagined lizards marching up pennsylvania avenue past the white house but if they could move on chicago they could surely move on washington he wondered if the invaders from another world had figured out it was the capital of the united states looking at szilards smug expression he realized the hungarian had gotten exactly what he wanted for all his devotion to democracy szilard had maneuvered the meeting like a chicago wardheeler larssen chuckled well if that wasnt democracy what was it a question better left unanswered in chicago perhaps the chuckle turned into a guffaw that larssen fortunately managed to strangle before it got loose if you played with the letters in dr szilards name just a little larssen wondered if szilard himself had noticed and how one said lizard in magyar i can report one riddle solved exalted fleetlord kirel said that will be a pleasant novelty atvar snapped the longer he wrestled with tosev the testier he became but he could not afford to irk kirel excessively all bowed to the emperor yes but those below him competed even officers cabals were not unknown and so atvar softened his tone what new things have you learned of the big uglies then our technicians have discovered why the highburst nuclear weapons of our initial bombardment failed to completely disrupt their radio communications kirel beckoned to one of those technicians who floated up with a captured tosevite radio set atvar opened his jaws in mocking laughter big and ugly and clumsy just like the tosevites themselves he said you speak truth exalted fleetlord the technician said also clumsy and primitive the electronics are not even solidstate as ours have been through almost all our recorded history the tosevites use as clumsy makeshifts these large vacuumfilled tubes here he pulled off the back plate of the set to point to the parts he meant they are bulky as you see exalted fleetlord and the amount of waste heat they produce is appalling they are most inefficient but exactly because they are so large and so so gross if i may use an imprecise word they are much less susceptible to electromagnetic pulse than unshielded integrated circuits would be thank you techniciansecond atvar said reading the males body paint for his rank your data are valuable service to the emperor hearing himself dismissed the technician cast down his eyes in salute to the harry turtledove sovereign then took back the radio set and pushed himself away from the fleetlords presence you see exalted fleetlord the tosevites communications system retained its utility only because it is so primitive kirel said their radios are primitive and that ends up being useful to them they dont yet know how to make decent missiles so they fling outsized artillery shells instead and that ends up being useful now they are trying to build missiles where will it end shiplord in our victory kirel said stoutly atvar gave him a grateful look maybe the only reason kirel was acting so loyally was that he did not want command of what looked like an effort that promised more in the way of trouble than glory at the moment atvar didnt care just having someone to whom he could complain worked wonders and complain he did when the tosevites arent primitive they hurt us too by the memories of all the ancient emperors who would have been mad enough to imagine making boats big enough to put airplanes on them who but the big uglies i mean home rabotev and halless i all had free water yes but in the form of rivers and ponds and lakes rabotev even had a couple of smallish seas none of them was troubled by the vast worldbestriding oceans of tosev and neither the race the rabotevs nor the hallessi used their waters to anything like the extent the big uglies did having planes appear out of nowhere as when they raided the base on the chinese coast was a rude surprise so were the ships with big guns that pounded bases anywhere near water kirel waggled his fingers in a shrug now that we know they fight from the sea we can sink their big boats and faster than they can hope to build them the boats arent exactly inconspicuous either that problem will go away and soon may it be so but once atvar got to worrying out loud he wasnt about to let himself be mollified so easily these missiles theyre trying to build how are we supposed to shoot them all down we came here intending to fight savages whose only missiles came from bows and do you know what the latest is tell me exalted fleetlord kirel said in the tones of a male who understands hed better listen sympathetically if he knows whats good for him in the past few days for the first time jet planes rose against our aircraft from both deutschland and britain theyre still badly inferior to ours especially the britainish ones but not nearly so much so as the primitive crates with revolving airfoils weve been facing i hadnt heard that exalted fleetlord now atvar really had kirels attention again after that moment of surprise the shiplord continued worldwar in the balance wait a bit deutschland and britain were enemies to each other before we landed am i right yes yes britain and the usa and the sssr and china against deutschland and italia britain and the usa and china against nippon but not for some eggless reason nippon against the sssr if the tosevites didnt keep coming up with new things to throw at us id swear on the emperors name they were all mad wait a bit kirel repeated if deutschland and britain were foes until we landed its not likely theyd share jet plane technology is it i wouldnt think so but who can tell for certain what the big uglies would do maybe its having so many different empires on so little land that makes them the way they are the scrambled convoluted way the tosevites played the game of politics made even the maneuvers of the imperial court tame by comparison dealing with any one tosevite official made atvar feel out of his league as for playing them off against one another as the manuals suggested he counted himself lucky that they werent exploiting him but kirel was still worrying over the jets exalted fleetlord if they dont share technology that means they can only have each developed it independently they are like a bad virus fleetlord they mutate not physically but technically which is worse too fast maybe faster than we can handle perhaps we should sterilize the planet of them the fleetlord turned both eye sockets to bear on his subordinate this from the male who had urged giving the big uglies a chance to surrender before the race choked off their communications or rather failed to choke off their communications you think they represent so great a dangerto us shiplord do exalted fleetlord we are at a high level and have been steady th for ages they are lower but rising quickly we must smash them down while we still can if only the filthy creatures hadnt hit the th emperor jossano atvar said mournfully if only we hadnt kept so many of our bombs aboard one ship he added mentally but no he was not to blame for that ancient doctrine ordained entrusting large stores of nuclear weapons only to the most reliable shiplords as an officer of the race should hed followed that ancient doctrine no one could possibly think less of him for that except that in so doing hed suffered a disaster the way ancient doctrine corroded whenever it touched matters tosevite worried him even more than the fighting down on the surface of tosev we still have some of the devices left kirel persisted maybe the big uglies will be more willing to submit if they see what we can do to their cities atvar threw back his head in disagreement we do not destroy the world toward which a settler fleet is already traveling that was what an harry turtledove cient doctrine said doctrine based on the conquests of rabotevs and hallessi exalted fleetlord tosev appears to me to be dissimilar to our previous campaigns kirel said pressing his superior up to the edge of politeness the tosevites have a greater capacity to resist than did the other subject races and so seem to require harsher measures the deutsche in particular exalted fleetlord the cannon that wrecked the th emperor jossano was theirs even if it was on the land of the sssr and the missile the big uglies tried to launch and now you tell me they fly jet planes as well no atvar said ancient doctrine declared that new planets were not to be spoiled by radioactivity which was apt to linger long after the war of subjugation ended after all the race would be living here in perpetuity integrating tosev into the fabric of the empire and tosev didnt have that much land to begin with but it did have hideously troublesome natives just moments before the fleetlord had thought how poorly ancient doctrine worked when dealing with the big uglies moving away from it frightened him as hed never been frightened before as if he were cut off from the emperors favor adrift and alone yet would he deserve the emperors favor if he led the race to more disasters wait shiplord i have changed my mind he told kirel who had begun to turn away go ahead and use one on what is the name of the place berlin exalted fleetlord kirel answered it shall be done iparis george bagnall said wearily i was here on holiday a couple of years before the war started its not the same nothings the same as it was before the war started ken embry said hell nothings the same as it was before the lizards came and that was bare weeks ago a good thing too else wed all be kriegies by now sitting behind barbed wire and waiting for our next red cross packages all whyte said the navigator lifted a leg and shook his tired foot then laughed wryly if we were kriegies with red cross packages wed likely see better grub than weve had on the way up here right on both counts bagnall said the german occupiers of northern and central france could have swept up the english fliers a dozen times over on their hike to paris but hadnt bothered some in fact child the men they might have shot under other circumstances french pўmts shared what they had with the englishmen but what they had was mostly potatoes and greens their rations made the ones back home sybaritic by comparison a true testimonial to how meager they were ken embry said talk about the lizards whodve dreamt hed be sorry to hear berlin was smashed to flinders the french papers still germandominated had screamed of nothing else the past few days shrieked about the fireball that consumed the city wailed over unbelievable devastation wept at the hundreds of thousands reported dead bagnall understood most of what the sheets proclaimed his french was better than hed giddily claimed in the moment of relief after the lanc got down safe now he said id not have shed a tear if theyd managed to toast hitler along with everyone else nor i embry agreed id not have minded carrying one of those bloody big bombs when we flew over cologne either so long as it was us or the nazis but the lizards complicate everything too right they do bagnall cast a wary eye to the sky as if to watch for a lizard plane not that seeing one would do any good if it had on harry turtledove board a superbomb like the one that hit berlin if the papers were to be believed always a risky business in france and all the more so after one single bomb had leveled an area miles across you couldnt even run from a bomb like that let alone hide what point in watching the skies then as bagnall brought his gaze back to earth it settled on a faded tattered propaganda poster from the vichy government though it had never held sway in the germanoccupied parts of france this was not the first such poster hed seen in big tricolor letters it proclaimed labourage et pturage sont les deux mamelles de la france underneath someone had neatly chalked a comment merde the flight engineer ignored the editorial remark he stared in wonder and fascination at the slogan marveling that anyone could have written it in the first place let alone committed it to print and spread it broadcast but there it was in letters four inches high all tricked out and made to look patriotic quite unable to help himself he broke out in great braying guffaws whats so bleeding funny asked joe simpkin the lancs rear gunner bagnall still could not speak he simply pointed at the vichy poster their attention drawn to it embry and alf whyte started laughing too simpkin didnt he really had no french though hed picked up a few words not all of them printable since the bomber had to land the edifying sentiment of the poster still remained beyond him however he scowled and asked whats it say something like work and farming are frances two tits bagnall answered between wheezes translating it into english set him off again and everyone else with him a thin frenchman in a ragged jacket and a black beret frowned at the spectacle of seven obvious foreigners falling to pieces in the middle of the street because there were seven of them he didnt do anything more than frown tits is it simpkin said he was from gloucester and spoke with a western accent france has better titsn those and legs too as if to prove him right a pretty girl rode by on a rattling bicycle that was probably older than she was her skirt showed a lot of tanned leg bagnall could hear every click of the bicycle chain as it traveled over the sprocket he could hear other bicycles around the corner and out of sight he could hear horses hooves and the rattle of iron tyres on cobblestones as a horsedrawn wagon made its slow way along the street he could hear someone working a handpowered sewing machine and an old woman calling her cat whose name was claude and who was she said a very naughty fellow he felt as though he could hear the whole city paris isnt paris without a horde of motorcars all trying to run you down at once he said worldwar in the balance no but its cleaner than it used to be because the cars are gone embry said smell how fresh the air is we might as well still be out in the country last time i was here the petrol fumes were bad as london no petrol fumes to worry about now bagnall agreed no petrol to worry about either the jerries have taken it all for their planes and tanks footsteps from around the corner told of someone approaching the footsteps rang as if even the fellows shoes were imbued with a sense of his importance when he appeared a few seconds later he proved better fed and much better dressed than most of the frenchmen bagnall had seen something gleamed silver on his lapel as he drew near bagnall saw what it was a little pin in the shape of a doubleheaded ax the francisque symbol of vichy and collaboration the man started to walk on by but the sight of men in unfamiliar uniforms even ones as dirty and ragged as those of the lancs crew had become roused his curiosity pardonnezmoi messieurs mais stesvous allemands he asked then switched languages sind she deutsche non monsieur nous sommes anglais bagnall answered the frenchmans eyes opened wide of itself his left hand twitched toward that lapel pin as if to hide the francisque bagnall wondered what was going through his head how he felt having accommodated himself to the german yoke on meeting men from a country which refused to wear it he spoke english too all the world today is a part of humanity with a nod he edged past the englishmen and hurried away looking back orver his shoulder slimy beggar alf whyte muttered all the world my left one id like to give him my boot up his backside so would i bagnall said but the devil of it is hes right or how long dyou think wed last here traipsing about in raf blue itd be a stalag for us faster than you can say hands up maybe so but i dont much care to count blighters like that as part of humanity whyte said if it was lizards in paris hed be sucking up to them instead of the germans the navigator didnt bother keeping his voice down the frenchman jerked as if stung by a bee and walked even faster now his footfalls sounded like those of a mere mortal not of one who was lord of all he surveyed ken embry clicked his tongue between his teeth we should count our blessings we havent had to live under jerrys thumb the last two years i daresay if hitler had invaded and won hed have found his share of english collaborators and plenty more whod do what they had to to stay alive harry turtledove i dont mind the second sort bagnall said you have to live and that means you have to get on about your job and all but im damned if i can see any of us sporting a silver jackboot or whatever the mosley maniacs use theres a difference between getting along and sucking up nobody makes you wear the francisque you do it because you want i o the rest of the aircrew nodded they walked deeper into paris the nearly empty streets were not all that made it feel strange to bagnall when hed been here before the depression still held sway one of the things hed never forgotten was the spectacle of men many of them well dressed suddenly stooping to pluck a cigarette butt out of the gutter but welldressed men in london were doing the same thing then somehow the frenchmen managed to invest even scrounging with panache thats whats gone bagnall exclaimed as pleased at his discovery as if he were a physicist playing with radium his comrades turned to look at him he went on what did we always used to think of when we thought of paris the foliesbergere embry answered at once whats her name the negro wench josephine baker prancing about wearing a few bananas and damn all else all the girls behind her wearing even less the orchestra sawing away down in the pit and no one paying it any mind sounds good to me joe simpkin said how do we get there from here not without effort bagnall ignored the gunners interruption not quite what i meant ken but close enough paris stood for good times gay paree and all that you always had the feeling everybody who lived here knew how to enjoy himself better than you did lord knows whether it was really true but you always thought so you dont now hard to be gay when youre hungry and occupied alf whyte said occupied yes ken embry said softly straighten up lads here comes jerry himself lets look like soldiers for him shall we the german infantry of propaganda photographs looked more machined than born of man and woman all lines and angles all motions completely identical hard expressionless faces under coalscuttle helmets that added a final intimidating touch the squad ambling up the street toward the aircrew fell a good ways short of herr gbbels ideal a couple of them were fat one wore a mustache that had more gray than brown in it several had the top buttons of their tunics undone something a gbbels soldier would sooner have been shot than imagine some were missing buttons altogether most had boots that wanted polishing thirdline troops bagnall realized maybe fourth the real german army the past year was locked in battle with the russians or grinding now forward now back across the sahara beaten france got the dregs of german manpower bagnall wondered how happy these occupation war worldwar in the balance riors were at the prospect of holding back the lizards a worse enemy than the red army ever dreamed of being he also wondered rather more to the point if the tacit anglogerman truce held on the ground as well as in the air the germans up ahead might be overage and overweight but they all carried mauser rifles which made the aircrews pistols seem like toys by comparison the feldwebel in charge of the german squad owned a belly that made him look as if he were in a family way he held up a hand to rein in his men then approached the british fliers alone he had three chins and his eyes were pouchy but they were also very shrewd bagnall would not have wanted to sit down at a card table with him sprechen she deutsch the sergeant asked the englishmen looked at one another they all shook their heads ken embry asked do any of your men speak english or parlezvous fr an ўais the feldwebei shook his head his flabby flesh wobbled but as bagnall had suspected he was a resourceful fellow he went back to his squad growled at his men they hurried into shops on the boulevard in less than a minute one of the soldiers emerged with a thin frightenedlooking frenchman whose enormous ears looked ready to sail him away on the slightest breeze that however was not why the soldier had grabbed him he proved to speak not only french but also fluent german the feldwebel spoke through him there is a soldatenheim a military canteen at the cafe wepler place clichy that is where english fliers are being dealt with you us will please come with re we prisoners bagnall asked the frenchman relayed the question to the german sergeant he was more at ease now that he saw he was to serve as interpreter rather than say hostage the sergeant answered no you are not prisoners you are guests but this is not your country and you will come with us it did not sound like a request in english embry said shall i point out its not his bloody country either with the rest of the aircrew bagnall considered that the germans had his comrades outnumbered and outgunned no one said anything the pilot sighed and returned to french tell the sergeant we will go with him gut gut the feldwebel said expansively cradling that vast belly of his as if it were indeed a child he also ordered the frenchman to come along so he could keep on interpreting the fellow cast a longing glance back at his little luggage store but had no choice save to obey it was a long walk the soldatenheim lay on the right bank of the seine north and east of the arc de triomphe the germans and the english had both respected the monuments of paris the lizards knew no such compunctions a chunk had been torn out of the arc like a cavity in harry turtledove a rotting tooth the eiffel tower still stood but bagnall wondered how many days more it would dominate the paris skyline in the end though what lay longest in the flight engineers memory about the journey to the canteen was a small thing an old man with a bushy white mustache walking slowly along the street at first glance he looked like marshal petain or anyones favorite grandfather he carried a stick and wore a homburg and an elegant doublebreasted pinstripe suit with knifesharp creases on the left breast pocket of that suit was sewn a yellow sixpointed star with one word juif bagnall looked from the old jew with his badge of shame to the fat feldwebel to the french interpreter he opened his mouth then closed it again what could he possibly say that would not make matters worse both for himself and all too likely for the jew as well he found nothing but silence was bitter as wormwood to him german military signs white wooden arrows with angular black letters had sprouted like mushrooms on every paris streetcorner the british aircrew probably could have found the military canteen through them without an escort but bagnall supposed he could not blame the sergeant for taking charge of them if not exactly enemies they were not exactly friends either the canteen had a big sign again white on black that announced what it was soldatenheim kommandantur grossparis on another panel of the sign was a black cross in a circle men in field gray came in and out below those who recognized the fliers raf uniforms stopped to stare no one did anything more than stare for which bagnall was duly grateful the feldwebel turned the interpreter loose just outside the doorway without even a tip the fellow hadnt translated more than half a dozen sentences most of them banal in the hour and a half it had taken to get here now he faced an equally long walk back but he left without a backward glance or a word of complaint as if escaping without trouble was payment enough for a man in his shoes perhaps it was not far inside the entrance a table with a sign lettered in both german and english had been set up the english section read for british mil itary seeking repatriation from france behind the table sat an officer with steelrimmed spectacles the single gold pip on his embroidered shoulder straps proclaimed him a lieutenant colonel the german sergeant saluted spoke for a couple of minutes in his own language the officer nodded asked a few questions nodded again dismissed the feldwebel with a few offhand words then he turned to the englishmen tell me how you came to paris gentlemen his english was precise and almost accentfree i am lieutenantcolonel maximilian hcker if knowing my name puts you more at ease as pilot ken embry spoke for the aircrew he told the tale of the attack on the lizard installation in considerable detail though bagnall noted worldwar in the balance that he did not name the base from which the lancaster had set out if hcker also noted that and he probably did he looked sharp as all getout he let it pass his gray eyes widened slightly when embry described the forced landing on the french road you were very fortunate flight lieutenant and no doubt very skillful as well thank you sir embry took up the tale again omitting the names of the frenchmen who had helped the aircrew along the way theyd learned only a couple of those and then just christian names even so embry did not mention them again hcker declined to press him the pilot finished then your sergeant found us sir and brought us here by the sign in front of you you dont intend to hold us prisoner so i hope youll not take it amiss if i ask you how we go about getting home by no means the german officers smile did not quite reach his eyes or maybe it was a trick of the light reflecting off his spectacle lenses he sounded affable enough as he continued we can put you on a train for calais this evening god and the lizards permitting you will be on british soil tomorrow it cant be as simple as that bagnall blurted after going on three years of war with the nazis and after seeing the old jew wearing the yellow star he was not inclined to take anything german on trust very nearly hcker plucked seven copies of a form off the table in front of him gave them to embry to pass out to his crew you have but to sign this and we shall send you on your way the form hastily printed on the cheapest of paper was headed parole it had parallel columns of text one german the other english the engliersion was florid legalese made worse by some remaining germanic wolorder but what it boiled down to was a promise not to fight ger many so long as either london or no not berlin but the country of which it had been the capital remained at war with the lizards what happens if we dont sign it bagnall asked if the smile had got to lieutenantcolonel hckers eyes it vanished from them now then you will also go on a train this evening but not one bound for calais embry said what happens if we do sign and then end up flying against you anyhow under those circumstances you would be welladvised to avoid capture hckers face was too round and mild to make him fit the film cliche of a german officer he seemed more bavarian peasant than prussian aristocrat but he packed enough menace into his voice for any three cinematic huns have you received any communication from the raf or his majestys government permitting us to sign such a document embry asked harry turtledove i have not hcker said formally we are still at war i give you my word of honor however that i have learned of no punishment given to any who have so signed please be so good as to put that assurance in writing for us to present to our superiors if it should prove false we shall consider ourselves at liberty to deem our paroles null and void nor should sanctions be applied against us in the event we are captured in arms against your country jolly good ken bagnall whispered admiringly hcker inked a pen wrote rapidly on the back of another parole form he handed it to the pilot i trust this meets with your approval flight lieutenant he pronounced it leftenant as a native englishman would have embry read what he had written before he replied he passed it to bagnall hckers script unlike his speech was distinctly germanic the flight engineer had to puzzle it out word by word but it seemed to set forth what embry had demanded bagnall gave it to alf whyte the german lieutenantcolonel waited patiently until the whole lancaster crew had read it well gentlemen he asked when embry had it back the pilot glanced from one flier to the next no one said anything embry sighed turned back to hcker give me the bloody pen he signed his parole with a few slashing strokes here hcker raised an eyebrow you are not pleased with this arrangement no im not pleased embry said if it werent for the lizards wed be fighting each other but theyre here so what can i do believe me flight lieutenant my feelings are the same in every particular the german answered i had a sister in berlin however and two nieces so i shall adjourn my quarrel with you for the time being perhaps we shall take it up again at a more auspicious moment cventry embry said the lieutenantcolonel answered beside berlin englinder coventry is as a toddlers scraped knee hcker and embry locked eyes with each other for most of a minute bagnall took the pen wrote his name on his parole form one enemy at a time he said the rest of the aircrew also signed theirs but even as hcker called for an escort to take the englishmen to the train station bagnall wondered how many nieces the old jew with the yellow star had and how they were faring a squadron of devils tramped down the main street of the prison camp like everyone else who saw them liu han bowed low no one worldwar in the balance knew what would happen if the little scaled devils were denied all the outward trappings of respect their captives could give no one least of all liu hah wanted to find out when the devils were gone a man came up to liu han and said something she shook her head i am sorry but i do not understand your dialect she said he must not have been able to follow hers either for he grinned spread his hands and walked away she sighed hardly anyone here spoke her dialect save the few villagers taken with her the scaly devils threw people from all over china together in their camps they either did not know or did not care about the differences among them for the educated few those who could read and write the lack of a common dialect mattered little they spoke together with brush and paper since they all used the same characters such was the ignorance of the demons that they had even put japanese in the camp no japanese were left any more some had slain themselves in despair at being captured those whose despair was less deep died anyhow one by one liu han did not know just how theyd met their ends so long as they were dead and the little devils none the wiser she was satisfied two streets over from the one the devils most regularly patrolled a market had sprung up people landed in camp with no more than what they had on their backs but they soon started trading that no reason for a man with a gold ring or a woman whose purse had been full of coins to do without inside days too chickens and even piglets had made their appearance to supplement the rice the devils doled out a bald man with a wispy mustache sat on the ground his straw hat up down in front of him in it nestled three fine eggs seeing liu han long at them he nodded and spoke to her when he saw she did not follow him he tried another dialect then another finally he reached one she could also grasp what you give for these sometimes even understanding did not help i am sorry she said i have nothing to give back in her own village it would have been the start of a haggle with which to while away most of a morning here she thought it was nothing but truth her husband her child dead at the hands of the japanese her village devastated first by the eastern barbarians and then by the devils in their dragonfly planes and now gone forever the man with the eggs cocked his head to one side smiled a bland merchants smile up at her he said pretty woman never have nothing to give you want eggs maybe you let me see your body for them no liu han said shortly and walked away the bald man laughed as she turned her back he was not the first in the market who had asked her for that kind of payment she went back to the tent she shared with yi min the apothecary harry turtledove was becoming an important man in the prison camp little scaly devils often visited him to learn written chinese and the dialects he spoke sometimes he made suggestions to them about the proper way to do things they very often listened that was what made him important if he wanted eggs he had influence to trade for them all the same liu han sometimes wished she had moved in with the other prisoners from her village or with people shed never seen before but she and he had come here in the belly of the same dragon plane he had been a speck of the familiar in a vast strange ocean and so she had agreed hed been diffident when he asked her he wasnt diffident anymore she lifted the tent flap a startled hiss greeted her she bowed almost double i am very sorry lord devil sir i did not mean to disturb you she said rapidly too rapidly the demon turned back to yi min from whose words she had distracted it she say what it asked in abominably accented chinese she apologizes says she is sorryfor bothering you yi min had to repeat it a couple of times before the little devil understood then he made a noise like a boiling pot is that how to say the same thing in your language he asked switching back to chinese once more the scaly devil hissed back at him the language lesson went on for some time with both yi min and the devil ignoring liu han as completely as if shed been the sleeping mat on which they squatted finally the little demon bubbled out what must have been a farewell for it got to its clawed feet and scurried out of the tent even in going it brushed past liu han without a word in either chinese or devil talk yi min patted the mat with some reluctance liu han sat down beside him in the place the little scaled demon had just occupied the mat was still warm almost hot devils fittingly enough were more fiery creatures than human beings yi min was in an expansive mood i shall be rich he chortled the race the what liu han asked the race it is what the devils call themselves they will need men to serve them to be their viceroys men who can teach them the way real people talk and also learn their ugly language it is difficult but ssofeg the devil who was just here says i pick it up more quickly than anyone else in this whole camp i will learn and help the devils and become a great man you were wise to stick by me liu han truly wise he turned to her and kissed her she did not respond but he hardly noticed his tongue pushed its way into her mouth she tried to fend him off his greater weight overbore her pressed her down to the mat already he was tugging at her tunic she sighed and submitted staring up at the gray fabric of the tent ceiling and hoping he would finish soon worldwar in the balance he thought he was a good lover he did everything a good lover should caressing her putting his face between her legs but liu han did not want either him or his attentions and so they failed to stir her again yi min was so full of himself that her response or rather lack of it did not even reach him had she not been there at a convenient moment she was sure he would simply have taken himself in hand but she was there so he took her instead let us try the hovering butterflies today he said by which he meant that he wanted her on top she sighed again he would not even give her the chance just to lie there limply once more she wished the scaly devils had herded someone else into the dragonfly plane with her she did not know why shed yielded the first time he forced himself on her save that he was the last link she had to the vanished life she was used to having yielded once saying no became more nearly impossible every time afterward looking in every direction but at his flushed rather greasy face she straddled him lowered herself he filled her but that was all she felt none of the delight she had known from her husband she moved vigorously just the same that was the way to make it over soonest he was thrashing beneath her like a gaffed carp when the tent flap opened she gasped and grabbed for her cotton trousers at the same moment that yi min oblivious as usual to everything not himself groaned with his final pleasure liu han wanted to die how could she show her face anywhere in camp now that her body had been seen in truth she felt like killing yi min for piling such humiliation on her shoulders maybe tonight after he fsleep fhe hiss from the entranceway brought her out of her dark fantasy and back to the present that wasnt a person there seeing her shame it was a little scaly devil as she rolled off yi min and away as she scrambled into trousers and tunic she wondered if that was better or worse better she supposed a person would surely gossip about her while a scaly devil might not the devil hissed and sputtered in his own devils language then tried to speak chinese what you do we were enjoying the moment of clouds and rain mighty lord devil ssofeg yi min answered as coolly as if hed said we were having a cup of green tea i did not expect you back so soon much more slowly than liu han had he began to put his clothes back on clouds and rain not understand the little devil named ssofeg said liu han could scarcely understand it as well expect to trap the moon in a mirror as poetry from a little devil it would seem yi min said in a low rapid aside to liu han he harry turtledove turned back to sofeg i am very sorry mighty lord devil i shall speak plain words for you we were making love doing what makes a baby mating bailing screwing fucking do any of those make sense to you wanting as she did to find all things about yi min odious liu han had to notice he was good at using simple words and at using a whole cluster of them in the hope that the devil might grasp at least one ssofeg did too make baby he echoed yes thats right yi min said enthusiastically he smiled a broad artificial smile and made extravagant gestures to show how pleased he was the little scaly devil tried to speak more chinese but words failed it it switched to its own language now yi min was the one who had to grope for meanings sofeg had patience too speaking slowly and simply as the apothecary had before at one point it aimed a clawed finger at liu han she flinched back in alarm but the scaly devil seemed just to be asking a question after a while yi min asked a question or two in return ssofeg answered with a couple of short words without warning yi min brayed laughter do you know what this stupid turtle thinks he managed to wheeze out between guffaws can you guess you would never guess not in a thousand years tell me then liu han said afraid the joke would turn on her but it did not yi min said the little scaly devil wanted to know if it was your breeding season if you came into heat at a certain time of the year like a vixen or a ewe if i understand him rightly that is how his kinds females are made and when they are not in season he can feel no desire himself the apothecary laughed again harder than ever poor poor devil that is strange liu han admitted she had never given any thought to the little scaly devils love lives they were so ugly she hadnt thought of their having any now almost against her will she found herself smiling poor devils yi min gave his attention back to ssofeg he mixed chinese and the devils language to get across the idea that women could be receptive at any time ssofeg hissed and squeaked so did yi min then in chinese he said i give you oath master devil that i tell you the truth here ssofeg squeaked again before it no he liu han thought tried chinese again too true all woman not just he pointed at liu han woman here true for all women yi min agreed solemnly though liu han saw the glint of laughter still in his eye to make sure his own sex was not demeaned he added it is also true that men human men have no fixed mating season but can mate with women at any time of the year that started ssofeg making cooking noises again instead of asking worldwar in the balance more foolish questions the little scaly devil whirled and scampered out of the tent liu han heard his clawed feet pattering away at a dead run she said im glad hes gone so am i yi min said it lets me think how can i best turn to my advantage this strange and sorrowful weakness of the scaly devils if they were proper men i could sell them proper medicine to strengthen their peerless pillars but if i correctly follow ssofeg without devil females he and his brethren might as well be so many eunuchs though even eunuchs have desires they say hmm not five minutes after his yang essence had mingled with liu hans yin he might as well have forgotten she remained in the tent to yi min yi min was all that truly mattered with everyone and everything else to be rearranged at his whim for his convenience now he sat crosslegged on the mat his eyes almost closed feverishly planning how to turn the dew ils debility into money or influence for him all at once he let out a cry nearly as intense as the one hed made when he spent himself inside her i have it he exclaimed i will liu han never found out what yi mins latest scheme was before he could announce it ssofeg burst back into the tent three more little scaly devils were right behind him all of them carrying guns liu hans bowels turned to water now yi min bleated like a sheep facing the butchrs cleaver mercy kind devil he wailed ssofeg pointed outside then to yi min you come he said in chinese yi min was so frightened he had trouble getting to his feet he stumbled out of the tent on stiff numb legs two of the armed devils flanked him as he went whysu han gaped at ssofeg at a stroke the little devil had given her he wanted most freedom from yi min and if he was gone then shed have this fine tent to herself she felt like kissing ssofeg if he hadnt had a mouthful of sharp teeth and one armed retainer still standing by him she might have done it then the devil pointed at her too come you he said me her sudden hopes crashed down oh no kind devil you dont want me you dont need me i am just a poor woman who knows not a thing in all the world she knew she was talking too fast for the ignorant little devil to understand but the words poured out of her like the sweat that all at once began to pour from her armpits ssofeg paid no more attention to what she wanted than yi min had when he undressed her and satisfied his own urges too come you woman he said the scaly devil behind him moved his gun so it bore on her the devils were not in the habit of taking no for an answer moaning she followed yi min out into the street people stared and pointed and exclaimed as the little devils marched her alon behind the apothecary she understood a couple of their remarks harry turtledove ee that doesnt look good i wonder what they did liu han wondered what shed done too aside from being foolish enough to let yi min take advantage of her and why should the scaly devils care about that no one did anything more than stare and exclaim the devils were little but they were powerful the three with guns could kill many chinese by themselves and even if they were somehow overwhelmed the rest of the scaly devils would flay the prison camp with fire from their dragonfly planes liu han had seen what such fire did to the japanese in her village and they had had arms to fight back the people in the camp were utterly defenseless against assault from the air yi min yelled help me someone i havent done a thing save me from the terrible devilm liu han snorted angrily and glowered at his back he didnt care what happened to anyone else so long as he saved his own worthless skin she snorted again it wasnt as if she didnt already know that despite his bawling like a pig with a cut hock no one did anything foolish for which liu han was heartily glad but she felt very lonely as the armed escort of devils led her out of the prison camp away from her own people and toward a dragonfly plane in ssofeg said having no choice first yi min and then liu han obeyed a few minutes later the dragonfly plane scrambled noisily into the air even though her stomach lurched every time the plane changed direction she wasnt as completely petrified as she had been the first time the little scaly devils forced her aboard one of their flying machines after all several of them were in here too and no matter how little they cared about her shed seen that they valued their own painted hides this is all your fault yi min shouted at her if you werent flaunting yourself there in my tent i never would have gotten into this predicament the unfairness of that took her breath away before she could answer one of the devils let out an ominous hiss it punctured the apothecarys bluster like a pin popping an inflated sows bladder he shut up though he didnt stop glaring at her she glared right back after about half an hours flight the dragonfly plane set down not far from some much bigger machines of the scaly devils the devils with guns urged her and yi min out marched them along to one of those big machines and up a ladder into its belly unlike the ones on the dragonfly plane the seats in there were padded though still not big enough even for her these seats had straps too a little devil waiting for them fastened those straps so liu han could not reach the buckles no matter how she squirmed her fear came back yi min writhed even more violently than he had under her here though his thrashing won no release the door to the outside world slammed shut the devil twisted a han worldwar in the balance le to make sure it stayed that way then he scrambled up an interior lader into a higher room leaving the two people alone and helpless your fault yi min insisted he went on in that vein for some time iu han stopped listening to him nothing obviously had ever been his ault in all his born days and if you didnt believe it you had but to ask dm without warning the machine shuddered beneath them earthluake liu han squalled well be crushed well be killed shed lever heard anything like the roar that went with the terrible unending haking without warning she felt as if two or three people or maybe a brick all knocked down by the earthquake had fallen on top of her she tried o scream but produced no more than a gurgle the dreadful unending eight made it hard to breathe at all let alone drag in enough air for a hriek after a little while much of the racket went away though a more muted rumble and several mediumloud mechanical noises persisted whats happening to us yi min liu han gasped out however much she disliked him he was the only other human being caught in this evilish trap besides with his education he might even have known the answer i have ridden on the railroad he replied his voice also coming forth in effortful grunts when a train starts to move it presses you back into your seat but never like this no never like this this is no train liu han said scornfully his words satisfied her no better than his body had the rumble from beneath them abruptly cut off at the same instant the crushinssure on liu hans chest also went away her own weight somehow seed to disappear too were it not for the prisoning straps that grasped her she felt as if she could have floated away from her seat perhaps even flown like a magpie exhilaration shed never known flooded through her its wonderful she exclaimed the only answer yi min gave was a sick gulping noise that reminded her of a fish trying to breathe after it was hauled out of its pond she twisted her neck so she could look over at him his face was pale as whey i will not vomit he whispered fiercely as if trying to make himself believe it i will not vomit big drops of sweat grew on his cheeks and forehead he shuddered still fighting to control his rebellious stomach liu han watched fascinated as one of the drops broke free it didnt fall it just hung almost motionless in midair as if hooked to the ceiling with an invisible line of spider silk but no no silk here yi min let out another gulp this one louder than the last all at once liu han hoped he would not be sick if his vomit hung as the drop of harry turtledove sweat had it was liable to smother him and if it drifted through the air it was liable to smother her then the apothecary quavered llook at the devil liu hah liu han turned back toward the ladder up which the little scaly devil had climbed he was there in the hatchway again peering down at the two humans with his unnerving independently mobile eyes but those eyes at the moment were the least unnerving thing about him he floated headdown a couple of yards above liu han with neither hands nor feet holding onto anything he did not fall any more than the drop of yi mins sweat had when he saw that the people could not escape he twisted in midair so his legs were toward them the practiced maneuver might have been part of a dance in three dimensions for the first time liu han found a devil graceful he reached out grabbed a rung of the ladder pushed sure enough just as liu han had imagined he flew upward into his own cabin isnt that the most amazing thing you ever saw she said its impossible yi min declared who knows whats impossible for devils liu han asked through his sickness yi min stared at her she needed a moment to read the expression on his face then she realized that without thinking about it she had spoken to him as to an equal that was not proper but it was the truth here caught by the devils cords they were equals equal nothings and of the two of them she was having the better time of coping with this strange place if yi mm had reprimanded her shoved her back down into the subservient role shed taken all her life likely she would have accepted it without a murmur but he didnt he was too filled with his own nausea too filled with his own fear because of that some thmgs not everything but some thingschanged forever between them in the next few silent minutes she didnt know how long they traveled with their weight left behind she enjoyed every second of it and wished only that she were free to float about and try the twisting move the little scaly devil had used yi min lay huddled on his seat every so often he made another sick gulping noise liu han did her best not to laugh at him the plane in which they were flying made noises of its own the pops and hisses meant nothing to liu han so she hardly noticed them but the metallic bangs and the grating sound that came from the front end after a while were impossible to ignore she said are we going to crash how should i know yi min answered peevishly diminishing himself in her sight yet again they did not crash more strange noises came from the front end of the plane then the harsh sounds of the little scaly devils speech three devils came floating back into the compartment where liu han was worldwar in the balance strapped down though she had not known the plane held more than one her fear came back with them for two of the devils bore long knives that were almost swords shed imagined yi mins vomit drifting through the air like stinking fog now in her minds eye she saw a red mist of her own blood filling the room she shuddered and tried to make herself as small as she could the devil with a swordknife glided down to the seat on which she lay reached out she shuddered again a thousand times better yi mins caresses than the touch of the scaly devil but all he did was unfasten the straps that held her in place then those confining the apothecary when they were both free the devil pointed upward in the direction from which he and his companions had come all at once in an almost blinding flash of enlightenment liu han saw that the armed devils were there to protect the other one from her and from yi min just as it hadnt occurred to her that she could talk back to yi min so she hadnt imagined mere humans might be dangerous to devils again something changed for good in the way she looked at the world yi min spoke hesitantly in the devils language the one who had released him answered what does he say liu han asked her tone said she had a right to know hes telling us to go that way yi min replied pointing in the same direction the little devil had he says they will not hurt us if we do as they say liu han pushed against the arms of her seat she floated up lighter than a feather the scaly devil did grab her but only to straighten her course yi min followed still making queasy noises in the back of his throat ic room from which the devils had come was smaller than the one in h theyd confined the humans one wall was nothing but dials and buttons and screens a scaly devil with a short sword floated in front of it he hissed at liu han as if warning her to come no closer she wanted to laugh at him she had no intention of doing that the devils small skinny body did not cover all the screens one showed cloudcovered blue and brown slowly moving past as if seen from far above the pretty colors had a sharp curved edge above was only black look yi min liu hah said they can make pretty pictures i wonder what it is yi min looked at the screen pointed to it tried out his small command of the devils tongue on the one guarding it that one answered at some length yi min interrupting a couple of times with new questions the apothecary said thats our world going round many miles below us liu han our whole world the western devils with whom i studied were right it seems the world really is round like a ball liu han kept her own opinion of that to herself the world had al harry turtledove ways looked flat to her but it certainly did seem to have a round edge now now was not the time to worry about it not with so many more urgent concerns closer to hand the scaly devil hissed and pointed with his blade urging her forward she grabbed what had to be a handhold and went through another opening two more armed devils waited in the much bigger space out there they pointed to an open circular doorway in the curved wall of that space liu han obediently propelled herself toward it it had handholds all around for those whose aim was poor hers wasnt she almost collided with the devil waiting inside that tunnel yi min missed the doorway and had to scrabble in with the handholds he was nursing a sprained wrist and cursing under his breath when he appeared the two floating devils followed him the trip along that corridor was the strangest journey liu han had ever known even surpassing the weightless flight in the roaring plane with every foot she traveled away from the doorway she grew heavier from floating she went to bounding then to walking with long strides then to ordinary steps with what felt like about her proper weight how do they do that she asked yi mina he was after all the only other person available and could also talk with the devils which she could not although now that she thought about it what held her back from learning their words for herself he spoke listened spoke listened finally gave up i do not understand it has something to do with spinning round and round but how could that make us heavier or lighter he wiped his sweaty forehead with a sleeve its too hot in here too it certainly is liu hah said it was as bad as any midsummer day though less humid than usual in her village in summer that helped but not enough the devils seemed perfectly happy in the heat she remembered how warm the mat on which the devil was sitting had felt just a few hours before and the christian priest she recalled had said devils lived in a hot place she hadnt taken him seriously but he must have known what he was talking about maybe being a western devil himself hed had more intimate acquaintance with other sorts of devils than was possible for a chinese the armed devils took the two humans out of the corridor and into another one other devils bustled past on errands of their own some of them turned one turreted eye toward liu hah and yi min most just ignored the two people the escort led liu han and yi min into a large room already inside were several devils with fancier body paint than any liu han had yet seen anda mat covered not with cotton cloth but with some smooth shiny stuff obviously of devilish manufacture one of the waiting devils sur worldwar in the balance prised liu han by speaking chinese what he said surprised her even more you two go screw now she gaped at him wondering if shed heard correctly his accent was dreadful and whether he knew what he was saying she knew a certain amount of relief to see that yi min looked as befuddled and as dismayed as she felt to have endured both terror and wonder to get here only to receive a blunt order to fornicate she wondered about the little scaly devils in ways that had never occurred to her before you go screw now the devil repeated no she said the word out of her mouth before she had time to wonder about its consequences and no yi min echoed which surprised her very little it was soon after he had taken her before and hed been through quite a lot since few men wanted to try when they werent likely to succeed not go screw not leave the scaly devil said liu han and yi min stared at each other appalled no matter how interesting the journey hither had been liu hah did not want to spend the rest of her days in the company of devils and yi min but she had no desire to exhibit herself to the devils either you are perverts if you think we will perform for you she burst out go away and leave us alone then we will see you cant talk to them that way yi min said fearfully but the devil who spoke chinese hissed at the others they filed out of the chamber one by one the last one closed the door what sounded like a lock clicked the devils might have left but they hadnt changed their minds kill hah looked around without the scaly devils the chamber was drllfully bare no food no water not even a pot for night soil just that cursed shiny mat she looked from it to yi min back again she wished she could persuade herself otherwise but she was convinced that door wouldnt open again until she and the apothecary did what the devils wanted resignedly she started taking off her clothes what are you doing yi min said what do you think im doing im getting this over with she retorted if the choice is between having you and staying locked up here among the devils id sooner have you but once were back in camp yi min youll never touch me again that warning was nothing but a bluff and she knew it she had no family in the camp to protect her from the apothecary and he was bigger and stronger than she but he did not argue muttering whatever you say he undid the waistband of his trousers let them fall to the metal floor of the chamber he did not have an easy time of it she had to help him with her hand harry turtledove and then her mouth before he would rise at all he moved slowly and care fully within her shepherding his strength and went on almost endlessly before at last he managed to spend maybe that long slow passage was what helped liu han startle her self by also ascending to the clouds and rain more probably though she decided later shed let herself go because for the first time the coupling was of her choosing not forced upon her true the choice yi min or the devils had not been a good one but it was her own that made a lot of difference the apothecary was still puffing as he rolled off her i wonder what the little blinking orange light over there in the corner of the ceiling was he said pointing i didnt notice it she confessed that annoyed her every time till now shed been more interested in where she was than in what yi min was doing to her now when they were finally in new and fascinating sur roundings her foolish body kept her from seeing everything there was to see she glanced toward the ceiling its not there now it was yi min said liu han dressed then walked over to the door and knocked on it again and again we kept our part of the bargain she said now you devils keep yours whether thanks to the racket she was making or not the door slid open a couple of minutes later the devil who opened it was the one who spoke chinese you come he said pointing to her and yi min she followed without fuss every other choice looked worse yi min walked right behind her she gave a long slow nod when she noticed that shed taken the lead here as in their justcompleted joining simply by act ing as if she had the right to do so she wondered if it was always that sim ple certainly it was not while facing the little scaly devils especially here in their lair here she was only too aware she was in their power she ducked to get through the entrance of the chamber to which the devil led her so did yi min being taller he had to bend farther if they had to stay in this strange place any length of time she was sure they would both end up smashing their foreheads in doorways every so often the devils who had been in the original chamber or at least the same number of devils liu han was still shaky about telling them apart now gathered around what looked like a tall pedestal with no statue on top of it their heads turned when the two people came in their mouths dropped open almost in unison liu han did not like the look of all those pointed teeth the scaly devil who spoke chinese said you watch you go screw that made no sense to liu han she turned to yi min what is the little devil trying to say try and find out since you speak his language worldwar in the balance yi min made hissing and bubbling noises liu han listened bemused getting him th do what she wanted had been easy all she needed to do was tell him in a firm way in this weird place his mans arrogance had dried up and blown away he was no master here and he knew it the devil says were going to watch ourselves couple yi min reported after a couple of minutes backandforth its the same in his speech as it is in chinese he seems very sure he the apothecary shut up one of the other little scaly devils impatient with all the chatter had stuck a clawed finger into a recess near the top of the pedestal an image sprang into being above it an image of the two people making love on the shiny mat in the other chamber liu han stared and stared she had spent coppers to see moving pictures two or three times but this was no ordinary moving picture for one thing it was not in shades of gray but perfectly reproduced the tans and golds and pinks of flesh for another the image looked solid not flat and as she discovered when she took a step her view of it shifted whenever she moved she walked all the way around the pedestal and saw herself and yi min from every side the devils watched her not the image their mouths fell open again all at once she was sure they were laughing at her and no wonder there she lay in miniature doing publicly what shed thought private watching herself made a third difference from seeing an ordinary moving picture and made her hate the little devils for tricking her so you people you screw any time no season the chinesespeaking devil demanded this true for all peoples of course it is liu han snapped yi min didnt say anything he was watching his rather beefy buttocks move up and down twisting his bhggto get the best possible view of things as far as he was concerned in a moving picture was just fine the devil said any man screw any woman any time yes yes yes liu han felt like screaming at the nasty little creature had it no decency but then who could say what was decent for a devil the devils talked back and forth among themselves every so often one or another of them would point at the two people which made liu han nervous the devils voices rose yi min said theyre arguing some of them dont believe it what could it matter to them anyhow liu han said the apothecary shook his head he had no idea either but the chinesespeaking scaly devil answered the question a little later maybe this screw so what do you big uglies so different than race maybe screw any man woman all time make you so he needed a brief colloquy with yi min before he found the word he wanted so progressive yes progressive the words the sentences made sense to liu han but she did not re harry turtledove ally take hold of the concepts behind them progressive to her was a word from communist propaganda that meant our way as far as she could see people and the little scaly devils had no way in common in fact they seemed to use progressive to mean the opposite of our way she could not ask them to explain either for they were arguing among themselves again then the one who spoke chinese said we find out if you speak true we make test make he went word hunting with yi min again make experiment bring for man many womans here for woman many mans see if screw all time like you say when he heard that when he understood it through bad grammar and twisted syntax yi min smiled beatifically liu han stared in disbelieving horror at the little devil who seemed pleased at his own cleverness shed wondered what could be worse than coming to this strange unpleasant place now she knew bobby fiore picked up a rock chucked it at a crumpled piece of paper forty or fifty feet away he didnt miss by more than a couple of inches his chuckle was sour chucking rocks was as close as hed come to taking infield since the lizards grabbed him he didnt even dare do that near the perimeter of the camp the last time anybodyd thrown a stone at a lizard five people were shot immediately afterward that stopped that one of the lizards whirligig planes racketed in from the northwest it landed at their encampment right outside the fence that cut off the peninsula on which sat cairo illinois fiore found another rock chucked it too let out a new chuckle more sour than the old hed never expected to come back to to come down to cairo again hed played there in the class d kitty league in was it or he didnt remember any more he did remember it had been a funny kind of town it still was a levee surrounded the place to protect it from floods on the mississippi and the ohio at whose confluence cairo sat over the top of the eastern barrier fiore could see magnolias and gingkos they gave the town a southern atmosphere that seemed out of place for illinois also southern was the feel of good times now long gone cairo had thought it would end up as the steamboat capital of the mississippi that didnt happen now it was just a lizard prison camp he supposed it made a good one because it had water on three sides the lizards had just wrecked the mississippi highway bridge and run up their fast fences across the neck of cairo point they didnt have gunboats in the river but they did have soldiers with machine guns and rockets on the levee and on the far shores a couple of boats were supposed to have snuck across at night but a lot more than a couple got sunk fiore mooched along till he came to the lizards fence it wasnt exactly barbed wire it was more like long strips of narrow doubleedged ra worldwar in the balance zor blade it did the same job as barbed wire though and did it just as well on the far side on the free side of the fence the lizards had run up guard towers they looked the same way say nazi prisoncamp guard towers would have looked a soldier in the nearest one swung the muzzle of his machine gun toward fiore go go go he said it might have been the only word of english he knew as long as he had that machine gun it was certainly the only one he needed bobby went went went you didnt disobey a prison guard not more than once fiores shoulders sagged as he walked slowly down highway back toward town the united states had been going to kick japans and germanys asses everybody knew it everybody felt good about it and then suddenly without the least warning in the world or out of it a prison camp probably a lot of prison camps right in the middle of the usa it wasnt so much that it didnt seem right it was more as if it didnt seem possible from the top of the world to sitting in a prison camp like a pole or an italian or a russian or a poor damned filipino americans werent supposed to have to go through this kind of nonsense his parents had left the old country to make sure they never went through this kind of nonsense and here it came to them he tramped down the middle of the highway wondering how his parents were he hadnt heard word one about pittsburgh since the lizards came when he got into cairo highway changed its name to sycamore street fiore kept walking on the white dashes of the center line no cars were running though a couple of burnedout shells remained of ones that had tried only a handful of men in their nineties remembered the last time war d the united states at home it was here again all uninvited a colored man came up sycamore toward fiore the fellow was pushing a cart that looked as if it had started life as a baby buggy an old cowbell held on with a bent coat hanger clanked to announce his presence as if that wasnt enough he sang out every few steps tamales git yo hot tamales what are you charging today fiore asked as the hottamale man drew near the negro pursed his lips reckon a dollar apieceil do jesus youre a goddamn thief you know that fiore said the hottamale man gave him a look that in other times he never would have taken from a negro his voice was cool and distant as he answered you dont want none friend theres plenty what does shit fiore unbuttoned the flap on his hip pocket dug out his wallet give me two okay boss the colored man said but not until the dollar bills were harry turtledove in his hand he flipped open the carts steel lid used a pair of tongs to dig out the greasy tamales he blew on them to cool them off before he gave them to fiore something for which in other times the board of health would have come down on him like a ton of bricks bobby didnt much care for a negros breath on his hot tamales either but kept his mouth shut he was glad enough to have the money to buy them when the lizards pushed him off their whirligig flying machine hed had in his pockets and that was counting his lucky quarter but it was enough to get him into a poker game and endless hours on endless train and bus rides from one minor league town to the next had honed his skills sharper than those of the local boys he sat down with more than two bills rubbed against each other in his wallet now he bit through corn husks into spicy tomato sauce onions and meat he chewed slowly trying to identify it a little closer than that it wasnt beef and it wasnt chicken the last tamales hed bought a couple of days before had had chicken in them these tasted different stronger somehow almost like kidney but not that either something his father used to say a phrase he hadnt thought of in years floated through his mind times so tough we had to eat roof rabbit in an instant suspicion hardened to certainty you son of a bitch he shouted half choking because he couldnt decide whether to swallow or spit thats cat meat in there the hottamale man didnt waste time denying it what if it is he said its the onliest meat i got case you didnt notice mister aint nobody bringin no food into cairo these days i oughta beat the crap outta you givin a white man cat meat fiore snarled if he hadnt still held a tamale in each hand he might have done it the threat alone should have made the negro cringe cairo not only looked like a southern town it acted like one jim crow was alive and well here colored children went to their own school their mothers were domestics their fathers mostly longshoremen or factory hands or sharecroppers they knew better than to disturb the powers that be but the hottamale man just stared steadily back at bobby fiore mister i cant sell you what i don got an if you beat on me maybe i wont hit back though you aint such a real big man as that what i do mister i tell the lizards yall may be white but them lizards they treats all kinds o folks like they was niggers white black dont make no never mind to them we aint free no more but we is equal fiore gaped at him he looked back steady still then he nodded as peaceably as if theyd been talking about the weather and started pushing his cart up sycamore street the cowbell clanked hot tamales git yo hot tamales fiore looked down at the two hed bought his father had known hard worldwar in the balance times he thought he had too but till now hed been wrong hard times were when you ate cat and were happy you had it to eat he ate both tamales then deliberately licked his fingers clean he walked farther into town then he heard behind him the click of lizards nails on asphalt he turned around to look that was a mistake the lizards all pointed their guns at him one made an unmistakable gesture come here gulping he came the lizards surrounded him none of them came up past his shoulder but with their weapons that didnt matter they marched him back toward their razorblade fence when he passed the slowmoving tamale man the fellow just grinned ill get you if its the last thing i do fiore shouted the hottamale man laughed out loud warsaw knew naked war again the crack of rifles the harsh abrupt roar of howitzers the screech and whine of incoming shells the crash when they struck and the slow rumbling crumple of collapsing masonry afterward almost moishe russie longed for the days of the sealedoff ghetto when dying came slow rather than of a sudden almost ironic that jews could come and go in the whole city now just when the whole city became a battlefield as the poles had fought to the last in warsaw against vastly superior nazi forces so now the germans embattled in turn were making warsaw a fortress against the overwhelming might of the lizards a lizard plane screamed overhead almost low enough to touch but too fast for antiaircraft guns to hit bombs fell one after another the ex plosions that followed were bigger than those the usual run of lizard bombs produced unaided like everyone else in warsaw german pole or jew russie had become a connoisseur of explosions the lizards must have set off some german ammunition what shall we do reb moishe wailed a man in the shelter actually it was only a room in the ground floor of a reasonably stout building but calling it safety might make it so names as any kabbalist knew had power pray russie answered hed begun to grow used to the title with which the jews of warsaw insisted on adorning him more explosions through them the man cried pray for whom for the germans who would kill us in particular or for the lizards who would kill everyone who stands in their way which is to say all of mankind such a question yitzkhak another man chided how is the reb to answer a question like that with the jewish love of disputation even in the face of death yitzkhak retorted what is a reb for but to answer questions like that it was indeed the question of the moment russie knew that only too well finding an answer that satisfied was hard hard through the worldwar in the balance differenttoned roars and crashes of aircraft shells bullets and bombs the people huddled against one another and passed the terrifying time by arguing why should we do anything for the ferkakte nazis they murder us for no better reason than that were jews this makes them better than the lizards who would murder us for no better reason than that were people remember berlin in an instant as much suffering as the germans took three years to give us they deserve it god made the germans as a scourge for us and god made the lizards as a scourge for the germans a near miss from a bomb sent chunks of plaster raining down from the ceiling onto the heads and shoulders of the people in the shelter if the lizards were gods scourge on the germans they also chastised the jews russie thought but then scourges were not brooms and did not sweep clean someone twisted the argument in a new direction god made the lizards i cant believe that if god didnt who did someone else countered russie knew the answer the poles outside the ghettos shattered walls gave to that but no matter what the goyim thought jews put no great stock in the devil god was god how could he have a rival but fitting the lizards into gods scheme of things wasnt easy either even as scourges the germans had plastered warsaw with posters of a wehrmacht soldier superimposed over a photograph of naked burnt corpses in the ruins of berlin in german polish and even yiddish the legend below read he stands between you and this it was a good effective poster russie would have reckoned it more effective still had he not seen so many naked jewish corpses in warsaw co dead on account of the germans still he said i will pray for the gens as i would pray for any men who sin greatly hisses and jeers met his words someone he thought it was yitzkhak shouted ill pray for the germans too to catch the cholera cries of agreement rang loud and often profane no way to speak of prayer russie thought disapprovingly let me finish he said and won a measure if not of quiet then of lowered voices the advantage of being thought a reb someone whose words were reckoned worth hearing he went on i will pray for the germans but i shall not aid them they want to wipe us from the face of the earth however badly these lizards treat all mankind they will treat us no worse than any other part of it thus i see in them gods judgment which may be harsh but is never unjust the jews in the shelter listened to russie but not all followed his way of thinking punctuated by blasts outside the dispute went on someone tapped russie on the arm a cleanshaven young man russie was almost sure the fellow had fewer years than his own twentysix though his beardless cheeks also accented his youth in a cloth cap and shabby tweed harry turtledove jacket he said wilt you do more than simply stand aside while lizards and germans fight reb moishe from under the stained brim of the cap his eyes bored into russie while he awaited his reply what more can i do russie asked cautiously he wanted to shift his feet hed not been under such intense scrutiny since his last oral examination before the war and maybe not then this young secularlooking jew had eyes sharp and piercing as slivers of glass and who are you im mordechai anielewicz the smoothfaced young man answered his offhand tone making his name seem small and unimportant as for what you can do he put his head close to moishes not russie thought that there was much danger of anyone overhearing them in the noisy chaos of the makeshift shelter as for what you can do you can help us when we hit the germans when you what russie stared at him when we hit the germans anielewicz repeated we have grenades pistols a few rifles even one machine gun the armja krajowa the home army the polish resistance forces has many more if we rise the nazis wont be able to fight us and the lizards both and warsaw will fall and we will have our vengeance his whole face thin and pale like everyone elses blazed with anticipation i i dont know russie stammered what makes you think the lizards will make better masters than the germans how could they be worse every line of anielewiczs body was a shout of contempt this i do not know but after we have seen so much suffering who knows what may be possible russie said and the poles will they really rise with you or sit on their hands and let the nazis slaughter you for every armja krajowa man theres another in the dark blue police the germanled order police wore uniforms of a shade nearly navy russie added sometimes the armja krajowa man is in the dark blue police there are traitors everywhere anielewicz shrugged as if hearing nothing he didnt already know most of them hate germans worse than jews as for those who dont well well have more guns after the rising than we do now if we fight germans we can fight poles too come on reb moishe youve said all along the lizards were gods means of delivering us from the nazis say it again when we rise to hearten us and bring new fighters to our cause but the lizards are not even human beings russie said anielewicz impaled him on another stare are the nazis yes he answered at once evil human beings but human beings all the same i dont know what to tell you i russie stopped shaking his head in bewilderment ever since god granted him a sign ever since the lizards came to earth hed been treated as someone important as someone whose opinion mattered reb moishe even anielewicz called him worldwar in the balance that now he discovered that with importance came responsibility hundreds more like thousands of lives would turn on what he decided all at once he wished he were simply a starving onetime medical student once more but that was not the sort of wish god was in the habit of granting russie temporized by when must i decide we strike tomorrow night anielewicz answered then with a couple of quick wriggles he slid away from russie and lost himself in the packed shelter after a while lizard bombs stopped raining down no sirens wailed to announce the all clear but that proved nothing power was erratic in warsaw these days for that matter power had always been erratic in the ghetto people took advantage of the lull to make their escape to try to rejoin their loved ones as he made his way to the door with the rest russie looked for mordechai anielewicz he did not find him one shabby jew looked all too much like another especially from behind russie came out onto gliniana street a couple of blocks east of the overflowingly full jewish cemetery he glanced toward the graveyard the germans had positioned a couple of centimeter antiaircraft guns in it their long barrels stuck up from among the tumbled headstones like monster elephant trunks russie could see the gun crews moving around now that the bombardment had eased up the sun sparked dully off the matte finish of their helmets nazis russie thought the source of endless misery and death and ruin a plume of cigarette smoke floated up from one of them they were nazis but they were so human beings would life be better under things called lizards lend me a sign god he begged silently as he had on the night when the lizards came one of the gunners assumed a spraddlelegged stance russie recognized the fellow was urinating hoarse german laugher floated to russies ears it filled him with rage how like the nazis to piss on dead jews and then laugh about it all at once he realized he had his sign an intelligence officer set a new stack of documents in front of atvar as was his habit he skimmed through the summaries till he found one that engaged his full attention it didnt take long this time he read every word of the second report in the stack then turned one eye toward the intelligence male this report is confirmed as accurate which one do you have there exalted fleetlord the officer peered down to see where atvar had paused oh that one yes exalted fleetlord no possible mistake there the big uglies in the town in the empire of deutschland are fighting amongst themselves quite ferociously too and the radio intercepts those are reliable as well harry turtledove the intelligence male nervously twitched his tailstump there we are less certain exalted fleetlord one of the languages seems close to deutsch the other rather farther from russki these cursed tosevites have altogether too many languages but if we correctly understand the import of these signals one faction in the city appears to be seeking our aid against the other its not the deutsche themselves calling for our assistance surely by the emperor no exalted fleetlord the intelligence officer said its the others the ones fighting against them our estimates are that the empire of deutschland as it now stands is a jerrybuilt structure most of its territory having been added in the course of the intertosevite war in progress when our fleet arrived some of the inhabitants of that empire remain restive under deutsch control i see atvar said though he didnt not altogether product of an empireof the empire which had been itself for tens of millennia he felt himself failing to grasp what it was like to try to build one in a couple of years without even the symbol of an emperor to bind it together in most cases or for that matter to pass suddenly out of the control of one empire and into that of another the intelligence officer said the groups involved in the fighting against the deutsche appear to be prominently represented in the camp our forces overran east of the town now involved in strife which camp do you mean atvar asked a fleetlords life is full of minutiae then he let out a hiss yes i remember that camp what was its name the intelligence officer had to check the computer before he answered it is called treblinka exalted fleetlord even spoken by a male of the race the tosevite word sounded harsh and ugly do you wish me to call up the images our combat teams recorded when they captured the place by the emperor no atvar said quickly once was sufficient once as a matter of fact had been excessive atvar thought hed hardened himself to the horrors of war even such hardening as hed gained had not come easy his own forces were taking far more casualties than the grimmest estimates had predicted before the fleet left home but then no one had expected the tosevites to be able to fight an industrialized war what the races advancing armor discovered at treblinka wasnt industrialized war though it wasnt even industrialized exploitation of criminals and captives the race had camps of that sort on all its planets and had overrun more on tosev the sssr especially seemed full of them all far more brutal than anything the emperor in his mercy would have permitted but treblinka the fleetlord did not need the computer screen to replay images of treblinka once reminded of the place his mind called up worldwar in the balance the pictures and he could not turn his eyes away from what his mind saw treblinka wasnt industrialized war or industrialized exploitation treblinka was industrialized murder mass graves full of tosevites shot in the head trucks designed so the waste products of their inefficient dirty engines were vented into a sealed compartment to kill those inside and just installed before the race seized treblinka chambers to slaughter large numbers of big uglies at once with poisonous gas it was as if the deutsche had kept working to find the most effective way to get rid of as many other big uglies at a batch as they could even if treblinka represented no more than one set of barbarians tormenting another it was plenty to sicken atvar it also set him thinking you say the groups now opposing the deutsche in this town are the same ones the deutsche have been massacring linguistic evidence and preliminary interrogations suggest this is so yes exalted fleetlord the intelligence officer answered we shall promise them help then and deliver it atvar said as the exalted fleetlord wishes the intelligence officer deserved higher rank atvar thought he kept any trace of what he thought about the fleetlords order from his voice whether he agreed with it or thought it demented he would obey it as males of the race were trained to obey from their hatchling days atvar said we have here at last an opportunity to use some big uglies as gloves with our hands inside despite their losses the leading empires refuse to yield to us italia is wavering but but italia has too many deutsch soldiers in it to be fully a free agent yes the male saide was not only submissive but keen atvar thought happily forgivinn the interruption because he had been right exactly so perhaps we hall presently help them as we shall go to the aid of the the the polska and the yehudim the male supplied thank you those are the kinds of big uglies i had in mind yes atvar said and our assistance to them should not be grudging either if they give us a secure zone from which we may with impunity assail both deutschland and the sssr we shall derive great benefits therefrom we can promise them whatever they want once tosev is fully under our control well its not as if they belong to the race or even the rabotevs or hallessi the intelligence officer said quite so they remain wild and thus we have no obligations toward them save those which we choose to assume atvar studied the male you are perceptive remind me of your name that i may record your diligence i am drefsab exalted fleetlord the officer said drefsab i shall not forget harry turtledove georg schultz raised up on his elbows to peer at the ripening fields of wheat and oats and barley made a sour face the crop at this kolkhoz is going to be shitty this year he said with the certainty of a man who had grown up on a farm that at the moment is the least of our worries heinrich jager answered he hefted the schmeisser that had belonged to dieter schmidt schmidt himself had lain under the black soil of the ukraine for the past two days jager hoped he and schultz had heaped on enough to keep the wild dogs from tearing up the body but he wasnt sure he and his gunner had been in a hurry schultzs chuckle had a bitter edge to it ja were a pair out of a jumble sale arent we you can say that again jager answered both men wore scavenged infantry helmets and infantry tunics of field gray rather than tankers black schultz carried an infantry rifle as well jagers new bristly beard itched all the time schultz complained about his too it was coming in carroty red though his hair was light brown any inspector who saw them would have locked them in the guardhouse and thrown away the key tankmen are usually neat to the point of fussiness a tank without things stowed just so and with working parts dirty and poorly maintained is a tank waiting for breakdown or blowup but jager had jettisoned spit and polish when he bailed out of his killed panzer iii his schmeisser was clean so was his pistol past that hed stopped worrying he was alive and for a german on the south russian steppe that remained no small achievement as if to remind him he was still alive his stomach growled the last time hed been full was the night he got a bellyful of kasha the night before the lizards came he knew what he had in the way of rations nothing he knew what schultz had the same we have to get something from that collective farm he said take it by force sneak up in the night or go up and beg i dont much care which any more but we have to eat im damned if i want to be a chicken thief schultz said then more pragmatically he added shouldnt be too hard just going on in most of the men theyll be off at the front thats true jager said almost all the figures he saw working in the field wore babushkas but this is russia remember even the women carry rifles id sooner get something peaceably than by robbery with the lizards all around we may need help from the ivans youre the officer schultz said shrugging jager knew what he meant youre the one who gets paid to think trouble was he didnt know what to think the lizards were at war with russia no less than with the reich which meant he and these kolkhozniks shared a common foe on the other hand he hadnt heard anything to worldwar in the balance let him know germany and the soviet union werent still fighting each other for that matter he hadnt heard anything at all since his panzer died he got to his feet the south russian steppe had seemed overpoweringly vast when he traversed it in a tank now that he was on foot he felt he could tramp the gently rolling country forever without coming to its end georg schultz stood up beside him though the gunner muttered might as well be a bug walking across a plate that was the other side of russias immensity if one could see a long way one could be seen just as far the peasants spotted the two germans almost instantly jager saw their movements turn jerky even before they swung his way he kept his submachine gun lowered as he strode toward the cluster of thatchroofed wooden buildings that formed the heart of the kolkhoz lets keep this peaceful if we can yes sir schultz said if we cant no matter what we take from the ivans now theyre liable to stalk us through the grass and kill us just what im thinking jager agreed the workers in the fields converged on the germans none of them put down their hoes and spades and other tools several young women and old men carried firearms pistols stuck in belts a couple of rifles slung over shoulders some of the men would have seen action in the previous war jager thought he and schultz could have taken the lot of them even so but he didnt want to find out the hard way he turned to the gunner do you speak any russian i ki verkh hands up thats about it how about you sir ittle more not much a short swagbellied fellow marched importantly up to jager it really was a march with head thrown back arms pumping legs snapping forward one after the other the kolkhoz chairman jager realized he rattled off a couple of sentences that might have been in tibetan for all the good they did the major jager did know one word that might come in handy here he used it khleb bread he rubbed his belly with the hand that wasnt holding the schmeisser all the kolkhozniks started talking at once the word fritz came up in the gabble again and again it was almost the only word jager understood it made him smile the exact russian equivalent of the german slang ivan khleb da the chairman said a broad grin of relief on his wide sweaty face he spoke another word of russian one jager didnt know the german shrugged kept his features blank the chairman tried again this time in halting german milk harry turtledove spasebo jager said thank you da milk schultz made a face me id rather drink vodka there thats another russian word i know vodka the kolkhoz chief grinned and pointed back toward one of the buildings behind him he said something too rapid and complicated for jager to follow but his gestures left no doubt that if the germans wanted vodka the collective farm could supply it jager shook his head nyet nyet he said milk to his gunner he added i dont want us getting drunk here not even a little bit theyre liable to wait until we go to sleep and then cut our throats likely youre right sir schultz said but stillmilk ill feel like im six years old again stick to water then weve been drinking it for a while now and we havent come down with a flux yet jager was thankful for that hed been cut off from the medical service ever since the battle skirmish he supposed was really a better word for it that cost his company its last panzers if he and schultz hadnt stayed healthy their only chance was to lie down and hope they got better another old woman a babushka in the grandmotherly sense of the word hobbled toward the germans in her apron she carried several rings of dark chewylooking bread jagers stomach growled the second he saw it he took two rings schultz took three it was food fit for peasants he knew back in mfinster before the war he would have turned up his nose at black bread but compared to some of the things hed eaten in russia and especially compared to nothing at all of which hed had far too much lately it was manna from heaven georg schultz somehow managed to cram a whole ring of bread into his mouth at once his cheeks bulged until he looked like a snake trying to swallow a fat toad the kolkhozniks giggled and nudged one another the gunner his face beatific ignored them his jaws worked and worked every so often he swallowed his enormous cud of bread began to shrink thats not the best way to do it sergeant jager said see ive almost managed to finish both of mine while you were eating that one i was too hungry to wait schultz answered blurrily his mouth was still pretty full the babushka went away came back with a couple of carved wooden mugs of milk it was so fresh it warmed jagers cup its creamy richness went well with the earthy mouthfilling taste of the bread peasants food yes but a peasant who ate it every day was likely to be a contented man for politeness sake jager declined more though he could have eaten another two dozen ringsor so he thought without filling himself up he drained the mug of milk wiped his mouth on his sleeve asked the kol worldwar in the balance khoz chief the most important question he could think of eidechsen he necessarily used the german word for lizards he did not know how to say it in russian he waved his hand along the horizon to show he wanted to find out where the aliens were the kolkhozniks didnt get it jager pantomimed short creatures imitated the unmistakable screech of their airplanes as best he could the kolkhoz chiefs eyes lit up ah yasheritsi he said the peasants clustered round him exclaimed jager memorized the word he had the feeling he would need it again the chief pointed south jager knew there were lizards in that direction that was the way hed come then the chief pointed east but made pushing motions with his hands as if to say the lizards over there werent close jager nodded to show he understood and then the kolkhoz chief pointed west he didnt do any dumb show to indicate the lizards thereabouts were far away either jager looked at georg schultz schultz was looking at him too he suspected he looked as unhappy as the gunner did if there were lizards between them and the bulk of the wehrmacht jager didnt care to follow that thought to its logical conclusion for that matter if there were lizards over that way the wehrmacht might not have much left in the way of bulk the kolkhoz chief gave him another piece of bad news berlin kaput germanski yasheritsi he used those expressive hands of his to show the city going up in a single huge explosion schultz grunted as if hed been kicked in the belly jager felt hollow and empty inside himself he couldnt imagine berlin gone or germany witiilin gone he tried not to believe it maybe theyre lying schultz saidarsely maybe its just the goddamned russian radio maybe but the more jager studied the kolkhozniks the less he believed that if theyd gloated at his reaction to the news he would have doubted them more have thought they were trying to fool him but while a few looked pleased at his discomfiture as was only natural when his country and theirs had spent a year locked in a huge vicious embrace most looked at him and his companion with sympathetic eyes and somber faces that convinced him he needed to worry he found a useful russian word nichevo he knew he pronounced it badly german had to use the clumsy lettergroup tsch even to approximate the sound that lay at its heart but the kolkhozniks understood tovarisch nichevo one of them said comrade it cant be helped theres nothing to be done about it it was a very russian word indeed the russians were and needed to belong on resignation he hadnt quite meant it that way he explained what he had meant harry turtledove berlin da yasheritsi he ground the heel of his boot into the dirt berlin nyet yasheritsi he ground his heel into the dirt again some of the russians clapped their hands admiring his determination some looked at him as if he was crazy maybe i am jager thought he hadnt imagined anyone could hurt germany as the lizards had hurt it poland france and the low countries had gone down like ninepins england fought on but was walled away from europe and though the soviet union remained on its feet jager was sure the germans would have finished it by the end of the fighting south of kharkov showed the ivans hadnt learned much no matter how many of them there were but the lizards the lizards were an imponderable they werent the soldiers they might have been but their gear was so good it didnt always matter hed found that out for himself the hard way a faint buzz in the sky far off to northward jagers head whipped around any sky noise was alarming these days doubly so when it might come from an almost invulnerable lizard aircraft this though was no lizard plane just one of the ivans flying sewing machines major not worth jumping out of your skin for anything thats up there without a swastika on it makes me nervolistt cant blame you for that i guess but if we arent safe from the red air force here in the middle of a kolkhoz we arent safe anywhere the tank gunner ran a hand along his gingery whiskers of course these days we really arent safe anywhere the soviet biplane didnt go into a strafing run although jager saw it carried machine guns it skimmed over the collective farm a couple of hundred meters off the ground its little engine did indeed make a noise like a sewing machine running flat out the plane banked turned in what looked like an impossibly tight circle came back over the knot of people gathered around the two germans this time it flew lower several kolkhozniks waved up at the pilot who was clearly visible in the open cockpit goggles leather flying helmet and all the biplane banked once more now north of the collective farm again when it turned once more it was plainly on a landing run dust spurted up as its wheels touched the ground it bounced along slowed to a stop dont know as how i like this sir schultz said dealing with the russians here is one thing but that plane thats part of the red air force we shouldnt have anything to do with something connected to the bolshevik government like that i know we shouldnt sergeant but everythings gone to hell since the lizards got here jager answered besides what choice have we too many kolkhozniks carried guns to let him think about hijacking the worldwar in the balance toy plane with the red star on its flank even assuming he knew how to fly it which he didnt the pilot was climbing out of the plane putting his booted foot in the stirrup on the side of the dusty fuselage below his seat his boot his seat no jager saw a blond braid stuck out under the back of the flying helmet and the cheeks under those goggles now shoved up onto the top of the flying helmet had never known or needed a razor even baggy flying clothes could not long conceal a distinctly unmasculine shape schultz saw the same thing at the same time his long jaw worked as if he were about to spit but he had sense enough to remember where he was and think better of it disgust showed in his voice instead one of their damned girl fliers sir so she is the pilot was coming their way jager made the best of a situation worse than he really cared for rather a pretty one too ludmila gorbunova skimmed over the steppe looking for lizards or anything else interesting no matter what she found she wouldnt be able to report back to her base unless the emergency was great enough to make passing along her knowledge more important than coming home planes that used radios in flight all too often stopped flying immediately thereafter she was far enough south to start getting alert and worried when she spotted a crowd around a collective farms core buildings at a time when most of the kolkhozniks should have been in the fields that in itself wasnt so unusual but then she caught a glint of light reflecting up from a couple of helmets as the angle at which she viewed them shifted she saw they were blackish gray not the dun color she had expected germans her lip twisted what the soviet government had to say aboutrmans had flipflopped several times over the past few years theyone from being bloodthirsty fascist beasts to peaceloving partners in the struggle against imperialism and then on june back to being beasts again this time with a vengeance ludmila heard the endless droning propaganda noted when it changed and changed her thinking accordingly people who couldnt do that had a way of disappearing of course for the past year the germans themselves had been worse than any propaganda about them she wished that meant no one in the soviet union had anything good to think about the nazis the measure of hitlers damnation was that imperialist england and the united states joined the soviets in the struggle against him the measure of the soviet unions damnation though ludmila did not think of it in those terms was that so many soviet citizens ukrainians baltic peoples byelorussians tatars cossacks even great russians collaborated with hitler against moscow were these kolkhozniks collaborators then if they were a quick pass harry turtledove with her machine guns would rid the world of a fair number of them but the line from radio moscow on germany had changed yet again since the lizards came they were not forgiven their crimes no one who had fled from them would ever forgive their crimes but they were at least human if they cooperated with soviet forces against the invaders from beyond the moon they were not to be harmed so ludmilas forefinger came off the firing button she swung the kukuruznik back toward the collective farm for a closer look sure enough those were germans down there she decided to land and try to find out what they were up to only when the u was bumping along the ground to a stop did it occur to her that if the kolkhozniks were collaborators they would not want a report going back toward moscow for eventual vengeance she almost took off again but chose to stay and see what she could the farmers and the germans came toward her peacefully enough she saw several weapons in the little crowd but none pointed at her the germans kept their rifle and submachine guns slung who is the chief here she asked i am comrade pilot said a fat little fellow who stood with his back very straight as if to emphasize how important he was kliment yegorevich pavlyuchenko at your service she gave her own name and patronymic watching this pavlyuchenko with a wary eye hed spoken her fair and called her comrade but that did not mean he was to be trusted not with two germans at his elbow she pointed at them how did they come to your collective farm comrade do they speak any russian the older one does a word here and there anyhow the one with the red whiskers knows only how to eat they must have been straggling a good while they hadnt even heard about berlin both germans looked at pavlyuchenko when they heard the name of their capital ludmila studied them as if they really were a couple of dangerous beasts shed never before been close enough to see hitlerites as individuals rather to her surprise they looked like neither the inhumanseeming killing machines that had swept the soviet armies east across a thousand kilometers of russia and the ukraine nor like winter fritz of recent propaganda with a womans shawl round his shoulders and an icicle dangling from his nose they were just men a little taller a little skinnier a little longerfaced than russian norms but just men all the same she wrinkled her nose they smelled like men too men who hadnt bathed any time lately the younger one the bigger one had a peasant look to him despite his foreign cast of feature she could easily imagine him on a stool milking a worldwar in the balance cow or on his knees plucking weeds from a vegetable plot the unabashed way he leered at her was peasantlike too the other german was harder to fathom he looked tired and clever at the same time with pinched features that did not match the lined and sundarkened skin of an outdoorsman like the redwhiskered one he wore a helmet and an infantrymans blouse over the black trousers of panzer troops the blouse had a privates plain shoulder straps but she did not think it was part of the gear hed started out with he was too old and too sharp to make a proper private in secondary school a million years before shed had a little german this past year shed done her best to forget it and hoped her transcript had perished when kiev was lost knowing the enemys language could easily make one an object of suspicion if these soldiers had little or no russian though it would prove useful she dredged a phrase out of her memory wie heissen she the germans worn filthy faces lit up till now theyd been nearly mute tonguetied among the russians which was also the root meaning of nemtsi the old russian word for germans those who could make no intelligible sounds the gingerwhiskered one grinned and said ich heisse feldwebel georg schultz fraulein and rattled off his pay number too fast for her to follow the older one said ich heisse heinrich jager major and also gave his number she ignored it it wasnt something she needed to know right now the kolkhozniks murmured among themselves either impressed she could speak to the wehrmacht men in their own tongue or mistrustful of her for the same reason swished she recalled more she had to ask their unit by clumsy circurrtion from which group of men do you come e sergeant started to answer the major his name meant hunter ludmila thought he certainly had a hunters eyes cleared his throat which sufficed to make the younger man shut up jager said are we prisoners of war russian pilot you may ask only certain things of prisoners of war he spoke slowly clearly and simply perhaps he recognized ludmilas hesitancy with his language nyet she answered and then nein in case he hadnt understood the russian he was nodding as she spoke so evidently he had she went on you are not prisoners of war we fight the she perforce had to say yasheritsi not knowing the german word for lizards first we fight germans now only if germans fight us not forget war against germany but put it to one side for now ah the major said yes that is good we fight the lizards first also eidechsen was what the german said ludmila made a mental note of it jager went on since we have this common foe i will tell you that harry turtledove we are from sixteenth panzer i will also tell you that schultz and i have together killed a lizard panzer she stared at him this is true radio moscow made all sorts of claims of lizard armor destroyed but she had flown over too many battlefields to take them seriously any more shed seen what was left of german panzer units that tried to take on the lizards too not much were these tankmen lying to impress her with how masterful the germans remained no she decided after a moment of watching and listening to them they described the action in too much vivid detail for her to doubt them if they hadnt been through what they were talking about they belonged on the stage not in the middle of a collective farm most convincing of all was jagers mournful summary at the end we hurt them but they wrecked us all my companys tanks are gone what are they saying comrade pilot pavlyuchenko demanded she quickly translated the kolkhozniks gaped at the germans as if they were indeed the superior beings they claimed to be their wide eyes made ludmila want to kick them russians always looked on germans with a peculiar mixture of envy and fear ever since the days of the vikings the russian people had learned from more sophisticated germanic folk to the west and ever since the days of the vikings the germanic peoples had looked to seize what they could from their slavic neighbors teutonic knights swedes prussians germans the labels changed but the germanic push to the east seemed to go on forever though latest and worst hitler was but one of many still these particular germans could be useful they hadnt beaten the lizards far from it but theyd evidently made them sit up and take notice soviet authorities needed to learn what they knew ludmila returned to their language i will take you with me when i fly back to my base and send you on from there i promise nothing bad will happen to you what if we dont care to go asked the major jager she reminded herself she did her best to put authority in her gaze if you do not go you will at best wander on foot and alone maybe you will find lizards maybe you will find russians who think you are worse than lizards maybe these kolkhozniks are only waiting for you to fall asleep the panzer major was a cool customer he did not turn to give kliment pavlyuchenko a onceover which meant hed already formed his judgment of the chief he did say why should i trust your promises ive seen the bodies of germans you russians caught they ended up with their noses and ears cut off or worse how do i know sergeant schultz and i wont wind up the same way the injustice of that almost choked ludmila if you nazi swine hadnt invaded our country we never would have harmed a one of you worldwar in the balance ive seen with my own eyes what you do to the part of the soviet union you took you should have everything you get she glared at jager he glared back then georg schultz surprised her and by his expression the major as well by saying krieg ist scheissewar is shit he surprised her again when he came up with two russian words voina gavno which meant the same thing da the kolkhozniks roared as one they crowded round the sergeant slapping his back pressing cigarettes and coarse makhorka tobacco into his hands and tunic pockets all at once he was not an enemy to them but a human being turning back to jager ludmila pointed at the kolkhozniks and the gunner this is why we have stopped fighting germans who do not fight us and why i can say no harm will come to you germany and soviet union are enemies da people and lizards are worse enemies you speak well and as you say we have little choice jager pointed to her faithful kukuruznik will that ugly little thing carry three not with comfort but yes she answered stifling her anger at the adjective hed chosen one corner of his mouth tugged upward in an expression she had trouble interpreting a smile she supposed but not like any shed seen on a russian face more like a dry white wine than a simple vodka he said how do you know that once we get into the air we will not make you fly us toward german lines i do not have the petrol to reach the nearest i know of she said also the most you can make me do is fly into the ground and kill us i will not fly west tudied her for perhaps half a minute that curious ironic smile stilllis face slowly he nodded you are a soldier yes she said and found she had to return the compliment and you so you must understand why we need to learn how you killed a lizard panzer wasnt hard schultz put in they have wonderful panzers to ride around in ja but theyre even worse tankmen than you ivans had he said that in russian he would have forfeited the goodw ill hed won from the kolkhozs farmers as it was ludmila gave him a dirty look so did kliment pavlyuchenko who seemed to have a smattering of german he is right jager said which distressed ludmila more for she was convinced the majors judgment needed to be taken seriously you cannot deny our pnzer troops have more skills than yours pilot he gave the word a feminine ending or we could never have advanced in our panzer iiis against your kvs and ts the lizards have even less skill than you russians but their tanks are so good they do not need much if we had comparable equipment we would slaughter them harry turtledove so here is german arrogance at first hand ludmila thought having admitted the lizards had smashed his unit to bits all the panzer major cared to talk about was the foes shortcomings ludmila said since our equipment is unfortunately not a match for theirs how do we go about fighting them das ist die frage sergeant schultz said solemnly for all the world like a nazi hamlet jagers mouth quirked up once more this time he raised an eyebrow too ludmila found herself smiling back if only to show that shed noticed the allusion and was no uncultured peasant the german turned serious we must find places and situations where they cannot use to best advantage all they have as the partisans fight behind your lines ludmila asked hoping to flick him on a raw spot but he only nodded exactly so we are all partisans now when set against the forces we aim to oppose somehow his refusal to take offense irritated her brusquely she pointed back toward her airplane the two of you will have to go into the front cabin side by side keep your machine pistols if you like i do not try to take your arms away but sergeant i hope you will leave your rifle behind here it will not she had to pantomime the word fit in a small space and may help the kolkhozniks against the lizards schultz glanced to jager ludmila eased fractionally when she saw the major give an almost invisible nod schultz presented the mauser to kliment pavlyuchenko with a flourish startled at first the collective farm chief folded him into a bear hug when the sergeant broke free he went through his pockets for every round of rifle ammunition he could find then he set a foot in the stirrup and climbed up into the u jager followed him a moment later the space into which they were crammed was so tight that they ended up sitting half facing each other each with an arm around the others back would you care to kiss me sir schultz asked jager snorted ludmila had the back cabin the one with working controls to herself at hershouted direction a kolkhoznik spun the little biplanes prop the sturdy radial engine buzzed to life the two germans set their jaws against the noise but otherwise ignored it she remembered they had their own intimate acquaintance with engine noise when she saw all the peasants were clear of her takeoff path she released the brakes eased the stick forward the kukuruznik needed a longer run than shed expected before it labored into the air a sedate performer under the best of conditions it was positively sluggish or better sluglike with more than three times the usual crew weight aboard but it flew the collective farm receded behind it as it made its slow way north worldwar in the balance be alert for big uglies both of you krentel warned from the cupola of the landcruiser it shall be done commander ussmak agreed the driver wished the male newly in charge of the landcruiser would shut up and let the crew do their jobs it shall be done telerep echoed ussmak envied the way the gunner could keep the faintest hint of scorn from his voice what telerep had to say privately about krentel would addle an egg but he was all respect when the landcruiser commander was around males of the race learned to show respect from their smallest days but telerep was unusually smooth even by that high standard maybe ussmak thought his lowvoiced gibes about krentel were a reaction to the need for public deference or maybe not telerep had never talked that way about votal when the previous commander was alive thinking about votal made ussmak think about the big uglies who had killed him and did more to make him alert than all of krentels warnings the natives of tosev had learned in a hurry that they could not oppose the race landcruiser against landcruiser aircraft against aircraft that lesson should have marked the end of conquest and the beginning of consolidation so officers had promised the males of the invasion force when battle commenced the promises had not come true the big uglies stopped throwing hordes of males and landcruisers and planes into the grinder to be minced up but they hadnt stopped fighting thus this landcruiser squadron kept rolling over the broad cool steppeland of the sssr seeking to flush out a band of tosevite raiders and bushwhackers who had shown up on a reconnaissance photo the day before yail from the sky rockets telerep shrieked ussmak had alreadylrammed the hatch shut over his head a moment later a metallic clang in the button taped to his hearing diaphragm announced that krentel had done the same ussmak twiddled his fingers in approval previous appearances to the contrary notwithstanding the new commander wasnt a complete idiot the salvo of rockets slammed down all around the landcruisers their warheads kicked up great gouts of earth blinding one of ussmaks vision slits closed in as he suddenly was he couldnt hear very much but he knew he would have heard a landcruiser going up when he didnt he took it for a good sign krentel meanwhile had been on the command circuit with base the range of the launcher is bearing he reported gunner send the big uglies back there two rounds of high explosive that will make them think twice about harassing the race again two rounds of high explosive it shall be done telerep said tonelessly the turret spun in its ring until it faced more nearly south than harry turtledove west the big gun barked twice two or three of the other landcruisers in the squadron also fired though none more than once ussmak thought all those commanders fools and krentel a double fool he doubted the big uglies who had fired the salvo were anywhere near their launcher any more if they had any sense theyd have touched it off with a long electric wire thats what he would have done in their place certainly and they made better guerrillas than standup soldiers krentel told him shift to bearing driver i want to finish off that clutch of bandits they shall not flourish within the bounds of territory controlled by the race bearing it shall be done ussmak said he swung the landcruiser almost in a half circle drove back in a direction close to the one from which the squadron had advanced this time he admitted to himself krentel had a point watch the ground carefully the commander added we must not risk driving over a mine our landcruiser like every other is precious to the race and its expansion exert unusual caution it shall be done ussmak repeated he wished krentel would stop jumping around like a female waiting for her first pair of eggs how was he supposed to get a good look at the ground while driving buttoned up he didnt want to open his hatch not yet the big uglies had a habit of lobbing a second rocket salvo just about when males were taking a deep breath after the first one even if his head was out in the open he didnt think hed spot a buried mine the tosevites were extraordinarily good at concealing them under leaves or stones or chunks of the rubble that littered the area from previous battles he took comfort in remembering the tosevite mines were designed to disable the weak and clumsy landcruisers the big uglies built even if one exploded right under his own machine it might not wreck it looking at it with the other eye turret though it might sure enough more rockets rained down on the squadron krentel must have reopened the hatch at the top of his cupola for ussmak heard him slam it again in a hurry the driver opened his jaws in amusement no the new commander wasnt as smart as he thought he was with luck hed learn a clump of low tosevite trees their colors duller than the ones of home stood by the landcruisers path about halfway to the place from which the natives had touched off their rockets ussmak thought about warning telerep to fix his machine gun on those trees but decided not to telerep knew his business perfectly well and besides watch those trees gunner before ussmak could finish thinking krentel would give the unnecessary order krentel gave it it shall be done commander again telereps subordination was perfect worldwar in the balance ussmak watched the trees too just because the order was unnecessary didnt make it stupid if he were a big ugly bandit hed post males in those trees to see what he could do about the races landcruisers in fact if krentel had been reading his mind before now telerep was the gunner fired a burst into the little stretch of wood with luck hed kill a big ugly or two and flush out some more ussmak wouldnt have wanted to crouch in hiding while bullets snarled through the trees searching for him and sure enough he spied motion at the edge of the trees so did telerep tracers walked the machine gun toward it then ussmak shouted hold fire the stream of bullets had already stopped telerep did know his business krentel didnt why are you holding he demanded angrily its not a big ugly commander just one of the animals they keep for pets the gunner answered in soothing tones be a waste of ammunition to kill it besides for a creature covered with fuzz its not even that homely yes it is krentel said ussmak sided with telerep hed seen several of these animals now and thought them far more handsome than their masters they were lean and graceful obviously descended from hunting beasts they were also friendly hed heard that a couple of males from another squadron had used raw meat to tame one and get a pet of their own i still think we ought to kill it krentel said oh please no commander ussmak and telerep said in the same breath the gunner added see how nice a creature it is its coming straiz toward us even though were in a big noisy landcruiser at doesnt make it nice krentel said that makes it stupid if you ask me but he did not order telerep to kill the tosevite animal taking the commanders silence as consent ussmak slowed the landcruiser to let the animal approach that seemed to please it it opened its mouth almost as if it were a male of the race laughing ussmak knew it was making sharp yelping noises even if he couldnt hear them through the landcruisers armor the animal ran right for the machine that gave ussmak pause maybe it really was stupid as krentel had said then the driver noticed it had a square package strapped onto its back a package with a cylindrical rod sticking straight up from it hed never seen one of these beasts so accoutered before and didnt trust it telerep he said sharply i think youd better shoot it after all what why the gunner said it he must have spotted the package the tosevite animal was carrying for the machine gun started to chatter in the middle of his sentence too late by then the animal was very close to the landcruiser with a sudden burst of speed it ran under the right track even though ussmak harry turtledove tried to swerve away at the last instant the strappedon mine exploded even as the animal was crushed to red pulp ussmak felt as if hed been kicked in the base of the tail by a big ugly wearing solidiron foot coverings the landcruisers right corner lifted up then slammed back to the ground hot fragments of metal flew all around the driver one buried itself in his arm he screeched then started to choke as firefighting foam gushed into the compartment he opened and closed his hand that hurt but he could still use it he tried the landcruisers controls the tiller jerked a horrible grinding noise came from the right side of the machine he snapped his jaws in fury swore as foully as he knew how then he realized krentel and telerep were both screaming into his audio button what happened are you all right is the landcruiser all right we had a track blown off may the spirits of the emperors of blessed memory curse the tosevites forevermore ussmak answered he sucked in another breath that stank of foam then spoke more formally commander this landcruiser is disabled i suggest that we have no choice but to abandon it he flipped up the hatch over his head let it be done krentel agreed his voice turned vicious i told you to slaughter that tosevite beast that hed been right made the rebuke sting worse as far as ussmak was concerned it didnt make him a better landcruiser commander the driver pulled himself up and out of the compartment it wasnt easy his bleeding right arm didnt want to bear its share of his weight he scrambled down behind the left side of the landcruiser he would have liked to find out just what the mine had done to the other track and sprocket but not enough to go around to the side exposed to the trees that animal hadnt been a wandering stray not with a mine strapped to its back somewhere in the copse lay big uglies with guns he was as sure of it as he was of his own name or the emperors sure enough bullets began snapping by pinging off the armor of the landcruiser krentel let out a hiss of pain are you all right commander ussmak said he still didnt think krentel was fit to carry votals equipment bag but the new landcruiser commander remained a male of the race no im not all right krentel snapped how can i be all right with a hole in my arm and two crewmales who are mental defectives i regret your arm is wounded ussmak said he wished the commander had been hit in the head instead those of lower rank gave unswerving deference to their superiors that was the way of the race but the way of the race defined obligations that ran in the other direction too superiors gave underlings respect in exchange for their loyalty those who didnt often brought misfortune on themselves along with ussmak and krentel telerep also huddled behind the pro worldwar in the balance tective flank of the landcruiser he waggled his left eye the one that faced ussmak back and forth to show he was thinking along with the driver krentel remained oblivious to the dismay he caused his crew a couple of the other landcruisers in the squadron slowed down poured suppressive fire into the trees the hail of bullets and highexplosive shells was so intense that the wood caught fire but when ussmak dashed away to scramble into the landcruiser that had pulled up behind his own wounded machine tosevite bullets flew all around him he heard one of those bullets strike home with a dull horribly finalsounding smack he couldnt look back he was scrambling through the front hull hatch almost falling down on top of the other landcruisers driver that male swore one of your crewmales just got hit he wont get up either was it but it wasnt ussmak knew for there was krentel nattering away over nothing in particular up in the turret telerep the driver thought with a surge of pain theyd been together all through training theyd awakened from cold sleep side by side within moments of each other with votal theyd fought their landcruiser across this seemingly endless plain now votal was dead and the landcruiser and telerep and there was krentel nattering the big uglies are getting too stinking good at this ambush business the driver of the other landcruiser said ussmak didnt answer hed never felt so completely alone among the race one always knew ones place in the mosaic and the places of those all around one now all those around ussmak were gone like fallen tesserae and he felt himself rattling around in the middle of a void the landcruiser grunted into motion once more and sensibly so no poi staying still an instant longer than needed the tosevites didnt neednore than a moment to work the most appalling mischief as the armored fighting vehicle built up speed ussmak began to rattle around literally as well as in the bitter corners of his mind here though he was not in the middle of a void the drivers compartment barely had room to hold an extra male worse everything from foam spray nozzle to the bracket that held the drivers personal weapon on the wall was hard and had sharp edges hed never noticed that while he was in the drivers chair the chair of course had padding and safety belts to hold him where he belonged now he was just jetsam tossed in here at random too bad about your other crewmale the other driver said as he shoved the landcruiser up into the next higher gear how did your machine get hit so ussmak had to tell him about the tosevite animal with the mine on its back and how a moments kindness had cost so much he felt halfstrangled as he spoke he couldnt begin to say what he thought about ei harry turtledove there krentel or telerep not even to a male who was a squadronmate he hissed helplessly that void around him again the driver hissed too yes i know the beasts you mean we havent bothered them either now i suppose well have to shoot them on sight if the eggless big uglies have taken to strapping mines on their backs too bad yes ussmak said and fell silent again rattle rattle rattle a little later the driver of the other landcruiser made a sharp disgusted noise theyre gone he said recalled to himself ussmak asked whos gone he had no vision slits not in his present awkward perch and no way of seeing outside the big uglies all thats here is a couple of wrecked launcher boxes for their stinking rockets not even any dead ones lying around they must have touched them off at long range then run away the driver clicked off the intercom switch that connected him to the turret before he added one quiet sentence more this whole trip back here was for nothing for nothing the words reverberated inside ussmaks head for nothing krentel had ordered them to turn around for nothing his landcruiser had been wrecked for nothing telerep had caught a bullet for nothing ussmak huddled here on a steel and ceramic floor about as useful to the race as the sack of dried meat he felt like for nothing the other driver still secure in his web of duties rather than all alone and falling let out a sigh of both annoyance and infuriating to ussmak resignation so it goes he said lwo or three times in his travels through the bush leagues sam yeager had had to dig in at the plate against every hitters nightmare a fireballing kid who couldnt find the plate if you lit it up like times square whenever he did it he faced a deadly weapon at the time he hadnt thought about it in quite those terms but it was true the worst sound in baseball was the mushy splat of a ball getting somebody in the head hed seen friends lose careers in an instant of inattention and bad lights he knew it was only luck he hadnt lost his the same way all that helped now against weapons more overtly deadly when bombs and bullets flew a tin hat seemed small protection for that matter a tin hat was small protection yeager had seen more than one man gruesomely dead helmet holed or smashed in or simply blown right off but he wore his gladly as better than nothing come to that he wouldnt have minded wearing it or even something that covered rather more whenever het to bat against a hardthrowing righthander peeked up from behind the blackened pile of bricks which until recently had been the back wall of a drycleaning establishment its sign lay fallen in the middle of main street he ducked down again in a hurry a lizard autogiro was growling through the air toward him the invaders from space were trying to push the ragtag american force of which he was a part out of amboy and trap them against the green river where thered be easy prey when he said that out loud mutt daniels grunted and answered reckon youre right boy but were gonna have the devils own time stoppin em a roar in the sky yeager automatically threw himself flat hed learned that even before he took the soldiers oath and had it reinforced when a fellow a few feet from him got smashed to a red smear for being a split second too slow to hit the dirt but the roar came from two pistonengined fighters that streaked west toward the autogiro the machine guns of the p warhawks hammered harry turtledove yeager stuck his head up again the autogiro was firing back and turning in midair to try to flee the lizards jets far outclassed anything humanity could make but their flying troop carriers were vulnerable the warhawks whizzed past the autogiro one to the right the other to the left they banked into tight turns for another firing pass but no need the lizard machine spurting smoke from just below the rotor settled to the ground in what was half landing half crash the fighters darted away before anything more dangerous appeared over the horizon yeager scowled to see live lizards scuttling out of the autogiro they left too soon he growled it wasnt a clean kill mutt daniels worked the bolt on his springfield to chamber a new round means its up to us dont it moving with a grace that belied his fleshy form he scuttled forward yeager followed he also had a rifle now taken from a man who would never need one again back on the farm where hed grown up hed shot at tin cans and gophers and the occasional crow with his fathers the military weapon he carried now was heavier and kicked harder but that wasnt the main difference from those vanished days when he shot at tin cans or gophers or crows they didnt shoot back a heavy machine gun began to bark up near the intersection of main street and highway pieces flew off the lizards autogiro and sparkled in the sunlight as they twirled through the air as for the lizards themselves they took cover with the speed and alacrity of their small reptilian namesakes one by one they opened fire their weapons chewed out short bursts not the endless racket of a bltfed machine gun but not single shots either was that a flicker of motion over there behind the ornamental hedge yeager didnt care to find out the hard way he threw his rifle to his shoulder and fired he scurried away to a new position before he looked toward the hedge again nothing moved there now another rumble in the air this one from the southwest yeager fired at the incoming autogiro but it stayed out of rifle range flame shot from under its stubby wings with a cry of fear yeager buried his face in grass and mud the rockets burst all around him lances of fire that lashed the american position the heavy machine gun fell silent through stunned ears yeager heard the lizards on the ground moving forward then another roar announced that the warhawks had returned their guns tore at the new autogiro this time they did the job right the aircraft slammed the ground sideways and became a fireball smoke rose into the blue sky it was less smoke than would have come from a humanbuilt plane the lizards used cleaner fuel but fuel wasnt all that burned in there seats palnt ammunition the bodies of the crew they all went up worldwar in the balance cheering the americans moved forward against the lizards careful there you goddamned fools sergeant schneider bellowed trying to shout over battlefield din you want to stay low as if to underscore the advice someone who hadnt stayed low enough suddenly pitched forward onto his face the warhawks came back to strafe the lizards on the ground something rose on a pillar of fire from behind a boulder in the middle of a main street lawn that marked a spot where lincoln had spoken the p fled twisting with all the skill the pilot had it was not enough the rocket tumbled it from the sky damn if it didnt look like a fourth of july skyrocket right down to the big boom at the end daniels said it flew like it had eyes yeager said thinking of the turning path the rocket had scrawled across the sky i wonder how they make it do that right now i got more important things to wonder about like if im gonna be alive this time tomorrow mutt said yeager nodded but his bump of curiosity still itched writers in astounding and the other pulps had talked about detection devices for as long as hed been reading them and likely longer than that hed discovered on the night the invaders from space descended on the world that living through science fiction was a lot stranger and a lot more deadly than just reading it a hiss in the sky a whistle a noise like a train pulling into a station an artillery shell burst among the embattled lizards then another and another dirt fountained skyward the enemys fire slackened yeager didnt know whether the lizards were killed or hurt or just playing pon but he used the lull to slide closer to them and also closer to wli the shells were landing he wished he hadnt thought of that but kept crawling ahead a lizard plane shot past heading east yeager cringed but the pilot wasted no time on a target as trivial as infantry no doubt he wanted that battery of field gus the shells kept coming for about another minute maybe two then abruptly stopped by that time though yeager and the other americans were on top of the lizard position surrender sergeant schneider shouted yeager was sure he was wasting his breath where would the lizards have learned english and even if they had would they quit they seemed more like japs than any other people yeager knew of at least they were small and liked sneak attacks japs didnt surrender for hell so would the lizards one of them had got some english god knew where no ssrenda came the reply a dry hiss that made the hair stand up on yeagers arms a burst of machinerifle fire added an exclamation point the burst was close close yeager grabbed a grenade pulled the pin lobbed it as if he were aiming for a cutoff man it flew toward the concrete harry turtledove block fence behind which he thought the lizard who didnt want to surrender was hiding he didnt see it go over by the time it did he was behind his own cover once more he hadnt needed more than one or two bullets snapping past his head to learn that lesson forever the grenade went off with a crash before the echoes died yeager sprinted up to the gray fence he fired over it once twice blindly if the lizard wasnt badly hurt he wanted to rattle it as much as he could then gulping he vaulted over the fence into the alleyway on the other side the lizard was down and thrashing and horribly wounded its red red blood stained the gravel of the alley yeagers stomach did a slow lazy loop hed never expected the agony of a creature from another world to reach him but it did the lizard yammered something in its own incomprehensible language yeager had no idea whether it was defiance or a plea for mercy all he wanted to do was put the alien out of its misery and make it be quiet he raised his rifle shot it through the head it twitched once or twice then lay still yeager let out a whistling sigh of relief hed thought too late that it didnt necessarily have to store its brains in its head he wondered if that would have occurred to any of the men fighting around him probably not sciencefiction readers were thin on the ground as things worked out it hadnt mattered anyway he bent over the scaly corpse scooped up the machine rifle the lizard had carried he was amazed at how light it was somebody he thought would have to take it apart and figure out how it worked sergeant schneidler yelled again surrender you lizards throw down your guns give up and we wont hurt you yeager thought he was wasting his breath but the bursts of enemy fire quickly ceased schneider came out in the open with something white it was a bygod pillowcase yeager saw tied to his rifle he waved toward the houses and stores in which the last few lizards were holed up then made a peremptory gesture no human could have misunderstood come out from behind yeager mutt daniels said he oughta get the medal of honor for that yeager nodded trying not to show how shaken he was he hadnt heard his manager no his exmanager now he supposed come up at all sergeant schneider simply stood and waited his big feet splayed apart his belly hanging over his belt he looked as though he would have made three of the dead lizard sprawled by yeager he looked hard and tough and quintessentially human seeing him defy the lizards machine rifles yeager felt tears sting under the lids of his eyes he was proud to belong to a people that could produce such a man after the hammering racket of battle silence seemed strange wrong almost frightening the eerie pause hung in the balance for almost half a minute then a door opened in one of the houses from which the lizards had been fighting without conscious thought on yeagers part his rifle snapped toward it schneider held up a hand ordering the americans not to shoot a lizard came slowly through the doorway he hadnt dropped his weapon but held it reversed by the barrel like sergeant schneider hed fastened something white to the other end the shape was familiar to yeager but he needed a moment to place it all at once he bent double in a guffaw what is it mutt daniels asked between chuckles yeager wheezed first time i ever saw anybody make a flag of truce out of a pair of womens panties huh mutt stared then started laughing too if the improvised white flag amused sergeant schneider he didnt let on he gestured again come here the lizard came moving with careful deliberation rather than his kinds usual quick skitter when he got within about twenty feet of schneider the sergeant pointed to his machine rifle then to the ground he did it two or three times before the lizard even more hesitantly than before set the weapon down schneider made another come here gesture the lizard came it flinched when he put an arm around it but it did not flee it came up to only the middle of his chest schneider turned to where the rest of the lizards were holed up you see no harm will come to you surrender jesus theyre really doing it yeager whispered looks that way dont it mutt daniels whispered back the lizards emerged from their hiding places there were only five more of them yeager saw and two of those were wounded leaning on thef llows the lizard who had surrendered first called something to thell the three with machine rifles set them down what are we going to do with hurt lizards yeager asked if theyre proper prisoners of war we have to try and take care of them but do we yell for a medic or a vet hell i dont even know if they can eat our food i dont know either and frankly i dont give a damn round and pudgy and filthy mutt made a most unlikely rhett butler he shifted the plug in his cheek spat and went on its right nice though havin prisoners of theirn not so much on account of what they can tell us but to keep em honest with all of our people they got something to that yeager wondered what had happened to the rest of the decatur commodores nothing good he feared remembering how the lizards had strafed their train the invaders could do whatever they pleased throughout big stretches of the united states if holding prisoners hostages would help restrain them yeager was all for it along with the rest of the americans he hurried forward at sergeant schneiders waved command to take charge of the alien pows having harry turtledove surrendered the lizards seemed abjectly submissive hurrying to obey the soldiers gestures as best they could even to invaders from space come along and this way were easy enough to put across schneider seemed convinced the band he led with everything from officers to weapons to organization in short supply slapping a more formally military name than that on it was optimistic had done something important we want to get these scaly sons of bitches out of here and back up to ashton just as fast as we can before more of em come along he told off half a dozen men you you you you you and you yeager was the fourth you mutt daniels the fifth get back to the bus that brought us here and take em away on it the rest of usil dig in and hope we see more men before the lizards decide to push harder good lord willing you can drop em off and head down this way again inside a couple of hours now get your butts in gear flanked by men with loaded bayonettipped rifles the lizards picked their way through and over debris toward the yellow school bus that had been pressed into service as a troop hauler yeager would have preferred the dignity of a proper khaki army truck but up at ashton a school bus was what they had the key was still in the bus ignition otto chase looked at it with a certain amount of apprehension anybody here able to drive this big honking thing the onetime cementplant worker asked i reckon sam and i just might be able to handle it mutt daniels said with a sidelong glance at yeager the ballplayer puffed up his cheeks like a chipmunk to hold in his laughter after half a lifetime bouncing around in buses helping to repair them by the side of the road pushing them when they broke down there wasnt a whole lot about them he didnt know mutt moreover had been bouncing around in buses essentially ever since there were buses if there was anything about them he didnt know yeager had no idea what it was daniels waited for the rest of the men to herd the lizards to the wide rear seat then started the engine turned the bus around in a street most people would have thought too narrow for turning around a bus and headed back to ashton he stayed off highway and highway preferring the backcountry roads less likely to draw attention from the air raising his voice to be heard over the noise of the motor he said reminds me of the country just back of the front line in france in right where the boches got farthest parts of it are all tore up but you go fifty yards on and youd swear nobody ever heard o war the description was apt yeager thought most of the farms that sprawled among belts of forest between amboy and ashton were untouched men wearing widebrimmed hats and overalls worked in several fields cows grazed here and there black and white splotches vivid against worldwar in the balance the cheerful green of grass and growing crops by the calm way life went on the nearest lizard might have been ten billion lightyears off but every so often the bus would rattle past a bomb or shell crater an ugly brown scar on the lands smooth green skin there were cattle by those craters too cattle on their sides bloating under the warm summer sun and a couple of the neat frame farm buildings were neither neat nor buildings any longer but more like a giants game of pickupsticks fat crows startled by the bus racket flapped into the air cawing resentment at having their feasting interrupted still as mutt had said the eye could mostly forget the war whose border the bus had just left behind the nose had a harder time yeager wondered if the faint reek of smoke and corruption simply clung to him the other americans and the lizards if it came in through the open windows of the bus from the lightly damaged countryside through which they were driving or if the breeze which was out of the west swept it along the front line the four unwounded lizards did what they could for the two who were hurt it wasnt much the humans had stripped them of the belts that along with their helmets were all they wore no telling what deadly marvels they might have concealed inside yeager had never thought about how invaders from space might feel if they were wounded and captured by humans who were as alien to them as they were to people they didnt look allpowerful or supremely evil they just looked worried in their shoes he would have been worried too he picked up one of the belts started opening pouches before long he found what looked like a bandage wrapped in some clear stuff smoother anore pliable than cellophane if it concealed a deadly marvel he decidd hed eat his helmet he pushed past the rest of the americans who still had their rifles leveled at the lizards and held out the bandage pack what the hell you doing otto chase growled who cares whether them damn things live or die if theyre prisoners of war were supposed to treat em decent yeager answered besides they hold a lot more of our kind than we do of theirs tormenting em might not be what you call smart chase grunted and subsided the lizards eyes swiveled from yeagers face to the bandage and back again they reminded him of the chameleon hed seen at the zoo in was it salt lake maybe spokane whichever it was a long time ago now one of the lizards took the bandage pack in its small hand as it used its claws to tear open the wrapping it hissed something at yeager it and all its companions even the two injured ones lowered their turreted eyes to the floor of the bus for a second or two then it deftly began to bandage a gash in a wounded lizards flank harry turtledove paw through those belts yeager said over his shoulder see if you can find some more bandages he was afraid the others would argue more but they didnt he heard their feet shift somebody he didnt look back to see whohanded him another pack and then another he passed them on to the lizards by the time the bus pulled up in front of the mills and petrie memorial center in ashton the injured lizards were swathed in enough gauze to make them look like something halfway between real wounded soldiers and boris karloff as the mummy men in army khaki civilian denim and plaid flannel and every possible combination thereof milled around in front of the stone and yellow brick building through the open drivers window mutt daniels yelled we got lizard prisoners in here what the devil we supposed to do with em that drew all the attention he wanted and then some people converged on the school bus at a dead run some pushing and elbowing followed as men of higher rank made those below them give way the first officer who actually got into the bus was a full colonel the highestranking fellow yeager had seen in ashton when hed joined up a couple of weeks before sergeant schneider had been the highestranking soldier in ashton tell me how you took them soldier he said in a drawl almost as thick as mutts theyre some of the very first lizard captives weve managed to get our hands on yes sir colonel collins daniels answered reading the name badge on the officers right breast pocket he ended up telling only part of the story though for the rest of the men yeager among them kept interrupting with details of their own sam knew that wasnt showing proper military discipline but he didnt care if this colonel collins whoever he was didnt want to listen to americans speaking their minds to hell with him collins listened without complaint when the story was done he said you boys had the luck of the devil i hope you know that hadnt been for those warhawks takin out the enemy helicopters so thats the right name for them yeager thought you couldye had a mighty thin time of it the colonel strode down the center aisle of the bus to get a closer look at the lizards like almost everyone else in the still free part of the united states he hadnt yet really seen any of them he brushed past yeager studied the prisoners for a couple of minutes then turned back to their captors dont look like so much do they no sir yeager said in chorus with the other americans collins he thought looked like quite a lot the colonel was about mutts age but with that and their accents the resemblance between them ceased collins was tall still slim handsome with a full head of silver hair he didnt worldwar in the balance keep a chaw in his cheek without the uniform yeager would have guessed him a politician say the mayor of a mediumsized and prosperous city he said you boys did somethin special here ill see youre all promoted for it all the men grinned mutt said sergeant schneider back there in amboy he deserves a big part o the credit sir yeager nodded vigorously ill see that he gets it then collins promised any time privates speak well of a sergeant when hes not around to hear it i reckon hes some sort of special man as the soldiers chuckled collins went on now the thing we have to do is get these lizards someplace where they can be studied by people who have a chance of figuring out what theyre all about and what theyre up to yeager spoke up ill help get em there sir colonel collins fixed him with a cold gray stare you so eager to get out of the front line eh soldier no sir that doesnt have a thing to do with it yeager said first flustered and then angry he wondered if collins had ever been in the front line maybe during the first world war he admitted to himself he didnt know how to read the fruit salad of service ribbons on the colonels left breast why should i pick you in particular then collins demanded best reason i can think of sir is that ive been reading science fiction for a long time ive been thinking about men from mars and invaders from space a lot longer and harder than anybody else youre likely to find sir collins was still staring at him but not in the same way damned if i know what kind of answer i expected but thats not it youre saying yc more likely to be mentally flexible around these zhings than so fone chosen at random are you yes sir yeager hadnt been in the army long but hed learned in a hurry not to promise too much so he hedged i hope so sir anyhow like managers officers earn their pay by making up their minds in a hurry and then following through after what couldnt have been more than a tensecond pause collins said okay soldier you want it so bad youve got it your name is samuel yeager sir yeager said saluting he could hardly keep the grin off his face as he spelled yeager the colonel pulled out a little notebook and a goldplated mechanical pencil he was yeager saw a southpaw he put the notebook away as soon as hed jotted down sams name all right private yeager mutt daniels spoke up ought to be coporal yeager sir or at least pfc when collins turned to frown at him he went on blandly you did say you were promotin us yeager wished mutt had kept his mouth shut and waited for colonel harry turtledove collins to get angry instead the colonel burst out laughing i know an old soldier when i hear one tell me you werent in france and ill call you a liar cant do it sir mutt said with a wide ingratiating smile that kept a lot of umpires from throwing him out of the game no matter how outrageously he carried on you better not try collins gave his attention back to sam all right pfc yeager you will serve as liaison to these lizard prisoners until they are delivered to competent authorities in chicago he took out his notebook again wrote rapidly as he tore out a couple of sheets he added these orders give discretion to your superiors in chicago they may send you back here or they may let you stay on with the lizards if you show youre more valuable in that role thank you sir yeager exclaimed pocketing the orders collins gave him they reminded him of bobby fiores brief tryout with albany if he didnt perform right away theyd ship him out and never give him another chance to show he could do the job but he wouldnt even get as long as bobbyd had theyd likely be in chicago tonight though god only knew who competent authorities were or how long it would take to find them still he had to get on the lizards good side in a hurry one way to do that seemed obvious sir if theres a doctor or medic out there to see to the wounds on these two collins nodded crisply he strode back to the door of the bus as if that were a signal all the lowerranking officers waiting outside swarmed toward it collins upraised hand did what king canute only dreamed of it held back the tide the colonel stuck his head out of the bus and shouted finkelstein sir a skinny fellow with glasses and a thick head of uncombed curly black hair pushed his way through the crowd hes a jew collins remarked but hes a damned fine doctor yeager would not have cared much if finkelstein were a negro it didnt matter one way or the other to the lizards that was for sure black bag in hand the doctor scrambled up into the bus whos hurt he asked in a thick new york accent then his eyes went wide oh come on yeager said if he was going to be lizard liaison he had to get on with the job he led finkelstein back to the lizards who had sat quietly through the colloquy with collins he hoped the creatures from another planet recognized him as the man who had let them have the bandages to bind up their wounds maybe they did they showed no agitation when he brought the doctor right up to them but when finkelstein made as if to tug at one of those bandages the unhurt lizards let out a volley of evilsounding hisses one of them stood up from his seat clawed hands outstretched how can you let them know im not going to do anything bad to them worldwar in the balance sam thought how the devil do i know but if he couldnt invent an answer somebody else would end up trying he hoped for inspiration and for once it came he handed his rifle to otto chase rolled up a sleeve make like youre putting a bandage on my arm then take it off again maybe theyll get the idea that thats what youre supposed to do yeah that might work finkelstein said enthusiastically he opened his medical bag took out a paperwrapped bandage hate to waste anything sterile he muttered as he opened it he wrapped it around yeagers arm his hands were deft and quick and gentle the lizards watched him intently yeager sighed and did his best to pantomime relief he had no idea whether he got the idea across to the lizards finkelstein undid the bandage then he tried moving toward one of the wounded prisoners again this time their uninjured companions though they hissed among themselves made no move to stop him the edge of a bandage came up easily its not tape the doctor said as much to himself as to yeager i wonder how it stays on he peeled it back further looked at the wound in the lizards side he let out a hiss of his own shell fragment id guess give me my bag soldier he grabbed a probe warn him this may hurt who me but this was what yeager had asked for he got the lizards attention pinched himself did his best to imitate the noises the wounded captives had made then he pointed to finkelstein the probe and the injury he looked at that as briefly as he could he found torn flesh to be torn flesh whether it belonged to man or lizard finkelstein slowly inserted the probe the wounded lizard sat very still then hissed and quivered at the same moment as the doctor exclaimed found it not too big and not too deep he withdrew the probe took out a pair of long thin grasping tongs almost there almost there ge his hands drew back the tongs came out of the wound clenchciron a halfinch sliver of metal a drop of the lizards blood fell from it to the floor of the bus all the alien prisoners even the wounded one spoke excitedly in their own language the one who had threatened the doctor with claws lowered his weird eyes toward the ground and stood very still yeager had seen the captives do that before it had to be a kind of salute he thought the doctor started to replace the bandage then paused and glanced toward yeager think i ought to dust the wound with sulfa can earth germs live on a thing from god knows where or would i be running a bigger risk of poisoning the lizard again yeagers first thought was how should i know why was a doctor asking medical questions of a minor league outfielder without a high school diploma then he realized that when it came to lizards he might not know a whole lot less than finkelstein after a few seconds thought he answered seems to me they must come from a planet that isnt too different than ours or they wouldnt want earth in the first place so maybe our germs would like them yeah that makes sense okay ill do it the doctor poured the yellow powder into the wound patted the bandage down it clung as well as it had before colonel collins walked to the back of the bus how are you doing doctor well enough sir thank you finkelstein nodded at yeager this is one sharp man you have here is he good collins headed up to the bus door again im sorry soldier the doctor said i dont even know your name im sam yeager pleased to meet you sir theres a kick in the head for you im sam finkelstein well sam shall we see what we can do for this other lizard here okay by me sam yeager said set of all the places jens larssen had ever expected to end up when he out from chicago to warn the government how important the metallurgical laboratorys work was white sulphur springs west virginia might have been the last staying at the same hotel as the german charge daffaires hadnt been high on his list of things to anticipate either but here he was at the greenbrier hotel by the famous springs and here again was hans thomsen the german had been interned here along with diplomats from italy hungary romania and japan when the united states entered the war thomsen had sailed back to germany on a swedish ship lit up to keep it safe from uboats in exchange for americans interned in germany now thomsen was back again in fact he had a room right across the hall from larssens down in the hotel dining room hed boomed in excellent english i was worried going home yes but coming back here once more on a dreadful little scow too small and ugly god be thanked for the lizards to notice then i was not worried i was far too seasick to think for a moment of being worried everyone who heard him laughed uproariously jens included having thomsen back in the united states was a forcible reminder that humanity had more important things to do than slaughtering itself it still made larssen nervous as far as he was concerned germany remained an enemy even if it happened to be forced into the same camp as the united states it was the same feeling hed had about allying with the russians against hitler but even stronger here not everybody in white sulphur springs agreed with him not by a long shot a lot of important people were here fled from washington when the government dispersed in the face of lizard air raids larssen had worldwar in the balance heard that roosevelt was here he didnt know whether it was true every new rumor put the president somewhere else back in washington in new york in philadelphia even in san francisco though how he was supposed to travel crosscountry with the lizards running loose was beyond jens larssen sighed walked over to the sink in his room to see if hed get any hot water he waited and waited but the stream stayed cold sighing he scraped whiskers off his face with that cold water lather from a hotelsized bar of lifebuoy soap and a razor blade that had definitely seen better days the resulting nicks tempted him to cultivate a beard his suits were wrinkled even his ties were wrinkled hed spent a long time getting here and service at the hotel ranged from lousy on down at that he knew damned well he was lucky no one in washington or white sulphur springs had heard from gerald sebring whod headed east from chicago by train instead of by car larssen stooped to tie his shoelaces one of them broke when he pulled at it swearing under his breath he got down on one knee and tied the lace back together then made his bow it was ugly but hed already found out how badly picked over the greenbriers little sundries store was it had been plundered first by axis diplomats and then by invading american bureaucrats he knew the place didnt have shoelaces maybe somebody in town did his nose wrinkled when he went out into the hall along with the brimstone odor of the springs it still smelled of the dogs and cats the interned diplomats had brought with them from washington really gives me an appetitefor breakfast he thought as he headed downstairs to the dining room blast didnt rate much of an appetite his choice was between stale tost with jam and corn flakes floating in reconstituted powdered milk either one cost jens suspected he might have to declare bankruptcy before he got out of white sulphur springs hed been making good money by wartime standards great money by the lean standards of the s but inflation headed straight for the roof when the lizards landed demand stayed high and they played merry hell with supply he ended up eating toast one taste of the powdered milk had been enough to last him a lifetime he left a niggardly tip and begrudged even that escaping quickly before the waiter could see how hed been stiffed larssen got his car and drove five miles into town to the methodist church to which hed been directed to report white sulphur springs was a beautiful little town it had probably been even more beautiful before herds of olivedrab trucks fouled the air with their exhaust and honked at each other like bellowing bulls disputing the right of way the antiaircraft guns which blossomed on every streetcorner also did little for the decor harry turtledove but even so the rolling greenclad slopes of the alleghenies the clear water of nearby sherwood lake and the fuming springs that gave the place its name made it easy for jens to understand why white sulphur springs had been a presidential resort in the days before the civil war when it was part of virginia and no one had ever imagined west virginia would become a separate state on the outside the whitepainted church with its tall steeple maintained the serenity the town sought to project one step through the door told larssen he had entered another world the pastor retained half his office but that was all from everywhere else came the clatter of typewriters the raucous chatter of people with too much to do and not enough time to do it and the purposeful clomp of governmentissue footgear on a hardwood floor a harassed corporal looked up from whatever he was typing seeing a veritable civilian before him he dispensed with even military politeness watcha want mac make it snappy i have a nine oclock appointment to see colonel groves larssen looked down at his watch he was five minutes early oh the corporal visibly shifted gears as he reassessed this civilians likely importance a good piece of his bigcity toughguy accent disappeared when he spoke again you want to come along with me sir thank you larssen followed the noncom through the pews on which more enlisted men were awkwardly working rather than praying crabwise down a hallway pinched by mountains of file boxes that clung like clots to either wall and into what had been the pastors sanctum new plywood partitions restricted that worthy to a fraction of his former domain the fraction thereof that lacked a telephone colonel leslie groves sat behind a desk that held said telephone he employed the instrument with vim and gusto what the hell do you mean you cant ship those tracks up to detroit so the bridge is out and the road has a hole in it so what get em on a barge the lizards arent blasting half the shipping they might the stupid bastards we have to get those tanks made or we can kiss everything goodbye ill call you tonight so i can keep up with what youre doing get it done fred i dont care how he hung up with no more of a goodbye than that fixed larssen with an intense blue stare youre from that chicago project it was not a question a flick of the colonels left hand dismissed the corporal thats right larssen wondered how much groves knew about it and how much he ought to tell him more than he wanted to he was already sure of that after berlin sir you have to know how important that project is and the lizards are advancing on chicago son we all got troubles groves rumbled he was a big man with auburn hair cut short a thin mustache and blunt competent features he worldwar in the balance filled the pastors chair to overflowing and sat well back from the desk a hefty belly kept him from getting any closer i know it jens said i mean i drove here from chicago after all sit down tell me about that groves urged ive been holed up here almost since the lizards came i ought to know more about the world outside than what i can find out over a phone line as if on cue the telephone jangled excuse me while the colonel barked instructions to someone on the other end of the line larssen perched on the uncomfortable chair in front of the desk and tried to marshal his thoughts groves gave him the impression of a man who worked hard every waking moment so he was ready when the handset went back into its cradle its not a trip im looking forward to reversing lizard planes are everywhere and i had to take the side roads up into upstate new york to get around the lizard pocket east of pittsburgh theyre in pittsburgh now groves said jens grunted the news didnt surprise him but it was like a kick in the belly just the same he made himself go on gas is hard as the devil to get i drove a few miles on a half gallon of grain alcohol i bought from a little old man i think was a moonshiner my engine hasnt been the same since either you kept going which is what counts groves said the alcohol was a good dodge one of the things were looking at is adapting engines to burn it in case the lizards hurt our refining capacity even worse than they have already if the revenuers havent been able to put a stop to stills damned if i see the lizards doing it i suppose not larssen agreed but the colonels words brought home to himhow bad things were somehow all the terror and trouble that had befallllim on the way from chicago all the horrors hed edited out of his bret account to groves seemed to have happened to him in isolation he could imagine other parts of the united states going on about their usual business while hell didnt seem half a mile off for him he could imagine it yes but groves was warning him it wasnt true he said as bad as that some places worse colonel groves said somberly the lizards are like a cancer on the country they dont just hurt the places where they are they hurt other places too because supplies cant go through the territory they hold the phone rang again groves delivered a crisp series of orders then returned to his conversation with jens without missing a beat they cut off our circulation you might say so we die inch by inch thats why the metallurgical laboratory is so important larssen said its our best chance at a weapon that will let us fight them on something like equal terms he decided to push a little washington could go the same way as berlin you know groves started to say something but was interrupted by the phone harry turtledove once more when he hung up he did say it you really think your people will be able to make an atomic bomb in time for us to get some use out of it were close to starting up a sustained reaction larssen said then he shut up even saying that much trampled on the security hed lived with ever since he became a part of the project the times though were not what they had been before the lizards proved atomic weapons didnt belong just on the pages of pulp magazines he added speaking of berlin nobody here knows how far along the germans are on their own special project no matter how things had changed he couldnt bring himself to say uranium to someone not in the know the germans groves scowled i hadnt thought of that nothings ever simple is it after berlin they have some kind of incentive to push ahead too heisenberg wasnt in the city when the bomb hit i hear if you know about heisenberg you know quite a bit about this larssen said surprised and impressed hed taken groves for just another man in a uniform if one more overstuffed than most the colonels gruff laugh said he understood what larssen was thinking i do try to remind myself im living in the twentieth century he noted dryly i spent a couple of years at mit before i got my west point ring and took an engineering doctorate afterward all of which and a nickel will buy me a cup of coffee or would have before the lizards came costs more now so you really think this gang of yotlrs is on to something do you yes i do colonel were too far along to make it easy for us to move too the lizards are advancing on chicago from the west and after my adventures coming east moving that way looks just about as risky if were going to go on doing our research the united states has to hold on to chicago groves rubbed his chin what we have to do and what we can do too often arent nearly the same thing these days worse luck anyway he tapped the eagle that perched on one shoulder dont have the authority to order us to hold chicago no matter what and forget about the other nine million emergencies all over the country i know that jens heart sank but youre the best contact ive made i was hoping you would oh i will son i will groves heaved his bulk out of the chair the phone rang again swearing groves flopped down again so hard larssen half expected the seat to break under him it held and groves as he had several times already crisply and authoritatively dealt with a new string of problems then he got up once more and went on talking as if hed never been interrupted ill run interference for you best i can but youre the one whos carrying the ball he stuck a foreandaft cap on his head lets go worldwar in the balance larssen had played football in high school if hed run the ball behind a lineman as huge as groves hed have put so many touchdowns on the board that people would have thought him the second coming of red grange the image made him smile where are we going he asked as groves pushed past him to see general marshall the colonel said over his shoulder he has the power to bind and to loose ґil get you in to talk to him today i hope after that its up to you thank you sir larssen said george marshall was army chief of staff if anyone could order chicago defended at all cost he was the man although against the lizards ordering something and having it come to pass were not the same thing hope rose in jens as he followed groves out into the street he drew in a lungful of air ripe not only with exhaust but also with the sulfurous reek of the springs groves took a deep breath too a grin made him look years younger that smell always reminds me of walking into a freshman chemistry lab it does by god jens hadnt made the connection but the colonel was absolutely right the very next breath brought with it memories of bunsen burners and reagent bottles with frosted glass stoppers colonel groves literally ran interference for larssen on the streets of white sulphur springs using his blocky body to bull ahead where a thinner or less confident man might have hesitated he had a good deal of muscle beneath the fat and also a driving energy that made him walk with a forward lean as if into a headwind getting in to see the chief of staff wasnt as simple as groves had made it sound back in his office the lawn of the house in which marshall stayed was clogged with officers jens had never seen so many sparkling silvears in his life to generals a colonel like groves might as well have een invisible he did not stay invisible long sheer physical bulk got him near enough to the doorway to catch the eye of a harriedlooking major inside in a ringing voice that cut through the hubbub groves announced his name and declared tell the general i have a fellow here from the metallurgical laboratory in chicago its urgent what isnt the major answered but he ducked back inside groves peacefully yielded up his place to a major general now what larssen asked he could feel the sun pounding his head and his arms he wore a shortsleeved shirt he was so fair he didnt tan worth a damn he just burned layer by layer now we wait groves folded his own arms across his broad khakiclad chest but you said it was urgent the colonels booming laugh made heads swing toward him if it werent urgent i wouldnt be here at all same with everybody else son harry turtledove as that major said everything is urgent nowadays but if he delivers that message well i expect were urgent enough if you know what i mean as seconds crawled by on hands and knees jens began to wonder he also wondered where in white sulphur springs hed be able to find calamine lotion to slather on his poor toasting arms and nose as inconspicu ously as he could he moved into groves massive shadow he felt a stab of jealousy when the major returned to call out the name of a brigadier general groves only shrugged the major came out again colonel uh graves thats me groves declared since no colonel graves rose up in righteous anger to dispute his claim larssen supposed he was right more officers heads turned toward him as he surged forward with jens in his wake envy and anger were the main expressions jens saw who was this mere colonel to take precedence over men with stars on their shoulders this way sir the major said this way led to a closed door in front of which groves and larssen spent the next several minutes cooling their heels larssen didnt care the hall was hot and airless but at least hed got out of the sun the door opened the brigadier general came out looking grimly satisfied he returned groves salute gave larssen a brusque nod and strode away come in colonel groves and bring your companion general marshall called from behind his desk jens noticed that he got the name straight thank you sir groves said obeying sir let me present dr jens larssen as i told your adjutant hes reached us from the project at the university of chicago sir as a civilian larssen reached across the desk to shake hands with the army chief of staff the generals grip was firm and precise jens first impression was that despite the uniform despite the three rows of campaign ribbons marshall looked more like a senior research scientist than a soldier he was in his early sixties spare and trim with hair going from iron gray toward white under a wide forehead his face was rather narrow he looked as though he seldom smiled his eyes were arresting they said hed seen a lot and thought hard about every bit of it if not warm he was gracious enough waving larssen and groves to chairs and listening closely to jens brief retelling of his trip across the eastern half of the united states then he put his elbows on the desk and leaned forward tell me the status of the metallurgical laboratory as you know it dr larssen you may speak freely i am cleared for this information if youd like me to step outside sir groves started to get up again marshall raised a hand to stop him that will not be necessary colonel security requirements have changed considerably since the end of worldwar in the balance may the lizards already know the secrets we are trying to extract from nature do the germans larssen asked being a civilian had advantages he could question the army chief of staff where military discipline held groves silent do we want the germans to learn them from us id better know the answer to that sir not least because hans thomsen has the room across the hall from mine at the greenbrier the germans have an atomic research program of their own marshall said it is in our interest to keep them fighting the lizards not least because to speak frankly they are doing a better job of it than anyone else at the moment they have their army and their economy already geared to war on a large scale while we were still readying our resources when the lizards came larssen nodded before he realized general marshall hadnt really answered his question being able to talk like a politician he supposed was one of the job qualifications for army chief of staff as if thinking along with him marshall said before i tell you what you may say to the german charge dr larssen and you may say nothing without direct authorization from me or someone at a higher level i do need to know where the metallurgical laboratory presently stands in its researches of course sir but larssen remained bemused as he mustered his thoughts who was at a higher level than general marshall only two men he could think of the secretary of war and president roosevelt was marshall implying he might meet them jens shook his head it didnt matter now he said when i left chicago sir we were assembling an atomkile which we hoped would have a kfactor greater than oneull have to explain a bit further than that im afraid marshall said while i have studied your groups reports with great attention i do not pretend to be a nuclear physicist it means arranging the uranium so that as atomic nuclei are split fission the term is the neutrons they release will split more atoms and so on think of it as a positive feedback cycle sir in a bomb like the ones the lizards have it happens in a split second and releases enormous energy what you are working toward is not a bomb in and of itself then marshall said thats right larssen eyed the older man with respect as marshall had said he was no nuclear physicist but he had no trouble drawing implications from data jens continued it is an essential first step though well control the nuclear reaction with cadmium rods that capture excess neutrons before they strike uranium atoms that will keep it from getting out of hand we have to walk before we can run sir and we need to un harry turtledove derstand how to produce a controlled chain reaction before we can think about making a bomb and chicago is the place where this research is going on marshall said musingly in the united states yes larssen said hed hoped marshall might tell him what if anything was happening elsewhere the chief of staff however had taken security for granted longer than jens had been alive he did not even change expression to acknowledge hed noticed the hint he said we intended to fight for chicago for other reasons this gives us one more thank you for your courage in coming here to report on the metallurgical laboratorys progress yes sir larssen wanted to ask more questions but general marshall did not strike him as a man given to loose talk even in private circumstances which these emphatically were not nevertheless he blurted what was uppermost in his mind general can we beat the damned lizards colonel groves shifted weight in his chair making it squeak jens abruptly realized that wasnt the way you were supposed to talk to the army chief of staff he felt himself flushing he was so fair he knew the flush would show that only embarrassed him more but marshall did not seem angry maybe the perfectly unmilitary question touched a responsive chord in him for he said dr larssen if you find anybody who knows the answer to that one he wins the prize were doing everything we can and well go on doing everything we can the alternative is to surrender and live in slavery americans wont accept that maybe your grandfather was one who helped prove it sir if you mean the civil war my grandfather was still back in oslo then trying to make a living as a cobbler he came to the united states in the s looking for something better than he had over there no doubt marshall said nodding thats a very human thing to do ill be frank with you dr larssen in purely military terms the lizards have us outclassed up to now no one not us not the germans not the russians not the japs has been able to stop them but no one has stopped trying and weve put most of our own conflicts on the back shelf for the time being as witness mr thomsens presence here across the hall from you didnt you say thats right cooperating with the third reich still left a bad taste in larssens mouth didnt i hear that warsaw fell when the people there rose against the nazis and for the lizards yes thats true marshall said soberly from the intelligence we have of what those people were suffering i can see how the lizards might have seemed the better bargain to them his voice went flat emotionless the very blankness of his face convinced jens he wasnt telling all he worldwar in the balance knew there after a moment that blankness lifted on a global scale however it is a small matter as are the chinese uprisings against the japs and in favor of the lizards but the lizards have weaknesses of their own colonel groves leaned forward his chair squeaked again may i ask what some of those weaknesses are sir knowing them may help me assign priorities in allocating matdriel the chief one colonel is their rigid adherence to doctrine they are methodical to a fault and slow to adapt tactics to fit circumstances some of our nearest approaches to success have come from creating situations where we used their patterns to lure units into untenable situations and then exploited the advantages we gained in so doing and now if you will excuse me the dismissal was polite but a dismissal nonetheless groves rose and saluted jens got up too he decided not to shake hands again general marshalls attention had already returned to the papers that clogged his desk the generals aide took charge of them as they came out of the office led them back to the door by which theyd ntered i think you did pretty well there dr larssen groves said making slow headway against the tide of officers that flowed toward the entrance call me jens larssen said then im leslie the heavyset colonel made an extravagant gesture where now the world lies at your feet larssen laughed till now he hadnt known any senior military men they were different from what hed thought theyd be marshall scholarly and precise plainly a firstclass mind a judgment jens did not make lightly not after working with several nobel laureates groves without the chief of staffs unbounded mental horizons but full of bulldog competencd just enough whimsy to leaven the mix neither was the singleinded fighting man evoked by the label general or colonel after a little thought larssen decided that made sense the group at the met lab werent the effete eggheads layfolk thought of when they imagined what nuclear physicists were like either people were more complicated than any subatomic particles he wondered what the lizards made of people if the invaders were as compulsively orderly as marshall had said mankinds aggressive randomness likely confused them no end he hoped so every weakness of theirs no matter how tiny was a corresponding strength for humanity he also wondered what it would be like in one of their spaceships cruising along far above the surface of the earth flying between planets perhaps even between stars they were the ones who could literally have the world under their feet cold clear envy pierced him despite his musings he was only a beat slow in answering groves unless youve got fdr up your sleeve there leslie i think youve done as much as any man could thanks more than i can say for all your help harry turtledove my pleasure groves stuck out a hand he had a grip like a hydraulic press you convinced me you and your group are on to something important and my superiors need to understand that too so they can factor it into their calculations as for roosevelt hmm he actually did look up his sleeve sorry no he seems to have stepped out too bad if you do happen to see him larssen had no idea how probable that was but believed in covering his bets mention the project if you get the chance ill do that jens groves glanced at his wrist again this time just to check his watch id best get back to it ive been away too long already god only knows whats stacking up on my desk no rest for the weary as they say with a last nod he turned and headed back toward the methodist church larssen hadnt been able to park any closer than several blocks away watching groves broad back recede he concluded the colonel got results from those around him by working twice as hard as any of them in that he would have fit in well at the metallurgical lab the physicist looked at his own watch nearly noon no wonder his stomach was sounding reveille he wondered what epicurean delight the greenbrier was offering for lunch yesterday it had been canned pork and beans canned corn and canned fruit cocktail wryly shaking his head he wondered about the consequences of excessive tin in the diet todays menu he discovered when he got to the hotel restaurant was extravagant by current standards spam and canned peas the peas were more nearly olive drab than green but he ate them all the same hoping they retained at least some of their vitamins he also put down an extra buck and a half for a nickel bottle of coke that nobody could snafu the bottle he noted was closer to the color peas ought to be than the peas themselves were as he was chasing the last sad soft overcooked peas with his fork there was a stir at the entrance to the dining room a couple of people started to clap larssen looked up saw a short pale bulletheaded man wearing a homburg steelrimmed spectacles and a suit of european cut that face had looked out at him from countless newsreels but hed never thought to encounter vyacheslav molotov in the flesh something else occurred to him his gaze flicked from table to table sure enough there sat hans thomsen also with a plate of spare the german charge daffaires was affable genial a fluent englishspeaker whod worked hard to put the best face on the activities of the nazi government until hitler declared war on the united states larssen wondered how he felt to be in the presence of the soviet foreign minister after germanys unprovoked invasion of russia he also wondered how molotov would react to finding a nazi representative here in the heart of the american government in refuge nor was his the only such curiosity the dining room grew silent for worldwar in the balance a few seconds as people stopped talking and suspended forks in midair to i see what would happen next thomsen jens thought recognized molotov before the latter saw him maybe molotov would not have noticed him at all but for the nazi party badge he wore on his left lapel the russian had a face as impassive as any larssen had ever seen he did not change expression now but he did hesitate before proceeding into the dining room then he turned to the man beside him a squarely built fellow whose suit was similar in cut to his own but much more poorly fit ted he spoke a single sentence of russian from the explosive coughs that went up a few people understood what he had to say in the original the squarely built mans function was then revealed he translated molotovs words into elegant oxfordaccented english the foreign commissar of the ussr observes that having al ready entered into diplomatic discussions with the lizards he has no oh jection to speaking to serpents as well more coughs rose larssens among them his eyes swung back to hans thomsen he doubted he could have been as politely insulting as molotov given what the nazis had done to the soviet union on the other hand all of humanity was supposed to be joining together to resist the in vaders from another planet if everyone kept remembering what was going i on before the lizards came the united front would come crashing down and if it did that literally handed the lizards the world thomsen was a trained diplomat if he noticed molotov had given him the glove he never let on he was smiling as he replied there is in en glish an old saying about the enemy of ones enemy the interpreter murmured to molotov now the communist official lookedraight back at the german it was on this basis no doubt that the inialist powers of great britain and the united states allied with the peceloving people of the ussr against the hitlerite regime watch out for this guy jens thought hes dangerous thomsen kept his smile but it looked held in place by force of will still he had a coun terthrust ready no doubt it was also on this basis that finland allied with germany after being invaded by the peaceloving people of the ussr as if at a tennis match larssen turned his head to look at molo tov the match here though he thought used a live hand grenade for a ball mootovs lips might have drawn back from his teeth a millimeter or two through his interpreter the soviet foreign minister replied as we have both noted the principle admits of broad application thus i am will ing to discuss our own differences at another time the sigh of relief that filled the dining room was quite audible larssen didnt consciously notice he was too busy adding to it lhe hologram of tosev hung in space above its projector just as it had before the race began to add a fourth world to the empire today though atvar did not urge kirel to project the image of the ferocious tosevite warrior with his sword and chain mail that the races probes had brought home like everyone else in the fleet atvar had found out more about tosevite warriors than hed ever wanted to learn the fleetlord turned to the assembled shiplords we are met here today valiant males to evaluate the results of the first halfyears fighting he used the races chronology of course sluggish tosev had completed only a fourth of its orbit and to discuss our plans for the combat yet to come the shiplords accepted the introduction better than hed dared hope when the schedule for the conquest of tosev was drawn up back on home the halfyear meeting was the last one included after half a year everyone was certain tosev would be firmly attached to the empire the race lived by schedules and plans drawn up long before they were carried out that atvars chief underlings recognized the need for much more work was a measure of how much the tosevites had shaken them we make progress atvar insisted large parts of tosev are under our virtually complete control on the hologram portions of the planets land area changed color from their natural greens and browns to a bright golden hue the southern half of the smaller continental mass much of the southwestern part of the main continental mass the natives in these areas while not as primitive as previously available data led us to believe have been unable to offer resistance much above the nuisance level may it please the exalted fleetlord shiplord straha of the th emperor yower said but much of this territory strikes me as being that on tosev least worth the having true its warm enough to suit our kind but much of it is so beastly wet that our fighting males break out in molds and rots molds and rots are a small price to pay for victory atvar answered worldwar in the balance more of the hologram turned gold so that tosev itself looked blotched and diseased here are our holdings in the regions where the big uglies are most technologically advanced as you can see for yourselves valiant males these have expanded considerably since last we gathered together the hologram rotated to give the shiplords a view of the entire planet brash as usual straha said certainly we have made great gains how could it be otherwise when we are the race the question that arises however exalted fleetlord is why our gains have not been greater still why tosevite forces yet remain in arms against us may i speak exalted fleetlord kirel asked at atvars assent the shiplord of the th emperor hetto went on the principal reason for our delays shiplord straha strikes me as obvious to a hatchling still wet from the egg the big uglies capabilities are far greater than we imagined while readying the expeditionary force oh indeed as we have discovered to our sorrow straha said sarcastically eager to score points off his rival but why is this so how did our probes fail us so badly how did the tosevites become a technological species while the race turned its eye turrets in the other direction kirel turned to atvar in protest exalted fleetlord the blame for that must surely rest with the big uglies themselves not on the race we merely applied procedures which had proved themselves eminently successful on our two previous conquests we could not know in advance that they would be less effective here that is so atvar glanced down to check some data on a computer screen before kirel could look too smug at having his commanders support the fleetlord added nevertheless straha poses a legitimate question n if impolitely why are the tosevites so different from us and our two ious subject races now straha brightened up atvar needed to keep his rivalry with kirel active that way both powerful shiplords and the lesser leaders who inclined to one of them or the other would continue to labor zealously to seek the fleetlords support after reviewing his electronic notes once more atvar said our savants have isolated several factors which they feel cause the tosevites to be as they are a muffled hiss ran through the shiplords as they gave their commander full attention some of these speculations had already gone out in bulletins and announcements but bulletins and announcements flowed from the fleetlords ship in such an unending stream that no one no matter how diligent could pay attention to them all words straight from the fleetlords jaws though were something else again he said one element contributing to the tosevites anomalous nature is surely the anomalous nature of tosev now all at once the planets immense innumerable oceans and seas and lakes and rivers glowed bright blue the excessive amount of free water serves along with moun harry turtledove tains and deserts to wall off groups of big uglies from one another and allow them to go their own separate ways this is obvious from one eyes glance at the globe and is not too different from our own most ancient days back on home but exalted fleetlord kirel began not only had he read all the bulletins and announcements hed discussed them with atvar the advantage of being shiplord to the bannership of the fleet but indeed atvar wanted to lay out this exposition himself without interruptions what follows is more subtle because land dominates water on the worlds of the empire we have little experience with boats and other aquatic conveyances that is not the case among the tosevites who lavish endless ingenuity upon them when some big uglies stumbled upon technology they were quickly able to spread its influence and theirs by sea to most of the planet then why do we not face one unified tosevite empire exalted fleetlord asked feneress a shiplord of strahas faction because the tosevites in the area where the breakthrough took place were already divided among several competing groups atvar answered travel by sea let them all expand their influence outward without consolidating into a single empire the assembled shiplords hissed again more quietly this time as implications began to sink in back on home the ancestral empire had grown step by small step that was the only way it could grow on a normal world where there were no great oceans to let its influence suddenly metastasize in a hundred directions at once atvar hissed himself as that word crossed his mind it seemed the perfect metaphor for the tosevites malignantly rapid technological growth you must also bear in mind the constantly competitive nature of the big uglies themselves he went on as we have recently discovered they are sexually competitive throughout the year and remain in a state permitting sexual excitement even in the longterm absence of any breeding partner atvar knew he sounded faintly disgusted without pheromones from females in heat his own sexual urge remained latent he didnt miss it on a mission like this it would have been a distraction the rabotevs and hallessi were like the race in that regard which had led its savants to believe all intelligent species followed the same pattern there as elsewhere tosev was proving a theorists crematorium straha said exalted fleetlord i recently received a shiplordseyesonly report noting that the tosevite empires opposing us are in fact not empires at all i find this a contradiction granted that the scale of area ruled may vary but how can there be government without empire before i came here shiplord i assure you i found that concept as unimaginable as you do now atvar answered tosev unfortunately has worldwar in the balance taught us all a variety of unpleasant new ideas of the lot government without empire may be the most repugnant but it does exist and must be dealt with the shiplords stirred uncomfortably talking about government without empire was worse than talking about sexual interest in the absence of females in heat for the race the latter was just an intellectual exercise a study in abstraction government without empire though tore at the underpinnings of a thousand millennia of civilized life feneress said without emperors exalted fleetlord how can the big uglies administer their affairs i too saw the report to which the senior shiplord straha refers but i confess i dismissed it as just another flight of fancy from savants drawing broad conclusions without enough data you are saying this is not the case it is not shiplord for my own peace of mind i wish it were but the data are irrefutable atvar replied moreover revolting as it surely seems to us the big uglies in many cases seem proud of their success at ruling themselves without emperors the big ugly named molotov had seemed proud of belonging to a band that had slaughtered his empires emperor the very idea still gave atvar the horrors but how do they administer their affairs feneress persisted several other shiplords males from both strahas faction and kirels made ges tures of agreement here the whole race united in finding the tosevites baffling atvar found them baffling too but he had been working hard to understand he said i will summarize as best i can in some tosevite uh nonempires the two most powerful examples are deutschland and the sssr the ruler has full imperial power but draws on no hereditary loyalty and ation from his subjects this may be one reason these two tosevite areasre ruled with more brutality than most obedience out of affection being unavailable to them they force obedience out of fear that made a certain amount of logical sense anyway no matter how much it appalled the fleetlord since logical sense was hard enough to come by on tosev he cherished it when he found it deutschland and the sssr were models of comprehensibility when set beside some of the other maybe lands was a good word for them atvar thought on tosev he went on italia nippon and britain are empires in our sense of the word or so they claim at any rate nothing the big uglies do can be trusted to be what it appears in the first two empires i mentioned the emperor serves as a false front for other tosevites who hold the actual power in their regimes this phenomenon was also known among the rabotevs before we integrated them into the empire kirel noted in fact some of our own ancient records may be interpreted to imply that it occurred among the race harry turtledove as well in the longago days when the empire was limited not merely to one planet but to a portion of that planet the shiplords muttered among themselves atvar did not blame them anything that cast doubt on the sovereignty of the emperor had to be intensely disturbing the emperor was the rock to which their souls were tethered the central focus of all their lives without him they could only wander through existence alone and afraid no better than the big uglies or any other beasts of the field yet this briefing held more that would disquiet them as the mutters died away atvar spoke again the case of britain is more obscure again though it is an empire its emperor holds no real power some of you will have noticed the name of the male uh churchill as appearing repeatedly among those who urge the tosevites to continue their futile and foredoomed resistance to the race this churchill it seems admittedly from the limited data we have and our own imperfect the emperor be praised understanding of tosevite customs is but the leader of the britainish faction which currently musters more support than any other if the factions shift their leaders meeting together may at any time choose for themselves a different chief strahas jaws gaped in amusement and when they do exalted fleetlord how will this war leader this churchill did you sayrespond by abandoning the power he has seized isnt he more likely to set soldiers on them to cure their presumption isnt that what you or i or any sane male would do we have reason to believe he would abandon power atvar answered and had the satisfaction of seeing strahas mouth close with a snap intercepted radio signals indicated such how best to put itresignation to factional shifts is a commonplace of government for lack of government among the britainish madness straha said what else would you expect from the big uglies atvar said and if you think the britainish mad how do you account for the tosevite land called the united states straha did not answer atvar had not expected him to answer the rest of the shiplords also fell silent without a doubt the most prosperous land on tosev the united states was by any rational standard an anarchy it had no emperor as far as any of the races savants could tell it had never had an emperor but it also had few of the trappings of a land ruled by force like the sssr or deutschland atvar summed up the races view of the united states in one scornful word snoutcounters how do they have the hubris to imagine they can build a land that amounts to anything by counting one anothers snouts and yet they have kirel said as usual soberly sticking to observable truth analysis suggests they acquired the snoutcounting habit from worldwar in the balance the britainish with whom they share a language and then extended it further than even the britainish countenance they even count snouts in the prison camps we have established on their soil atvar said when we needed big ugly representatives through whom to deal with their kind thats how they chose them instead of picking ones known to be wise or brave they let several vie for the jobs and counted snouts to see which had the most in favor how are these representatives working out asked hassov who was rather a cautious male and thus inclined to kirels faction how much worse are they than those selected by some rational means our officers have noted no great differences between them and similar representatives elsewhere on tosev atvar said some are better and more obedient than others but that is the case all around the planet the admission bothered him it was as if he were confessing that the manifest anarchy of the united states worked as well as a system that made sense as a matter of fact it did seem to work well by tosevite standards anyhow and the american big uglies he did not understand how they derived american from united states but he did not pretend to be a linguist either fought as hard for the sake of their anarchy as other big uglies battled for their emperors or nonimperial rulers straha said very well exalted fleetlord the tosevites rule themselves in ways we find incomprehensible or revolting or both how does this affect our campaign against them a relevant question atvar said approvingly he did not trust straha the male had enough ambition to be why he had almost enough ambition to be one of those freewheeling american big uglies himself atvar thought with the new perspective hed gained from half a year on tosev but enying his ability tt fleetlord resumed the tosevites with these ramshackle temporary governments of theirs have shown themselves to be more versatile more flexible than we are no doubt those back on home would be shocked at the improvisations we have been forced to make in the course of our conquest here no doubt a good many of you are too atvar added silently to himself from lack of practice or need the race did not improvise well when change came in the empire it came in slow carefully planned steps with likely results and plans to meet them mapped out beforehand the emperor and his servants thought in terms of millennia that was good for the race as a whole but did not promote quick reflexes here on tosev situations had a way of changing even as you looked at them yesterdays perfect plan if applied day after tomorrow was as apt to yield fiasco as triumph improvising though seems a way of life for the big uglies atvar said witness the antilandcruiser mines they mounted on animals backs harry turtledove would any of us have imagined such a ploy bizarre as it is though it has hurt us more than once and the supply of munitions available to us as compared to that which the tosevites continue to produce remains a source of some concern by the emperor we rule the skies on this world straha said angrily how is it that weve failed to smash the factories down below just too late he added exalted fleetlord several shiplords stirred uneasily at the implied criticism of atvar the fleetlord did not let his own anger show the answer to your question shiplord straha has two parts first tosev has a great many factories scattered through several areas of the planets surface destroying them all or even most of them is no easy task besides which the tosevites are adept at quickly repairing damage this i suppose is another result of their having been at war among themselves when we arrived they cannot match our technology but are extremely effective within the limits of their own we should have had more resources before we undertook the conquest of an industrialized planet feneress complained now atvar did project the image of the mailclad tosevite warrior captured by the earlier probe from home shiplord let me remind you that this is the opposition we expected to face do you think our forces adequate to defeat such foes feneress sensibly stood silent what reply could he hope to make against swordswinging primitives the fight would have been over in days probably without the loss of a single male of the race atvar touched the controls again new images replaced the familiar one of the tosevite fighting male a guncamera hologram of a sweptwing fighter with two jet engines and the hookedcross emblem of deutschland a landcruiser from the sssr underpowered and undergunned by the standards of the race certainly but needing only scaling up to become a truly formidable weapon a bombedout factory complex in the united states that had been turning out several bombing planes every day and finally the satellite picture of the unsuccessful deutsch missile launch into the shiplords sudden silence atvar said considering the unexpectedly strong struggle the big uglies have been able to maintain we can be proud of our successes thus far as we gradually continue to cripple their industrial base we may find future victories coming more easily simply because we did not have the walkover we expected we need not twitch our tailstumps and yield to despair or pessimism kirel added instead we should give thanks that the emperor in his wisdom sent us forth with force overwhelming for our anticipated task thus allowing us to accomplish the far more difficult one that awaited us here the fleetlord sent him a grateful look he could not imagine a more encouraging note on which to close the gathering but before he had the worldwar in the balance chance to dismiss the shiplords traha asked exalted fleetlord in view of the technological base the tosevites do have could they be working toward nuclear weapons of their own and if so how can we prevent this development short of sterilizing the planets surface some of the lesser shiplords and those less given to paying attention to their briefings twitched in alarm in a way atvar did not blame them he had trouble thinking of anything more horrid than tosevites armed with fission bombs but they also annoyed him for they should have been able to envision the potential problem for themselves without strahas prodding the more atvar had to deal with tosevites the more he thought his own people lacked imagination we have no evidence that they are he said how much this extrapolation from a negative means however is uncertain if one of their warring empires were involved in such research i doubt it would trumpet the fact over the radio lest it encourage its enemies to do the same you have spoken truth exalted fleetlord straha agreed let me ask the question another way do the big uglies know enough about the inner workings of the atom to envision nuclear weapons after our initial bombardment to disrupt their communications and especially after we smashed the capital of deutschland they need not envision nuclear weapons kirel said they have seen them they have seen them yes straha would not let his rival distract him from the point he was trying to make but can they understand what they have seen atvar hadnt thought of the question in quite those terms finding out just what the tosevites knew wasnt easy even if they were reticent on the radio their books surely revealed a great deal but in only half a year who among the race had had the cljnce to find and translate the relevant texts the fleetlord knew the answer perfectly well no one the war of conquest left no leisure for such fripperies as translation except that now it was not a frippery straha had a point finding out exactly what the big uglies knew about the inner workings of the atom could prove as important as anything else in this campaign with hope but without too much atvar put a hushmike to his mouth and asked the bannerships computer what it knew hed expected it to report back that it had no information instead though it gave him a translated radio intercept of a news item from the united states xrays reveal the cincinnati reds outfielder mike mccormick suffered a fractured leg in yesterdays contest he is expected to be out for the season like a lot of translated intercepts this one didnt tell atvar everything he might have wanted to know he wondered what sort of contest an outfielder took part in and for what season he harry turtledove was lost spring summer harvest the fleetlord also wondered whether cincinnati had greens and blues and yellows to go with its reds but all that was by the bye the important thing about the intercept was that it showed this mike mccormicks leg fracture had been diagnosed by xrays atvar presumed that meant xrays were in common use down on tosev if they werent then the big uglies wouldnt have freely talked about them on the radio during wartime and if xrays were in common use they know something about the inner workings of the atom he said and explained his reasoning dismay spread through the ranks of the shiplords straha spelled out the reason for that dismay then they may indeed be covertly seeking a means of producing nuclear weapons so they may atvar admitted oddly the notion appalled him less than he would have guessed hed been appalled so many times already by the tosevites and the unexpected things they did that he was getting hard to shock he just let out a long hissing sigh and said one more thing to worry about the white horse inn smelled of beer and sweat and the tobacco smoke that made the air nearly as thick as a london peasoup fog the barmaid named daphne set pints of what was misleadingly called best bitter in front of david goldfarb and jerome jones she scooped up the shillings theyd laid on the bar slapped jones wrist when he tried to slip an arm around her waist and spun away laughing her skirt swirled high on her shapely legs sighing jones followed her with his eyes its no use old man goldfarb said i told you that weeks ago she only goes with fliers cant shoot a man for trying jones answered he tried every time they came to the white horse inn and as consistently crashed in flames he took a moody pull at his beer i do wish she wouldnt giggle that way though under other circumstances it might discourage me goldfarb drank too then made a face this beer discourages me bloody war thin and sour the yellow liquid in his glass bore only the faintest resemblance to what he fondly recalled from the days before rationing he sipped again pah i wonder if its saltpeter theyre putting in it the way they do in schools to keep the boys from getting randy no i know that taste by god thats right you went to a public school so what back before the lizards smashed our radar you were better with it than i ever was to cover his thoughts goldfarb drained his glass raised a finger for another eventually even bad beer numbed the tongue jerome could say worldwar in the balance so what sincerely enough but after the war was done if it ever ended hed go back to cambridge and end up a barrister or a professor or a business executive goldfarb would go back too back to repairing wireless sets behind the counter of a dingy little store on a dingy little street to him his friends egalitarianism rang hollow blithely oblivious jones went on besides if there is saltpeter in this bitter its not working worth a damn id really fancy a go right now but its the sods with wings on their shirtfronts wholl get one look at that will you he pointed disgraceful i call it now you know what its like down in the lower classes goldfarb thought but jerome didnt not really just seeing daphne perched on a flight engineers knee over by the electric fire wasnt enough to take away his ingrained advantages in society all it did was make him jealous it made goldfarb jealous too especially when sylvia the other barmaid also went over to the table full of aircrew she quickly ended up in the bombaimers lap it wasnt fair goldfarb tried to remember the pithy phrase hed heard in an american film not long before them as has gits that was it no grammar there but a lot of truth as for himself he didnt even seem able to git his pint refilled that struck him as excessive he got up started over to the table where the fliers were monopolizing the barmaids jerome jones put a hand on his arm are you bloody daft david theres seven of them there theyll wipe the floor with you what goldfarb stared then realized what jones was talking about oh i dont want a fight i just want a fresh pint maybe theyll stop feeling up the girls long enough to let one of them draw me another maybe they wont too jerome said but goldfarb ignored him and wallacross the pub to the aircrew and the barmaids nbbody there took any notice of him for a few seconds the fellow who had daphne on his knee was saying worst thing i saw there or at least the nastiest was that old fellow walking down the street with a yellow star of david on his chest he looked up from his comrades saw goldfarb standing there you want something friend his tone was neither hostile nor the reverse he waited to hear what goldfarb had to say i came over to see if i could borrow daphne just for a moment goldfarb held up his empty pint glass but what you were just talking about i hope im not prying but youre newly back from france thats right who wants to know the flight engineer was a pint or two ahead of goldfarb but still alert enough one of his eyebrows rose i hope im not prying in turn radarman but are you by any chance of the jewish faith yes i am goldfarb knew he didnt look quite english his hair was too wavy and the wrong color brown while no anglosaxon or even celt wore a nose like his i have relatives in warsaw you see and i harry turtledove thought id ask someone whod seen with his own eyes how jews are faring under the germans if im interrupting your party i do apologize perhaps if i gave you my name you could look me up at the station when its convenient for you no thats all right pull up a chair the flight engineer said after a quick eyecheck of the rest of the aircrew he straightened his leg so daphne started to slide down it she squeaked indignantly as she sprang to her feet the flight engineer said hush love bring this lad his new pint will you pert nose in the air daphne snatched goldfarbs glass out of his hand and marched behind the bar thats very kind of you goldfarb said he pointed back at jerome jones may my friend join you as well on receiving a nod he waved jones over i suppose hell want another pint too daphne said darkly as she returned with the filled glass the one he has is empty now thats bloody sure without waiting for an answer she carried jones dead soldier away to be revivified the newly enlarged group exchanged names the pilot of the aircrew ken embry said you have to remember two things goldfarb warsaw isnt likely to be just like paris by any means and it isnt under the germans any more i understand all that goldfarb said but anything i can find out will be of value to me fair enough said the flight engineer whose name was george bagnall aside from the sixpointed stars i saw shops and even telephone booths with signs saying things like no jews allowed and patronage by jews prohibited other shops had special lateafternoon hours for jews so they could only pick over what other people had left bastards goldfarb muttered who the jerries too right they are embry said we didnt see anything though like the photos the lizards have released from warsaw or like what the people who live there talk about on the lizards wireless programs if even a tenth part of thats true by god im damned if i blame those poor devils for rising up against the nazis not a bit of it the rest of the aircrew spoke up in agreement all save douglas bell the bombaimer and sylvia were so wrapped up in each other that goldfarb half expected them to consummate their friendship on the table or the floor if bell aimed his bombs as well as he did his hands hed done some useful work embry said even with pictures i have trouble believing the jerries built a slaughterhouse for people at whatever the name of that place was treblinka goldfarb said he had trouble believing it too but less trouble he guessed than embry to a young englishman whose accent said he came from the comfortable classes organized murder like that worldwar in the balance might really be unthinkable to goldfarb whose father had fled less orga nized but no less sincere persecution the notion of a place like treblinka was merely dreadful where embry couldnt imagine it goldfarb could and had to hope he was wrong how has it been back here day by day bagnall asked until jerry shipped us home from calais weve been in the air so much all we did on the ground was sleep and eat goldfarb and jones looked at each other its not been the push button war we had during the blitz goldfarb said at last the lizards are smarter than jerry they took out our radar straightaway and send more rockets after it whenever we try to light it up again so weve been reduced to field glasses and telephones like in the old days daphne came back with jerome jones new pint he leered at her davids been using his field glasses to peer in your window really she said coolly setting the pint down and all the time i thought it was you jones fair english skin made his flush visible even by the light of the fireplace goldfarb and the aircrew howled laughter even douglas bell un tangled himself from sylvia long enough to say theres a fair hit by god jones buried his nose in the pint do you know what i hear has worked well though goldfarb valiant ly tried to get back to george bagnalls question barrage balloons have cost the lizards some of their aircraft they fly so low and so fast they havent a prayer of evading if the balloons wire happens to lie in their path nice to know something does a bit of good bagnall said but that wasnt quite what i meant not the war i mean just life radarmen dont have lives jones said its against his majestys ar ticle war or something like that he shoved his reemptied pint to wardaphne try not to put so much arsenic in this one my darling i why youd likely thrive on it but the barmaid went to fill the pint again shes sweet daphne is i can tell that already bagnall said ah but you got her on your knee goldfarb said morosely do you know how many months jerome and i have been trying to do that quite a few by your long face arent there any other women in do ver i expect there may be have we looked jerome under every flat stone we could find jones answered he was watching douglas bell and sylvia if hed had a pad in front of him hed have taken notes too im going to pour this over your head dearie daphne told him they say it makes a good hairset he said adding not that id know just in time to keep the barmaid from making good on her threat harry turtledove goldfarb finished his second pint but wasnt quite in his friends hurry to get another one everything the lancaster aircrew had told him about life for the jews in france made him worry more about what had been happening to them in warsaw where traditions of persecution ran back centuries and where the nazis had no one within hundreds of miles to keep an eye on what they did german radio could scream all it liked about traitors to mankind he feared the jews in warsaw had been so desperate that even alien invaders looked better to them than the benign and humane rule of hans frank he wondered how his uncles and aunts and cousins were doing in poland thinking about the broadcasts in yiddish and german over the warsaw shortwave station the lizards had set up he wondered how many or how few of his uncles and aunts and cousins were still alive he stared down at his empty pint would another help him forget his fears or bring them more strongly to the surface the latter he suspected he held out the glass to daphne anyhow since youre still on your feet dear would you bring me one more enough bitter and hed stop caring about anything at all if not this pint then the next one or the one after that then jerome asked the aircrew and what happens to you lads next ken embry said i expect well be going up again in another day or two by all theyve said experienced aircrew are getting rather thin on the ground if youll forgive something of a mixed metaphor how can you be so bloody calm about it jones burst out flying against the jerries was one thing but against the lizards embry shrugged its what we do its what we have to do what else is there for anyone to do but do what he has to do the best he can for as long as he can do it goldfarb studied the pilot and the rest of the aircrew while he worried about his relatives and from all hed heard with reason they carried on in the face of their own nearly certain deaths he looked at sylvia who might have been trying to squeeze douglas bell to death and suddenly understood on a level deeper than words why she and daphne would sleep with fliers but not with men who stayed on the ground he remained rueful about that but his jealousy disappeared when daphne came back with his bitter he stood up dug in his pocket came out with a handful of silver fetch these lads a round would you jerome jones stared at him such largess did your rich grandfather just cork off or have you forgotten youre a jew he would have gone for anyone elses throat especially with a couple of pints in him bagnall and a couple of the other members of the aircrew worldwar in the balance shifted in their seats to get ready to grab him if he tried instead he started to laugh bloody hell daphne ill buy one for this bigmouthed sod too the aircrew relaxed jones eyes got even bigger than they had been if id known calling you names was the way to pry beer out of you idve tried it long ago geh kak afen yam goldfarb said and then disgusted everybody by refusing to translate moishe russie felt his heart pound in his chest meeting the lizard governor whose forces had driven the nazis out of warsaw always fright ened him though zolraag had treated him well enough certainly better than he would have fared had he fallen under the eye of hans frank he did not know whether frank was dead or fled hoping him dead was sin ful russie knew that he was willing to make the wish even so tadeusz borkomorowski the leader of the home army came out of zolraags office he did not look happy he looked even less happy on see i ing russie what are you going to pry out of him now jew he growled they will give you anything you like it seems that is not so russie said borkomorowski frightened him too he hated germans yes but he also hated jews the germans were gone now that left him only one target scowling still borkomorowski stamped out his boot heels ringing on the marble floor russie hurried into zolraags office keeping his peoples protector waiting would not do your excellency he said in german he could speak to a lizard eas ily enough now a couple of weeks before when the nazis fled beset from within and attacked from without at the same time the first of the little scamtng creatures had seemed like demons to him though they were allies ey were weird almost beyond his power to take in there the ger man propaganda had not lied but dealing with zolraag day by day had begun to make strangeness familiar and also brought the suspicion that the lizard found him in par i ticular and humanity in general at least as peculiar as he thought the gov ernor herr russie zolraag spoke slowly and with an accent that almost swallowed rs and turned the middle sound in russies name into a long hiss you are well i hope yes your excellency thank you russie hissed himself and made a gargling sound hed learned how to say thank you in zolraags language he was doing his best to pick up words of the lizards speech as he was already fluent in yiddish hebrew german and polish acquiring a new tongue held no terror for him he got the idea that zolraag found the idea of there being many languages as alien as anything else about the earth the lizard was working hard with german though while his accent harry turtledove remained hed picked up new words every time he spoke with the jew and his grammar if less than good was better than it had been now he said the german prisoners herr russie what do you think we do with them they are prisoners your excellency they ought to be treated like any other prisoners of war russie had walked out to the camp in the ruins of the rakowiec district just to see germans behind the razor strips the lizards used in place of barbed wire he wished he hadnt looking at the crowds of dirty battered hungry men milling around reminded him overpoweringly of looking down any street when the ghetto was packed tight not all your people so think herr russie who is your emperor here our ruler you mean your emperor he who decides for you zolraag said he seemed to think it was very simple maybe it was among the lizards russie gathered that their supreme commander the fleetlord zolraag called him had chosen zolraag governor of warsaw and that was that things in human warsaw and especially inside the jewish quarter were less simple the old germanbacked ghetto administration still functioned after a fashion doling out rations from the lizards now rather than from the nazis russie himself held moral authority because of the night the lizards came how that translated varied from day to day sometimes from minute to minute and there was mordechai anielewicz hed taken a bullet through the left hand during the attack on the germans but it hadnt slowed him down if anything the fat white bandage seemed to mark him as a hero his men swaggered through the streets of the jewish quarter with captured german rifles on their shoulders they walked boldly when they went into the rest of warsaw too they were men whose comrades could avenge slights and they knew it for jews the feeling was rich and heady like a fine new brandy the armja krajowa hated them many of the mausers they bore had come to them from the lizards more arms than the new conquerors gave the polish home army of course the poles had had far more guns at the start of the warsaw rebellion than the jews maybe the lizards were working to balance the two groups in the newly conquered territory maybe too russie admitted to himself zolraag and the rest of the lizards were using the jews and their plight under the nazi regime as a tool against the rest of mankind he listened to shortwave radio just as hed spoken on it from a studio for the lizards though hed told no more than the truth and much less than all the truthhuman broadcasters dismissed his reports as obvious propaganda even the dreadful pictures that came out of the ghetto brought little belief worldwar in the balance because of that russie said your excellency you will hurt yourself if you treat these captured germans different from any other prisoners of war people will only say you are cruel and ruthless this you say herr russie unnervingly zolraag looked at moishe with one eye and down at the papers on his desk with the other you a jew a how do you say it a sufferer no a victim of these germans not treat them as killers why killers they are you asked what i wanted done your excellency russie answered now ive told you revenge is a meal better eaten hot than cold he spent the next few minutes explaining that and reminded himself not to use figurative language with the lizard governor again any time soon zolraag turned both eyes on him that was almost as unnerving as being examined with just one for his stare was steadier than any mans could be you are emperor for your people when you so say you decide this is what i say for myself russie answered he knew that if he lied zolraags backing of his policy would transmute the lie to truth but if he started lying where would he stop he didnt want to find out hed discovered too many horrors in both himself and the world around him over the past few years after a moment he added i am fairly sure i can bring my people with me that wasnt a lie more in the way of an exaggeration the governor studied him a while longer then looked away in two directions at once maybe you do this herr russie maybe you bring people with you maybe this end up by being good maybe we say look at jews see how germans do to them see how jews not want what was word you use revenge yes revenge kind jews gentle jews better than germllls jls russie said in a hollow voice more clearly than ever he saw that zolraag cared nothing for the jews as jews and little for them as victims of the nazis he himself remained as much a thing to the lizards as he had been to hans frank the only difference was to zolraag he was a useful rather than an abhorrent thing that marked an improvement surely a little while longer under the german generalgouvernement and he would have been a dead thing all the same the realization tasted bitter as the bitter herbs of the seder zolraag said maybe we make picture jew give german prisoner food maybe we do that herr russie yes make picture make men think any jew who let himself be used for that sort of picture would find himself hated by other jews russie answered despair tinged his thoughts propaganda thats all they want us for they rescued us for their own purposes not out of any special kindness a moment later the lizard echoed his worries we help you then harry turtledove herr russie you help us now you owe us what is word debt yes you owe us i know but after what we went through this is a hard way to repay the debt what else you jews good for herr russie now to us russie flinched as from a blow never before had zolraag been so brutally frank with him change the subject a little before you get in deeper he thought the ploy had served him well in medical school letting him use his strengths and minimize weakness he said your excellency how can jews think of giving germans food when we still havent enough for ourselves have as much as anyone else now zolraag said yes but we were starving before even what we have now is none too good the poles resented having their rations cut to help feed the jews and the jews were angry at the poles for not understandingor for approving of their plight under the nazis fair rations meant everyone ate too little russie said with all your power your excellency cant you bring in more food for everyone in warsaw then we would worry less about sharing it with the germans where we get food herr russie no food here not by warsaw no this place where fight happen not farming fight ruin farming you tell me where food is i get otherwise zolraag spread clawed hands in a very human seeming gesture of frustration but russie stared at the lizard in dismay he knew only god was omnipotent but the lizards aside from seeming like manifestations of his will when they drove the germans out of warsaw and saved the jews from certain destruction were able to do so many other things with so little effort that moishe had assumed their abilities were for all practical purposes unlimited discovering that was not so rocked him he faltered could you not uh bring food in from other parts of the world where you are not fighting hard zolraag let his mouth hang open russie glowered at rows of little sharp pointed teeth and the unnerving snakelike tongue he knew the governor was laughing at him zolraag said can do that when you people give up stupid fight join empire now no need all we have in fight tosev this world big place need all we have i see russie said slowly here was news he would have to pass on to anielewicz maybe the combat leader would have a better feel for what it meant than he did what it sounded like was that the lizards were stretched thinner than they wanted to be a world was indeed a big place till the war started russie hadnt really worried about anything outside poland the germans crushing triumph taught him the folly of that afterward his hope against the worldwar in the balance germans rested first on england and then on the even more distant united states but when zolraag spoke of this world he implied the presence of others that should have been obvious the lizards plainly were from nowhere on earth till now though what all that meant hadnt got through to russie he wondered how many worlds the aliens knew and if any besides earth and their own home held thinking beings having gained a secular education indispensable in medicine russie believed in darwin alongside of genesis they coexisted uneasily in his mind one dominant when he thought the other when he felt in the ghetto god gained the upper hand for prayer seemed likelier to do some good than anything merely rational and when the lizards came prayer was answered but russie suddenly wondered what part god had had in creating the lizards and whatever other thinking races there might be if he had shaped them all what was man that he should notice him especially if lizards and any others were not his creatures what was his place in the universe had he any place in the universe posing the question in those terms was even more frightening than coming to meet with zolraag the governor said we have more food we give you more maybe soon russie nodded that meant he wasnt supposed to hold his breath zolraag went on you find out who is emperor of jews about german prisoners herr russie tell what you think to do not wait must know your excellency it shall be done russie repeated the phrase in the lizards language to them it was one to conjure with one almost as important as the shma yisroayl for an observant jew they built their lives around elaborate patterns of obedience in the same way people did around families it shall be done was the most potent promise they had when zolraag seemed to have nothing further to say russie got to his feet bowed to the lizard governor and started to leave then the lizard said a moment please moishe obediently turned back zolraag continued is always so not cold how do you say a little cold in warsaw cool russie asked cool yes that is word thank you is always so cool in warsaw it will be cooler yet later in the year your excellency russie answered puzzled it was still summer in warsaw not a hot summer but summer nonetheless he remembered the winter before when heat of any sort electricity coal even wood had been next to impossible to come by he remembered huddling with his whole family under all the bedclothes they had and his teeth chattering like castanets even so he remembered the endless sound of coughing that had filled the ghetto and picking out by ear the soft tubercular coughs from those brought on by pneumonia or influenza he remembered scrawny corpses lying in the harry turtledove snow and his relief that they might not start to stink until they were picked up if zolraag thought this august day cool how could he explain to the lizard what winter really meant he saw no way as well explain the talmud to a fiveyearold and a goyishe fiveyearold at that what hed already said would have to do zolraag hissed something in his own language russie caught a word or two inside a refrigerator then the governor switched back to german thank you herr russie for saying beforehand what may be bad about what comes for ah for warning you russie said warning yes that is word thank you good day herr russie good day your excellency russie bowed again this time zolraag did not detain him with more questions in the waiting room outside the governors office sat a handsome strikingly masculinelooking young catholic priest his pale eyes went icy for a moment when they met the jews but he managed a civil nod russie nodded back civility was not to be despised asking poles to love jews was asking for a miracle having asked for one miracle and received it moishe did not aim to push his luck with god but asking for civility that was within the realm of the possible zolraags headquarters lay in a block of two and threestory office buildings on grjecka street in southwestern warsaw a couple of the buildings had taken shell hits but most were intact save for such details as bullet holes and brokenout windows that made the block close to unique in the city russie thought as he scrunched through shards of glass nazi artillery and unending unchallenged streams of luftwaffe bombers had torn gaping holes in warsaw when the city stood siege after the germans invaded poland most of that rubble still remained the germans did not seem to care what sort of warsaw they ruled so long as it was theirs the buildings smashed in now had a weathered look to them as if theyd always been part of the landscape more ruins though were fresh sharpedged the germans had fought like men possessed to hold the lizards out of warsaw russie walked by the burnt shell of a nazi panzer it still exhaled the deadmeat stench of mans final corruption shaking his head russie marveled that so many germans here as elsewhere had expended so much courage for so bad a cause god had given mankind that particular lesson at least since the days of the assyrians but its meaning remained obscure a lizard fighting vehicle purred past the wrecked german tank when the nazis entered warsaw their roaming smokebelching panzers all hard lines and angles as if the faces of ss men were somehow turned to armor plate seemed dropped into straight from a malign worldwar in the balance future the lizards smoother faster nearly silent machines showed that the germans were not quite the masters of creation they fancied themselves to be it was a couple of kilometers back to the edge of the jewish quarter russie wore his long black coat unbuttoned but hed started to sweat by the time he drew near the ruined walls that marked off the former god be praised ghetto if zolraag thinks this is cool weather let him waft until january he thought reb moishe a peddler pushing a cart full of turnips paused to doff his cloth cap reb moishe a very pretty girl no more than thirteen or fourteen smiled she was gaunt but not visibly starving reb moishe one of anielewiczs fighters came to a fair approximation of attention he wore an old polish helmet a peasant blouse and baggy trousers tucked into german army boots twin bandoliers full of gleaming brass cartridges crisscrossed his chest the salutes pleased russie and reminded him hed become an important man here he gravely gave back each in turn but as he did so he wondered whether any of the people hed greeted would still have been alive had the lizards not come and if so how much longer they would have survived he wondered how much longer he would have survived himself and so i decided to help the lizards in the hope that they would then help my people he thought and they did and we were saved and what have i gained from this only to be branded a liar and a traitor and a renegade by those who will not believe their fellow men capable of what the germans did here tried to tell himself he did not care that the recognition of those inside warsaw those who knew the truth counted for more than anything anyone else could say that was true and not true at the same time given a choice he would sooner have worked with any human beings save only the germans against the invaders from another world but what choice had he had when the lizards came the russians were far away and themselves reeling under german attack the british were beleaguered the americans so distant they might as well have been on the dark side of the moon set beside the nazis the lizards looked like a good bargain no they were a good bargain all the same he sometimes wished hed not had to make it such thoughts flew away when he turned a corner and saw mordechai anielewicz coming toward him the young leader of the jewish fighters was surrounded by several of his men all of them heavily armed all in the ragged mishmash of military gear and ordinary clothes russie had seen on the other warrior anielewicz himself carried no weapons though he dressed as shab harry turtledove bily as his followers his firm stride and the space the others kept clear around him proclaimed him to be cock o the walk here he nodded cautiously to russie allies and rivals at the same time they drew their power from different sources anielewicz straight from the barrels of his fighters guns russie from the confidence the jews of warsaw placed in him because of that neither was as confident with the other as he would have been with one of his own kind anielewicz spoke first good day to you reb moishe how did your meeting with the lizard governor go well enough russie answered he complained the weather was too cool to suit him though did he anielewicz said a couple of the jewish fighters laughed anielewiczs smile was broad but never quite reached his eyes hell complain more in a few months and thats a fact what else did he have to sayz it doesnt sound as though theres much hope for more rations any time soon russie explained zolraags supply problems they were something the jews military leader needed to know too bad anielewicz scowled we really need more than the poles because we had so much less for so long but if he cant he cant i dont want to start a war with the armja krajowa over this they outnumber us too badly borkomorowski was in to see zolraag just before me he isnt too happy about how much were getting now too bad anielewicz said again still its worth finding out and its not what youd call a surprise his gaze sharpened he peered at russie as if over a gunsight and what did his lizardy excellency have to say about the nazi bastards and ss swine who couldnt run fast enough when they got thrown out of here has he figured out what hes going to do with them yet he asked me what i thought as a matter of fact russie said and what was your answer anielewicz asked softly russie took a deep breath before he answered i told him that if it were up to me i would treat them as prisoners of war almost all the fighters growled at that ignoring them moishe went on doing so would pull the teeth from the propaganda the germans are putting out against us and besides if we treat them as they treated us how are we any better than they they did it to us for sport when we do it to them its for vengeance anielewicz said with the same exaggerated patience he would have used in explaining to a child of four do you want to be the perfect ghetto jew reb moishe the one who never hits back no matter what the goyim do to you weve come too far for that he slapped one of his men on the shoulder the fellows slung mauser bounced up and down worldwar in the balance standing up to armed ruffians russie discovered was hardly easier when they were jews than it had been when they were germans he said you know what i am was i not with you when we rose but if murder in cold blood was wrong for the germans i tell you again that it does not magically become right for us what did zolraag think when you said this to him if i understand him rightly he thought i was out of my mind russie admitted which jerked a few startled laughs from the fighters around anielewicz he may well have a point the smile anielewicz gave russie was far from pleasant it reminded him of a wolf curling back its lip to show its teeth he studied the young jewish fighting leader anielewicz was different from the germans who had until lately been his models in matters military most of them were professionals going about their business no matter how horrific that business might be anielewicz by contrast gave the impression that he loved what he was doing did that make him better or worse russie couldnt decide he said as may be he wants some sort of consensus from us before he acts youll have noticed that the lizards think we must have someone who can make binding decisions for our whole community now mordechai anielewicz let out a snort of genuine amusement has he ever watched anyone trying to get three jews to agree about anything i would say not but i would also say something else we used the lizards to save our own lives because nothing they did to us could be worse than what the nazis were already doing well and good thus far mordechai no one who knows the truth of what we suffered could blame usthat a drowning man grabs any plank in the sea ne of the fighters growled what about the ones who wont believe the truth even when its shoved in their fat faces if youd believed the nazis would do all they said theyd do would you have stayed in poland russie asked like a lot of polish jews russie had relatives in england and more distant ones in the united states his parents had got letters after hitler came to power urging them to get out while they could they hadnt listened and they were dead now the fighter grunted he was in his late thirties maybe hed made the choice to stay himself instead of having his parents do it for him anielewicz put the conversation back on track were you coming to some sort of point about the lizards reb moishe i do hope so for youve said nothing to convince me thus far think about this then we did what we had to do with the lizards i grant you that but are we wise to do any more than we have to do telling them to shoot their german prisoner for us plays into their hands harry turtledove and into the hands of the rest of the germans as well if you do not think well of mercy for mercys sake look at that before you urge a slaughter are you sure you intended to be a doctor you argue like a reb thats certain but anielewicz really did think about what russied said russie could see it in his face slowly the fighting leader said youre telling me you dont want us to be the lizards catspaws thats it exactly maybe russie had found the key to reaching the fighting leader after all we have to be to some extent because were so much weaker than they are but when we let them put our name on their wickedness it becomes ours as well in the eyes of the world the fighter whod spoken before said he may have something there boss he sounded reluctant to admit it moishe admired him the more for speaking yes he just may the glance anielewicz shot russie was no more friendly for that by god reb moishe i want vengeance on those nazi bastards when the lizards bombed berlin i cheered do you know that i cheered i would be lying if i said i was as sorry as i should have been russie said well there you are anielewicz said as if hed proven something maybe he had if so russie did not care to concede it cheering though was wrong dont you see most of those germans had done nothing more to the lizards than wed done to the germans they just happened to be in berlin when the lizards dropped their bomb the lizards didnt care that they werent soldiers they went ahead and killed them anyhow they arent angels mordechai this i know anielewicz answered but better our devils than the devils on the other side no thats not the lesson moishe stubbornly shook his head the lesson is better that we not become devils ourselves anielewiczs scowl was fearsome russie felt the fear if the leader of the jewish fighting forces chose to ignore him what could he do about it but before anielewicz replied he glanced at the fighters who accompanied him a couple of them were nodding at russies words that seemed only to make anielewicz angrier all right he spat on the filthy cobblestones well keep the stinking germans alive then if you love them so well love them you must be out of your mind but i hope i still know what justice is and russie added i hope i still know that what mankind thinks of me is more important than any lizards good opinion and that includes zolraags his own vehemence surprised him the more so because he got on well with the aliens governor worldwar in the balance anielewicz also surprised him there for once we agree reb moishe there in fact we might even find common ground with general borkomorowski should the need ever arise really russie was not sure he wanted to find common ground with borkomorowski on anything save the desirability of getting rid of the germans borkomorowski was a good polish patriot which made him only a little less fascist or perhaps just less efficiently fascist than heinrich himmler still that may be useful one of these days moscow the winter before german troops had seen the spires of the kremlin from the russian capitals suburbs none came any closer than that and then theyd been thrown back in bitter fighting yet now heinrich jager walked freely through the streets the wehrmacht had been unable to reach beside him georg schultz looked this way and that as he did every day going to and from the kremlin schultz said i still have trouble believing how much of moscow is still in one piece we bombed it the lizards bombed it and here it is still its a big city jager answered it can take a lot of punishment and not show much big cities are hard to destroy unless his voice trailed away hed seen pictures of berlin now and wished he hadnt he and schultz both wore illfitting civilian suits of cheap fabric and outdated cut he would have been ashamed to put his on back in germany here though it helped him fit in for which he was just as glad he would not have been safe in his tankmans uniform in the ukraine the panzer troops had sometimes been welcomed as liberators germans remained enemies in moscow even after the coming of the lizards schultz pointed to a poster on a brick wall can you read what that says sir jagers russian was better than it had been but still far from good letter by unfamiliar cyrillic letter he sounded out the posters message smert means death he said i dont know what the second word is something to do with us something nasty schultz agreed the poster showed a pigtailed little girl lying dead on the floor a doll beside her a footprint in blood led the eye to a departing soldiers marching boot on the heel of which was a german swastika before he got to moscow jager had been certain down to the very core of him that the wehrmacht would have beaten the red army for good this year had the lizards not intervened now he wondered though hed never worldwar in the balance said so out loud it wasnt just that russia was so much bigger than germany he had known that all along but despite the stubbornness of soviet resistance he hadnt believed the russian people were as firmly behind stalin as the germans were behind hitler now he did and it was a disturbing thought his shoes scuffed on the paving of red square the germans had planned a victory parade there timed for the anniversary of the bolshevik revolution it hadnt happened russian sentries still paced back and forth in front of the kremlin wall in their own stiff version of the goose step jager and schultz came up to the gateway by which they entered the kremlin compound jager nodded to the guards there a group of men he saw every third day none of the russians nodded back they never did their leader who wore a sergeants three red triangles on his collar patches held out his hand papers he said in russian as usual he carefully examined the documents the germans produced compared photographs to faces jager was certain that if he ever forgot his papers the sergeant would not pass him through even though he recognized him breaking routine was not something the russians did well today though he and schultz had everything in order the sergeant started to stand aside to pass them through when someone else came trotting across red square toward the checkpoint jager turned to see who was in such a tearing hurry as he did his mouth fell open ill be goddamned schultz said which about summed things up unlike the tankmen the fellow approaching wore a german uniform an ss uniform at that and wore it with panache his every aggre stride seemed to warn that anyone who gave him trouble would hala thin time of it he was tall and broadshouldered and would have been handsome had a scar not seamed his left cheek actually he was handsome anyhow in a piratical sort of way instead of bristling at him as jager had expected the russian guards grinned and nudged each other the sergeant said papers the ss man drew himself up to his full impressive height stuff your papers and stuff you too he said in a deep booming voice his german held an austrian accent the sentries practically hugged themselves with glee the sergeant came to an attention stiffer than he might have granted marshal zhukov waved the big bruiser into the kremlin why didnt we ever try that schultz said admiringly i dont have the balls for it jager admitted the ss man spun toward them for all his size he was light on his feet so you are germans after all he said i thought you might be but what with those ragpickers getups i couldnt be sure till you opened your mouths who the devil are you anyway major heinrich jager sixteenth panzer jager answered crisply harry turtledove here is my tank gunner sergeant georg schultz and now herr hauptsturmfhrer i might ask you the same question the ss rank was the equivalent of captain however much brass this fellow had jager was his superior the ss mans brace was almost as rigid and as full of parody as the soviet sergeants had been clicking his heels he declared in falsetto ss hauptsturmfhrer otto skorzeny begs leave to report his presence sir jager snorted the scar on skorzenys cheek partly froze the left corner of his mouth and turned his smile into something twisted jager asked him what are you doing here especially in that suit youre lucky the ivans havent decided to take your nose and ears nonsense skorzeny said if he ever had doubts about anything he didnt show them in public russians only know how to be one of two things masters or slaves if you convince them youre the master what does that leave them if georg schultz murmured too softly for the ss man to hear you still havent said why youre here jager persisted i am acting under orders from skorzeny hesitated jager guessed hed been about to say from berlin he resumed from my superiors can you say the same he gave jagers russian suit a fishy stare beside jager schultz stirred angrily jager wondered if this arrogant hauptsturmfdhrer had ever seen action that required him to get those polished boots dirty but that question answered itself skorzeny wore the ribbon for a wound badge between the first and second buttons of his tunic all right he had some idea of what was real then and his counterquestion made jager think what would the authorities have to say about how he was working with the red army he briefly summarized how he had come to be in moscow maybe skorzeny had done some fighting but could he say hed taken out a lizard panzer not many had and not many of those who had still lived when he was through the ss man nodded now he blustered less you might say were both in moscow for the same reason then major whether with official approval or without we have a common interest in showing the ivans how to make themselves more effective foes for the lizards ah jager said just as the soviets no longer treated germans caught on russian soil as prisoners of war the surviving pieces of the government of the reich must have decided to do their best to keep the russians in the fight now and worry about their being bolshevik slavic untermenschen later the three germans walked together toward the kremlin the heart of soviet russia still wore the camouflage it had donned after the russogerman war began its bulging onion domes an architecture alien and oriental to jagers eyes had their gilding covered over with battleship gray worldwar in the balance paint walls were mottled with patches of black and orange yellow and brown rather like the hide of a leprous giraffe to confuse attackers from the air such tricks had not entirely spared it from damage stolid wideshouldered women in shawls and drab dresses carried bricks and chunks of wood away from a recent bomb hit the sicksweet stink of day before yesterdays battlefield hung over the place that smell always made jagers heart beat faster in remembered fear skorzeny grunted and put a hand over the right side of his belly jager thought the ss mans reaction similar to his own until he realized skorzenys face held real pain whats wrong he asked my fucking gall bladder the hauptsturrnfhrer answered it had me in the hospital for a while earlier this year but the doctors say it isnt going to kill me and lying around on my backside is a bloody bore so here i am up and doing again a good thing too you were here on the eastern front before sir georg schultz asked yes with das reich skorzeny said schultz nodded and said nothing more jager could guess what he was thinking a lot of people who saw action on the eastern front would fall down on their knees and thank god for an illness that got them sent back to germany and safety skorzeny by the way he talked would sooner have stayed and fought he didnt sound as though he were bluffing either jagers respect for him went up a notch in spite of the lizards air raids the kremlin still swarmed with life occasional holes merely showed jager the soldiers and bureaucrats bustlib out within in the same way as he could have seen the humming lif side an anthill with its top kicked off he was not surprised to find skorzeny heading for the same doorway as he and jager used naturally the ss man would also be meeting with officers from the defense commissariat the doorway into the kremlin itself like the one into the compound around it was guarded the lieutenant who headed this detachment put out his hand without a word without a word jager and schultz gave him their documents without a word he studied and returned them then he turned to skorzeny his hand still outstretched an impish grin lit the big mans face he seized the russian lieutenants hand vigorously pumped it up and down the guards stared in disbelief the lieutenant managed to return a sickly smile a couple of his men had raised their submachine guns when he smiled they lowered them again talk about balls one of these days hes going to get his blown off playing games like that schultz said out of the side of his mouth maybe maybe not jager answered hed known a few people who simply bulled their way through life charging at the world with such harry turtledove headlong aggression that it gave way before them korzeny seemed to be of that stripe on a larger scale so did adolf hitler and stalin it was easier to think of the soviet leader than of hitler as jager let the immensity of the kremlin swallow him and schultz skorzeny followed just inside the doorway stood a pair of russian lieutenantcolonels no germans would go wandering unescorted through the red armys holy of holies one of the russian officers wore a tankmans black collar patches good morning major jager sergeant schultz he said in excellent german lieutenantcolonel kraminov jager said nodding back politely viktor kraminov had been assigned to schultz and him since they came to moscow they might have traded shots with each other the year before for kraminov had been part of marshal budennys southern soviet army before being transferred to staff duty in moscow he had an old mans wise eyes set in a face of childlike innocence and knew more about handling panzers than jager would have expected from the russians battle performance the other lieutenantcolonel a fellow jager had not seen before wore green collar patches georg schultz frowned whats green stand for he whispered jager needed a minute to think russian infantry patches were maroon tanks artillery and engineers black cavalry dark blue air force light blue but what soviet service wore green as its waffenfarbe jager stiffened hes nkvd he whispered back chultz flinched jager didnt blame him just as no russian soldier would want to run across the gestapo so the germans naturally grew nervous at the sight of an officer of the peoples commissariat for the interior if hed come across the nkvd man a year ago he would have shot him at once german orders were to take no secret policemen or political commissars alive regardless of the laws of war after one brief glance the nkvd lieutenantcolonel ignored the two germans in civilian clothes hed been waiting for otto skorzeny a very good day to you herr hauptsturmfhrer he said his german was even better than kraminovs he sounded fussily precise like about half of jagers old gymnasium teachers hello boris you skinny old prunefaced bastard skorzeny boomed back jager waited for the heavens to fall the nkvd man who really was a skinny old prunefaced bastard just gave a tight little nod from which jager inferred hed been working with skorzeny for a while and had decided hed better make allowances the nkvd man boris turned toward lieutenantcolonel kraminov perhaps all five of us will work together today he said in chatting before you gentlemen arrived viktor danielovich and i discovered that we worldwar in the balance all may be able to contribute to an operation which will benefit both our nations it is as lieutenantcolonel lidov says kraminov agreed cooperation here will aid both the soviet union and the reich against the lizards you mean you want german help for something you dont think you can do on your own skorzeny said why do you need us for an operation which i presume will be on soviet soil his gaze came to a sudden sharp focus wait its on territory we took from you last year isnt it that may be lidov said the noncommittal reply convinced jager that skorzeny was right he made a mental note the ss man might bluster but he was anything but stupid lieutenantcolonel kraminov evidently saw dissimulation was useless too he sghed perhaps regretting it come all of you the germans followed the two russian officers down the long highceilinged halls of the kremlin other russian soldiers sometimes paused in their own duties to stare at skorzenys ss uniform but no one said anything they seemed to accept that the world had grown stranger these past few months the office jager and schultz entered was not the one kraminov used like kraminovs though it was surprisingly light and airy with a large window that gave a view of the grounds of the kremlin compound jager had looked for nothing but dank gloom at the heart of soviet russia but a moments reflection after finding the opposite told him that was silly even communists needed light by which to work and the kremlin was far older than either communism or electricity when it was raised the onl ht worth having came from the sun so large windowsutenantclonel lidov pointed to a samovar tea tovarishchii he asked jager frowned kraminov didnt call schultz and him comrades as if they were reds themselves but then kraminov was a tankman a warrior not nkvd at home jager drank coffee thick with cream but he hadnt been at home for a long time he nodded lidov poured for all of them at home jager didnt drink tea from a glass either he had done that before though with captured samovar sets in steppe towns and collective farms overrun by the wehrmacht lidov brewed better tea than hed had there the nkvd man set down his glass to business he said jager leaned forward and looked attentive georg schultz just sat where he was skorzeny slouched down in his chair and looked bored if that disconcerted lidov he didnt let it show to business he repeated as the hauptsturmfhrer has suggested the proposed action will take place in an area where the fascist invaders had established themselves prior to the arrival of the alien imperialist aggressors commonly known as lizards harry turtledove jager wondered if lidov talked that way all the time skorzeny yawned by fascist invaders i presume you mean us germans he sounded as bored as he looked you and your lackeys and running dogs yes maybe lidov did talk that way all the time however he talked he didnt retreat a centimeter though skorzeny could have broken him over his knee like a stick to resume then along with bands of gallant soviet partisans german remnant groups remain in the area under discussion thus the apparent expedience of a joint sovietgerman operation where is the area in question jager asked ah lidov said attend the map here if you please he stood up pointed to one of the charts tacked onto the wall the lettering of course was cyrillic but jager recognized the ukraine anyhow red pins showed soviet positions blue ones surviving german units and yellow the lizards the map had more yellow measles than jager liked lidov went on we are particularly concerned with this area north and west of kiev near the town of komarin there early in the struggle against the lizards you germans succeeded in wrecking with heavy artillery two major ships of the common enemy that made georg schultz sit up straighter so did jager it was news to him too skorzeny said and so this is no doubt excellent but how does it concern us here in and around the wreckage of one of these ships the lizards appear to be making no more than an ordinary effort at salvage this is emphatically not the case at the other tell us about the second one then jager urged yes that is what i was getting to major the nkvd man said we have reports from witnesses that the lizards are operating as if in an area of poison gas although no gas seems to be present not only do they wear masks in fact but also bulky fullbody protective suits you see the significance of this i trust ja jager said absently except for helmets and sometimes body armor lizards didnt wear clothes if they felt they needed to be protected from something whatever it was had to be pretty fierce as for gas he shivered a little as he remembered his own days in the trenches back in the first war a gas mask was torment made worth wearing only because it warded against worse it is not gas you say skorzeny put in no definitely not lidov answered there has been no problem due to wind or anything of that sort the lizards appear to be engaged in recovering certain chunks of metal strewn about over a wide area when their ship exploded these are loaded into lorries which seem to be very heavy for their size judging by the tracks they leave in dirt armorplated jager asked worldwar in the balance possibly lidov said or possibly lead jager thought about that lead was good for plumbing but for shielding the only time hed ever seen anyone use lead for shielding was when the fellow whod x rayed him after he was wounded put on a lead waistcoat before he took his pictures he made a sudden connection hed heard inside these very kremlin walls that the weapon which destroyed berlin had had some sort of effect not being a physicist he didnt know quite what related to xrays he said is this salvage related to these dreadful bombs the lizards have skorzenys dark eyes widened lidovs rather narrow ones already constricted by a tatar fold at their inner corners now thinned further in a voice silky with danger he said were you one of ours major jager i doubt you would long survive you speak your thoughts too openly georg schultz surged halfway out of his chair you watch your mouth you damned red jager set a hand on the gunners shoulder pushed him back into the seat do remember where we are sergeant he said dryly that is an excellent suggestion sergeant schultz the nkvd man agreed your loyalty does you credit but it is foolish here he turned back to jager you major may be too clever for your own good not necessarily otto korzeny spoke up for the panzer officer that we are here lieutenantcolonel lidov that you have said even so much on this sensitive matter argues that you need german assistance for whatever you have in mind you shall not get it unless major jiger here remains unharmed you do need us do you not in other circumstances histitkile would have been sweet now it mocked ov glared at him lieutenantcolonel kraminov who had let the other man do the talking till now said you are right worse luck herr hauptsturmfhrer this area has only russian partisans no regular red army forces as you germans drove these out last fall while brave enough the partisans lack the heavy armament required to attack a lizard lorry convoy there are however also fragmentary wehrmacht units in the area in regard to the lizards these are hardly more than partisan forces themselves lidov interrupted but they do retain more arms than our own glorious and heroic partisans that is true by his expression the truth tasted bad in his mouth thus we suggest a joint undertaking kraminov said you three will serve as our liaison with whatever german units remain north of kiev in the event we succeed in despoiling the convoy our two governments will share equally in what we capture is it agreed how do we know you wont keep everything for yourselves schultz asked harry turtledove you fascist aggressors were the ones who brutally violated the nonaggression pact the great stalin generously granted to hitler lidov snapped we are the ones who tremble at the thought of trusting you you wouldve jumped us if we hadnt schultz said angrily comrades lieutenantcolonel kraminov said in german which gave the word a different feel from the harsh russian lidov had used please comrades if we are to be comrades we shall need to work together if we go at each others throats only the lizards will benefit hes right georg jager said if we start arguing well never get anything done he hadnt forgotten his own dislike and contempt for nearly everything hed seen in the soviet union but could not deny the russians fought hard nor that they were masters of partisan warfare for now let ideology wait can you get me a telegraph line to germany otto skorzeny asked i must have authorization before proceeding with this scheme provided the latest lizard advances have not cut it yes lidov said i can also let you transmit on the frequency arranged with your government you must talk around what you truly wish to say there however to keep the lizards from following if they intercept the signal as they very likely will the telegraph first then skorzeny said that failing the radio the mission strikes me as worth accomplishing other concerns can wait he studied the nkvd lieutenantcolonel as if through the eyepiece of a panzer cannon sight lidov scowled right back at him without words both men said that while other concerns could wait they were not forgotten liu han sat naked on the shiny mat in her room in the giant airplane that somehow never fell down from the sky she made herself into the smallest bundle she could legs drawn up tight hands clasped on her shins head pressed down till it touched her knees with her eyes closed she could imagine the entire universe around her had disappeared her world view did not include the concept experimental animal but that was what she had become the little scaly devils who held her here wanted to discover certain things about the way people functioned and were using her to help them learn they cared not at all what she thought of the process the door to the chamber slid open before she could will herself to stillness she looked up two lizards marched in with a man a foreign devil not even decently chinese between them the man wore no more clothes than she did another one here one of the scaly devils said in his hissing chinese she lowered her head again refused to answer another one she thought when would they be satisfied that she could indeed fit the drons worldwar in the balance of however many men they brought her this was the fifth the sixth she couldnt remember maybe after a while it ceased to matter how could her defilement grow any greater she tried to recapture the feeling of power the feeling of being her own person shed known for that little while when yi min was helpless and afraid then her own will had mattered if only for a short time before then shed been held in her place by the customs of her village and her people afterward by the terrifying might of the lizards just for a moment though shed almost been free you two show what you do you eat you not no food for you the devil said liu han knew he meant it after the first couple of men in this grim series shed tried to starve herself to death but her body refused to obey her her belly cried louder than her spirit eventually she did what she had to do to eat the other lizard spoke to the foreign devil in a language that was neither chinese nor the lizards own speech liu han still tried to pick up words of that whenever she could then the scaly devils went out of the chamber they were probably taking pictures but that was not the same as having them in the room she still drew the line there reluctantly she looked up at the foreign devil he was very hairy and had grown a short thick beard that reached to within a couple of fingers breadth of his eyes his nose seemed nearer a hawks beak than what a proper person should grow his skin was not too different in color from hers at least he did not simply ravage her as one man had the second the door closed behind him he stood quietly watching her letting her look hinlґer sighing she stretched herself out flat on the mat come ahead lett it over with she said in chinese her weary voice full of infinite bitterness he stooped beside her she tried not to cringe he said something in his own language she shook her head he tried what sounded like a different tongue but she understood no better she expected him to get on top of her then but instead he let out hisses and grunts which she realized after a moment were words in the lizards speech name is he ended with the cough that showed the sentence was a question her eyes filled with tears none of the others had even bothered to ask name is liu han she answered sitting up she had to repeat herself the accents she and he gave the lizards words were so different that they had trouble following each other once shed given her name she saw she ought to treat him as a human being too you name is he pointed to his furry chest bobby fiore he turned toward the doorway by which the little scaly devils had departed spoke their name for themselves race then he delivered an extraordinary series of gestures most of which shed never seen before but all obviously a long way harry turtledove from compliments either he didnt know his picture was being taken or he didnt care some of his antics were so spirited almost like those of a traveling actor in a skit that she found herself smiling for the first time in a long while race bad she said when he was done and gave the different cough that put extra stress on what she said instead of answering with words he just repeated the emphatic cough shed never heard a little scaly devil do that but she followed him well enough no matter how they despised their captors though they remained captive if they were going to eat they had to do what the scaly devils wanted liu han still didnt understand why the lizards thought it important to prove that men and women didnt go into heat and could lie with each other any time but they did she lay back again maybe it wouldnt be so bad this time as far as skill went yi min was three times the lover the foreign devil with the unpronounceable second name proved to be but if he was rather clumsy he treated her as though it were their wedding night not as if she was a handy convenience she hadnt imagined foreign devils had so much kindness in them few enough chinese did she hadnt known any kindness since her husband died in the japanese attack on her village to thank him she did her best to respond to his caresses shed been through too much though her body would not answer still when he closed his eyes and groaned atop her she was moved to reach up and stroke his cheek the beard there was almost as rough as a bristle brush she wondered if it itched he slid out of her sat back on his knees she drew up one leg to hide her secret place foolish when hed just been inside her he pantomimed smoking a cigarette with such nimble gestures that she started to laugh before she could catch herself he raised a bushy eyebrow took another drag on the imaginary smoke then made as if to crush it out on his chest hed so convinced her the nothing between his two fingers was real she exclaimed in chinese dont get burned that set her laughing again she groped for words in the lizards tongue the only one they had in common you not bad you liu han he said her name so strangely she needed a moment to recognize it you not bad also she looked away from him she didnt know she was crying till the first scalding tears ran down her cheeks once she started she discovered she could not stop she wailed and keened for all shed lost and suffered and endured for her husband and her village for her very world and her own violation shed never imagined she had so many tears inside her after a little while she felt bobby fiores hand on her shoulder hey he said hey she didnt know what it meant in his language she worldwar in the balance didnt know if it meant anything or was just a sound she did know his voice held sympathy and that he was the only human being whod shown her any since her nightmare began she twisted around and clung to him till shed cried herself out he didnt do much but let her hold him he ran a hand through her hair once or twice and quietly said hey a few more times she hardly noticed so consumed was she by her own grief as her sobs at last slowed to gasps and hiccups she felt his erection pressed against her belly hot as the tears shed shed she wondered how long hed had it it didnt surprise her she would have been surprised if a naked man in the arms of a naked woman failed to rise what surprised her was that hed been content to ignore it what could she possibly have done to stop him if hed decided to take her again his restraint made her want to cry again she realized how desperate shed grown when simply not being raped became a kindness worth tears he asked her something in his own language she shook her head he shook his too maybe angry at himself for forgetting she couldnt understand his eyebrows came together as he looked thoughtfully past her shoulder toward the blank metal wall of the chamber he tried the scaly devils speech you liu han not bad now not so bad bobby fiore when she tried to say his name she botched it at least as badly as he had hers oka he said she did understand that a city person in one of the films shed seen had said it people in the city picked up foreign devils slang along with their machines and funny clothes he let go of her she looked down at herself shed held him so tight theooth skin of her chest had the marks of his hair pressed into it his ere started to droop now that she no longer lay against him she reached out and closed her hand around him the lizards had taken everything shed ever had leaving her with only her body with which to thank him that eyebrow of his went up again so did what she was holding somehow the heat of it against the palm of her hand brought comfort if it was good this time if she lost herself in her body sheer sensation might let her forget for a little while the metal room in which she was trapped and the scaly devils who kept her here to satisfy their own perverse curiosity she moaned softly as she lay back on the mat once more she wanted it to be good hoped it would be bobby fiore moved beside her his lips came down on hers his hand roamed her body a bit sooner than she would have liked his fingers found their way between her legs they didnt go quite to the right place after a few seconds of frustration she reached down and moved them to where they belonged he frowned for a moment she hoped she hadnt angered him who harry turtledove could say what might anger a foreign devil he didnt put his hand back where it had been though and now it was better now her eyes closed and her buttocks clenched and her back began to arch as if from far away she heard him laugh deep in his throat she was at the edge of the clouds and rain when he took his hand away her eyes opened it was her turn to start to frown but his weight pressed her against the slick surface of the mat his tongue teased her left nipple as he guided himself into her her legs rose clenched around him with her inner muscles she squeezed him as hard as she could ah he said in surprise or delight or both at once then she stopped listening to anything but what her body told her afterward they were both sweaty and breathing hard the only thing wrong with making love liu han thought as the afterglow faded was that it didnt really help all the troubles pleasure had let her ignore were still here none had got any better ignoring troubles was not meeting them she knew that but what else here could she do she wondered if foreign devils had the wit to be disturbed by such worries she glanced over at bobby fiore his hairy face had turned serious his own gaze distant and inward surely thoughts much like her own were passing through his head but when he noticed her looking at him he smiled and sat up in one smooth motion he might have been imperfectly skilled in matters of the mattress but he had a wellmuscled body which he handled well otherwise he also had a sense of foolishness this time he pretended to smoke two cigarettes at once one in each hand liu han laughed a few seconds later she rolled over and gave the foreign devil with the funny name a long grateful hug whatever private fears or worries hed been brooding about hed set them aside to make her feel better that was something else that hadnt happened since the scaly devils came as if thinking of the little devils was enough to make them appear the door to the hallway outside her chamber slid open the devils who had brought bobby fiore in now returned to take him away again that was how it went they forced a man on her then took him away so she never saw him again up till now that had been only a relief now it wasnt or not so much but the devils didnt care one way or the other or so she thought until the scaly devil who spoke chinese after a fashion said you do mating two times why two times never two times before absurdly he sounded suspicious as if hed caught her enjoying herself at what was supposed to be hard work well in a way he had shed learned honest answers worked best with the little devils we did it twice because i liked him much more than i liked any of the others i just wanted to be rid of them but he is not a bad man if he were chinese he might be a very good man worldwar in the balance the other devil was talking with bobby fiore he answered in his own language it wasnt chinese so liu han could make nothing out of it because it had no tones it sounded to her more like animals grunting than speech she wondered how and if foreign devils managed to understand one another but compared to the hisses and coughs the scaly devils used bobby fiores foreign devil language was as lovely as a beautiful song the little scaly devil who had been talking with her turned and spoke to the one whod been talking with bobby fiore they made their snaky noises back and forth liu han tried to follow what they were saying but couldnt they talked too fast she worried the last time shed had a moment of feeling partway safe and secure the scaly devils had turned her into a whore what new horror were they plotting now the one who spoke bobby fiores language said something to him he nodded as he answered that seemed to mean the same thing to him as it did to her so hed probably just said yes but yes to what the lizard who knew a little chinese turned both his eyes back to her you want come back again this man the question took her by surprise again she gave an honest answer what i really want is to go back to the camp you took me from if you will not do that i wish you would just leave me alone here and not make me give my body for food this one choice not for you the scaly devil said this other choice not for you either what choices do you give me liu han asked bleakly then she re alized this was the first time the little scaly devils had offered her any at all up till now theyd simply done with her as they pleased chow ma she had reason to hope come back again this man one choice the little devil said other choice come in here new man you pick choice now liu hah felt like screaming at him he would not free her he just let her choose between two kinds of degradation but any choice was better than none bobby fiore had not hit her though hed gone into her he hadnt forced her hed let her clutch at him when she cried hed even made her laugh with his silly imaginary cigarettes and he hated the little scaly devils maybe nearly as much as she did i would rather have this man come back again she said as fast as she could not wanting to give the little devil a chance to change his mind he turned to the other devil they talked back and forth once more the one who spoke chinese said big ugly male say he want come again too we do that see what happen you him we learn plenty maybe she couldnt have cared less what the scaly devils learned except in sofar as she hoped they learned nothing whatever but she smiled her thanks to bobby fiore if he hadnt been willing to come back to her then harry turtledove whatever she wanted probably wouldnt have mattered he smiled back liu han not bad he said and gave the emphatic cough the two scaly devils both made noises like kettles bubbling over the one who spoke chinese asked why use our tongue talk you him we dont know each others languages liu han answered shrugging the scaly devils could do all sorts of things shed never imagined possible but sometimes they were genuinely stupid ah this one said we learn again he and his companion led bobby fiore out of the chamber just before the door slid shut and hid him he raised yet another pretended cigarette to his lips liu han stood for a while staring at the closed door panel then she noticed or rather paid heed to being messy and dripping the cubicle had a faucet that released a few seconds worth of water when she pushed a button by it she went over and cleaned herself as best she could when she was done she didnt feel the need to wash again and again and again as she had several times before once was enough that to her meant progress flight leader teerts felt like a longball back on home two males would toss a ball back and forth starting out at arms length from each other every time one of them caught it hed take a step backwards good longball players could keep the game going until they were a city block apart championship players could go almost twice that far the shiplords of the invasion fleet had them all beat theyd thrown teerts and his flight of killerplanes back and forth across the whole length of tosev s main continental mass hed begun the campaign by swatting britainish bombardment aircraft out of the sky now he was attacking nipponese ground positions almost halfway around this cold wet world there they are gefrons voice came through the flight leaders headphones i have them on my terrain mapper teerts checked the display yes those were the races landcruisers and other fighting vehicles up ahead their iff transponders all glowing cheerily orange ahead of them lay the nipponese trench lines in front of what was the name of the town harbin that was it which the killerplanes were supposed to soften up that is affirmative gefron teerts said i say again affirmative pilot rolvar have you also acquired the target i have flight leader rolvar answered formally then his voice changed now lets go smash it teerts would not have wanted to be one of the big ugly soldiers down there the peaceful night was about to turn hideous for them at the precise programmed instant rockets leapt away from his killercraft to slice into the gashed earth in which the nipponese huddled the flames from their motors reminded him of knives of fire worldwar in the balance since he was flight leader he had a display rolvar and gefron lacked one that showed theyd also launched their rocket packs a moment later ground explosions confirmed that there were far more of them than his own munitions load could have accounted for by itself lets see how they like that gefron shouted jubilantly we should have given it to them a long time ago by the emperor pilots got special training so their eyes did not leave their instruments when they heard the emperors sacred name teerts kept on paying attention to his cabin displays he felt the same excitement gefron had shown it was as close to arousal as a male could know in the absence of females he also wished his flight had been able to attack the nipponese sooner but there were only so many killerplanes and so many tosevite positions to smash this one had had to wait its turn it would have waited longer still had the shiplords not thrown his flight east against it his aircraft roared low over the shattered trench line little dots of flame sprang into being on the ground as the surviving big uglies fired blindly at him the nipponese were not the only tosevite army to do that teerts had listened to the briefings he supposed shooting back made the big ugly soldiers feel less like the helpless victims they really were its probability of doing anything more than that was very small teerts didnt gamble gambling was a vice of support for males who had time to kill which was not one of his problems hed been in action from the start but if hed sat down with the little plastic dodecahedrons a few times he would have understood with his gut rather than just with hiss in the difference between a small probability and zero probability w e left engine made a horrible noise then died his killercraft lurdted in midair a small towns worth of warning lights came on all over his instrument panel at the same time he keyed his radio flight leader teerts aborting mission and attempting to return to base i must have sucked a bullet or something right into one turbofan may the spirits of departed emperors take you safely home rolvar and gefron said in the same breath rolvar added we will finish the attack run on the tosevites flight leader im sure you will teerts said rolvar was a good reliable male so was gefron in a different more primitive way between the two of them theyd make the nipponese wish theyd never been hatched teerts swung his killercraft westward back toward the base from which hed set out he could fly on one engine though he wouldnt be very fast or maneuverable get repairs made and hed be good as new tomorrow the right engine made a horrible noise then died all at once teerts instrument panel was nothing but warning lights this isnt fair the flight leader thought his hardwon altitude began to harry turtledove slip as the aircraft became nothing more than an aerodynamic stone in the sky ejecting i say again ejecting he yelled his thumbclaw hit a button hed never expected to have to use something about the size of the invasion fleets bannership booted him in the base of the tail as hard as it could his eyes stayed open but he briefly saw only gray mist pain soon brought him back to his senses one of the three bones in his left wrist had surely broken at the moment though that was the least of his worries still strapped into his seat he floated above the nipponese lines like the biggest most tempting target in the whole empire the big uglies blazed away at him for all they were worth he watched in fearful fascination as holes appeared in the ripstop fabric of his parachute too many holes or three or four too close together and ripstopping wouldnt matter much then a bullet smacked the armored bottom of the seat he hissed in fright and tried to draw up his legs not fair he thought again the whole killercraft was armored not just the bottom of the seat bullets that hit were nearly harmless but turbofan blades immensely strong though they were couldnt chew up lead if you were colossally unlucky enough to lose both engines that way if you were that unlucky you had to hope the big uglies wouldnt catch you and do the frightful things rumor said they did to prisoners you had to hope you landed a little ways away from them so you could unstrap and try to evade until the rescue helicopter got there to pick you up but if you were that unlucky who cared what you hoped teerts had spilled wind from his canopy trying to float as far back toward the races lines as he could that would have made rescuing him a lot easier if he hadnt come down right in the middle of a nipponese trench he was sure he was dead the big uglies swarmed around him shouting at one another and brandishing rifles with knives stuck onto the ends of their barrels he waited for them to shoot him or stick him a little more pain he told himself and everything would be over his spirit would join those of the emperors now departed to serve them in death as he had served the race in life one of the nipponese outshouted the rest by the way they cleared a path for him he must have been an officer he stood in front of teerts hands on hips staring at him with the small immobile eyes that characterized the big uglies instead of a rifle he carried a sword not too different from the one borne by the tosevite warrior in the picture the races probe had sent home teerts wondered why he didnt draw it and use it why else had the others drawn back but to give their commander the privilege of the kill but the officer did not strike instead he gestured for teerts to free himself from the straps that held him in his seat worldwar in the balance the flight leader obeyed awkwardly because his left hand wouldnt work as soon as hed moved a couple of paces away from the seat the nipponese did take his sword from its sheath he slashed twohanded at the lines that held teerts parachute to the ejection seat the sword must have had good metal in it for the tough lines parted almost at once the parachute canopy blew away the officer said something to his males several of them raised their rifles and fired repeatedly into the seat the blasts almost deafened teerts they also dismayed him right down to the claws on his toes those bullets were certain to smash the homing beacon buried in the padding baring his small flat teeth the nipponese pointed east with his sword he barked out a phrase that probably meant something like get moving teerts got moving the officer and several of his males followed to make sure the flight leader didnt try to run teerts had no intention of running since he hadnt been killed out of hand he expected to be treated fairly well the race held far more tosevite captives than the other way round and mistreatment of prisoners could be avenged tenthousandfold not only that the big uglies barbarous though they were fought among themselves so often that theyd developed protocols for dealing with captured enemies teerts couldnt remember offhand whether nippon adhered to those protocols but most toscvite empires did jets screamed overhead back where the ejection seat had landed that would be gefron and rolvar trying to keep him from being captured too late unfortunately not only had he landed among the big uglies but this officer was alert enough to have wrecked the beacon and got him away frjt in a hurry ltill he didnt think things would be too bad the officer first took him to a medical station a nipponese doctor with corrective lenses held in front of his eyes by a weird contraption of bent wires bandaged his wrist and poured a stinging disinfectant over the cuts and scrapes hed got in his ejection and landing by the time the doctor was done teerts felt halfway decent then the nipponese officer started hustling him away from the front line again the jets wail vanished the other two pilots in the flight must have expended their munitions and had to head home artillery shells whistled overhead every so often most came from the west and landed on tosevite positions the big uglies kept firing back though they seemed too stubborn to know when to give up teerts walked toward the dawn that was breaking in the east as light grew nipponese artillery fire also picked up lacking nightvision gear the tosevites were limited to targets they could actually see each salvo of theirs drew quick counterbattery fire from the gunners of the race back at the rear edge of the nipponese trench system a new party of harry turtledove big uglies took charge of teerts by the way the officer who had captured him acted toward the one who now received him the latter was far more prominent they bowed to each other one last time before the junior officer and the males who had accompanied him headed back to their position teerts new keeper surprised him by speaking the language of the race you come this way he said his accent was mushy and he barked out his words but the flight leader followed him well enough where are you taking me teerts asked glad for the chance to communicate with something more expressive than gestures the nipponese officer whirled and struck him he staggered and almost fell the blow had been cleverly aimed not talk unless i say you can talk the big ugly shouted you prisoner now not master you obey obedience had been drilled into teerts his whole life long his captor might be a savage but he spoke as one who had the right to command almost instinctively the flight leader responded to his tone may i speak he asked as humbly as if he were addressing a shiplord hal the nipponese said a word teerts did not understand as if realizing that the tosevite abandoned his own jargon speak speak thank you exalted male with no notion of the officers rank teerts laid the honorifics on with a trowel without asking where exalted male do you have places in which you keep your captives from the race the nipponese showed his teeth among the big uglies teerts knew that was a gesture of amiability not amusement the officer however looked not the least bit amiable he said you prisoner now no one care what happen to you forgive me exalted male but i do not understand you tosevites teerts carefully did not say big uglies take prisoners in your own wars and mostly treat them well is it just to use us so differently from your own not do so the nipponese officer answered be prisoner go against bushido the word was in nipponese the officer explained it against way of fighting male proper fighting male die before become prisoner become prisoner not deserve to live become how you say sport for those who catch thats teerts caught himself before he blurted out insane thats not the way most other tosevites act they fools idiots we nipponese we how you say people of the emperor our way right proper same family rule us two thousand five hundred year he drew himself up as if that paltry figure were a matter for pride teerts didnt think it wise to point out that the emperors family had ruled the race for fifty thousand years which was twentyfive thou worldwar in the balance sand revolutions of tosev a small pride he reasoned might be more easily hurt by a large truth he said what will you do with me then what we want the officer answered you ours now if you mistreat me the race will avenge itself on your people teerts warned the nipponese officer made a peculiar barking noise after a bit teerts realized it had to be what the big uglies used for laughter the officer said your race already hurt nippon so bad how you do worse on account of prisoners eh you try make me afraid i show you i not afraid to do this he kicked teerts hard the flight leader hissed in surprise and pain when the big ugly kicked him again he whirled round and tried to fight back even if he was smaller than a tosevite he had teeth and claws they did him no good the officer did not even bother reaching for the sword or the small firearm he carried on his belt hed somehow learned to use his legs and arms as deadly weapons teerts couldnt so much as tear his tunic the beating and stomping went on for some time finally the nipponese officer kicked the flight leaders broken wrist teerts vision blurred and threatened to go outr just as it had when the ejection seat hurled him away from his killercraft as if from very far away he heard someone screaming enough enough he needed a while before he recognized the voice as his own you talk stupid again the big ugly asked he stood balanced on one leg ready to kick teerts some more if the flight leader said no the tz ite might stop if he said yes he was sure hed get kicked to deathizot the feehng the officer dn much care one way or the other what he answered in a way that indifference was even more frightening than the beating itself no i wont talk stupidly again or ill try not to anyway teerts gasped the tiny qualification held all the defiance left in him you get up then teerts didnt think he could but if he failed the big ugly would have another excuse to hurt him he struggled to his feet did his best to wipe the mud off his scales onehanded what you learn from this the nipponese officer asked the flight leader could hear the danger in that question it wasnt just rhetoric hed better answer it in a way that satisfied the tosevite slowly he said i learned that i am your prisoner that i am in your power that you can do whatever you want with me the big ugly moved his head up and down you keep this in your mind eh yes teerts didnt think he was likely to forget harry turtledove the nipponese officer gave him a light shove you come on then moving hurt but teerts managed he didnt dare fail maybe the big ugly really had taught him a lesson after all dawn was breaking when they came to a transport center the race had worked it over at least once truck carcasses lay here and there some flipped over others burnt out still others both but the center still functioned nipponese soldiers chanting as they worked unloaded cloth sacks from a few intact motor vehicles and from a great many animaldrawn wagons the officer shouted to the males there a couple of them came rushing over they exchanged bows with the flight leaders captor spoke rapidly back and forth the officer shoved teerts again pointed toward a wagon you go on that one teerts awkwardly climbed into the wagon the nipponese officer gestured for him to sit in one corner he obeyed the wooden bottom and sides scratched against his sore hide the officer and a big ugly soldier got into the wagon with him now the officer took out his small firearm the soldier kept his rifle aimed at teerts too the flight leaders mouth wanted to fall open the tosevites had to be crazy if they thought he was in any shape to try something crazy they might have been but they werent stupid the officer spoke again in his own language the males around the wagon obeyed with an alacrity that would not have shamed members of the race they snatched up a heavy dirty tarpaulin and draped it over teerts and his guards no one see you now the officer said and laughed his noisy barking laugh once more teerts was afraid he was right from the air the wagon would look like any other hardly worth shooting up and certainly not worth investigating oh in an infrared scan the wagon bed might show up warmer than it would have were it just carrying supplies but no one was likely to bother scanning it somebody with heavy booted feet got up onto the front of the wagon the part the tarpaulin didnt cover the wagon shifted under his weight the newcomer said something though not to teerts or the big uglies the only answer he got was a soft snort from one of the two animals tethered to the front end of the wagon the animals started to walk in that instant teerts discovered the wagon had no springs he also discovered the road over which it traveled did not deserve the name the first two jounces made him bite his tongue after that with the iron taste of blood in his mouth he deliberately clamped his jaws shut and endured the rattling as best he could he was jolted worse here at a walking pace than hed ever been inside his killercraft worldwar in the balance after a while daylight began to seep through the space between the tarpaulin and the top of the wagon the two tosevites did not seem to have so much as twitched since they sat down their weapons remained pointed straight at teerts he wished he were as dangerous as they thought he was may i speak he asked the nipponese officers head moved up and down hoping that meant yes the flight leader said may i please have some water hai the officer said he turned to the other male spoke briefly the soldier shifted his weight he could move after all he carried a water bottle slung on his right hip he undid it with one hand the other kept his rifle aimed at teerts passed it to his commander the officer in turn gave it to teerts making sure all the while that the flight leader could not grab his small firearm teerts found the water bottle hard to use the tosevites could wrap their flexible lips around its opening to keep from spilling it his own mouthparts were less mobile he had to hold the bottle above his head pour the water down into his mouth even so some of it dribbled out the corners of his jaws and made a couple of small puddles on the floor of the wagon refreshed he dared ask may i also have some food saying the word told him how empty his belly was you eat food like us the officer paused tried to make himself clearer you eat food from this world of course i do teerts answered surprised the big ugly could doubt it why would we conquer this world if we could not support ourselves upz i afterwards he officer grunted then spoke to the other soldier again this time the junior male moved slowly grudgingly he had to put down his rifle to reach into the pack on his back from it he took out a cloth wrapped around a couple of flat whitish grainy cakes he handed one of them to teerts carefully refolded the cloth and put the other cake back into the pack then he picked up the rifle again by the way he held it he wouldnt have been sorry to shoot the flight leader teerts stared down at the cake he held in his good hand it didnt look particularly appetizing why was the male so unhappy to give it up the flight leader took a while to realize the two cakes might have been the only food the soldier had theyre barbarians after all he reminded himself they still have things like hunger and weve been hitting their supply lines as hard as we can he knew about hunger himself now he bit into the cake it tasted bland and starchy given a better choice it wasnt anything he would have eaten of itself though his tongue flicked out to clean the last cou harry turtledove ple of crumbs off his claw he wished he had another cake just like it or maybe another three maybe he thought too late he shouldnt have shown just how hungry he was he didnt like the way the nipponese officer stretched out his lips and showed his teeth vyacheslav molotov glanced around the room here was a sight that would have been impossible to imagine a few months before diplomats from allies and axis imperialists and progressives fascists and communists and capitalists all gathered together to seek a common strategy against a common foe had molotov been a different man he might have smiled as it was his expression never wavered he had been in a place more unimaginable than this when he floated featherlight in the lizard leaders bakeoven of a chamber hundreds of kilometers above the earth but this london room was remarkable enough the room might have been anywhere in the world it was in london because great britain lay relatively close to all the powers here save only japan the lizards hadnt invaded the islands and their attacks on shipping wh aphazard enough to have given everyone a reasonable chance of arri safely and indeed everyone had arrived safely though the conference was starting late because the japanese foreign minister had been delayed zigzagging around the lizardheld areas of north america the only disadvantage molotov could see to meeting in london was that it gave winston churchill the right to preside molotov had nothing personal against churchill though imperialist he was a staunch antifascist and without him britain might well have folded up and come to terms with the hitlerites in that would have left the soviet union in a bad way when the nazis turned east the next year no it wasnt personal animosity but churchill did have a habit of going on and on he was by all accounts a master orator in english molotov unfortunately spoke no english even masterful oratory when understood only through the murmurs of an interpreter soon palled that didnt bother churchill round and plump and ruddyfaced waving a long cigar he looked the very picture of a capitalist oppressor but his words were defiant we cannot yield another inch of ground to these creatures it would mean slavery for the human race forevermore harry turtledove if we didnt all agree in this we would not be here today cordell hull said the us secretary of state raised a wry eyebrow count ciano isnt for instance molotov appreciated the dig at the italians who had given up even pretending to fight the lizards a couple of weeks before the italians had named fascism and now they showed its bankruptcy by yielding essentially at the first blow the germans at least had the courage of their convictions mussolini seemed to lack both translators murmured to their principals joachim von ribbentrop spoke fluent english so the five leaders got along with three languages and thus only two interpreters per man that made the talks cumbersome but not unmanageably so shigenori togo said i feel our primary goal here is not so much to affirm the fight against the lizards with which we all agree but to ensure that we do not allow the hostilities previously existing among ourselves adversely to affect our struggle that is a good point molotov said the soviet union and japan had been neutral which allowed each of them to devote its full energies to foes it reckoned more important though japans foes were the ussrs allies in its battle against germany japans axis partner diplomacy could be a strange business yes it is cordell hull said we have come a long way in that direction mr togoa short while ago youd not have been welcome in london and even less welcome traveling across the united states to get here togo bowed in his seat politely acknowledging the americans reply churchill said another point we must address is the trouble we have rendering aid to one another as matters now stand we must sneak about on our own world like so many mice fearing the cat it is intolerable it shall not stand bravely spoken as usual comrade prime minister molotov said you set forth an important and inspiring principle but unfortunately offer no means of putting it into effect to find such a means is the reason we have agreed to meet in spite of past differences ribbentrop said molotov did not dignify that with a reply if churchills gift was for inspiration the nazi foreign ministers was for stating the obvious molotov wondered why the pompous posturing fool couldnt have been in berlin when it disappeared from the face of the earth hitler might have had to replace him with a capable diplomat airraid sirens began to wail lizard jets shrieked by on lowlevel attack runs antiaircraft guns pounded not as many as warded moscow molotov thought but a goodly number none of the diplomats at the table moved everyone looked at everyone else for signs of fear and tried not to give any of his own they had all come under air attack before worldwar in the balance times like these make me wish i were back in the wine business ribbentrop said lightly he had animal courage if nothing else hed been decorated for bravery during the first world war i want those goddamned planes shot down churchill said as if giving someone unseen an order if only it were that easy molotov thought if stalin could have done it by giving an order the lizards would long since have ceased to trouble us as would the hitlerites some things unfortunately yielded to no mans orders maybe that was why foolish people imagined gods into being to have someone whose orders were sure to be obeyed a stick of bombs crashed down not far from the foreign office building the noise was cataclysmic windows rattled one broke and fell in tinkling shards to the floor the interpreters were less obliged to show sangfroid than the men they served several of them muttered one of ribbentrops aides crossed himself and began fingering a rosary more bombs fell another window broke or rather blew inward a fragment of glass flew past molotovs head and shattered against the wall the translator whod been praying cried out and clapped a hand to his cheek blood leaked between his fingers o much for your imaginary god molotov thought as usual though his face revealed nothing of what went on in his mind if you like gentlemen we can adjourn to the shelter in the basement churchill said interpreters looked hopefully at foreign ministers molotov checked his confreres none of them said anything in spite of the suggestions obvious good sense molotov took the bull by the horns yes let us do that comrade prime minister in all candor our lives are valuable to the native serve foolish displays of bravado gain us nothing if we can keep safarwe should do so almost as one the diplomats and interpreters rose from their seats and moved toward the door no one thanked molotov for cutting through the facade of bourgeois manners but hed expected no thanks from class enemies as the soviet foreign minister set foot on the stairs leading down another irony struck him for all their advanced technology the lizards appeared in marxistleninist terms still to be in the ancient economic organizational system using slave labor and plunder from captive races to maintain their imperial superstructure next to them even churchill even ribbentrop was progressive the thought amused and appalled molotov at the same time another stick of bombs shook the foreign office as the diplomats descended to the cellar cordell hull slipped and almost fell catching himself at the last instant by grabbing the shoulder of the japanese interpreter in front of him jesus christ the secretary of state exclaimed molotov understood harry turtledove that without translation though the american pronounced christ as if it were chwist hull followed it with several more sharpsounding remarks what is he saying molotov asked his englishspeaking translator oaths the man answered forgive me comrade foreign commissar but i do not follow them easily the americans accent is different from churchills with which i am more familiar when he speaks deliberately i have no trouble understanding him but the twang he gives his words when he is excited makes them difficult for me do your utmost molotov said he hadnt thought about there being more than one dialect of english to him it was all equally incomprehensible stalin and mikoyan spoke russian with an accent of course but that was because the one came from geoxgia and the other from armenia the interpreter seemed to imply something else more like the differences between the russian of a kolkhoznik near the polish border the former polish border molotov thought and that of a moscow factory worker the shelter proved iowroofed crowded and smelly molotov looked around scornfully was this the best the british could protect their essential personnel corresponding quarters in moscow were farther underground surely better armored and much more spacious clerks and officials gave the diplomats as much room as they could which was not a great deal churchill said shall we continue gentlemen molotov wondered if he had lost his mind resume in front of all these people then he reflected that what happened here was not likely to be reported back to the lizards unlike the powers negotiating today the invaders had no longestablished spy network to pick up their rivals every word but then he realized that might not matter he said i make no secret which meant stalin had told him to make no secret of the fact that i have met the enemys commanding officer in his ship above the earth as i expected those negotiations proved fruitless the lizards demanding nothing less than the unconditional surrender we all find unacceptable in the course of the meeting however i also learned the german foreign minister had held talks with this atvar creature i desire to know now whether this also holds true for great britain the united states and japan if so i desire to know the status of their conversations with the lizards in short are we in danger of betrayal from within joachim yon ribbentrop spluttered something indignant in german then switched to english the translator murmured into molotovs ear yes i discussed certain matters with the lizards after the fire that fell on berlin this is surely understandable not so i betrayed nothing however and resent the imputation as proof i offer the reichs continuing struggle against the invading forces no imputation was intended molotov said though he remembered worldwar in the balance atvar had implied ribbentrop was more pliable than the german painted himself of course it was as likely the lizard lied for his own advantage as that ribbentrop did so more likely still they both lied molotov resumed what of the rest of you cordell hull said i havent done any of this buck rogers stuff by which he means he has not traveled into space the interpreter glossed no one from the government of the united states has we have held lowerlevel talks with the lizards on our soil regarding such matters as transportation of food and other noncombat supplies to areas they control and we are also attempting to arrange exchanges of prisoners of war soft molotov thought the handful of prisoners the soviets had taken from the invaders were interrogated until no longer useful and then disposed of just as if they were germans or kulaks with important information as for supplying food to lizardheld areas moscow had enough trouble feeding the people it still ruled those the lizards had overrun made useful partisans and spies but that was all shigenori togo spoke in german molotov remembered he had a german wife the soviet foreign ministers englishspeaking interpreter also knew german he translated for molotov he says there is no excuse for treating with this enemy ribbentrop scowled at the japanese representative ignoring the glare togo switched to his own language and went on for some time molotovs other translator took over the emperor hirohitos government has consistently refused to deal with the lizards except on the battlefield we see no reason to discontinue this policy we shall continue to fight until events prove favorable for us we understand this fight will be difficult that is why i am here today but japan will fight on regardless of the course ather nation may take the same holds true for britain churchill declared we may talk with the foe consistent with the usages of war but we shall not surrender to him resistance is our sacred duty to our children you say this now ribbentrop said but what will you say when the lizards strike london or washington or tokyo or moscow with the same dreadful weapon that destroyed berlin silence reigned for the next several seconds it was a better question than molotov had expected from the plump prosperous foolish ribbentrop he did notice the nazi foreign minister had put the soviet capital last on his list annoyed by that he said comrade stalin has pledged a fight to the finish and the soviet workers and people shall hold to the pledge come what may in any case if i may use a bourgeois analogy having continued to resist despite wholesale murder at the hands of germany we shall not quail at the prospect of retail murder from the lizards ribbentrops protuberant blue eyes glared balefully shigenori togo harry turtledove whose nation had been at war with neither the soviet union nor germany when the lizards came was in the best position to address both their representatives such talk as this gentlemen aids no one but the invaders of course we remember our own quarrels but to use them to interfere with the struggle against the lizards is shortsighted he could not have picked a better word to gain molotovs attention the ineluctable nature of the historical dialectic made marxistleninists longterm planners almost by instinct the fiveyear plans that had made the soviet union an industrial match for germany were a case in point molotov said i merely used the analogy to demonstrate that we shall not be intimidated by brute force in fact the soviet union and germany are even now cooperating in areas where our two states can effectively bring combined resources to bear against the common enemy he stopped there another word would have been too much ribbentrop nodded we will do what we must do to secure final victory glee danced behind molotovs unchanging visage he would have bet a prewar crimean dacha against a trip to the gulag that ribbentrop had no idea what sort of cooperation hed meant he knew perfectly well that he would never have told the pompous ass anything important instead of bemoaning the dreadful weapons the lizards have one of the things we should be doing is discovering how to make them for ourselves cordell hull said i am authorized by president roosevelt to tell you all that the united states has such a program in progress and that we will share resources with our allies in the struggle the united states and britain are already operating under such an arrangement churchill said adding with a touch of smugness nor is the sharing to which secretary hull referred by any means a oneway street now molotovs stony facade trapped amazement had he been as indiscreet as hull hed have earned and deserved a bullet in the back of the head yet the american secretary of state spoke at his presidents orders astonishing molotov more easily understood the lizards than the united states combining the technical expertise implicit in hulls words with such unbelievable nayvete incredible and dangerous ribbentrop said we are prepared to cooperate with any nation against the lizards as are we togo said everyone looked at molotov seeing silence would not serve here he said i have already stated that the soviet union is currently working with germany on projects of benefit to both nations we have no objection in principle to pursuing similar collaborative efforts with other states actively resisting the lizards he glanced round the tight circle of diplomats ribbentrop actually smiled at him churchill hull and togo remained expressionless save worldwar in the balance that one of churchills eyebrows rose a little unlike the nazi buffoon theyd noticed he hadnt really promised anything a wide gap lay between no objection in principle and genuine cooperation well too bad if they wanted to keep fighting the lizards they were in no position to call him on it cordell hull said another area of concern for all of us is dealing with nations which have for whatever reasons made devils bargains with the lizards he ran a hand through the strands of gray hair hed combed over the top of a mostly bald skull the americas had a lot of nations like that many of them will have done so only under compulsion and may well remain willing to carry on the fight and to work with us even while nominally under the invaders yoke churchill said that may be true in some cases molotov agreed his own judgment was that churchill kept the cockeyed optimism which hed demonstrated in defying hitler after british forces were booted out of europe in that kind of optimism often led to disaster but sometimes it saved nations bourgeois military experts hadnt given the red army six weeks of life against the wehrmacht but the soviets were still fighting almost a year later when the lizards came to complicate the situation yet again molotov went on partisan movements against both the invaders and the governments collaborating with them should also be organized and armed as expeditiously as possible leaders who favor submission must be removed by whatever means prove necessary he said the last with a hard look at joachim von ribbentrop the german foreign minister was dense but not too dense to miss tha essage the fuhrer still feels a personal fondness for mussolini hel sounding more than a little embarrassed no accounting for taste churchill rumbled still minister molotov is correct we are past the stage where personal likes and dislikes ought to influence policy the sooner mussolini is dead and buried the better for all of us some german forces remain in italy they might well be the ones to give him the boot or rather take him from it for good the interpreter stumbled over the idioms in the last sentence but molotov got the gist he added having the pope join mussolini in the grave would also be a progressive development since the lizards do not interfere with his bleating preachments he fawns on them like a cur but would a successor prove any better shigenori togo asked along with this we must also ask ourselves whether making the pope into a martyr would in the long run prove harmful by generating hatred for our cause among catholics all over the world this may perhaps need to be considered molotov admitted at last his own instinct was to strike at organized religion wherever and however he could but the japanese foreign minister had a point the political re harry turtledove percussions might be severe the pope had no divisions but many more followed him than had backed leon trotsky now dead with an ice ax in his brain not one to yield ground lightly molotov added perhaps the pope could be eliminated in a way which makes the lizards appear responsible cordell hull screwed up his face this talk of assassination is repugnant to me soft molotov thought again the united states large rich powerful and shielded by broad oceans east and west had long enjoyed the historical luxury of softness not even two world wars had made americans feel in their guts how dangerous a place the world was but if they could not awake to reality with the lizards in their own back yard they would never have another chance in war one does what one must churchill said as if gently reproving the secretary of state the british prime minister could see past his button of a nose the allclear sirens began to wail molotov listened to the long sigh of relief that came from the foreign office workers all around theyd got through to the far side of another raid none of them thought that only meant theyd have the dubious privilege of facing another soon the office staff formed a neat queue to leave the shelter and get back to work molotov had seen endless queues in the soviet union but this one seemed somehow different he needed a few seconds to put his finger on why soviet citizens queued up with a mixture of anger and resignation because they had no other way to get what they needed and because they suspected even queuing up often did no good the english were more polite about it as if theyd silently decided it was the one proper thing to do their revolution is coming too molotov thought to sweep away such bourgeois affectations meanwhile affected bourgeois though they were they seemed likely to stay in the fight against the lizards so did the other three powers though molotov still had his doubts about germany any nation that let a nonentity like ribbentrop become foreign minister had something inherently wrong with it but the chief capitalist states were not giving up yet even if italy had stabbed them in the back that was what hed needed to learn and that was the word he would take back to stalin sam yeager shepherded two lizards down the corridor of the zoology building of the hull biological laboratories he still carried his rifle and wore a tin hat but that was more because hed grown used to them than because he thought hed need them the lizards made docile prisoners more docile than hed have been if theyd caught him he thought he stopped in front of room a the lizards stopped too in here samyeager one of them asked in hissing english all the lizard pows worldwar in the balance pronounced his own name as if it were one word what their mouths did to sam finkelstein was purely a caution yeager got the idea his command of their tongue was as villainous as their english he was doing his best with it though and answered yes in here ullhass ristin brave males he opened the door with the frostedglass window gestured with the barrel of the rifle for them to precede him in the outer office a girl was clattering away on a noisy old underwood she stopped when the door opened her smile of greeting froze when she saw the two lizards its all right rnam yeager said quickly theyre here to see dr burkett you must be new or else youd know about them yes its my first day on the job answered the girl actually yeager saw with a second look she was probably in her late twenties maybe even early thirties his eyes flicked automatically to the third finger of her left hand it had a ring too bad dr burkett came out of his sanctum he greeted ullhass and ristin in their own language he was more fluent than yeager though he hadnt been learning for nearly as long thats why hes a fancypants professor and im a bushleague outfielder yeager thought without much resentment besides the lizards liked him better than they did burkett they said so every time they went back to their own quarters now though burkett waved them into his office shut the door behind them isnt that dangerous the girl asked nervously shouldnt be yeager answered the lizards arent troublemakers besides burketts window is barred so they cant get away and besides oll ore time he pulled out a chair i sit here until they come out ago in and get em if they dont come out inside of a couple of hours he reached into his shirt pocket drew out a pack of chesterfields not his brand but you took what you could get these days and a zippo would you like a cigarette uh im sorry im barbara larssen yes id love one thanks she tapped it against the desk put it in her mouth leaned forward to let him light it her cheeks hollowed as she sucked in smoke she held it then blew a long plume at the ceiling oh thats nice i havent had one in a couple of i days she took another long drag ii yeager introduced himself before he lit his own smoke dont let me i get in your way if youre busy he said just pretend im part of the fur niture ive been typing nonstop since half past seven this morning so i could use a break barbara said smiling again okay yeager said agreeably he leaned back in his chair watched her she was worth watching not a moviestar beauty or anything like that but pretty all the same with a round smiling face green eyes and harry turtledove dark blond hair that was growing out straight though its ends still showed permanent waves to make conversation he said your husband off fighting no that should have been good news but her smile faded anyhow she went on he was working here at the university at the metallurgical laboratory as a matter of fact but he drove to washington a few weeks ago he should have been back long since but she finished the cigarette with three quick savage puffs ground it out in a square glass ashtray that sat by her typewriter i hope hes all right yeager meant it if the fellow needed to travel bad enough to do it with the lizards on the loose he was up to something important for that matter yeager wasnt the sort to wish bad luck on anybody so do i barbara larssen did a game best to hold fear out of her voice but he heard it all the same she pointed to the pack of chesterfields i hope you wont think im just scrounging off you but could i have another one of those sure thanks she nodded to herself as she started to smoke the second cigarette that is good she tapped ash into the ashtray when she saw yeagers eyes follow the motion of her hand she let out a rueful laugh typing is hell on my nails ive already broken one and chipped the polish on three others but after a while i got to the point where i couldnt stand just sitting around cooped up in my apartment any more so i thought id try to do something useful instead makes sense to me yeager got up stubbed out his own smoke he didnt light another for himself he wasnt sure where his next pack was coming from he said i suppose keeping busy helps take your mind off things too it does some but not as much as i hoped it would barbara pointed to the door behind which dr burkett was studying the lizards how did you end up standing guard over those things i was part of the unit that captured them out west of here he answered good for you but how did you get picked to stay with them i mean did you draw the short straw or what yeager chuckled nope matter of fact i broke an old army rule i volunteered you did her eyebrows shot upward why for heavens sake rather sheepishly he explained about his fondness for science fiction her eyebrows moved again this time their inner ends came together in a tight little knot above her nose hed seen that expression before more times than he could easily count you dont care for the stuff he said worldwar in the balance no not really barbara said i was doing graduate work in medieval english literature before jens had to move here from berkeley so its not my cup of tea but then she paused and looked thoughtful still i suppose its done a better job of preparing you for whats happening here than chaucer has for me mmm maybe so sam had been ready with his usual hot defense of what he read for pleasure finding out he didnt need it left him feeling like a portable phonograph that had been wound up and forgotten without a record on its turntable barbara said as for me if i couldnt type id still be stuck in that bronzeville flat bronzeville now yeagers eyebrows went up i dont know a lot about chicago if id ever played here i would the thought was there and gone fast as a lizard jet but i do know thats not the real good part of town nobodys ever bothered me barbara said with the lizards here the differences between whites and negroes look pretty small all of a sudden dont they i suppose so yeager said though he didnt sound convinced even to himself but whatever color they are youll find more than its share of crooks in bronzeville hmm tell you what what time do you get off here whenever dr burkett feels like turning me loose it sounds like she answered i already told you im new on the job why id walk you home if you like hey whats so darn funny laughing still barbara larssen threw back her head and made a noise that might have been a wolfs howl yeagers cheeks turned hot barbara si think my husband might approve of that idea in the abstract but nwalking along the concrete if you know what i mean thats not what i had in mind at all yeager protested not until the words were out of his mouth did he realize he wasnt telling the whole truth the front of his mind had made the offer innocently enough but some deeper part knew he might have kept quiet if he hadnt found her attractive he was embarrassed that shed seen through him faster than he saw through himself no harm in your asking and im sure it was kindly meant she said giving him the benefit of the doubt men only turn really annoying when they cant hear no thank you or dont believe it and i see youre not like that okay he said as noncommittal a noise as he could come up with barbara put out her second cigarette looked at her wristwatch the electric clock on the wall wasnt running and said id better get back to work she bent over the typewriter her fingers flew the keys made machinegun bursts of noise yeager had known a few reporters who could harry turtledove crank more words a minute than barbara was putting out now but not many he leaned back in his chair he couldnt imagine an easier duty unless something went wrong inside dr burketts office or unless burkett needed to ask him something not likely since the scientist seemed convinced he already knew everything himself he had nothing to do but sit around and wait a lot of people would have got bored in a hurry being a veteran of long hours on trains and buses yeager was made of tougher stuff than that he thought about baseball about the science fiction he read to kill time between one town and the next about the lizards about his small taste of combat plenty to last him a lifetime if he got his way which he probably wouldnt and he thought about barbara larssen there she sat in front of him after all she wasnt ignoring him either every so often shed look up from her work and smile some of his thoughts were the pleasant but meaningless ones with which any man will while away the time in the presence of a pretty girl others had a bitter edge to them he wished his former wife had cared about him while he was traveling the way barbara obviously cared about her husband what was his name jens that was it whether he knew it or not jens larssen was one lucky fellow after a while the door to dr burketts office opened out came burkett looking plump and pleased with himself out came ristin and ullhass yeager wasnt so good at figuring out what their expressions meant but they werent in any obvious distress burkett said ill want to see them again same time tomorrow soldier im sorry sir said yeager who was not sorry at all but theyre scheduled to spend all day tomorrow with a doctor uh fermi youll have to try another time i know dr fermi barbara larssen exclaimed jens works with him this is most inconvenient dr burkett said i shall complain to the appropriate military authorities how is one to conduct a proper experimental program when ones subjects are snatched away at inconvenient and arbitrary times what that meant sam thought was that burkett hadnt bothered to check the schedule before he made his list of experiments too bad for him aloud yeager said im sorry sir but since we have a lot more experts than we do lizards we have to spread the lizards around as best we can bah burkett said fermi is just a physicist what can they possibly have to teach him he plainly meant it as a rhetorical question but yeager answered it anyhow dont you think he might be a little interested in how they worldwar in the balance came to earth in the first place sir burkett stared at him maybe hed assumed joining the army precluded a man from having a mind of his own barbara said shall i schedule you for another session with the lizards as soon as theyre available dr burkett yes do that he answered as if she were part of the furniture he stamped back into his private chamber slamming the door behind him barbara larssen and yeager looked at each other he grinned she started to giggle i hope your husband comes home safe barbara he said quietly her laughter stopped as abruptly as if cut by a knife so do i she answered im worried hes been gone longer than he said he would her gaze settled on the two lizards who stood waiting for yeager to tell them what to do next he nodded everyones life would have been simpler without the lizards anybody gives you a bad time because hes not around you let me know he said hed never had a reputation for being a hard case while he was playing ball but he hadnt carried around a bayonettipped rifle then either thanks sam i may do that she said her tone was just cool enough to let him know again that he shouldnt be the one who gave her a bad time he answered with a sober expression that let her know he got the message he turned to the lizards gestured with his gun come on you lugs he stood aside to let them precede him out of the office barbara larssen picked up the telephone on her desk made a face put it down no dial tone yeager guessed everything was erratic these days burketts next gor with the lizards would have to wait a while the plymouths engine made a sudden dreadful racket as if it had just been hit by machinegun fire jens larssen knew a mechanical death rattle when he heard one on the dashboard panel in front of him the battery and temperature lights both glowed red he wasnt overheated and he knew he still had juice what he didnt have any more was a car it rolled forward another couple of hundred yards until he pulled off onto the shoulder to keep from blocking highway for anyone else shit he said as he sat and stared at the dashboard lights if he hadnt had to use garbage for fuel so much of the time if he hadnt had to try to make his way over bombedout roads or sometimes over no roads at all if the damned lizards had never come he wouldnt have been stuck here somewhere in eastern ohio two whole states away from where he was supposed to be he raised his eyes and looked out through the dusty bugsplashed windshield up ahead the buildings of a small town dented the skyline smalltown mechanics had helped keep the car going more than once be harry turtledove fore maybe they could do it again he had his doubts the plymouth had never made a noise like this one before but it was something he had to try he left the key in the ignition when he got out good luck to anybody who tried to drive the car away slamming the driversside door relieved his anger a little he took off his jacket slung it over his shoulder and started up the road toward the town there wasnt much traffic in fact there wasnt any traffic he tramped past a couple of cars that looked as if theyd been sitting on the shoulder a lot longer than his and past a burntout wreck that must have been strafed from the air and then shoved over to the roadside but no cars passed him all he could hear was his own footfalls on asphalt just outside the outskirts of town he came to a signboard welcoae to strasburg home of garver brothers worlds biggest little store below that in smaller letters it said population jens blew air out between his lips to make a snuffling noise here was smalltown usa all right even though the new census was already two years old the mayor or whoever hadnt got around to fixing the numbers yet why bother when they probably hadnt changed by more than a couple of dozen he walked on the first gas station he came to was closed and locked a big fat spider was sitting in a web spun between two of the gas pumps so it had likely been closed for a while that didnt look encouraging the drugstore half a block farther on had its door open he decided to go in and see what they had at their soda fountain at the moment he wouldnt have turned down anything cold and wet or even warm and wet he still had some money in his pocket colonel groves had been generous down in white sulphur springs being treated as a national resource was something hed have no trouble getting used to gloom filled the inside of the drugstore the electricity was out anybody in here larssen called peering down the aisles back here a woman answered but that wasnt the only answer he got from much closer came startled hisses two lizards walked around a display of wildroot creme oil that was taller than they were one carried a gun the other had his arms full of flashlights and batteries larssens first impulse was to turn around and run like hell he hadnt known hed blundered into enemyheld territory he felt as if he were carrying a sign that said dangerous human nuclear physicist in letters three feet high fortunately he didnt give in to the impulse as he realized after a moment to the lizards he was just another person for all they knew he might have lived in strasburg the lizards skittered out of the drugstore with their loot they didnt pay for it jens exclaimed it was on reflection the stupidest thing hed ever said in his life worldwar in the balance the woman back near the pharmacy had too much sense even to notice idiocy they didnt shoot me either so i guess its square she said now what can i do for you confronted by such unshakable matteroffactness larssen responded in kind my car broke down outside of town im looking for somebody to fix it and if you have a cocacola or something like that ill buy it from you i have pepsicola the woman said five dollars that was robbery worse than back at white sulphur springs but larssen paid without a whimper the pepsicola unrefrigerated and fizzy went down like nectar of the gods it tried to come up again too jens wondered if you could explode from containing carbonation when his eyes stopped watering he said now about my car charlie tompkins runs a garage up on north wooster just past garver brothers the woman pointed to show him where north wooster was if anybody can help you hes probably the one thank you for shopping at walgreens sir he wondered if shed have said that to the lizards had he not come in and interrupted her very likely he thought nothing seemed to faze her when he handed her the empty soda bottle she rang up no sl on the cash register reached in and took out a penny which she handed to him your deposit sir bemused he pocketed the coin deposits hadnt gone up with prices of course not he thought shopkeepers have to pay out deposits strasburg wasnt big enough to get lost in he found north wooster without difficulty an enormous sign proclaimed the presence of the garver brothers store the signboard outside of town unlike a lot of stown signboards hadnt exaggerated the store sprawled over a coupleof acres the parking lot off to one side had room for hundreds of cars at the moment it held none that did not mean it was empty trucks ignored the white lines painted on concrete they were not trucks of a sort jens had seen before they were bigger somehow smoother of outline quieter when one of them rolled away it didnt rattle or rumble or roar no smoke belched from its exhaust the lizards were plundering garver brothers a couple of them stood in front of the store guns at the ready in case the small crowd of people across the street got boisterous in the face of that firepower and of everything the lizards had behind it nobody seemed inclined toward boisterousness jens joined the crowd two or three people gave him sidelong looks he was a stranger with a capital s hed grown up in a small town before he went off to college he knew he could live here for twenty years and still be thought a stranger though perhaps by then a lowercase one harry turtledove damn shame somebody said somebody else nodded larssen didnt as someone from out of town his opinion was automatically less than worthless he just stood and watched the lizards knew the kinds of goods they wanted they came out of garver brothers with coils of copper wire slung over their scaly shoulders with hand tools of all sorts with an electric generator trundled along on a wheeled cart with a lathe on another cart jens tried to find a pattern to their depredations at first he saw none then he realized most of what the lizards were taking was tools that would help them make things of their own rather than already finished products of earthly manufacture he scratched his head not quite knowing what to make of that it might have been a sign the invaders were settling in for a long stay on the other hand it might also have meant their own resources were short and they were having to eke them out with whatever they could steal if that was so it was encouraging theyre just a bunch of damn chicken thieves thats what they are someone in the crowd said as another truck rolled away most of the rest of the people murmured agreement this time larssen did let himself nod whatever their reasons for cleaning out garver brothers the lizards were doing a good workmanlike job of it a vehicle came up wooster street toward the store it was about as far removed as possible from the smooth silent trucks the lizards ran it was a horsedrawn buggy driven by a bearded man with a broadbrimmed black hat he pulled into the parking lot as casually as if it had been filled with fords and de sotos put a feed bag on his horses nose and strode toward the guarded front door the amish have been coming to garver brothers for years someone observed i wish i had me a buggy like that somebody else said a horsell run on grass but my car sure as hell wont the lizards with guns blocked the amish farmers path into the store he spoke to them since he didnt raise his voice and his back was turned larssen couldnt make out what he said he braced himself for trouble all the same another lizard came bounding up to the doorway maybe he spoke english because the farmer started talking to him instead of to the guards and then to jens surprise the aliens stood aside and let him go in he emerged a few minutes later with a shovel a pickax and a bolt of black cloth nodding politely to the lizards as he passed them he returned to his wagon climbed in and rolled away he didnt want anything the lizards needed so they let him have his stuff jens thought that was smart of them as for the farmer he might not have seen them as being that different from anyone else who failed to worldwar in the balance share his own rigorous faith the idea of living in a simple orderly world with laws held small appeal for larssen as a physicist he strict no thought well of order and law and predictability but the tools he used to seek them were necessarily more complex than pick shovel and horse and buggy that reminded him why hed come this way in the first place does anybody know if charlie tompkins garage is open he asked not right now it isnt said the fellow whod called the lizards chicken thieves on account of im charlie tompkins what can i do for you stranger my car broke down about a mile outside of town larssen answered any chance you can take a look at it the mechanic laughed dont see why not im not what youd call real busy these days i expect you can tell that by lookin whats your machine doin anyhow when jens described the symptoms tompkins looked grave that doesnt sound so good well well go see come on up to my shop so as i can get some tools as the woman at the drugstore had said the garage lay just a little past the garver brothers store tompkins picked up his tool kit it didnt look light so larssen said ill carry it for you if you like weve got a ways to walk dont worry about it here come on with me the mechanic led larssen owe to a bicycle which had a bracket welded to the head tube the handle of the tool kit fit neatly over the bracket tompkins climbed onto the saddle gestured to larssen you ride behind me i dont use any gas this way a bikes got fewer parts than a car and theyre easier for soebody like me to fix if they do break that made perfect sense but jens hadnt ridden on one of those littllat racks since about the third grade will it carry both of us he asked tompkins laughed ive put bigger men than you back there my friend sure youre tall but youre built like a pencil we wont have any trouble i promise they didnt have much what there was came because larssen hadnt been on any bicycle at all for a good many years and needed a little while before his body remembered how to balance charlie tompkins compensated for his lurches without saying a word in a way that only made them more embarrassing werent you never supposed to forget how to stay on a bicycle jens sighed as he did his best not to maim himself while exploding the cliche whereabouts you from mister tompkins asked as they rolled past the sign welcoming people to strasburg chicago larssen answered the mechanic twisted his head that struck larssen as foolhardy but harry turtledove he kept his mouth shut after a moment tompkins turned back to watch where he was going he spoke over his shoulder and you were heading back there were you from wherever you were coming from thats right what about it nothing really tompkins pedaled along for a few more seconds then went on in a sad tone thing is though you might not want to say that to just anybody around here who asks chicagos still free right sure it is im not asking whether you would or you wouldnt mind but i can see where you might not want the lizards to get wind of whatever reasons youve got for going that way how would the lizards larssens voice trailed away you dont mean people would tell them he knew the lizards had human collaborators the warsaw jews chinese italians brazilians up till this second though hed never imagined there could be such a thing as an american collaborator he supposed that was naive of him evidently it was tompkins said some people theyll do anything to get in good with the boss no matter who the boss is some other people have gotten hurt on account of it he didnt seem to care for the subject either instead of giving details he took one hand off the handlebars and pointed that your car up ahead there that plymouth yes thats it okay lets see what weve got tompkins stopped the bike with the soles of his shoes against the asphalt he and jens both got off the mechanic unhooked the tool box walked over to the deceased automobile reached through the grill and popped the hood latch once the long piece of sheet metal was up and out of the way he bent over and peered into the engine compartment a low mournful whistle floated up mister i hate to tell you but you got yourself a cracked block another whistle not much later your valves are shot to shit too pardon my french what the hell you been burnin in this machine anyhow whatever i could get my hands on that would burn larssen answered honestly well i know how that goes what with the way things are but jesus even if times were good i couldnt fix this poor bastard by my lonesome what with the way things are i dont think i can fix her at all hate to have to tell you that but im not gonna lie to you either how am i supposed to get back to chicago then larssen wasnt really asking tompkins it was more a cry to the unhearing gods when hed come east through ohio the lizards hadnt been anywhere near this far north when hed come east through ohio his car had been in reasonably good shape too wouldnt take you forever to walk there tompkins said what is it maybe three four hundred miles could be done worldwar in the balance jens stared at the mechanic in dismay at least two weeks on shanks mare more likely a month dodging in and out of the lizards territory dodging bandits too likely enough one more thing hed never expected in america at least outside the vanished wild west winter was on the way too already the sky had lost the perfect transparent blue of summer barbara would think he was dead by the time he got back if he got back his eye fell on tompkins bicycle he pointed tell you what ill trade you my set of wheels for yours you can use the parts that are still good to keep other cars running before the lizards came swapping a twoyearold plymouth for an elderly bicycle would have been insane be fore the lizards came of course his car could have been fixed if it broke down before the lizards came his car wouldnt have broken down be cause he wouldnt have had to abuse it so now now charlie tompkins looked from the bike to the plymouth slowly shook his head whats the point to that mister you take off for chicago you gonna carry your car on your back ill get to scavenge it whether i give you my bike or not why you larssen wanted to murder the mechanic the force of the feeling frightened him left him almost sick he wondered how many killings had sprung from the chaos the lizards spread across the united states across the world times grew ever more desperate the risk of get ting caught shrank so why not kill if you needed to to fight the temptation he jammed his hands deep into his trouser pockets amidst keys and small change the fingers of his right hand closed round his cigarette lighter the zippo unlike the plymouth would work forever or at least as long as he could keep coming up with flints it we also burn moonshine a lot better than the car had e yanked out the case flipped open top buffed steel the his thumb went to the lighters wheel you dont trade me your bike charlie ill burn the goddamn car lets see how you like that the mechanic started to grab for a wrench from his tool kit larssens mouth went dry maybe he hadnt been the only one thinking of murder then tompkins hand stopped suddenly his highpitched laugh sounded unnatural but it was a laugh godawful times he said to which jens could only nod all right larssen take the bike i expect ill be able to come up with another one from somewheres larssen relaxed but not very far his zippo might torch the plymouth but it didnt stack up very well against a monkey wrench he walked over to the rear end of the car opened the trunk he took out the smaller of the two suitcases there and a ball of twine slammed the trunk shut he did the best job he could of tying the suitcase to the rack on which hed ridden then pulled the trunk key off the ring and tossed it to charlie tompkins he swung his right leg over the bicycle saddle as if he were mounting harry turtledove a horse if hed wobbled as a passenger he was even more unsteady up there by himself but he managed to stay upright and keep the bike rolling forward after a couple of hundred yards he took a chance and looked back over his shoulder tompkins was already going through the suitcase hed had to leave behind he scowled and kept pedaling the u buzzed through the night so low that an instants inattention or simply a hillock shed forgotten would have cost ludmila gorbunova her life the kukuruznik was proving the soviet unions ace in the hole in the war against the lizards newer red air force planes with greater speed and better guns but also with more metal in their airframes and higher minimum ceilings had all but vanished from the skies the obsolescent little biplane trainer too small too slow and too low to be noticed soldiered on the slipstream blew chilly over ludmilas goggled face fall was in the air the rains would start any day now her lips curled upwards in a mirthless smile the rasputitsa the time of mud had hurt the fascists badly last year she wondered how the lizards armored vehicles would enjoy trying to push forward through slimy porridge she also wondered just for a moment what her superiors had done with the two germans shed delivered to them from the ukrainian collective farm having deadly foes suddenly turn into allies was disconcerting as was the realization the nazis were human beings like her own side better when theyd seemed only small fieldgray shapes scurrying like lice before the bullets from her machine guns she glanced down at the map book balanced on her knees the lights from her instrument panel let her trace her assigned flight path she flew over a river a quick peek at her watch told her how long shed been in the air yes it ought to be the slovechna which meant she needed to swing farther south now her breath came short and fast when she spotted lights on the horizon ahead some of the lizards still kept the stupid habit of lighting up their campsites at night maybe they thought it made them safer from ground attack given the range and power of their weapons maybe it even did ludmila was no marshal of the soviet union to know everything there was to know about ground tactics she did know being able to see what she was shooting at made her own job easier she couldnt gain altitude and then glide silently to the attack as she had against the nazis aircraft that attacked the lizards from anything much above ground height came down in pieces a lesson learned from bitter experience stay low and you had a chance it wasnt always a good chance her air regiment was chewed to bits she knew of only three or four other pilots from it still flying the regiment was long since broken up of course large concentrations of aircraft worldwar in the balance on the ground drew the lizards wrath like nothing else these days the kukuruzniks flew by ones and twos not in formation the lighted area swelled ahead of her her finger went to the firing button for the machine guns she spied what looked at first like bumpy ground but proved as she drew nearer to be some sort of vehicles under camouflage netting trucks she thought lizard tanks being almost impervious to human weapons were seldom concealed so carefully she started her firing run the machine guns hammered under her wings the little u shook like a leaf in an autumn wind the flying sparks of tracer bullets helped guide her aim almost in the same instant the lizards began shooting back they owned more firepower than the germans had been able to bring to bear by the muzzle flashes on the ground ludmila thought ten thousand automatic weapons had opened up on her all at once the fabric skin of the kukuruzniks wings made cheerful popping noises as bullets pierced it then one of the trucks blew up in a bluewhite ball of hydrogen fire so different from the orange flames of blazing petrol the blast of heat seared ludmilas cheeks as she flew past it tried to fling her aircraft tumbling out of control she wrestled with stick and pedals held it steady in the air touched off by the first more trucks exploded behind her she gave the u all the meager power it had banked away toward the friendly darkness a few lizards kept shooting at her but only a few more ran to fight the fires shed touched off as night drew its cloak around her she took one hand off the stick for a moment pounded fist against thigh shed hurt them this time n ow to find her way home even without flying a combat mission n i ating at night was anything but easy she straightened onto compass course that would bring her somewhere close to the airstrip from which shed been operating she checked her watch and her airspeed indicator the other vital tools of night flying after about hmm fifty minutes shed begin to circle and look for landing lights just surviving a mission was enough to make her proud and to make her remember all her friends who would never fly again that thought quickly leached joy from her leaving behind only weariness and the jittery residue of terror either she was a better navigator than shed thought or much luckier than usual for she spotted the dim landing lanterns after only a couple of circles they were hooded so as not to be visible from high overhead the red air force had learned the dangers of that from the luftwaffe the lesson was all the more vital against the lizards her approach in the dark was tentative the makeshift airstrip anything but smooth the landing she made would have earned only scorn from her osoaviakhim instructor she wondered if the man was still harry turtledove alive she didnt care she was down and among her own people and safe until her next mission she didnt even have to think about that not yet as soon as she got out of the u groundcrew started dragging it to cover a woman mechanic pointed to the bullet holes ludmila shrugged patch them as you get the chance comrade im all right and so is the aircraft good the mechanic said oh you have a letter down in the bunker a letter the soviet post erratic since the start of the war had grown frankly chaotic once the lizards added their ravages to those of the nazis eagerly ludmila asked from whom i dont know its in an envelope and it doesnt say on the outside the mechanic answered an envelope really the very occasional letters ludmila had had from her brothers and her father and mother were all written on folded single sheets of paper with her name and unit scrawled on the reverse shed had only one note since the lizards came three hasty lines from her younger brother igor letting her know he was alive she trotted for the shelter bunker saying ill have to see whos gotten rich curtains and doglegs in the entry passage kept candlelight from leaking out yevdokia kasherina looked up from the tunic she was darning how did it go she asked with a fellow pilots concern it was a long way from the formal debriefings of earlier missions but the soviet air force was too dispersed and battered to have much room for formalities these days well enough ludmila said i shot up some trucks that werent hidden well enough and i got back here alive now whats this i hear about a letter its over there on your blankets yevdokia said pointing you dont think anyone would dare do anything with it do you better not ludmila said fiercely both women laughed ludmila hurried over to where she slept the clean white envelope gleamed against the dark blue wool of the blankets she snatched it up carried it over to a candle shed expected to recognize the script on the envelope at a glance and thus know who had written to her before she started the letter itself hearing from any of her family would be so good but to her surprise and disappointment the handwriting was unfamiliar to her indeed handwriting was too good a word for it her name and unit were printed in large copybook letters of the sort a bright eightyearold might make whos it from yevdokia asked i dont know yet ludmila said the other pilot laughed a secret admirer ludmila vadimovna hush ludmila tore open the envelope pulled out the piece of paper worldwar in the balance inside the words on that were also printed rather than written for a moment they seemed utterly meaningless to her then she realized she had to switch languages and even alphabets the letter was in german her first reaction was fright before the lizards came a letter in german would have been delivered by a harshfaced nkvd man certain she was guilty of treason but censors must have seen this note and decided to let it go through reading it probably would not endanger her to the brave flier who plucked me from the kolkhoz it began flier had a feminine ending tacked on and kolkhoz was spelled out in those copybook cyrillic letters i hope you are well and safe and hitting back against the lizards i write this as simply as i can as i know your german is slow though much better than my russian i am now in moscow where i work with your government to hurt the lizards in new ways these will a few words were neatly clipped out of the letter a censor had been at it then some of ludmilas fear returned somewhere in moscow her name appeared in a dossier for getting mail from a german as long as germany and the soviet union kept on working together against the lizards that dossier would not matter if they had a falling out ludmila read on i hope one day we may see each other again this may be so because the censor had excised another section the letter finished your country and mine have been enemies allies enemies and now allies again life is strange not so i hope we shah not be enemies ourselves you and i the signature was a scrawl that looked to her eyes nothing like heinrich jager but that was surely what it said underneath in the clear printing that marked the rest of the note he had appended major th panzer as if she were unlikely to remember him without being rded he stared at the piece of paper for a long time trying to sort out her own feelings he was polite he was wellspoken he was not the ugliest man she had ever seen he was a nazi if she answered his letter another note would go down in the dossier she was as certain of that as of tomorrows sunrise well yevgenia said when she did not comment you were right yevgenia gavrilovna it is from a secret admirer the other pilot made a rude noise the devils nephew no doubt how did you guess a shell screamed down and landed in the middle of the grove of larches south of shabbona illinois mutt daniels threw himself flat splinters of wood and more deadly splinters of metal whined past overhead i am getting too old for this shit daniels muttered to no one in particular a flock of blackcrowned night herons quawks the locals called them after the noise they made leapt into the air in panic they were handsome birds two feet tall or more with long yellow legs black or sometimes dark green heads and backs and pearlgray wings quawking for all they were worth they flew south as fast as they could go mutt listened to their receding cries but hardly looked up to watch them go he was too busy deepening the foxhole hed already started in the muddy ground under the larches in the generation that had passed since hed got back from france hed forgotten how fast you could dig while you were lying on your belly another shell burst this one just east of the grove the few quawks that hadnt taken fright at the first explosion did at this one from a hole a few feet away from daniels sergeant schneider said they likely wont be back this year huh the herons schneider explained they usually head south for the winter earlier in the year than this anyhow they come in in april and fly out when fall starts just like ballplayers daniels said he flipped up more dirt with his entrenching tool i got a bad feeling this grove aint gonna be the same when they come north after spring training next year us and the lizards were kind of rearranging the landscape you might say he didnt find out whether sergeant schneider would say that or not a whole salvo of shells crashed down around them both men huddled in their holes heads down so they tasted mud then from east of the larches american artillery opened up pounding back at the lizard positions along the line of highway as he had in france mutt wished the worldwar in the balance big guns on both sides would shoot at one another and leave the poor damned infantry alone tanks rumbled past the grove under cover of the american barrage trying to push back the lizard vanguard still moving on chicago daniels raised his head for a moment some of the tanks were lees with a small turret and a heavy gun mounted in a sponson on the front corner of the hull more though were the new shermans with their big main armament up in the turret they looked like the lizard tanks from which daniels had been retreating since the lizards came down from beyond the sky the closer they get to chicago the more stuff were throwin at em he called to schneider yeah and a fat lot of good its doing us too the other veteran answered if they werent spread thin trying to conquer the whole world at once wed be dead meat by now or maybe they dont really care whether they get into chicago or not and thats why theyve moved slower than they might have what do you mean maybe they dont care why wouldnt they mutt asked when he thought about strategy he thought about the hitandrun play when to bunt and the right time for a pitchout since he got home after the armistice hed done his best to forget the military meaning of the word schneider though was a career soldier though only a noncom he had a feel for the way armies functioned he said what good is chicago to us its hub right the place where all the roads and all transportation the railroads and all the lake and river traffic come together just by being this close and by their air power the lizards have smashed that network to smithereens ce aniels pointed to the advancing american tanks whered those from then they mustve got into chicago some kind of way or they wouldnt be here probably by ship sergeant schneider said things ive heard they dont quite understand what ships are all about and how much you can carry on one that probably says something about wherever they come from wouldnt you think damned if i know mutt looked at sergeant schneider with some surprise he might have expected that remark from sam yeager whod enjoyed reading about bugeyed monsters before people knew there were any such things the sergeant though seemed to have a onetrack military mind what was he doing wondering about other planets or whatever you called them as if to answer the question mutt hadnt asked schneider said the more we know about the lizards the better we can fight back right i guess so said daniels who hadnt thought of it in quite those terms harry turtledove and speaking of fighting back we ought to be moving up to give those tanks some support schneider scrambled out of his foxhole shouted and waved one arm so the rest of the troops in the grove would know what he meant and dashed out into the open along with the others daniels followed the sergeant he felt naked and vulnerable away from his hastily dug shelter hed seen more than enough shelling both in and during the past weeks to know a foxhole often gave only the illusion of safety but illusions have their place too without them most likely men would never go to war at all westbound american shells tore through the air their note grew fainter and deeper as they flew away from mutt when he heard a rising scream he threw himself into a ditch several seconds before he consciously reasoned that it had to spring from an incoming lizard round his body was smarter than his head hed seen that in baseball often enough when you had to stop and think about what you were doing you got yourself in trouble the shell burst a few hundred yards ahead of him among the advancing lees and shermans it had an odd sound again daniels didnt stop to think for more rounds followed the first cursing himself and schneider both for breaking cover he tried once more to dig in while flat on his belly the barrage walked toward him he wished he were a mole or a gopher any sort of creature that could burrow far underground and never have to worry about coming up for air his breath sobbed in his ears his heart thudded inside his chest so hard he wondered if it would burst i am too old for this shit he wheezed the lizard barrage ignored him he remembered that the boche artillery hadnt paid any attention when he cursed it either the shells rained down for a while then stopped the one blessing about going through lizard barrages was that they didnt last for days on end the way german pounding sometimes had in maybe the invaders didnt have the tubes or the ammunition dumps to raise that kind of hell or maybe they just didnt need to do it their fire was more accurate and deadly than the boches had ever dreamed of being when daniels ever so cautiously raised his head he saw that the field hed been crossing was churned into a nearly lunar landscape up ahead two or three tanks were burning as he watched smoke and flame burst from under another one a tread thrown it ground itself into the mud howd they do that mutt asked the air no new shell had struck the lee he was sure of that it was almost as if the lizards had a way to pack antitank mines inside their artillery rounds before the invaders came down from mars or wherever he would have laughed at the idea he wasnt laughing now the lizards were nothing to laugh about a couple of feet in front of his new foxhole half hidden in yellowing worldwar in the balance grass lay a shiny blue spheroid a little smaller than a baseball daniels was sure it hadnt been there before the shelling started he reached out to pick it up and see what it was then jerked back his hand as if the thing had snarled at him dont fool around with what you dont know nothin about he told himself as if he were more likely to obey a real spoken order just because that little blue thing didnt look like a mine didnt mean it wasnt one he was certain the lizards hadnt shot it at him out of the goodness of their hearts assuming they had any let a sapper screw around with it thats his job mutt gave the spheroid a wide berth as he started moving forward again he didnt go as fast as he wanted to he kept looking down to see if any more of them had been scattered about a flat bang and a shriek off to his right told him his caution wasnt wasted ahead and to his left sergeant schneider trotted westward steady as a machine daniels started to call out a warning to him then noticed that even though the sergeant was making better time than he not surprising since schneider was both taller and trimmer he was also carefully noting where he planted his feet soldiers in wartime didnt necessarily live to grow old but schneider was not about to die from doing something stupid farther up ahead another tank rolled over a mine this one a sherman started to burn the fiveman crew bailed out seconds before the tanks ammunition began cooking off the rest of the american armor fearful of meeting a like fate slowed almost to a crawl come on sergeant schneider shouted perhaps to the suddenly lagg vanks perhaps to the infantrymen whose advance had also slowed e got to keep moving if we bog down in the open theyll slaughter lis that held enough truth to keep mutt slogging forward after the sergeant but he soon began looking for a good place in which to dig in despite schneiders indomitable will the advance was running out of steam even the sergeant recognized that after another couple of hundred yards when he stopped and took out his entrenching tool the rest of the men followed his example trench lines began to spiderweb their way across the field daniels worked for half an hour extending his hole toward the one nearest to him on the right before he realized the lizards had halted the american counterattack without ever once showing themselves that did not strike him as encouraging atvar studied the situation map of the northern part of tosev s secondary continental map this does not strike me as encouraging he said i find it intolerable that the big uglies continue to thwart us in this harry turtledove way we must do a more effective job of destroying their industrial base i have repeatedly spoken of this concern yet nothing seems to be accomplished why exalted fleetlord the situation is not as black as you make it kirel said soothingly true not all the enemys factories are wrecked as completely as we might like but we have damaged his road and rail networks to the point where both raw materials and finished goods move with difficulty if at all atvar refused to be mollified we ourselves are moving with difficulty if at all he said with heavy sarcasm as he stabbed a finger toward the representation of a lakeside city this place should have fallen some time ago kirel leaned forward to read the name of the town chicago possibly so exalted fleetlord yet again we have rendered it essentially useless to the big uglies as a transport center the deteriorating weather has not helped our cause either and in spite of all obstacles we do continue to advance on it at a hatchlings crawl atvar sneered it should have fallen i tell you before the weather became a factor in any way possibly so exalted fleetlord kirel repeated yet the big uglies have defended it with unusual stubbornness and now the weather is a factor if i may he touched a button below the video screen in front of atvar the fleetlord watched as rain poured down from a soggy sky turning the ground to thick brown porridge the big uglies evidently used to such deluges were taking full advantage of this one theyd destroyed a good many roads leading toward chicago themselves forcing the vehicles of the race off into the muck the vehicles didnt like muck very well the mechanics who tried to keep them running in it liked it even less the same thing is happening in the sssr and against the nipponese in what do they call it in manchukuo thats right atvar said its even worse in those places than in the united states because they dont need to wreck their roads to make us go into the mud as soon as it rains for more than two days straight the roads themselves turn into mud why didnt they pave them to begin with the fleetlord knew kirel could not possibly answer a question like that even if he could have answered it responsibility still rested with atvar the races landcruisers and troopcarriers of course were tracked they managed after a fashion even churning through sticky mud most supply vehicles though merely had wheels back before atvar went into cold sleep that had seemed sufficient even extravagant against spearcarrying warriors riding on animals it would have been if this cursed planet were anything like what the stinking probes claimed it to be we would have conquered it long since he growled without a doubt exalted fleetlord kirel said should you care to worldwar in the balance use it we still have one major advantage of the big uglies a nuclear weapon exploded above chicago would end its resistance once and for all i have considered this atvar said that he had considered it was the measure of his frustration but he went on i am also obligated however to consider our occupation of tosev as well as our conquest of it chicago is a natural center of commerce for the region and will be again when peace returns under our administration creating another such nexus after destroying this one would prove troublesome and expensive for those who come after us let it be as you say then exalted fleetlord kirel replied he knew when to set a topic aside in any event he had plenty of other titbits with which to worry atvar i have a report that the deutsche launched two mediumrange missiles against our forces in france last night one was intercepted in flight the other impacted and exploded fortunately without damage worse than a large hole in the ground their guidance systems leave much to be desired what i would most desire is that they had no guidance systems the fleetlord said heavily may i at least hope we destroyed the launchers from which these missiles came kirels hesitation told him he could not so hope the shiplord said exalted fleetlord we scrambled killercraft and vectored them over the area from which the missiles were discharged it is heavily forested terrain and they failed to discover the launchers officers speculate the deutsche used either launchers concealed in caves portable launchers or both more information will become available upon subsequent firings more damage will become available too unless we are more careful than we have been atvar said we have the capability to knock these s out of the sky i expect us to live up to that capability it shall be done kirel said atvar relaxed a little when kirel said something would be done he meant it what other news of interest have you for me shiplord some intriguing data have come in from the study we began when we learned the tosevites were sexually active at all seasons of the year kirel replied tell me atvar said anything that will help me understand the big uglies behavior is an asset as you say exalted fleetlord you may recall that we took a fair number of tosevites of each gender and had them mate with one another to confirm they did indeed lack a breeding season this they have done as you know even more interesting however is that several moreorlesspermanently mated malefemale pairs have emerged from the randomly chosen individuals not all subjects in the experimental study have formed such pairs we are currently investigating the factors which cause some to do so and others to abstain harry turtledove that is interesting the fleetlord admitted i remain not entirely sure of its relevance to the campaign as a whole however some may well exist kirel said we have had instances all over the planet of tosevites some military personnel but others nominally civilians attacking males and installations of the race without regard for their own lives or safety in those cases where the assailants survived for interrogation a reason frequently cited for their actions was the death of a mate at our hands this malefemale bonding appears to be part of the glue which holds together tosevite society interesting atvar said again he felt faintly disgusted when he smelled the pheromones of females in estrus all he thought about was mating at other seasons of the year or indefinitely if no females were around not only was he not interested he was smug about not being interested among the race the two words arousal and foolishness sprang from a common root trust the big uglies to build their societies based on a facet of foolishness he thought he asked can we exploit this tosevite aberration so it works to our advantage rather than against us our experts are working toward this goal kirel said they will test strategies both among our shipboard experimental specimens and more cautiously with select members of the populations of big uglies under our control why more cautiously atvar asked then he answered his own question oh i see if the experiments down on tosev produce undesirable results that might lead to situations where big uglies will seek to harm members of the race in the manner you previously described exactly so exalted fleetlord kirel answered we have learned from painful experience that suicidal attacks are most difficult to guard against we can much more easily protect ourselves against dangers from rational beings than from fanatics who are willing sometimes even eager to die with us not even the threat of largescale retaliation against the captive populace has proven a reliable deterrent half of atvar heartily wished hed been passed over for this command hed be living in peaceful luxury back on home but he had a duty to the race and knew somber pride at having been chosen the male best suited to the task of fostering the empires growth he said i hope our experts will soon be able to suggest ways in which we can use the big uglies perpetual randiness against them and speaking of using things tosevite against the tosevites how fare we in turning the captured portion of their industrial capacity to our benefit kirel did not let the change of subject fluster him not as well as we would have liked exalted fleetlord he replied earning atvars respect for unflinching honesty part of the problem rests with the tosevite factory workers we must necessarily employ in large numbers many are apathetic and perform poorly while others actively hostile sabotage as worldwar in the balance much of what they produce as possible another issue involved is the general primitiveness of their manufacturing plants by the emperor theyre not too primitive to keep from turning out guns and landcruisers and aircraft to use against us atvar exclaimed why cant we use some of that capacity for ourselves the only way to do so exalted fleetlord is to adapt ourselves resign ourselves might be a better way to put it to arms and munitions at the big uglies current technological level if we do so we forfeit our chief advantage over them and the contest becomes one of numbers wherein the advantage is theirs surely some of these facilities at any rate can be upgraded to our standards atvar said kirel made an emphatic gesture of negation not for years the gap is simply too wide oh there are exceptions a bullet is a bullet we may be able to adapt their factories to produce small arms to our patterns though even that will not be easy as hardly any of their individual infantry weapons are automatic we have had some success reboring captured artillery tubes to fire our ammunition and could perhaps manufacture more tubes to our own specifications i have seen these reports atvar agreed from them i inferred greater progress would also be possible i wish it were so exalted fleetlord kirel said repeating the gesture of negation you will notice the examples i cited were of unsophisticated weapons as soon as electronics of any sort become involved any hope of our using tosevite facilities goes straight out the window but they have electronics some at least atvar said they have boladar and radio for instance our task would be simpler if they di i true enough they have electronics but they have no computers whatever and they know nothing of integrated circuits or even transistors the vacuumfilled glass tubes they use in place of proper circuitry are so large and bulky and fragile and produce so much heat as to make them useless for our purposes can we not introduce what we need into their factories simpler to build our own by what the technical experts tell me kirel answered besides which we run the risk of tosevite workers learning our techniques from us and transmitting them to their unsubdued brethren this is a risk we take with every venture that involves the big uglies atvar made an unhappy noise none of the manuals from home warned about that sort of risk neither the rabotevs nor the hallessi had been far enough along to be in a position to steal the races technology and turn it against its creators therefore the planners drawing on precedent as they always did failed to envision that any race could do so harry turtledove the fleetlord should have thought of the danger for himself but tosev presented so many unexpected difficulties and the race was so little used to dealing with unexpected difficulties that not all of them became obvious at once precedent organization and longterm planning were splendid things within the empire where change when it occurred did so in tiny closely supervised increments over the course of centuries they did not prepare the race to handle tosev we and the big uglies are both metals atvar said to kirel but we are steel and they are quicksilver an excellent comparison exalted fleetlord right down to the poisonous vapors they exude his subordinate answered may i make a suggestion speak you are gracious exalted fleetlord i can understand the reasons for your reluctance to employ nuclear weapons against chicago but the natives of the united states continue to resist if not with the skill of the deutsche then with equal or greater stubbornness and with far greater industrial capacity even if their weapons are generally less sophisticated they need to have the potential price of such resistance brought home to them their capital washington i believe they call it is merely an administrative center with limited commercial or manufacturing significance it is moreover not far from the eastern coast of the continent prevailing winds would blow most nuclear waste products harmlessly out to sea one of atvars eyes swung across the map from chicago to washington the situation was as kirel described still results in the case of berlin were not altogether as we anticipated he said a damning indictment among the race but kirel said it had unexpected benefits as well as shortcomings we gained the allegiance of warsaw and its environs shortly after employing that first device truth atvar admitted it was an important truth too the race too often saw only hazard in the unexpected even if opportunity could also hatch from it not only that kirel continued but it will also create uncertainty and fear on the part of the big uglies who do continue to resist destroying a single imperial capital might be an isolated act on our part but if we destroy a second one that shows them we can repeat the action anywhere on their planet at any time we choose truth atvar said again like any normal male of the race he distrusted uncertainty the idea of using it as a weapon was unsettling to him but when he thought of it as inflicting uncertainty on the foe in the same way that his forces might inflict hunger or death the concept became clearer and more attractive moreover kirel was usually a cautious male if he thought such a step necessary he was likely to be right worldwar in the balance what is your command exalted fleetlord kirel asked let the order be prepared for my review i shall turn both eyes upon it the instant it appears before me barring unforeseen developments i shall approve it exalted fleetlord it shall be done tailstump quivering with excitement kirel hurried away this is radio deutschland not radio berlin moishe russie thought as he moved his head closer to the speaker of the shortwave set not any more nor was the signal though on the same frequency as berlin had always used anywhere near as strong as it had been instead of shouting it was as if the germans were whispering now in hope of not being overheard an important bulletin the news reader went on the government of the reich is grieved to report that washington dc capital of the united states of america appears to have been the victim of a bomb of the type which recently made a martyr of berlin all radio transmissions from washington ceased abruptly and without warning approximately twentyfive minutes ago confused reports from baltimore philadelphia and richmond speak of a pillar of fire mounting into the night sky our fhrer adolf hitler has expressed his condolences for the american people victims like the germans of the insane aggression of these savage alien invaders the fhrers words russie clicked off the set he did not care what adolf hitler had to say he wished with all his heart that hitler had been in berlin when the lizards dropped their bomb on it the regime there had deserved to go up in a pillar of fire ut washington if berlin represented everything dark and bestial in thliuman spirit washington stood for just the opposite freedom justice equality yet the lizards destroyed them both alike yisgadal vyiskadash shmay rabo russie murmured the memorial prayer for the dead so many would be dead across the ocean he remembered the posters the germans had plastered all over warsaw before the city fell to the lizards before the jews and the polish home army rose up and helped the lizards drive the germans out of warsaw no doubt that had been justified without the lizards russie knew he and most if not all his people would have died that reasoning had let him support them after they entered warsaw gratitude was a reasonable emotion especially when as fully deserved as here that the outside world thought him a traitor to mankind hurt deeply but the outside world did not know and refused to see what the nazis had done here better the lizards than the ss so he still believed but now booted feet pounded down the corridor toward his office breaking in on his thoughts the door flew open the moment he saw harry turtledove mordechai anielewiczs face he knew the fighting leader had heard washington they both said in the same breath russie was the first to find more words we cannot go on comfortably working with them after this not unless we want to deserve the hatred the rest of mankind would give us for such a deed reb moishe youre right anielewicz said the first time in a long while hed given russie such unqualified agreement but where russie thought in terms of right and wrong the jewish soldier almost automatically began considering ways and means we cannot simply rise up against them either not unless we want the bloodbath back again heaven forbid russie said then he remembered something he would sooner have forgotten im supposed to go on the radio this afternoon what shall i say god help me what can i say nothing anielewicz answered at once just the sound of your voice would make you the lizards whore he thought for a moment then gave two words of blunt practical advice get sick zolraag wont like that hell think im faking and hell be right but russie had been a medical student even as he spoke his mind searched for ways to make false sickness seem real he thought of some quickly enough the punishment theyd inflict on him would also scourge him for letting the lizards make him into their willing tool a purgative a good strong one he said a purgative and a stiff close of ipecac whats ipecac anielewicz asked russie made ghastly retching noises the fighters eyes went big and round he nodded and grinned that should do the job all right im glad they have you in front of the microphone instead of me ha it wasnt a laugh only one syllable of resignation but russie thought such florid symptoms would convince zolraag something truly was wrong with him the epidemics in the ghetto the endemic diseases from which all humanity suffered seemed to horrify the lizards who gave no signs of being similarly afflicted russie would have liked to study at one of their medical schools no doubt he would have learned more there than any earthly physician could teach him if we want this to work were going to have to do something else you know anielewicz said at russies raised eyebrow he elaborated were going to have to talk with general borkomorowski the poles have to be in on this with us otherwise the lizards will turn them loose on us and stand back and smile while we beat each other to death yes russie said though he both distrusted and feared the commander of the armja krajowa but he had other more immediate concerns even if i manage not to broadcast today ill still have to go back to the studio next week the week after that at the latest if i take to my bed and swallow more ipecac in a few days his stomach lurched unhappily at the prospect worldwar in the balance dont worry past this afternoon anielewiczs eyes were cold and calculating yes i can piece together enough uniforms and i can find enough blond fighters or fellows with light brown hair why do you need fighters with russie stopped and stared youre going to attack the transmitter and you want the nazis to get the blame for it right both times anielewicz said you should have been a soldier i just wish i had some men who werent circumcised humans would know the difference the lizards might not but i hate to take the chance some poles think the only thing the germans did wrong was to leave some of us alive they might rat on us if they get the chance russie sighed unfortunately youre right send one of your fighters out for the ipecac and another for the purgative i dont want to be remembered for getting either one in case the lizards ask questions later he sighed i have the feeling i wont want to remember the next few hours anyway i believe that reb moishe anielewicz eyed him with amusement and no small respect you know i think id rather be wounded in combat at least then it comes as a surprise but to deliberately do something like this to yourself he shook his head better you than me better nobody russie glanced at his watch the former property of a german who no longer needed it but youd better arrange for it quickly the lizards will be coming in less than three hours and i ought to be good and sick by then he started going through the papers on his desk i want to move the ones that truly matter so you can puke all over the rest anielewicz finished for him thats good if you pay attention to the small details in a plan that helps tcig pieces go well he touched one finger to the brim of his gray cloth ill take care of it he was as good as his word by the time the lizard guards came to escort russie to the studio he wished anielewicz had been less efficient the lizards hissed and drew back in dismay from his door he could hardly blame them the office would need an airing out before anyone wanted to work there again a pair of good trousers werent going to be the same any more either one of the lizards ever so cautiously poked his head back into the office he stared at russie who sprawled limp as wet blotting paper over his chair and befouled desk what wrong the lizard asked in halting german must be something i ate russie groaned feebly the small part of him that did not actively wish he were dead noted he was even telling the truth perhaps the most effective way to lie ever invented most of him though felt as if hed been stretched too far tied in knots and then kneaded by a giants fingers harry turtledove a couple of more lizards looked in at him from the hallway so did some people if anything they seemed more horrified than the lizards who did not have to fear catching whatever horrible disease hed come down with and simply found him most unaesthetic one of the lizards spoke into a small handheld radio an answer came back crisp and crackling regretfully the lizard advanced into the office he spoke into the radio again then held it out to russie zolraags voice came from the speaker you are ill reb moishe the governor asked by now his german was fairly good you are too ill to broadcast for us today im afraid i am russie croaked most sincerely he added his first untruth of the afternoon im sorry i also am sorry reb moishe zolraag answered i wanted your comments on the bombing of washington dc about which we would have given you full information i know you would say this shows the need for your kind to give up their foolish fight against our stronger weapons russie groaned again partly from weakness partly because hed expected zolraag to tell him something like that he said excellency i cannot speak now when i am well i will decide what i can truthfully say about what your people have done i am sure we will agree on what you would say zolraag told him the governor was trying to be subtle but hadnt really found the knack he went on but for now you must get over your sickness i hope your doctors can cure you of it he sounded unconvinced of the skills of human physicians russie wondered again what wonders lizard medical experts could work he said thank you excellency i hope to be better in a few days this sort of illness is not one which is usually fatal as you say again zolraag seemed dubious russie supposed he had reason when the lizards broke into warsaw thousands of starving ews in the ghetto had suffered from one form of intestinal disease or another and a great many had died the governor continued if you want my males will take you from your office to your home thank you excellency but no russie said i would like to preserve as much as possible the illusion of free agency he regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth better if the lizards kept on thinking of him as a willing catspaw he hoped zolraag wouldnt understand what hed said but the lizard did worse he approved yes this illusion is worth holding to reb moishe he answered confirming that as far as he was concerned russies freedom of action was an illusion even in his battered nauseated state he felt anger stir the governor spoke in his own hissing language the lizard who held worldwar in the balance the radiotelephone answered then skittered out of russies office with every evidence of relief he and the rest of the aliens left the jewish headquarters russie listened to their claws clicking on linoleum a few minutes later mordechai anielewicz came back in he wrinkled his nose it stinks like a burst sewer pipe in here reb moishe he said lets clean you up a little and get you home russie surrendered himself to the fighting leaders blunt practical ministrations he let anielewicz manhandle him down the stairs waiting on the street was a bicycle with a sidecar anielewicz poured him into it then climbed onto the little saddle and started pedaling such personal concern russie said the wind blowing in his face did a little to revive him im honored if id brought a car for you then youd have some business being honored anielewicz said laughing russie managed a wan chuckle himself these days gasoline was more precious than rubies in warsaw rubies after all remained rubies but gasoline once burned was gone forever even diesel fuel for fire engines was in desperately short supply a few dry leaves whirled through the streets on the chilly fall breeze but only a few a lot of trees had been cut down for fuel more would fall this winter russie thought and buildings wrecked in two rounds of fighting would be cannibalized for wood warsaw would be an uglier city when the fighting ended if it ever did rain began falling from the leadgray sky mordechai anielewicz reached up yanked down the brim of his cap so it did a better job of covering his eyes he said its set well have a go at the transmitter tomorrow night stay sick till then hat happens if you dont take it out russie asked ielewiczs laugh had a grim edge to it if we dont take it out reb moishe two things happen one is that some of my fighters will be dead and the other is that youll have to go on taking your medicines so that by this time next week youll likely end up envying them maybe the fighting leader meant it for a joke but russie didnt find it funny he felt as if the gestapo had been kicking him in the belly his mouth tasted like on second thought he didnt want to try to figure out what his mouth tasted like many of the jews the nazis forced into the warsaw ghetto had left it since the lizards came even so the streets remained crowded adroit as a footballer dodging through defensemen toward the goal anielewicz steered his bicycle past pushcarts rickshaws hordes of other bicycles and swarms of men and women afoot no one seemed willing to yield a centimeter of space to anyone else but somehow no one ran into anyone else either then suddenly there was space anielewicz stopped hard a squad of lizards tramped past on patrol they looked cold and miserable one harry turtledove turned his strange eyes resentfully up toward the weeping sky another wore a childs coat he hadnt figured out buttons but held the coat closed with one hand while the other clutched his weapon as soon as the lizards moved on the crowds closed in again anielewicz said if those poor creatures think its cold now what will they do come january freeze was the answer that immediately sprang into russies mind but he knew he was probably wrong the lizards knew more than mankind about so many things no doubt they had some simple way to keep themselves warm out in the open that patrol certainly had looked chilly though anielewicz pulled up in front of the apartment block where russie lived can you make it up to your flat he asked lets see russie unfolded himself from the sidecar he wobbled when he took a couple of tentative steps but stayed on his feet yes ill manage good if i had to walk you up id worry about the bicycle being here when i got back now i can worry about other things instead anielewicz nodded to russie and rode off had moishe felt more nearly alive he might have laughed at the way people in the courtyard started to come up to greet him then took a better look and retreated faster than theyd advanced he didnt blame them he would have sheered off from himself too if he didnt look horribly contagious it wasnt from lack of effort he turned the key walked into his flat one perquisite of his position was that his family had it all to themselves his wife whirled round in surprise moishe what are you doing here so early rivka said starting to smile then she got a good look at him and maybe a good whiff of him as well and asked a better question moishe what happened to you he sighed the lizards happened to me she stared at him her eyes wide in a face that while not skeletal as it had been a few months before was still too thin the lizards did that to you not directly he answered what the lizards did was to treat washington dc exactly as they had berlin and to expect me to be exactly as happy about it rivka did not much concern herself with politics the struggle for survival had taken all her energy but she was no fool they wanted you to praise them for destroying washington they must be meshuggeh thats what i thought so i got sick moishe explained how hed manufactured his illness on short notice oh thank god when i saw you i was afraid youd come down with something dreadful i feel pretty dreadful russie said though drugs rather than bacteria worldwar in the balance induced his illness his insides had still gone through a wringer the only difference was that he would not stay sick unless it proved expedient his little son reuven wandered out of the bedroom the boy wrinkled his nose why does father smell funny never mind rivka russie turned briskly practical were going to get him cleaned up right now she hurried into the kitchen the water had been reliable since the lizards took the town she came back with a bucket and a rag go into the bedroom moishe hand me out your filthy clothes clean yourself off and put on something fresh youll be better for it all right he said meekly shedding the soiled garments was nothing but relief he discovered hed managed to get vomit on the brim of his hat in a horrid sort of way that was an accomplishment the rag and bucket seemed hardly enough for the job for which they were intended he wondered if the vistula would have been enough thoughts of the augean stables ran through his mind as he scrubbed filth from himself he hadnt discovered greek mythology until his university days sometimes the images it evoked were as telling as any in the bible in clean clothes he felt a new if hollow man he didnt want to touch what he had been wearing but finally bundled the befouled outfit so the filthiest parts were toward the middle he brought everything out to rivka she nodded ill take care of them soon living in the ghetto had made stenches just part of life not something that had to be swept away on the instant at the moment questions were more urgent what will you do if the lizards insist that you speak for them after youre better ill get sick again he answered though his guts twisted at the prospeevvith luck though i wont have to he told her what anielewicz hadlanned for the transmitter even if that works it only puts off the evil day rivka said sooner or later moishe either you will have to do what the lizards want or else you will have to tell them no i know moishe grimaced maybe we never should have thrown our lot in with them in the first place maybe even the nazis were a better bargain than this rivka vigorously shook her head you know better when you are dead you cant bargain and even if we have to disobey the lizards i think they will kill only the ones who disobey and only because they disobey rather than making a sport of it or killing us simply because we are jews i think you are right the admission failed to reassure russie he after all would be one of those who disobeyed and he wanted to live but to praise the lizards for using one of their great bombs on washington better to die with selfrespect intact harry turtledove let me make you some soup rivka eyed him as if gauging his strength will you be able to hold it down i think so he said after making his own internal assessments he let out a dry chuckle i ought to try anyhow so i have something in my stomach in case i ah have to start throwing up again what i just went through was bad enough but the dry heaves are worse the soup was thick with cabbage and potatoes not the watery stuff of the days when the germans starved the ghetto jews and every morsel had to be stretched to the utmost though no one who had not known those dreadful days would have thought much of it its warmth helped ease the knots in russies midsection he had just finished the last spoonful when somebody came pounding down the hall at a dead run a fist slammed against his front door the somebody shouted reb moishe reb moishe come quick reb moishe russie started to get up his wife took him by the shoulders and forced him back into his chair youre sick remember she hissed she went to the door herself opened it whats wrong my husband is ill he cannot go anywhere but he has to the man in the hallway exclaimed as if he were a twoyearold convinced his word was law he cannot rivka repeated she stepped aside to let the fellow get a look at moishe adding see for yourself if you dont believe me which told russie he had to look as bad as he felt im sorry reb moishe the man said but we really do need you some of our fighters are facing off with some armja krajowa louts up on mickiewicza street and its getting ugly theyre liable to start shooting at each other any minute now russie groaned of all the times for hotheaded jews and prejudiced poles to start butting heads this was the worst rivka was too far away to make him keep sitting down he rose ignoring her look of consternation but before he could do anything more the man in the hallway said the lizards are already bringing heavy equipment up there theyll slaughter everyone if a fight breaks out with another groan russie clutched his belly and sank back down rivkas alarmed expression turned to real concern but she rallied quickly please go now she told the man my husband would come if he possibly could you know that but he really is ill yes i see he is im sorry god grant you health soon reb moishe the fellow departed at the same breakneck pace at which hed arrived rivka shut the door then turned on russie are you all right she demanded hands on hips you were going out there i know you were then all of a sudden he knew a moments pride that his acting had been good enough to worldwar in the balance give her doubts he said if the lizards are already there i cant let them see me or theyll know im not as sick as i let on her eyes widened yes that makes sense you im not done he interrupted the other thing is i dont think our men are tangling with the armja krajowa poles by accident think where the quarrel is at the opposite end of warsaw from the lizard headquarters i think theyre trying to draw troops and maybe zolraags attention too away from the studio and the transmitter mordechai said tomorrow night but he works fast unless i miss my guess this is a putup fight i hope youre right for most of the next minute rivka looked as intensely thoughtful as a yeshiva student following a rabbis exegesis of a difficult talmudic text a smile broke through like sunrise yes i think you are good russie said he did feel better with the warm soup inside him he hoped he wouldnt have to spew it up again but carried another vial of ipecac in a coat pocket he got up and walked over to the battered sofa springs poked through here and there and the fabric was filthy but just owning a sofa was a mark of status among warsaw jews these days the nazis hadnt stolen it in one of their ghetto sweeps and the family hadnt had to break it up and burn it to keep from freezing the winter before as he lay down on it russie was conscious of how lucky that made him rivka draped a threadbare blanket over him how can you look sick if youre not covered up she asked i seem to have managed he said but she ignored him he let the blanket stay tut the time he came close to dozing off reuven started banging on with a spoon rivka quickly hushed the boy but the damage was done a few minutes later a new more ominous racket filled the flat the distant rattle of guns where is it coming from russie asked turning his head this way and that if it was from the north the jews and poles might really have opened up on each other if from the south anielewiczs fighters in german uniform were hitting the radio transmitter i cant tell either rivka said the sound is funny inside a block of flats thats true russie settled himself to wait the shooting and explosions lasted only a couple of minutes hed nearly forgotten the echoing silence that followed gunfire though hed heard it almost daily before the lizards seized warsaw from the germans half an hour later another knock came at the apartment door rivka opened it without ceremony a lizard walked in he fixed both eyes on russie in hissing german he said i am ssfeer from the governor zolraags staff you know me now yes i recognized your body paint moishe answered how can i harry turtledove help you i fear i cannot do much at the moment i was taken ill this morning so the prominent zolraag learned ssfeer said he how say you he gives permissions to you to get well more slow bandits from deutschland just now theyhow say you shoot up radio maybe to keep you quiet not let you speak we need maybe ten days to fix oh what a pity russie said the lancaster rumbled down the runway engines roaring the plane bounced and shuddered as it gained speed lizard bomblets had cratered the runway the week before and repairs were crude george bagnall knew nothing but relief that they werent trying to take off with a full bomb load bombs were delicate things once in a while a bump would set one off after which the groundcrew would have another crater a big one to fill in the bomber fairly sprang into the air in the pilots seat next to bagnalls ken embry grinned amazing what lightening the aircraft will do embry said i feel like im flying a spitfire i think its all in our head bagnall replied the radar unit back there cant be a great deal lighter than the ordnance we usually carry the flight engineer flicked an intercom switch how is it doing radarman goldfarb seems all right he heard in his earphones i can see a long way thats the idea bagnall said a radar set in an aircraft several miles above the earth could peer farther around its curve pick up lizard planes as they approached and give englands defenses a few precious extra minutes to prepare bagnall shivered inside his flight suit and furs as the lanc gained altitude he switched on his oxygen tasted the rubber of the hose as he breathed the enriched air goldfarb spoke enthusiastically if we can keep just a few planes in the air theyll do as much for us as all our ground stations put together of course he added we also have a good deal farther to fall bagnall tried not to think about that the lizards had pounded british ground radar in the opening days of their invasion forcing the raf and ground defenses to fight blind ever since now they were trying to see again the lizards were not likely to want to let them see coming up on angels twenty ken embry announced taking station at the altitude radioman how is our communication with the fighter pack reading them five by five ted lane replied they report receiving us five by five as well they are eager to begin the exercise sir bloody maniacs embry said as far as im concerned the ideal mission is one devoid of all contact with the enemy whatsoever bagnall could not have agreed more despite machine gun turrets all worldwar in the balance over the aircraft the lancaster had always been at a dreadful disadvantage against enemy fighters evasion beat the blazes out of combat the knowledge made bomber aircrew cautious and made them view swaggering aggressive fighter pilots as not quite right in the head from back in the bomb bay david goldfarb said i ought to be able to communicate directly with the fighter aircraft rather than relaying through the radioman thats a good notion goldfarb bagnall said jot it down maybe theyll be able to use it on the mark and maybe if we keep on being luckier than we deserve well live to try out the mark he added to himself he didnt need to say it aloud goldfarb had known what the odds were when he volunteered for this mission bagnall wiped the inside of the curved perspex window in front of him with a piece of chamois cloth nothing much to see out there not even the exhaust flames from other bombers ahead above below and to either side reassuring reminders one was not going into danger all alone now there was only night night and the endless throb of the four merlins consciously reminded of the engines the flight engineer flicked his eyes over the gauges in front of him mechanically all was well i have enemy aircraft goldfarb exclaimed back in the bomb bay he couldnt see even the night just the tracks of electrons across a phosphorcoated screen but his machine vision reached farther than bagnalls eyes i say again i have enemy aircraft heading distance thirtyfive miles and closing speed ted lane passed that word on to the mosquitoes that lurked far above the radarcarrying lancaster the twinengine planes not only had the hig operational ceiling of any british fighters they were also with thevooden skins and skeletons harder for radar to acquire rockets away from the lizard aircraft goldfarb yelped bearing straight for us speed too bloody fast for my machine here shut it down embry ordered he threw the lanc into a violent corkscrewing dive that made bagnall glad for the straps that held him in his seat his stomach felt a couple of thousand feet behind the aircraft he gulped wishing he hadnt had greasy fish and chips less than an hour before the mission started an excited yell from joe simpkin in the tail gunners turret echoed in his headset the gunner added one of those rockets flew through where we used to be well by god ken embry said softly the pilot who made a point of never letting anything impress him added who would have thought the boffins could actually get one right im rather glad they did bagnall said stressing his broad as to show he also took such miracles for granted the engineers down on the ground had been confident the lizards would attack a radarcarrying air harry turtledove craft with the same radarhoming rockets theyd used to wreck the british ground stations turn off the radar and what would they have to home on nothing down on the ground it all seemed as inexorably logical as a geometric proof the boffins however didnt have to test their theories in person that was what aircrews were for shall i start it up again goldfarb asked over the intercom no better not not quite yet embry said after a moments thought it does us no good if it isnt running the radarman said plaintively it does us no bloody good if it gets us shot down either bagnall thought but that wasnt fair and he knew it for someone whose only time in the air had been practicing for this mission goldfarb was doing fine and not only was it natural for him to want to play with his toy he had a point a radar set that had to shut down as soon as action started to keep from being destroyed was better than no radar set at all but not much along with letting goldfarb talk directly with the fighters his radar directed the boffins would have to come up with a way to let him keep the set operating without getting it and its aircraft blown out of the sky ted lane let out an earpiercing red indian whoop a mosquito just took out one of their planes bounced him from above almost headon couldnt very well come up on him from behind could he what with the lizards being the faster aircraft says he saw the enemy break up in midair and then he was diving for the deck for all he was worth everyone in the lancaster cheered then ken embry said what about the rest of the mosquitoes after a moment the radioman answered er several of them do not respond to my signal sir that dashed the moment of exultation the raf was slowly painfully learning how to hurt the lizards the lizards already knew only too well how to hurt the raf bagnall hoped the fighter pilots had managed to bail out trained men were harder to replace than airplanes from his station in front of the nowdark radar screen goldfarb said the chaps on the ground have been listening to us too with a bit of luck theyll also have hurt the lizards at least theyll have had the advantage of knowing a bit sooner from which direction theyre coming fat bloody lot of good itll do them embry said like any pilot he pretended to disbelieve flak crews could possibly hit anything with their guns if that attitude made flying seem safer for him bagnall was not about to complain a calm pilot was a smooth pilot and a smooth pilot was likeliest to bring his aircrew home again goldfarb repeated may i turn the set on again sir embry took his right hand off the stick pounded a closed fist up and down on his thigh bagnall didnt think he knew he was doing it at last the pilot said yes go ahead you may as well as youve noted that is the purpose of our being up here on this lovely fall evening worldwar in the balance really bagnall said and all the time i thought it was to see how fast the lizards could shoot us down the groundcrew have formed a pool on it i understand did you toss in your shilling ken im afraid not embry answered imperturbable when they told me someone had already chosen twenty seconds after takeoff i decided my chances for winning were about nil so i held onto my money out of consideration for my heirs what about you old fellow sorry to have spoiled your wager but im afraid im the chap who took the twenty seconds after we left the ground bagnall was not about to let the pilot outdo him in offhandedness not this time i admit i did wonder how id go about collecting if i happened to win the radar set like any humanbuilt piece of electronic apparatus needed a little while to warm up after it went on bagnall had heard rumors that lizard gear taken from shotdown planes went on instantly he wondered if they were true from what he knew valves tubes the americans called them by their very nature required warmup time maybe the lizards didnt use valves though he had no idea what might take their place another flight incoming same bearing as before goldfarb announced range twentythree miles and closing too bloody fast shall i shut it down now no wait until they launch their rockets at us embry said bagnall wondered if the pilot had lost his mind and even wondered if there really was a groundcrew pool and if embry was trying to win it but embry proved to have method in his madness weve already seen we can evade the rockets that track us by our own radar if we shut down before they fire those they may get closer and shoot rockets of a different sort at us swe cant evade their tactics do tend to be stereotyped dont they bagnall agreed after a little thought given a choice theyll do the same thing over and over regardless of whether its the right thing and if its wrong why give them the excuse to change just what was in my embry began goldfarb interrupted him rockets away shutting down now again the lancaster spun through the air again bagnall wondered if the fish and chips would stay down and again the lizards rockets failed to bring down the british aircraft maybe this isnt a suicide mission after all bagnall said happily hed had his doubts as the lanc rolled down the runway ted lane listened to the surviving mosquitoes as they made their runs at the attackers another hit he said this time though no one in the lancaster shouted for joy the aircrew had realized the price the fighter pilots were paying for every kill then the radioman told embry we are ordered to break off opera harry turtledove tions and return to base the air vice marshal remarks that having been lucky twice hes not inclined to tempt fate by pushing for a third bit of good fortune the air vice marshal is a little old woman the pilot retorted he added hastily you need not inform him of my opinion however we shall of course obey his instructions like the good little children we are navigator if you would be so kind as to suggest a course suggest is the proper word all right alf whyte said from his little curtainedoff space behind the pilots and flight engineers seats what with some of the twists you put the aircraft through i thought the compass was jitterbugging to a hot swing band if we are where i think we are a course of will bring us to the general neighborhood of dover in ten or twelve minutes ohseveneight it is embry said turning to that course now he swung the bomber through the sky as if it were an extension of himself george bagnall watched the neatly ordered phalanx of gauges in front of him as intently as if they monitored his own heartbeat and breathing in a very real way they did if the lancasters engines or hydraulic system failed his heart would not go on beating for very long i have contact with the airfield the radioman announced they read us five by five and report no damage from the lizards this evening thats good to hear embry said bagnall nodded the landing would be rough enough as it was what with the hasty repairs to earlier repairs from the sky the lanc wouldnt be coming in with combat damage or unexpended bombs as it might have from a mission over germany or france but its fuel tanks were much fuller than they would have been on the return flight from such a mission the petrol the plane burned made a morethansatisfactory explosive when things went wrong bagnall stared out through the perspex he tapped embry on the arm isnt that the ocean approaching embry looked too sod me if its not alf were coming up on the bloody north sea are we north or south of where we want to be i feel like a blind man tapping down the path with his stick all the more so with that radar set back in the bomb bay it ought to be able to find our way home for us all by its lonesome i dare say it will do precisely that one of these days the navigator answered i suggest you bear in mind though that the lizards doubtless monitor every sort of signal we produce do you really care to guide them to the runway as you set down now that you mention it no ha embry pointed down into the darkness bagnalls eyes followed his finger he too spied the red torch winking on and off he flicked on the lancasters wing lights just for a moment to acknowledge the signal other torches these white along one side of the runway and green worldwar in the balance along the other sprang to life embry pointed looks like a bloody aircraft carrier flight deck down there i thought this was the raf not the fleet air arm could be worse bagnall remarked at least the runways not pitching in a heavy sea theres a cheerful thought embry lined up the lancaster on the two rows of torches went into the final landing descent the hasty touchdown was less than smooth but also less than disastrous about par for a landing under war conditions bagnall thought along with the rest of the aircrew he got out of the lanc in a hurry and sprinted across the tarmac now blacked out again for the nissen hut whose corrugated metal walls were surrounded by sandbags to protect against blast a tent of blackout curtains in front of the huts doorway let people go in and out without leaking light for all the world and for unfriendly visitors from another world to see the glare of the bare bulbs strung from the nissen huts ceiling smote bagnalls darkaccustomed eyes like a photographers flash the aircrew hurled themselves onto chairs and couches some drained by the mission fell asleep at once in spite of the glare others bagnall among them dug out pipes and cigarettes may i have one of those david goldfarb asked pointing to the flight engineers packet of players im afraid im all out bagnall passed him a cigarette leaned close to give him a light off the one he already had going as the radarman inhaled bagnall said i expect youll be off to the white horse inn after the boffins get done grilling you over how things went tonight whats the point goldfarb said more in resignation than bitterneoh i expect ill drink there but the girls as i say whats the point bagnall also knew about the barmaids preferences now he stuck his tongue far into his cheek i think staring into the radar screen must have a deleterious effect on the brain did it never occur to you that youve just returned from flying a combat mission the end of goldfarbs cigarette suddenly glowed a fierce red his eyes glowed too i knew it only too bleeding well when those lizard rockets homed on us i confess i hadnt thought of it in other terms though thank you sir bagnall waved a hand in a parody of aristocratic elegance delighted to be of service service it had been too in an instant hed made the radarman forget all about the fear hed just endured he wished he could perform the same service for himself ussmak cursed the day the race had first discovered tosev he cursed the day the probe the race had sent to this miserable world returned safely he cursed the day hed been hatched the day hed gone into cold sleep the day hed awakened he cursed krentel something hed been doing every day since the blundering idiot replaced votal he cursed the big uglies for killing votal and then telerep and leaving krentel alive most of all he cursed the mud the landcruiser he drove was built to handle difficult terrain on the whole it did well but tosev being a wetter place than any of the three worlds already in the empire had mixtures of water and dirt more thorough and more spectacularly gloppy than any of the races engineers had imagined ussmak was in the middle of one of those mixtures as far as he could tell it was most of a continent wide and most of a continent long the russkis only made matters worse by not paving any of their stinking roads once the rain soaked into what was allegedly a roadbed the mud there was most of a continent deep too he pressed his foot down on the accelerator the landcruiser lurched forward so long as he moved every little while he was all right if he stayed too long in one place the machine started to sink its tracks were more than wide enough to support it on any reasonable surface this gluey slimy stuff was a long way from reasonable ussmak accelerated again the landcruiser plowed through the bog its tracks flung muck in all directions some of the muck dead emperors only knew how splashed down onto ussmaks vision slit he pressed a button detergent solution sprayed the armorglass clean that was a relief at least he wouldnt have to unbutton and stick his head into the refrigerator outside krentel had his cupola in the turret dogged down tight too a landcruiser commander was supposed to look out over the top of that cu worldwar in the balance pola as much as he could but ussmak though he blamed krentel for a lot of things couldnt blame him for not wanting to freeze his snout off at that the driver thought gunning the landcruiser forward once more things could have been worse he could have been driving a truck instead the wheeled vehicles the landcruiser was supposed to be protecting had a much rougher time in this accursed bog than he did hed already used his towing chain to pull two or three of them out of places where theyd sunk worse than axledeep that the trucks had to be shielded just made them heavier and the sticking problem worse for that matter ussmak could have been one of the poor wretches in radiation suits who guddled around in the freezing tosevite slime for the bits of radioactive material their detectors found the radiation suits werent heated no one had foreseen the need no one had foreseen that the big uglies would be able to blow the th emperor sohrheb all over the landscape either the males in those suits had to labor in shifts one group going back to a warming station while the other emerged to work krentels voice rang in the intercom button taped to ussmaks hearing diaphragm maintain heightened alertness driver i have just received a report that tosevite bandit groups may be operating in the area primary defense responsibilities fall on our glorious landcruiser forces as you say commander ussmak answered it shall be done how he was supposed to be especially alert for bandits when he could see only straight ahead with the landcruiser buttoned was beyond him maybe krentel ought to open up the cupola and look around after all he thought about saying as much to the landcruiser commander but decided not to bother the race did not encourage lower ranks to reprove theirs superiors that way lay anarchy in any case ussmak doubted that ktl would have listened he seemed to think the emperor had personally granted him all the answers and finally ussmaks own sense of isolation from everything going on around him had only grown worse since his two original landcruiser crewmales died a good replacement for votal would have taken pains to reforge the team krentel just treated him like a piece of machinery machines dont care machinelike ussmak kept the landcruiser out of as much trouble as he could hed found some better ground where the grass now yellow and dying rather than green and shiny with life was still thick enough under his tracks to keep the landcruiser from sinking as fast as it had on barer terrain ahead lay a stand of low scrubby trees their bare branches groped for the sky like thin beseeching arms theyd dropped their leaves when the rains started ussmak wondered why it seemed wasteful to him certainly none of the trees back on home behaved in such profligate fashion he missed home although the idea of turning tosev into another version of his own world had seemed good and noble when he got into the harry turtledove coldsleep capsule everything hed seen since he came out of it screamed that it wasnt going to be as easy as everybody had thought given the big uglies intractability he wondered how the race had succeeded so well on rabotev and halless i he also wondered why no one else seemed to have any doubts about what the race was doing here the males had just formed their own rather compressed version of society back home and gone on about their business changing original plans only because the tosevites had more technology than anyone expected no one worried about the rightness of what they were doing even ussmak had no real idea of what the races forces ought to be doing now that theyd come to tosev he supposed the doubts he did have sprang from his own feeling of apartness from everyone around him from having been wrenched out of his comfortable niche in the original landcruiser crew and thrust into the unwanted company not merely of strangers but of pompous inept strangers behind him the turret traversed with a whir of smooth machinery the coaxial machine gun began to chatter we shall rout out any big uglies lurking among the trees krentel declared with his usual grandiloquence for once though the commanders tone failed to grate on ussmak krentel was actually doing something sensible ussmak cherished that when it happened had it happened more often he might have been content even on this miserable cold wet ball of mud machinegun bullets whined less than a meter above heinrich jagers head had any leaves remained on the birch trees the bullets would have shaken the last of them down as it was he used the fallen leaves to help conceal himself from the lizard panzer firing from the open country ahead the wet ground and wet leaves soaked jfigers shabby clothes rain beat on his back and trickled down his neck he suppressed a sneeze by main force a round ricocheting from a tree trunk kicked mud up into his face beside him georg schultz let out a ghostly chuckle well major arent you glad we never had to mess with this infantry shit before now that you mention it yes it wasnt just the manifold discomforts of crawling around bare to the elements either jfiger felt naked and vulnerable without armor plate all around him in his panzer iii machinegun bullets had been something to laugh at now they could pierce his precious tender flesh as easily as anything else they happened to strike he raised his head a couple of centimeters just enough to let him peer out at the lizard panzer it seemed sublimely indifferent to anything a mere foot soldier could hope to do to it all at once jager understood the worldwar in the balance despair his own tank must have induced in french and russian infantry whod tried and failed to stop it the shoe was on the other foot now sure enough one of the partisans who huddled with jager might have been reading his mind the fellow said well there it is comrade major what the fuck do we do about it for the time being we wait jager answered unless youre really keen on dying right now that is after what ive been through the last year and a half from your fucking nazi bastards dying is the least of my worries the partisan answered jager twisted his head to glare at the ally who would have been anything but a few months before the partisan a skinny man with a graystreaked beard and a big nose glared back jager said i find this as ironic as you do believe me ironic the partisan raised bushy eyebrows jager had trouble understanding him he wasnt really speaking german at all but yiddish and about every fourth word made the major stop and think the jew went on fuck ironic i asked god how things could be worse than they were with you germans around and he had to go and show me let it be a lesson to you comrade nazi major never pray for something you dont really want because you may get it anyhow right max jager said smiling a little in spite of himself he hadnt fought side by side with any jews since the first world war he had no great use for them but the russian partisan band sprawled in the dripping woods with him was more than half jewish he wondered whether the ivans back in moscow had set it up that way on purpose to make sure the pns didnt think about betraying stalin that made a certain amount orrsense but it was also likely to make a fighting unit less efficient than it would have been without mutual suspicion and on the jews side outright hatred the lizard panzers machine gun stopped spitting flame it swung away from the woods jager envied the turrets quick power traverse if hed had himself a machine like that now he could have accomplished something worthwhile it was wasted on the lizards who had hardly a clue about how to exploit it the tank wallowed forward through the mud jager had made the acquaintance of russian mud the previous fall and spring it had done its best to glue his panzer iii in one place for good he was not altogether disappointed to watch it give the lizards trouble too his attention shifted from the tank to the trucks and soldiers it was guarding the trucks like any wheeled vehicles were having a lot of trouble in the mud the nkvd man back in moscow had been right they were unusually heavy every so often a lizard soldier looking even more harry turtledove alien than usual in a shiny gray suit that covered him from toe claws to crown would go over and put something at this distance jager couldnt tell what into the back of a truck i hope we dont have to hijack a vehicle he thought given the state of what the russians for lack of a suitably malodorous word called roads he wasnt sure the band could hijack a lizard truck from a position carefully camouflaged by tall dead grass a german machine gun began to bark a couple of lizards fell others started to run while still others wiser or more experienced flattened out on the ground as human soldiers would have done the glass blew out of a trucks windshield when a round or two struck home jager couldnt see what happened to the driver the commander of the lizard panzer needed longer to notice the machine gun had opened up than he should have the dummkopf had his cupola buttoned up too jager would have demoted a man to say nothing of blistering his ears and maybe his backside for a piece of stupidity or was it cowardice like that when the lizard finally deigned to pay some attention to the machine gun nest he did just what jager had hoped he would instead of standing off and annihilating it with a round or two from his cannon he charged toward it his own machine gun chattering the german weapon fell silent that worried jager if the lizard got lucky with his own machine gun the partisan band might have to back off and come up with a new plan but then the concealed machine gun started up again now firing straight at the oncoming tank save as a goad that was useless jager watched mm bullets spark off the lizard panzers invincible front armor and fly away uselessly the popgun onslaught though was intended only as a goad to make sure the enemy tank commander took the machinegun nest too seriously to worry about anything else georg schultz let out a gleeful grunt god damn me to hell if he isnt taking the bait sir ja jager answered absently he watched the panzer slog through the mud until it was just past the edge of the woods then its main armament did speak a bellow that made jagers ears ring mud fountained up from just behind the german machinegun nest but the weapon kept returning fire jager turned his head to glance over at max brave men there he remarked the muzzle of the cannon lowered a centimeter or so fired again this time the machine gun was put out of action a singularly bloodless term jager thought for having a couple of men suddenly made into mangled chunks of raw meat but otto skorzeny was already dashing forward from the birch trees worldwar in the balance toward the lizard panzer the enemy tank commander must have been looking straight through his forward cupola periscope for he never saw the big ss man pounding toward him from the flank and rear muck flying from his boots as he ran skorzeny covered the couple of hundred meters out to the panzer in time an olympic sprinter might have envied the big machine started to move just as he came up on it he scrambled onto the rear deck chucked a satchel charge under the overhang of the turret and dove off headfirst the charge exploded the turret jerked as if kicked by a mule blue flames spurted from the engine compartment an escape hatch in the front of the panzer popped open a lizard sprang out jager took no notice of the alien enemy he was watching skorzeny leg it back toward the shelter of the woods then his gaze slid to max again fuck you nazi the jewish partisan repeated but even he saw that would not do not by itself grudgingly he added that ss bastard isnt just brave hes fucking crazy since jager had thought the same thing since he met skorzeny in moscow he declined to argue along with everyone else in the band he grabbed his rifle got to his feet and ran toward the lizards of the salvage crew shouting at the top of his lungs the heavy protective suits made the lizards slow and awkward they fell like ninepins jager wondered how safe it was for him to be tramping about with no more protection than his helmet but only for a moment getting shot was a much more pressing concern come on come on come on he shouted pointing toward the truck the german machine gun had shot up it hadnt moved since when he got up to it he found out why one of the rounds that shattered the windshield hado blown out the back of the drivers head the blood and brains splashed over the inside of the cab looked no different from those of a human being similarly killed having made sure the truck driver was in fact dead jager hurried around to the rear of the vehicle the latch there was very much like the one on an earthly truck the partisans already had it open jager peered into the cargo compartment which was lit by fluorescent tubes that ran from front to back across the ceiling the mudcovered little misshapen chunks of metal that lay on the floor of the compartment seemed hardly worth the trouble to which the lizards had gone to recover them but they were what the raiders had come to steal if the lizards wanted them so badly they ought to be worth having along with his rifle max carried an entrenching tool he scooped up several of those innocuouslooking muddy lumps dumped them into a leadlined wooden box a couple of the other partisans hauled between harry turtledove them the instant he finished they slammed on the lid three men spoke together lets get out of here the advice was to say the least timely the lizards had another panzer off in the distance maybe a kilometer and a half away it started churning toward them in the same instant muzzle flashes sprang from the machine gun on its turret bullets cracked past the running men one of them fell with a groan longrange machinegun fire wasnt much good for taking out any particular individual but it could decimate troops caught in the open jager had fought on the somme in german machine guns then had done a lot worse than decimating the oncoming british unlike those brave but foolish englishmen a generation before the partisans were not advancing into barbedwire entanglements but running for the cover of the woods they were almost there when one of the men carrying the leaddined chest threw up his hands and pitched forward onto his face jager was only a few meters away he grabbed the handle the partisan had dropped the box was astonishingly heavy for its size but not too heavy to lift jager and the jew on the other side ran on the sound of dead leaves scrunching wetly under his feet was one of the loveliest things hed ever heard it meant hed made it into the woods he and his fellow bearer dodged around tree trunks trying to take advantage of as much cover as they could behind them the lizard panzer kept firing but it didnt sound as if it was getting any closer jager turned to the partisan beside him i think the bastard bogged down the jew nodded the two men grinned at each other as they hurried away from the tank jager felt surprising confidence build in him hed thought of this mission as suicidal ever since the nkvd man proposed it back in moscow that hadnt kept him from taking part suicidal missions were part of war and if they served the cause were often worth attempting but now he began to think he might actually get away with this one then well hed worry about then later he began to think hed have a later in which to worry about then a whirring thutter in the air brought all his fears flooding back knowing it was foolish knowing it was dangerous he glanced over his shoulder the helicopter swelled in the split second he watched it its guns started to chatter mud wouldnt slow it down left alone it could hover over the barebranched woods and lash the raiders with fire until they had to give up their mission wham wham wham from among the trees a centimeter antiaircraft cannon opened up on the helicopter with its light mount designed for mountain warfare it had made up twentyseven manportable loads jager had hauled one of them himself it was a german weapon served by wehrmacht men along with their own partisans in this band the lizard helicopter just hung in midair for a moment as if disbelieving the guerrillas could seriously attack it it was proof against rifle bullets but not against the antiaircraft guns shells jager watched them chew it to pieces watched chunks of metal fly from it at every hit too late the helicopter swung toward its tormentor the centimeter flak kept pounding away like a sinking ship the helicopter heeled over onto one side and crashed the raiders cheers filled the woods max pumped his fist in the air and screamed take that you jager couldnt follow the rest of the yiddish he called it but it sounded explosive the panzer major yelled himself then blinked fighting alongside a jew was one thing tactics dictated that finding you agreed with him finding you might even like him as a man was something else again if he lived long enough jager would have to think about that otto skorzeny came dodging through the trees even filthy even in dappled ss camouflage gear he managed to look dapper he shouted move you stupid fools if we dont get away now we never will you think the lizards are going to sit there with their thumbs up their arses forever its your funeral if you do as usual skorzeny galvanized everyone around him the red partisans undoubtedly hated him still but who could argue with a man whod just singlehandedly wrecked a lizard panzer the raiders hurried deeper into the woods none too soon again jager heard the thuttering roar of helicopters in thehe glanced back and saw a pair of them now the germans mannine antiaircraft cannon opened up at long range this time hoping to knodl down one in a hurry so they could fight the other on more even terms and also hoping to draw both machines fire onto themselves and away from their fleeing comrades the helicopters separated swung around to engage the antiaircraft cannon from opposite sides jager wished the gun were a big it could have swatted the copters like flies but an was anything but a manportable weapon it had a barrel almost seven meters long and weighed more than eight tonnes the stubby mountain antiaircraft gun would have to do one of the helicopters blew up in midair showering flaming debris over the woods the other bored in for a firing run jager watched tracers from the cannon on the ground swivel through a wild arc then stab up at the second helicopter while tracers from its machine guns stabbed down the centimeter flak suddenly fell silent but the helicopter did not go on to pursue the partisans a rending crash moments later told harry turtledove him why the gunners had done their duty as well as they were able better than anyone dared hope when the mission was planned the partisan carrying the leadlined box with jager was at the end of his tether stumbling and staggering and gasping like a man breathing his last jager scowled at him get away from there and put somebody else on that handle before you ruin the mission and get us both killed only after hed spoken did he notice the order in which hed put those two elements he grunted in case he hadnt noticed that would have told him he was a thoroughly trained soldier the raider nodded his thanks and reeled away georg schultz hurried up here ill take some of that sir he said nodding to the burden jager now held alone no let me it was max the foulmouthed jewish partisan he wasnt as big probably wasnt as strong as schultz but hed shown himself to be wiry and tough all other things being equal jager would have preferred his tank gunner beside him but all other things were not equal the mission might depend on cooperation between surviving germans and russians having two germans carrying the precious whateveritwas inside that chest might make the reds think harder about selling them out all that ran through jagers head in a couple of seconds he couldnt afford to think very long hanging onto the chest solo was hard work he said let the jew do it georg schultz looked unhappy but fell back a couple of paces max took one of the handles from jager together they started moving again even as he trotted beside jager max glared at him how would you like it if i said let the fucking nazi do it eh mister fucking nazi thats major fucking nazi to you mister jew jager retorted and the next time you want to go swearing at me kindly remember those flak men back there who stayed at their gun and got shot up to help you make your getaway they did their jobs max snapped but after he spat into a clump of brown leaves he added yeah all right ill remember them in the kaddish i dont know that word jager said prayer for the dead max said shortly he glanced toward jager again now his gaze was measuring instead of hostile but somehow no easier to bear you dont know fucking much do you you dont know babi yar for instance eh no jager admitted whats that place a little outside of kiev not far from here as a matter of fact you find a big hole in the ground then line jews up at the edge of it men women children doesnt matter you line em up you shoot em in the worldwar in the balance back of the neck they fall right into their own graves you germans are fucking efficient you know then you line up another row and shoot them too you keep doing it till your big hole is full then you find yourself another fucking hole propaganda jager said without a word max used his free hand to pull down the collar of his peasants blouse and bare his neck jager knew a gunshot scar when he saw one the jew said i must have jerked just as the gun went off behind me i fell down they had bastards down in the hole with more guns making sure everybody really was dead they must have missed me i hope they dont get a fucking reprimand you know more people fell on me but not too many it was getting late when it was dark i managed to crawl out and get away ive been killing fucking germans ever since jager didnt answer he hadnt gone out of his way to notice what happened to jews in russian territory taken by the germans nobody in the wehrmacht went out of his way to notice that it wasnt safe for your reer it might not be safe for you personally hed heard things everybody heard things he hadnt worried much about it after all the fhrer had declared jews the enemies of the reich but there were ways soldiers treated enemies lining them up at the edge of a pit and shooting them from behind wasnt supposed to be one of those ways jager tried to imagine himself doing that it wasnt easy but if the reich was at war and his superior gave him the order he shook his head he just didnt know from across the chest less than a meter away his jewish yokemate watched him flounder watching max watch him only made jager flounder harder if jews could flipflop from enemies of the reich to comradesinalthat just made massacring them all the harder to stomach maxs voice was sly you maybe have a fucking conscience of course i have a conscience jager said indignantly then he shut up again if he had a conscience as hed automatically claimed how was he supposed to ignore what germany might well have been doing even in his own mind he didnt want to phrase it any more definitely than that to his relief the woods started thinning out ahead that meant the most dangerous part of the mission crossing open country with what theyd stolen from the lizards lay ahead beside the abyss whose edge hed been treading with max physical danger suddenly seemed a welcome diversion as long as he was putting his own life on the line hed be too busy to look down into the abyss and see the people piled there with neat holes in the backs of their necks the survivors of the raiding party gathered near the edge of the trees skorzeny took charge of them from under the thick layer of dead leaves he pulled out several chests which looked the same as the one jager and harry turtledove max carried but were not leadlined two men to each one he ordered pausing to let the russian partisans who understood german translate for those who didnt we scatter now two by two to make it as hard as we can for the iizards to figure out who has the real one one of the partisans said how do we know the real one will go where its supposed to all the worn dirty men russians and germans alike nodded at that they still had no great trust in one another theyd fought too hard for that skorzeny said we have one from each side holding the prize the panje wagon thats waiting for them has one from each side too if they dont try to murder each other well be all right ja the ss man laughed to show hed made a joke jager looked over to max the jew was not laughing he wore the expression jager had often seen on junior officers who faced a tough tactical problem he was weighing his options that meant jager had to weigh his too skorzeny said well go out one pair at a time the team with the real chest will go third who told you you were god a partisan asked the ss mans scarred cheek crinkled as he gave an impudent grin who told you i wasnt he waited a moment to see if he got any more argument when he didnt he swatted a man from the pair closest to him on the shoulder and shouted go go go as if they were paratroopers diving out of a ju transport plane the second pair followed a moment later then skorzeny yelled go go go again and jager and max burst out of the woods and started off toward the promised panje wagon it waited several kilometers north and west outside the lizards tjghtest security zone jager wanted to sprint the whole way slogging through mud carrying a heavy chest that wasnt practical im fucking sick of rain max said though he knew as well as jager that the snow which would follow was even harder to endure jager said right now i dont mind rain at all the lizards will have a harder time chasing us through it than they would on dry ground the low clouds will make us harder to spot through the air too if you want to get right down to it i wouldnt mind fog either i would max said wed get lost i have a compass very efficient max said dryly jager took it for a compliment until he remembered it was the word the jew had used to describe the assemblyline murder at what was the name of the place at babi yar that was it anger surged in the panzer major the trouble was he had trouble deciding whether to turn it on his own people for dishonoring the uniforms they wore or the jew for telling him about it and making him notice it he glanced over at max as usual max was watching him he had no trouble finding a focus for his fury worldwar in the balance jager twisted his head looked behind him the driving rain had already obscured the woods he could see one of the decoy pairs but only one he wouldnt have wanted to track anyone in weather like this and wished just as much trouble on the lizards they wouldnt pursue in panzers anyhow from what hed seen their armor had at least as much trouble coping with russian mud as the wehrmacht did he must have been thinking aloud max grinned an unsympathetic grin and said you poor boggeddown bastards fuck you too max in the wrong tone of voice that would have started the fight skorzeny had notquitejoked about as it was the jewish partisans expression changed shape as if he like jager had to change some of his thinking then both mens faces congealed to fear the lizards had more helicopters in the air and this time no flak cannon would stop them rifle shots rang out from back in the woods but using a rifle against one of these machines was as magnificently futile as the polish lancers charges against german panzers back when the war the human war was new but these rifle bullets did have some effect the whistling roar of the copter rotors grew no louder the deadly machines hovered over the trees their guns snarled when they paused more rifle fire announced that they hadnt finished off all the raiders the yammering resumed the sound from the helicopters changed jager looked back but could see nothing through the curtains of rain he tried to be optimistic anyhow maybe theyre settling down so they can comb through the woods if they are theyll be looking in the wrong place max was less sanguine dont count on them to be so fucking stupi fhey arent what youd call good soldiers not in the tactical sense jager answered seriously theyre brave enough and of course they have all that wonderful equipment but ask them to do anything they havent planned out in advance and they start floundering around theyre even worse than russians that way he thought but he kept quiet about that the strafing from the helicopters hadnt slaughtered all the raiders rifles barked again a soviet submachine gun added its note to the din then harsher and flatter lizard automatic small arms answered they have landed troops jager exclaimed the longer they waste time back there the better the chance the mission has of succeeding and the likelier theyll kill off my friends max said yours too i suppose does a fucking nazi have friends after a tough day shooting jews in the back of the neck do you go out and drink some beer with your kameraden im a soldier not a butcher jager said he wondered whether georg schultz had got one of the dummy chests if so he was tramping through the mud too if not he also wondered about otto skorzeny the ss harry turtledove captain seemed to have a gift for creating impossible situations and then escaping from them hed need all that gift now but thinking of the ss made jager think of babi yar that would have been their doing wehr nacht men couldnt have stomached it he added you russians have butchers too so max said does that make you right jager found no good answer the jewish partisan went on i wish theyd sent me to the gulag in siberia years before you fucking germans ever got to kiev then i wouldnt have had to see what i saw further argument cut off abruptly when jager fell headlong into the muck max helped him haul himself to his feet they pushed on jager felt as if he were a hundred years old a kilometer through this clinging goo was worse than a days march on hard dry ground he wistfully wondered whether the soviet union contained so much as a square centimeter of hard dry ground at the moment he also wondered for what the soft wet ground over which he was fleeing had been used in germany land had a clearly defined purpose meadow crops forest park town this stretch met no such criteria it was just land raw terrain of that the soviet union had unending inefficient abundance jager abruptly cut off his disparaging thoughts about soviet inefficiency his head went up like a hunted animals the tiny atrophied muscles in his ears tried to make them prick like a cats lizard helicopters were in the air again we have to move faster he said to max the partisan pointed to his own trousers which were covered in mud up to the knees he dismissed jagers suggestion with three sardonic words good fucking luck rationally jager knew max was right still as the whirring drone from the sky grew louder he wanted to drop the heavy chest and run he looked over his shoulder the driving rain veiled the helicopter from sight he could only hope it helped hide him from the lizards off to the south from the middle of this big open field shots cracked jager recognized the deep bark of a gewehrk the standard german infantry rifle no way to tell now of course whether it was borne by a standard german infantryman or a very definitely nonstandard russian partisanl the helicopter that had been closest to him droned off to meet the fleabite challenge i think some of the decoys just drew them away from us jager said it might be a jew saving your neck nazi how does that make you feel max said after a moment though he added in wondering tones or it might be a fucking nazi saving mine how does that make me feel you know the word verkaktў nazi this is a verkakte mess and no mistake a village maybe even a small town loomed llt if tho rain ahoart worldwar in the balance in instant unspoken agreement both men swerved wide around it whats the name of that place jager asked chernobyl i think max said the lizards drove the people out after their ship blew up but they might keep a little garrison there lets hope they dont jager said the jewish partisan nodded if the village held a garrison it didnt come forth to search for the raiders or maybe it did and simply missed jager and max in the downpour once past the clump of ugly wooden buildings and even uglier concrete ones jager glanced down at his compass to get back onto the proper course max watched him put it back in his pocket how are we going to find the fucking panje wagon we keep on this heading until we walk past them in the rain the jew put in if you have a better idea id love to hear it jager said icily i dont i was hoping you did they pushed on skirting another small patch of woods and then returning to the course the compass dictated jager had a piece of black bread and some sausage in his pack getting them out onehanded was awkward but he managed he broke the bread bit the sausage in half and passed max his share the jew hesitated but ate after a while he pulled a little tin flask from his hip pocket he yanked out the cork gave the flask to jager for the first swig vodka ran down his throat like fire thanks he said thats good he put his thumb over the opening so the rain couldnt get in passed the flask back to max off to one side somebody spoke up in russian jager started then drted the chest that had become like an unwelcome part of him and gnled for the rifle slung on his back then a german voice added ja we could use something good about now you found them max said to jager as the panje wagon came up through the muck thats fucking amazing instead of hatred he looked at jager with something like respect jager who was at least as surprised as the jewish partisan did his best not to show it the horse that pulled the panje wagon had seen better days the light wooden wagon itself rode on large wheels it was low wide and flatbottomed so it could float almost boatlike across the surface of even the deepest mud it looked as if its design hadnt changed for centuries which was probably true no vehicle was better adapted to coping with russias twiceyearly rasputitsa the driver and the fellow beside him both wore red army greatcoats but instead of a shlern a russian cloth helmet rather like a balaclava the man who wasnt holding the reins had on the longbrimmed cap of a german tropicalweight uniform the weather was anything but tropical but the cap kept the rain out of his eyes harry turtledove he said you have the cabbages yes by god we do jager said max nodded together they lifted the leadlined chest into the wagon jfiger had grown so used to the burden that his shoulder ached when he was relieved of it max handed the flask of vodka to the driver then clambered up over the side of the wagon jfiger followed him between them they almost filled the wagon bed the fellow with the shlem spoke in russian max turned it into yiddish for jager he says we wont bother with roads well head straight across country the lizards arent likely to find us that way and if they do jager asked nichevo the russian answered when max put the question to him it cant be helped since that was manifestly true jiiger just nodded the driver twitched the reins clucked to the horse the panje wagon began to roll its true yi min declared i floated through the air light as a dandelion seed in the little scaly devils airplane and it flew so high that i looked down on the whole world the apothecary conveniently forgot to mention in fact hed just about made himself forget altogether how sick hed been while he floated light as a dandelion seed and what did the world look like when you looked down on it one of his listeners asked the foreign devils are right believe it or not the world is round like a ball yi min answered i have seen it with my own eyes so i know it is so ahh some of the men said who sat crosslegged in front of him either impressed at his eyewitness account or astonished europeans could be right about anything others shook their heads disbelieving every word he said foolish turtles he thought hed had a lot of lies taken for granted in his time now that he was telling nothing but the truth half the people in the scaly devils prisoner compound made him out to be a liar in any case his audience hadnt gathered to hear him talk about the shape of the world a man in a blue cotton tunic said tell us more about the women the little scaly devils gave to you everyone believers and skeptics alike spoke up in favor of that even if yi min were to lie about it hed still be amusing the best part was he didnt need to lie i had a woman whose skin was black as charcoal all over save only the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet and i had another who was pale as milk even her nipples only pink with eyes of fine jade and hair and bush the color of a foxs fur ahh the men said again imagining it one of them asked did their strangeness make them better on the mat neither of those two was particularly skilled yi min said and his audience sighed with disappointment he quickly added still their being worldwar in the balance so different to look at was piquant like pickle after sweet if you ask me the gods first made the black folk but left them in the oven too long then they tried again but took the white folk the foreign devils most of us had seen out too soon finally they made us chinese and cooked us to perfection the men who listened to him laughed some of them clapped their hands then the fellow in the blue tunic said from what oven did the gods take the little scaly devils nervous silence fell yi min said to know that for certain you would have to ask the little devils themselves if you want to know what i think my guess is that a whole different set of gods made them why do you know they have a mating season like cattle or songbirds and are impotent all the rest of the year poor devils several men chorused the first sympathy yi min had heard for the lizards its true he insisted thats why they took me up into their airplane that never lands in the first place to see for themselves that real human beings could mate at any season of the year his smile was very nearly a leer i proved it to their satisfaction and to mine he smiled again this time happily at the grins and laughter his words won being back among people with whom he could speak back among people who appreciated his undoubted cleverness was the greatest joy in returning to the ground after so long aloft then a bald old fellow who sold eggs said didnt the little devils also kidnap that pretty girl who was living in your tent why didnt she come back with you t hey wanted to keep her up there y run answered shrugging i dont know they would not tell me what does it matter shes only a woman he was just as glad liu han remained with the scaly devils shed been a pleasant convenience to him certainly but no more than that and shed seen him sick and vulnerable while he floated without weight a weakness he was doing his best to pretend had never happened now with the prestige of his journey and the connections he retained with the little scaly devils women both prettier and more willing than liu han were happy to share his mat he sometimes wondered what the little devils were doing to her but his curiosity remained abstract bowing as he sat he said i do hope ive held your interest my friends and that youll reward me for helping you pass an idle hour the gifts the audience gave were about what hed expected a little cash a pair of old sandals that wouldnt fit him but which he could trade for something he wanted some radishes a smoked duck breast wrapped in paper and tied with string a couple of tiny pots filled with ground spices harry turtledove he lifted their lids sniffed smiled appreciatively yes hed been paid well for entertaining he gathered up his loot and walked back toward the hut in which he was living nothing was left of the tent hed shared with liu han he could not honestly say he missed it either with winter nearly at hand he was glad to have wooden walls around him of course the people in the camp had also stolen everything hed accumulated before the scaly devils took him up into the sky but so what he was already well on his way to getting more and better getting more and better of everything as far as he could see was what the world was all about from the changes in the camp while hed been flying he had to conclude just about everyone agreed with him instead of several square li of flapping canvas it now boasted houses of wood and stone and sheet metal some of them quite substantial none of the construction materials had been here when the scaly devils prisoners were herded into the wireenclosed compound but they were here now one way or another people managed sharp wire wasnt enough to keep them from managing as he came up to his own shelter yi min readied the key that he carried on a bit of string around his neck key and lock both had cost only a couple of pigs feet the smith who made them out of scrap metal was too skinny to have bargained hard yi min knew they werent very good but what did that matter the lock on his door publicly proclaimed him a man of property which was what he had in mind it wasnt supposed to keep thieves away his close connections with the little devils took care of that on about the fourth try the key clicked the lock opened and yi min went inside he started a fire in the little charcoal brazier by his sleeping mat the feeble warmth the brazier gave made him long for his old home where he slept on top of the low clay hearth and stayed snug even in the worst weather he shrugged the gods dealt the tiles in the game of life a mans job was to arrange them into the best hand he could sudden silence clamped down on chattering friends shouting husbands screeching wives even squalling children yi min instinctively understood what that meant little scaly devils close by he was already turning toward the door when the knock came he raised the inner bar regardless of connections no sense taking chances pulled the door open he bowed low ah honored ssofeg you do me great favor by honoring my humble dwelling with your presence he said in chinese then went on in the devils speech what is your will superior of mine speak and it shall be done you are dutiful ssofeg said in his own language it was polite formula and praise at the same time the scaly devils were even more punctilious than chinese about respect for superiors and elders then ssofeg worldwar in the balance switched to chinese which he used with yi min as the apothecary used the little devils language with him you have more of what i seek i have more superior of mine yi min said in the lizards speech one of the little spicepots hed received for his talk of women and other marvels was full of powdered ginger he took out a tiny pinch put it in the palm of his other hand and held it out for ssofeg the little devil flicked out his tongue for all the world like a kitten lapping from a bowl although the tongue itself so much reminded yi min of a serpents that he had to steel himself to keep from jerking away two quick licks and the ginger was gone for a couple of seconds sofeg simply stood where he was then he quivered all over and let out a long slow hiss it was the nearest approach to a mans ecstatic grunt at the moment of clouds and rain that yi min had ever heard from a little scaly devil as if hed forgotten chinese ssofeg spoke in his own language you can have no idea how fine that makes me feel no doubt you are right superior of mine yi min said he liked to get drunk he enjoyed a pipe of opium every so often too though there he was very moderate for fear of permanently blunting his drive and ambition as an apothecary hed come across and sampled a lot of other substances alleged to produce pleasure everything from hemp leaves to powdered rhinoceros horn most so far as he could tell had no effect whatever that didnt keep him from selling them but it did keep him from trying them twice but ginger as far as he was concerned ginger was just a condiment some people claimed it had aphrodisiac powers because ginger roots sometime oked like gnarled little men but it had never done anything to haryi mins lance but when ssofeg tasted it he might have died and gone to the heaven christian missionaries always talked about in glowing words the little scaly devil said give me more every time i taste the pleasure i crave it again his bifurcated tongue went out then in i will give you more superior of mine but what will you give me in return ginger is rare and expensive i have had to pay much to get even this little amount for you yi min was lying in his teeth but ssofeg didnt know that nor did the people from whom he got ginger know he was selling it to the scaly devils they would eventually figure it out of course at which point competition would cut into his profits but for now for now ssofeg let out another hiss this one redolent of distress already i have given you much very much his tailstump lashed in agitation but i must know this this delight once more here he took from around his neck something that most closely resembled the field glasses yi min had once seen a japanese officer using these see in darkness as well as light i will report them missing quick give me another taste harry turtledove i hope i will be able to get any kind of price for them yi min said peevishly in fact he wondered whether the nationalists the communists or the japanese would pay most for the new trinket he had contacts with all three the little scaly devils were naive if they thought mere wire cut a prison camp off from the world around it such decisions could wait by the way ssofeg stood swaying slightly he couldnt yi min gave him another pinch of ginger he licked it off the apothecarys palm when his pleasurefilled shiver finally stopped he said if i report much more gear as missing i shall surely be called to account yet i must have ginger what shall i do yi min had been hoping for just that question as casually as he could keeping any trace of a chortle from his voice he said i could sell you a lot of ginger now he showed ssofeg the spicepot full of it the scaly devils tailstump lashed again i must have it but how you buy it from me now yi min repeated then you keep some enough for yourself and sell the rest to other males of the race they will make up your cost and more ssofeg turned both eyes full upon the apothecary staring as if he were the buddha reincarnated i could do that couldnt i then i could pass on to you what they convey to me my own difficulties with inventory control would disappear and you would gain the wherewithal to acquire still more of this marvelous herb which i desire more with each passing day truly you are a big ugly of genius yi min the superior of mine is gracious to this humble inferior yi min said he did not smile ssofeg was a clever little devil and might notice and start asking questions better left unraised no on second thought ssofeg was unlikely to notice anything he was caught in the gloom that always seemed to seize him when gingers exhilaration wore off now he shook as if from an ague rather than with delight he moaned but how can i in good conscience expose other males of the race to this constant craving i feel myself that would not be right he stared hungrily at the spicepot full of ginger fear bubbled through yi min some opium addicts would kill to keep from being separated from their drug and ginger seemed to hit ssofeg far harder than opium did its human users the apothecary said if you take this from me now superior of mine where will you get more when you have used it all the little devil made a noise like a boiling kettle plan for tomorrow plan for next year plan for the generations yet to come he said sounding as if he were repeating a lesson learned long ago in school he resumed you are right of course thievery would in the long run prove futile what then is your price for the pot of precious herb you hold here yi min had an answer ready i want one of the picturetaking machines the race has made the ones that take pictures you can look at worldwar in the balance from all around i want also a supply of whatever it is the machine takes the pictures on he remembered how interesting the pictures the devils had taken of liu han and him were many men in the camp would pay well to watch such pictures while he could give the young men and girls who would perform in them next to nothing but ssofeg said i myself cannot get you one of these machines give me the ginger now and i will use it to find a male who has access to them and can abstract it so it will not be missed yi min laughed scornfully you called me wise before do you all at once think me a fool hard bargaining followed in the end the apothecary surrendered a quarter of the ginger to ssofeg the rest to remain with him until payment was forthcoming the little scaly devil reverently enclosed the ground spice in a transparent envelope put that envelope into one of the pouches he wore on the belt round his waist and hurried out of yi mins hut the devils gait always struck yi min as skittery but ssofegs movements seemed downright furtive well they might the apothecary thought the japanese had strict laws against selling equipment to the chinese since the little devils gear was so much better than that of the japanese it only stood to reason that their regulations would be harsher if ssofeg got caught by his peoples inspectors he would probably be in even bigger trouble than he thought well that was his lookout yi min had been certain almost from the day the scaly devils landed that they would make his fortune at first hed thought it would be as an interpreter now though ginger and with luck interesting films looked likely to prove even more profitable he wasnt fussy about how he got rich as long as he did im on my way he thought eat trickled through bobby fiores beard dripped down onto the smooth shiny surface of the mat on which he sat when he got up to walk over to the faucet his buttocks made rude squelching noises as they pulled free from the mat the water that came when he pushed a button was warmer than luke and had a faint chemical tang he made himself drink anyhow in heat like this you had to drink he wished he had some salt tablets hed spent a couple of seasons playing ball in west texas and new mexico the weather there hadnt been a lot cooler than the lizards kept their spaceship every team in that part of the country kept a bowl of salt tablets by the bat rack he thought they did some good without them how were you supposed to replace what you sweated away the door to his cubicle silently slid open a lizard brought in some rations for him and a magazine as well thank you superior of mine fiore hissed politely the lizard did not deign to reply it got out of the cubicle in a hurry the door closed behind it harry turtledove the rations as usual were earthly canned goods this time a can of pork and beans and one of stewed tomatoes fiore sighed the lizards seemed to pull cans off the shelf at random the meal before had been fruit salad and condensed milk the one before that chicken noodle soup and chocolate syrup after weeks on such fare he would have killed for a green salad fresh meat or a scrambled egg the magazine however was a treat even if it did date from when he wasnt with liu han he was here by himself and had to make his own amusement something new to look at would keep him interested for several meals the title signal even let him hope it would be in english he found out it wasnt as soon as he opened it just what the language was he couldnt tell his formal education having stopped in the tenth grade something scandinavian he guessed hed seen os with lines through them like these on minnesota shopfronts in towns where everybody seemed to be blond and blueeyed he didnt need to be able to read the signal to figure out what it was a nazi propaganda magazine here was gbbels smiling from behind his desk here were russians surrendering to men in coalscuttle helmets here were a rather beefy cabaret dancer and her soldier boyfriend here was the world that had been before the lizards came he clenched his teeth tears stung his eyes being reminded of that world also reminded him how much things had changed one thing fifteen years of playing minorleague ball had taught him was how to roll with the punches that meant eating pork and beans and stewed tomatoes when the lizards gave them to him lest his next meal be worse or fail to come at all it meant looking at the pictures in the signal when he couldnt read the words and it meant hoping he could see liu han some time soon but not letting himself get downhearted when he had to stay in his cubicle alone he was washing molasses and tomato juice off his fingers and trying to rinse his beard clean when the door opened again the lizard that had brought in the cans now carried them away fiore looked at the signal a while longer then lay down on the mat and went to sleep the lights in the cubicle never dimmed but that didnt bother him the heat gave him a harder time still he managed anyone who could sleep on a bus rattling between clovis and lubbock in the middle of july could sleep damn near anywhere hed never realized how rough life was in the bush leagues until he found all the rugged things for which it had prepared him as usual he woke slick with sweat he splashed water over himself to get some of the greasy feel off his skin for a little while as it evaporated he felt almost cool then he started sweating again at least it was worldwar in the balance dry heat he told himself had it been humid he would have cooked long since he was glancing through the signal again trying to figure out what some of the norwegian words meant when the door opened he wondered what the lizards wanted he wasnt hungry yet the pork and beans still felt like a medicine ball in his stomach but instead of a lizard with canned goods in walked liu han your mate said one of the lizards escorting her his mouth fell open fiore thought that meant he was laughing that was all right he laughed at the lizard too for not being able to mate he gave liu han a hug neither of them wore anything they stuck to each other wherever they touched how are you he said letting her go its good to see you it was good to see anyone human but he didnt say that aloud good also to see you liu han said adding the lizards emphatic cough to end the sentence they spoke to each other in a jargon they invented and expanded each time they were together oneno other two people could have followed english chinese and the lizards language pasted together to yield evergrowing meaning she said i am glad the scaly devils do not force us to mate she used the lizards word for that each time we see each other now youre glad he laughed i can only do so much he flicked his tongue against the inside of his upper lip as he blew air out through his mouth making a noise like a window shade rolling up and him with it hed done that often enough for her to understand it she smiled at his foolishness not that i dqnt like what you do when we mate again she used the lizards emotionless word which let her avoid choosing a human tewith more flavor to it but i do not like having to do it at their ordel yeah i know he said being a specimen didnt appeal to him either then he wondered what they ought to do istead besides their bodies the only thing they had in common was that the lizards had shanghaied both of them since liu han plainly didnt feel like screwing to pass the time he went through the signal with her hed decided a while ago that she was anything but stupid but he found how little she knew of the world outside the village from which shed come he couldnt read the text of the magazine but he recognized faces and places in the pictures gbbels mar shal petain paris north africa to liu han they were all strange he wondered if shed even heard of germany germany and japan are friends he told her only to discover that japan wasnt japan in chinese he tried again japan fights that in pantomime america and fights china too oh the eastern devils she exclaimed eastern devils kill my man harry turtledove my child just before little scaly devils come this germany friends with eastern devils must be bad probably he said hed been sure the germans were the bad guys when they declared war on the united states since then though hed heard they had done a better job of fighting the lizards than most did that all of a sudden turn them back into good guys he had trouble figuring out where loyalty to his own country stopped and loyalty to to his planet would it be started he wished sam yeager were around yeager was more used to thinking in terms like those he also noticed not for the first time but more strongly than ever before that anything not chinese was somehow devilish to liu han the lizards were scaly devils he himself when he wasnt bobbyfiore pronounced all as one word was a foreign devil and now the japs were eastern devils given what theyd done to her family he couldnt blame her for thinking of them like that but he was pretty sure she would have hung the same label on them no matter what he asked her about it using multilingual circumlocutions when she finally understood she nodded surprised he needed to put the question to her if you are not chinese of course you are a devil she said as if stating a law of nature thats not how it is fiore told her but she didnt look convinced then he remembered that till hed started playing ball and meeting all sorts of people instead of just the ones from his neighborhood hed been sure everybody who wasnt catholic would burn in hell forever maybe this devil business was something like that they went back to looking at the signal the highkicking nightclub dancer in her skimpy satin outfit made liu han laugh how can she show herself wearing so little she asked forgetting for the moment that she herself wore nothing fiore laughed in turn except when he stuck to the mat he often forgot he was naked too amazing what you got used to liu han pointed to an advertisement for an olympia typewriter what she said in english adding the lizard interrogative cough fiore had more trouble explaining it than hed expected after a while he figured out that she couldnt read or write hed known a few ballplayers mostly from the south who had the same trouble but it wasnt something that automatically occurred to him now he wished more than ever that the signal was in english he would have started teaching her on the spot he thought about showing her the alphabet despite crossed os and as with little circles above them the abcs didnt change much but if he didnt understand what he was reading how was she supposed to he gave it up as a bad job and turned to the next page it showed a flight of german bombers over some russian city in spite of the sweltering heat she shivered and pressed herself against him she worldwar in the balance might not know what a typewriter was for but she recognized bombers when she saw them fiore clicked his tongue between his teeth wasnt that a hell of a thing they came to the article about marshal petain fiore thought he was going to have trouble putting across what vichy france was all about the more so as he didnt understand all the details himself but as soon as he managed to convey to her that it was a german puppet state she nodded and exclaimed manchukuo thats right the japs have puppets too dont they he said puppets she had the concept but the word eluded her he resorted to pantomime again until she got the idea he hammed up his dumb show as much as he could she always enjoyed that she did smile now but only for a moment then she said the scaly devils have made puppets of us all he blinked that was as serious an idea as shed ever gotten across she was also dead right if it werent for the lizards hed be doing what the answer he arrived at brought him up short if it werent for the lizards all hed be doing was trying to keep a floundering minorleague career alive getting an offseason job and waiting for uncle sam to send him a draft notice when you stepped back and looked at it none of that was worth writing home about maybe we were already puppets before the lizards came he said harshly his voice grew softer as he added if they hadnt come i never would have known you so i guess im glad they did liu han did not answer right away her face was unreadable as she studied fiore he flinched from that quiet scrutiny wondering how badly hed just stuck his foot in his mouth he knew shed been through hard ti and it was a lot rougher for a woman to have to lie down with a strllilge man than the other way around he suddenly wondered exactly what she thought of him was he something good or simply something better than shed known in captivity before how much the answer mattered surprised him till now he hadnt asked himself what liu han meant to him either sure getting laid was fine and hed found out more about that from her than hed thought he needed to learn until the lizards brought him up here but there was more to it in spite of all the dreadful things that had happened to her she remained good people he wanted to take care of her but did she want him for anything more than an insurance policy she never did answer not in words she put her head on his chest smoothing away the hairs with her hand so they wouldnt tickle her nose his arms closed around her back he could have rolled over on top of her but it didnt cross his mind not now they held each other for a while he wondered what his mother would say if he told her he was falling in love with a chinese girl he hoped hed have the chance to find out harry turtledove then he wondered how hed say i love you to liu han he didnt know the chinese for it she didnt know the english and it was one place where the lizards language helped not at all he patted her bare shoulder one way or another hed get the idea across lhe latest storm had finally blown out of chicago leaving a fine dusting of snow on the ground the lizards stared at it in swiveleyed wonder as sam yeager marched them along toward the metallurgical laboratory he was comfortable enough in a wool sweater but they shivered in toolarge peacoats scrounged from the great lakes naval base their breath hotter than his made puffs of steam in the crisp air in spite of intermittent lizard air raids a couple of students were playing catch on the dying grass by the walk doing their best to pretend everythings normal yeager thought he envied them their determination as athletes they werent much one of them flatout missed the ball when it came to him it skidded through the slush and stopped almost at yeagers feet he set down the rifle he was still required to carry scooped up the baseball and fired it back to the student whod thrown it if the kid hacaught it it would have hit him right in the middle of the chest he stal at yeager as if to say who is this old guy yeager just grinned picked up his piece and started shepherding the lizards down the walk again ristin said you he followed it with a lizard word yeager didnt know very well as best he could yeager echoed the croaked word not understanding he added in the lizards language ristin obligingly gestured while repeating the word a light went on in yeagers head he dropped back into english oh you mean throw he made as if to throw again this time without a baseball throw ssrow ristin agreed he tried english himself you ssrow good thanks yeager said and let it go at that how was he supposed to explain to an alien that hed made a living not much of a living sometimes but hed never gone hungry because he could throw and hit a baseball if he didnt have a better arm than a couple of halfassed college kids hed better leave town harry turtledove it wasnt much warmer inside eckhart hall than it had been outside heat was as hard to come by as electricity these days army engineers did a marvelous job of repairing bomb damage but the lizards could wreck things faster than they could fix them since the elevator wasnt running yeager took ristin and ullhass up the stairs to enrico fermis office he didnt know about them but the exercise made him warmer fermi bounced up out of his chair when yeager walked the lizards through his open door so good to see you and your friends here he said effusively yeager nodded hiding a smile at the physicists heavy accent he would have bet bobby fiores father sounded the same way fermi had a glass coffeepot set up above a tin of canned heat heavy china mugs cafeteriastyle stood beside the sterno the physicist gestured for yeager to take one thank you sir yeager said he hadnt noticed little things like cigarettes and coffee until he couldnt get them whenever he wanted scarcity made them precious and besides the coffee was hot he glanced at ullhass and ristin theyd tried coffee too but found it too bitter to stand that was their tough luck he thought it cut them off from something that could heat them up from the inside out he took another sip from his cup felt his eyes opening wider coffee hit harder when you couldnt have it every day so did tobacco he remembered how barbara larssen had reacted to her first smoke in a while at fermis gesture the lizards perched themselves on a couple of chairs in front of the desk their feet barely touched the ground human furniture was too big for them yeager sat down too off to one side his springfield resting in his lap he was still on guard duty though that wasnt his chief reason for being here enrico fermi had more important things to do than learning the lizards language so yeager interpreted whenever ristin and ullhass ran out of english till the past few weeks everything he knew about nuclear physics had come from the pages of astounding if stories like blowups happen and nerves hadnt had good science in them as well as good fiction he would have been no use to fermi not because he couldnt understand the lizards but because he wouldnt have been able to understand the physicist fermi asked the lizards how long have your people known how to control and release the energy contained within the atomic nucleus yeager translated he knew he didnt do perfectly for nucleus the word he used actually meant something closer to center but the lizards understood him well enough they chattered back and forth between themselves for a few seconds before ullhass said somewhere between seventy and eighty thousand years we think ristin added thats our years of course yours are about twice as long worldwar in the balance yeager did the arithmetic in his head even after dividing by two it was still an ungodly long time if ristin and ullhass were telling the truth the lizards had known about atomic power since humanitys newest superweapon was fire against cave bears if he turned to fermi do you believe them professor let me say that i know of no reason for them to lie fermi answered he looked like the fellow youd find behind the counter of a delicatessen in half the mediumsized towns in the united states he sounded like him too until you listened to what he had to say now he went on i think if we had had this power for so long we would have accomplished more with it than they have what the lizards had done looked like plenty to yeager theyd crossed space to land on earth theyd kicked the tar out of every army theyd come up against and theyd blown berlin and washington clean off the map what did fermi want egg in his beer the physicist gave his attention back to the aliens how do you proceed in separating the useful u from the much more abundant u in one form or another hed been asking that same question since he first set eyes on the lizards as usual they left him frustrated ullhass spread his clawed hands in a very humanseeming gesture of frustration you keep pestering us about this we have told you before we are soldiers we do not know all the fine details of our technology this time fermi turned to yeager can you credit what they say not for the first time yeager wondered why the devil the experts were asking him questions all at once though he realized he too was antoof sorts an expert on the lizards that made him chuckle the only n which hed been an expert before was hitting the cutoff man he certainly hadnt been an expert at hitting a curve ball or hed have played at fields a lot fancier than the ones in the threei league he still didnt believe he had much expertise but he did know more about the lizards than most people mixing what he did know with his common sense which except for keeping him at a baseball career had always been pretty good he answered professor i think maybe i do believe them you yank a couple of privates out of the american army and they might not be able to tell you everything you want to know about how an electrical generator works fermis sigh was melodramatic s this may be so and yet i have learned a great deal from what they do know they take for granted so many things which are for us on the cutting edge of physics or beyond it just by examining what they know of course to be true we have tremendously refined our own lines of investigation this will help us a great deal when we relocate our program im glad youve yeager broke off when you what harry turtledove when we move away from here fermi said sadness filled his liquid brown eyes it will be very hard this i know but how are we to do phys ics in a city where we have not even electricity most of the day how are we to proceed when the lizards may bomb us at any time may even cap ture chicago before long the line i hear is nearly to aurora now under these circumstances what is there to do but go where will you go to yeager asked it is not yet decided we will leave the city by ship surely much the safest way to go as your little friends fermi nodded toward ullhass and ristin do not seem to have grasped the importance of travel by wa ter on this world but where we shall try to set down new roots that is still a matter for debate yeager looked at the lizards too are you going to want to take them with you he asked if the answer was yes hed have to figure out whether he should try to finagle a way to come too he supposed he should he couldnt think of any way in which hed be more useful to the war effort but he seemed to have taken fermi by surprise the physicist rubbed his chin like most mens in chicago it was poorly shaven and had a couple of nicks no new razor blades had made it into town for a long time yeager felt smug for using a straight razor which required only stropping to keep its edge that also endeared him to his sergeant who was an oldtime graduate of the cleanlinessisonestepaheadof godliness school after a moment fermi said it may well be that we shall he glanced at yeager in a lot of science fiction scientists were supposed to be so involved in research that they took no notice of the world around them yeagers little while at the university of chicago had shown him it didnt usually work that way in real life now fermi confirmed that yet again saying this affects you no this affects me yes yeager said we do not leave tomorrow or even the day after fermi said you will have time to make whatever arrangements you must ah would you like me to send a request for your services to your commanding officer this will help you with your military formalities not so professor if youd do that it would save me from a lot of red tape yeager said i will see to it to make sure he did see to it fermi jotted a note to himself his head might have been in the clouds much of the time but his feet were firmly on the ground he also shifted gears as smoothly as a chauffeur at our last session ullhass was telling what he knew of the cooling systems employed by the lizards atomic power plants perhaps he will elaborate a little more on these his poised his pencil above a fresh sheet of paper questions flew one after another worldwar in the balance finally yeager had to call time im sorry professor but ive got to take our friends here on to their next appointment si si fermi said i understand you do what you must do mr yeager you have been helpful to us here i want you to know that and know you will be very welcome to come with us as we depart to who knows where we are to depart to thank you sir that means a lot to me a proud smile stretched itself across yeagers face he gave ullhass and ristin a grateful look if it hadnt been for them hed have been reading about scientists for the rest of his life without ever meeting one let alone being useful to one he got up gestured with the rifle that had lain halfforgotten across his lap come on you two lets go time for us to be on our way one nice thing about the lizards was that unlike most people he knew they didnt give him any back talk ullhass said it shall be done superior sir and that was that they preceded him out the door hed long since been convinced that his standing orders never to let them get behind him were foolish but he obeyed anyhow army orders were like baseball fundamentals you couldnt go far wrong with them and you couldnt do anything right without them he almost bumped into andy reilly the custodian when he came out the door and he and his charges hadnt taken more than a couple of steps down the hall when someone else called hi sam he couldnt just turn around that would have put the lizards at his back so he went around behind them before he answered hi barbara what are you doing up here she smiled as she came up she wasnt skittish about ullhass and rn any more im here a lot my husband works for the met lab reer yeah you did tell me i forgot yeager wondered if barbara larssen knew how big a misnomer metallurgical laboratory was maybe maybe not secrecy about atomic energy research wasnt as tight as it had been before the lizards proved it worked but hed been warned in no uncertain terms about what would happen to him if he talked too much he didnt want a cigarette bad enough to get a blindfold with it he didnt even want to think about that he asked any word of jens no none barbara kept up a brave front but it was getting tattered worry no fear showed in her voice as she went on he should have been back weeks ago you know he was long overdue the first time you brought these little fellows into dr burketts office and if he doesnt get back soon from the way she stopped short he thought he scented the great god security he said professor fermi told me the project is going to pull out of chicago i wasnt sure if you knew and i didnt want to say too much if you harry turtledove didnt barbara answered security sure enough wouldnt it be awful if he did make it here only to find out there isnt any met lab to come back to there may not be any chicago to come back to yeager answered from what fermi said the lines just outside aurora now i hadnt heard that her lips thinned a small vertical worry line appeared between her eyes theyre getting close what will you do he asked will you go with the met lab people when they pull out i just dont know barbara said thats what i came up here to talk about as a matter of fact theyre holding a slot for me but i dont know if i should use it if i were sure jens was coming back id stay no matter what but hes been gone so long i have trouble believing that any more i try but she broke off again this time security had nothing to do with it she groped in her purse for a hanky yeager wanted to put an arm around her with the two lizards standing between them that wasnt practical even without them it probably would have been stupid shed just think he was coming on to her and shed be at least half right he didnt even tell her fermi had asked him to evacuate with the metallurgical lab staff feeling awkward and useless he said i hope he makes it back soon barbara oh god so do i her hands shaped themselves into claws her red nail polish made them look like bloody claws her face twisted god damn the lizards for coming down here and wrecking everything people have tried to do for as long as thereve been people even the bad things theyre our bad things nobody elses ullhass and ristin had picked up almost as much english as yeager had learned of their language they flinched away from barbaras fury its all right yeager told them nothings going to happen to you two he understood how barbara felt he knew much of that same rage himself but constantly being around the lizard pows had made him start thinking of them as people too sometimes almost as friends he hated the lizards collectively but not individually it got confusing barbara seemed to share some of that confusion shed gotten to the point where she could tell one of the captive lizards apart from another dont worry she said to yeagers two charges i know its not your fault in particular yes you know this ullhass said in his hissing voice but what can we do if you not know this no thing we are how you say it in your grisp grip maybe yeager answered or do you mean grasp i do not know what i mean ullhass declared it is your speech you teach we learn theyre like that yeager said to barbara trying to find less cmo worldwar in the balance tionally charged things to talk about now that theyre our prisoners its like weve become their superior officers and anything we say goes dr burkett has talked about the same thing she said nodding she ii turned back to the lizards your people are trying to take our whole world into their grasp do you wonder that we dont like you but we are the race ristin said it is our right yeager had got pretty good at reading tone in the lizards voices ristin sounded surprised barbara would question that right yeager clicked his tongue between his teeth both lizard pows swung their eyes toward him it was something he did when he wanted to get their atten tion he said youll find not everybody on this planet agrees with you about that teerts wished his ejection seat had malfunctioned better to have crashed with his aircraft than to fall into the hands of the nipponese those hands lacked the races claws but were no less cruel for that hed found out about the nipponese in a hurry even before theyd got him to harbin his illusion that they treated prisoners decently had been shattered from what hed seen of the way they treated their own kind that shouldnt have come as a surprise to him the rest of the tosevite empires were barbarous yes but their leaders had the sense to recognize that war was a risky business in which things could go wrong and that both sides were liable to lose prisoners when things did go wrong nipponese soldiers however were supposed to commit suicide before they let themselves be captured that was bad enough worse they expected their foes to play by the same set of rules and scorned captives as cowards who deserved whatever happened to them ferts looked down at himself from his neck all the down his way to groplt every rib was clearly visible the food they gave him was vile and they didnt give him very much of it he had the feeling that if they hadnt been interrogating him they might not have bothered to feed him at all the door to the little room where they kept him swung noisily open on rusty hinges a couple of armed guards came in teerts jumped to his feet and bowed to them theyd beaten him once for forgetting after that he didnt forget the officer who had brought him to harbin followed the guards into the smelly little cell teerts bowed again deeper this time the nipponese made a point of being insanely punctilious about such things teerts said good day major okamoto i hope you are well i am well okamoto did not ask how teerts was a prisoners health was beneath his notice he shifted from nipponese to the tongue of the race despite a heavy accent he was growing fluent you shall come with me at once it shall be done teerts said harry turtledove okamoto turned his back and walked out of the chamber short for a tosevite he still towered over teerts so did the nipponese guards the knives mounted on the ends of their rifles looked very long and cold and sharp they gestured with the guns for teerts to precede them he was already in motion by now captivity had become a routine like any other cold smote him when he left the building where he was imprisoned he was always chilly even inside what the tosevites called heat was arctic to the race outside the weather really was arctic with frozen water falling from the sky in feathery flakes it clung to the ground to trees to buildings coating everything with a layer of white that helped mask its inherent ugliness teerts began to shiver violently okamoto paused snapped an order to the guards one of them set down his rifle for a moment pulled a blanket out of his pack and draped it over teerts the captured pilot pulled it as tight around himself as he could slowly the shivers subsided okamoto said you lucky you important prisoner otherwise we let you freeze teerts would willingly have forgone such luck a truer measure of his importance was the vehicle that waited outside his prison to take him to his next interrogation session it was noisy and smelly and had a ride like a killercraft out of control and about to crash but at least it boasted an engine rather than a big ugly pedaling hard enough to grow warm even in this frigid weather better yet it also had an enclosed cabin one of the guards drove the other sat beside him in the front seat major okamoto sat behind the driver teerts behind the other guard okamoto did not have a rifle with a long knife on the end but he did carry both a sword and a pistol and even if teerts could somehow have overcome him what was the point how could he flee out of this teeming den of big uglies without getting caught and meeting a fate even worse than the one he was now suffering den was the right word for harbin he thought as the military vehicle made its slow way through the narrow twisting streets of harbin it was a city in size but not to his mind in design indeed it didnt seem to have a design streets ran every which way big important buildings sprawled next to appalling hovels here and there piles of rubble testified to the effectiveness of the races bombardment halfnaked big uglies labored at the piles clearing them away a brick at a time teerts thought longingly of rosspan the city back on home where hed grown up sunshine warmth cleanliness streets wide enough for traffic sidewalks wide enough for pedestrians hed taken all those things for granted till he came to tosev now by dreadful counterexample he knew how lucky hed been to enjoy them the truck rumbling along in front of teerts vehicle ran over one of the scavenger beasts that roamed the streets of harbin the animals yelp worldwar in the balance of agony pierced the deep engine rattle that was the main traffic noise in harbin the truck never slowed as the animal passed under its wheels it had somewhere important to go what did one animal matter teerts got the idea it wouldnt have paused after running over a big ugly either it could have easily enough if harbin owned any traffic rules teerts hadnt discovered them vehicles with engines pushed their way as best they could through swarms of animaldrawn wagons and carts and even thicker swarms of tosevites tosevites on foot tosevites carrying burdens on poles balanced on their shoulders tosevites riding twowheeled contraptions that looked as if they ought to fall over but never did tosevites pedaling other tosevites about in bigger contraptions or pulling them in carts as if they were beasts of burden themselves sometimes at a particularly insane intersection a nipponese with white gloves and a swagger stick would try to bring a little order into the chaos the next big ugly teerts saw obeying any of them would be the first he got the idea harbin was a peculiar kind of place even by tosevite standards which was saying a good deal nipponese troops were the most aggressively visible piece of the blend in a town near a fighting front that was not surprising what was surprising was the way they knocked around big uglies not in uniform natives who to teerts inexperienced eyes looked no different from themselves save in clothing the farther east teerts vehicle went the more he saw of another variety of big ugly pinkskinned with lightcolored brown or even yellow tufts of fluff or fur or whatever it was on top of their heads they seemed less voluble than the darker natives who made up most of the local population and went about their business with a stolid determination that impressed teerts turned to major okamoto these pale tosevites hed learned by pnful experience never to say big ugly to a big uglys face may i ask where they come from no okamoto answered at once prisoners may not spy no questions from you do you hear me obey it shall be done teerts said anxious not to anger his captor the small part of him that was not hungry and afraid insisted the big ugly was being foolish he would never escape to tell what he knew but okamoto tolerated no argument so teerts gave him none the vehicle pulled up in front of a building from which flew nipponese flags red ball on white ground several antiaircraft guns poked their noses into the sky from sandbagged installations around it when teerts was flying killercraft hed laughed at such puny opposition hed stopped laughing when the big uglies shot him down he hadnt laughed since the guards got out of the vehicle one unlocked teerts door and pulled it open then jumped back so the other could level his rifle at the pilot out they yelled together in nipponese out teerts came marvel harry turtledove ing as usual that the big uglies could find his unarmed and miserable self so dangerous he only wished they were right since they were unfortunately mistaken he let them lead him into the building the stairs did not fit his size or his gait he climbed them anyhow the interrogation chamber was on the third floor he walked in with trepidation some very unpleasant things had happened to him in there today though the three big uglies behind the desk all wore pilots wings that relieved teerts a little if these questioners were pilots theyd presumably ask him about his killercraft at least he would know the answers to their questions other interrogators had grilled him about the races landcruisers ground tactics automatic weapons even its diplomatic dealings with other tosevite empires hed pleaded ignorance and theyd punished him for it even though he told the truth as hed learned he bowe low to the interrogation team and then to major okamoto who interpreted for them they didnt bow back he gathered a prisoner forfeited the right to any gesture of respect the big ugly in the middle turned loose a torrent of barking nipponese okamoto translated colonel doi is interested in the tactics you use with your killercraft against our planes teerts bowed to the tosevite who had asked the question tactics are simple you approach the enemy as closely as you can preferably from behind and above so you are not detected then you destroy him with missiles or cannon shells doi said true this is the basis of any successful fighter run but how do you achieve it where precisely do you deploy your wing man what is his role in the attack we commonly fly in groups of three teerts answered a leader and two trailers but once in combat we fly independent missions what that is nonsense doi exclaimed teerts turned and bowed nervously to okamoto hoping to appease him please tell the colonel that while it would be nonsense for his aircraft ours are superior enough to those you tosevites fly to make my words the truth he didnt like the grunt that came from the colonel of itself one of his eye turrets swiveled to the collection of nasty tools hung on the wall behind him when the race needed to interrogate one of its own or a rabotev or a hallessi they pumped the suspected offender full of drugs and then pumped him dry no doubt physicians were hard at work developing drugs that would let them do the same for the big uglies the nipponese were more primitive and more brutal techniques to gain information by inflicting pain were lost in the mists of the races ancient history the nipponese however had proved intimately familiar with such techniques teerts suspected they could have hurt him much worldwar in the balance worse had he been one of their own kind since he was strange and valuable theyd gone easy for fear of killing him before theyd wrung out everything they wanted to know what they had done was quite ingenious enough he felt like cheering when the big ugly named doi changed the subject how do these missiles of yours continue to follow aircraft even through the most violent evasive actions two ways teerts answered some of them home on the heat from the target aircrafts engine while others use radar the nipponese translation of that took a good deal longer to say than teerts words had colonel dois answer was also lengthy and major okamoto fumbled a good deal in putting it into the language of the race what he did say sounded like a paraphrase the colonel instructs you to give us more information on this radar do you mean he doesnt know what it is teerts asked do not be insolent or you shall be punished okamoto snapped he instructs you to give us more information on radar do so the deutsche the americans and the british use it teerts said as innocently as he could when that got translated all three of his interrogators let out excited exclamations he just stood quietly waiting for the hubbub to die down he thought he hoped hed managed to imply the nipponese were barbarous even by tosevite standards eventually doi said go on prisoner speak of this device as you use it it shall be done teerts bowed granting the big ugly reluctant respect for not conceding nipponese ignorance we shoot out a beam of rays like light but of longer wavelength then detect those that reflect back frone objects they strike from these we learn distance speed altitude andearing of targets the nipponese chattered among themselves again before the one on the left directly addressed teerts okamoto translated lieutenant colonel kobayashi says you are to help our technicians build one of these radar machines i cant do that teerts blurted staring appalled at kobayashi did the big ugly have any idea what he was asking for teerts couldnt have built or even serviced a radar set with the races tools parts and instruments to expect him to do it with the garbage that passed for electronics among the tosevites was insane kobayashi spoke a few ominoussounding words they sounded even more ominous when okamoto turned them into the language of the race you refuse again teerts eyes involuntarily swung back to the instruments of pain on the wall behind him no i dont refuse i am not able he said so quickly that okamoto had to force him to repeat himself i have not harry turtledove the knowledge either of radar itself or of your forms of apparatus i am a pilot not a radar technician hont kobayashi asked okamoto that was one nipponese word teerts had learned it meant is it true he waited fearfully for the interpreters reply if okamoto thought he was lying he would likely renew his acquaintance with some of those instruments hont hai okamoto said yes it is true teerts did his best not to show his relief as he had tried not to reveal fear before kobayashi said what good is this lizard if he can only babble of marvels without being able to share them teerts took the return ride from relief to fear the nipponese kept him alive mainly because they were interested in what he could teach them if they decided they werent learning they wouldnt hesitate to dispose of him colonel doi spoke at some length teerts had no idea what he said instead of interpreting okamoto joined the discussion that came when the senior officer stopped talking it grew loud several times stubby tosevite fingers stabbed out at teerts he did his best not to flinch any one of those gestures could have meant his death all at once the antiaircraft cannon outside the tower where he was being interrogated began to roar the scream of killercraft overhead was incredibly loud and incredibly terrifying the jolting thud of bombs going off made the floor shiver as if in an earthquake if the race had targeted this hall for destruction it could kill teerts along with the nipponese how dreadful to die from the weapons of ones friends he had to admit the big ugly officers showed courage they sat unmoving while the building shook around them colonel doi looked at teerts and said something in his own language major okamoto translated the colonel says that if he joins his ancestors in the next little while he will have the happy no the pleasure that you go with him maybe dois words were intended to make teerts afraid instead they gave him one of the very few moments of pleasure hed had since his aircraft swallowed those indigestible nipponese bullets he bowed first to doi then to okamoto tell the colonel i feel exactly the same way with roles reversed too late to regret the defiant words they were already spoken okamoto turned them into nipponese instead of getting angry colonel doi leaned forward in his chair a sign of interest ignoring the dreadful racket all around he said is that so what do you believe happens to you when you die had teerts face been flexible like a tosevites he would have grinned enormously at last a question he could answer without fear of getting himself into deeper trouble he said when we are through here our spirits join those of the emperors who guided the race in the past so that we may go on serving them he didnt just believe that he was as worldwar in the balance sure of it as he was that this part of tosev would turn away from its star tonight billions of individuals of three species on three worlds shared that certainty when his remarks had been translated colonel doi made that mouthmotion of amiability the first time teerts had seen it from an interrogator the officer said we have much the same belief i shall be honored to serve my emperor in death as i have in life i wonder if the spirits of our dead war against those of your kind the notion made teerts queasy mterial tosevites were quite troublesome enough and he didnt care to think of emperors past being compelled to struggle against their spiritual counterparts then he brightened up until a handful of years before the big uglies had enjoyed no industrial technology if their barbarous spirits dared assail those of the race surely they would be smashed he did not say that to colonel doi it may be so seemed a much safer answer then he swung his eyes toward okamoto please ask the colonel if i may ask him a question that has nothing to do with spying hai doi said teerts asked do all tosevites hold the same idea about what will happen after you die even in the midst of chaos that sent the nipponese officers into gales of their barking laughter through major okamoto doi said we have as many beliefs as we have different empires maybe more that of us nipponese is the correct one however teerts bowed politely he did not presume to contradict his captors but dois answer left him unsurprised of course the big uglies were divided in opinion about the world to come the big uglies as far as he couleee were divided about everything their little makeshift empires had alllbeen fighting one another when the race came no doubt their little makeshift beliefs fought one another too then his scorn faded in an odd way the big uglies innumerable different beliefs and languages and empires might have proved a source of strength for them they competed so savagely among themselves that less effective methods fell by the wayside maybe that was why the swordswinging savages the race had expected to meet no longer inhabited tosev like any rightthinking member of the race teerts automatically assumed unity and stability desirable in and of themselves until he came to tosev hed never had any reason to assume otherwise now as if a cold breeze blew through his thoughts he wondered what price his species and the hallessi and rabotevs with them paid for their secure comfortable lives until the race came to tosev it hadnt mattered now it did even if the exalted fleetlord atvar were to pull every starship off this chilly harry turtledove mudball tomorrow the race would not be finished with the tosevites one fine day surely sooner than anyone back on home would expect starships full of fierce savage big uglies would follow where atvar had gone what did that leave the only thing that occurred to teerts was conquering the tosevites and so thoroughly integrating them into the empire that their competitiveness would be stifled for good failing that he didnt want to think about failing that the next best choice he came up with was sterilizing the planet altogether that would keep the empire safe no matter how hard it was on the big uglies all other choices looked worse bombs stopped falling the turbofans of the races killercraft faded into the distance in the streets of harbin a few nipponese still fired rifles into the air at imaginary targets it is over lieutenantcolonel kobayashi said until the next time they come back let us resume the questioning then colonel doi said he turned his face toward teerts once more his poor immobile eyes could not do the job by themselves whatever friendliness and recognition of teerts as a fellow intelligent being he had shown while discussing the nature of the world to come now vanished as abruptly as it had appeared we were speaking of radar machines i find your answer evasive and unsatisfactory if you do not prove more forthcoming you will be punished major okamoto teerts braced for what he knew was coming okamoto bowed to doi then stepped forward and slapped teerts across the muzzle just in front of his left eye turret he staggered when he regained his balance he bowed to okamoto though he would sooner have killed him please tell the colonel i will do my best to answer his question but i am ignorant of the knowledge he seeks okamoto translated that doi said ha more likely you are a liar major okamoto slapped teerts again while he desperately tried to think of something that might satisfy doi okamoto drew back his hand for yet another blow teerts began to think that being killed by bombs from the race might not have been so dreadful after all atvar said we can now take it as certain that the big uglies know enough to covet nuclear weapons of their own his voice had the dreadful finality of a physicians when telling a patient only a little time was left the assembled shiplords stirred restlessly atvar tried to think of worse news he might have given them maybe that the big uglies had exploded a nuclear weapon under one of the races landed ships of course they would have found out about that without his telling them straha said exalted fleetlord how did our security procedures fail so abominably as to permit the tosevites to raid a nuclear recovery team worldwar in the balance atvar wondered how his own security procedures had failed so abominably as to permit straha to find out just what the big uglies had done he said investigations are continuing shiplord he was also investigating how straha had learned what had happened but forbore to mention it the shiplord said forgive me exalted fleetlord but i would be grateful for somewhat more detail than you have furnished forgive me shiplord but i have difficulty in providing them before straha could come back with more sarcasm atvar went on one of the unfortunate things we have observed about the big uglies is that while we have better technology they are better soldiers than we in tactical terms we have practiced and studied war they have lived it to our cost we are discovering what a difference that makes let me give an example of this kirel said supporting the fleetlord in and around several of our positions we installed sensors that detected tosevites by sniffing out the uric acid that is one of the wastes they excrete the concentration of it in the air lets us gauge the number of big uglies in the vicinity this is adapted from standard techniques we use back on home straha said in challenging tones why do you mention it now what relevance has it to our failure its relevance is that the tosevites do not think in our standard terms kirel answered they must somehow have become aware of our sensors possibly by stumbling over one of them and learned how they functioned so straha said i assume this story has a point it does kirel assured him the tosevites began discharging their liquid wastes directly onto the sensors g usting straha said there if nowhere else atvar agreed with him having evolved on a hotter drier planet than tosev the race did not casually cast off water but passed all its excreta in neat solid form big ugly prisoners had strained the fleets plumbing systems disgusting true but also informative kirel said some of our technicians suddenly began screaming in panic that four billion tosevites were heading straight for their position by our best estimates that is about double the total population of tosev but it is also what the drenched befouled and overloaded sensors were reporting and while we reacted to these frightening data the big uglies worked mischief elsewhere is this a ploy that would have occurred to any of us straha did not answer none of the other shiplords said anything either though a few let their mouths fall open in amusement atvar thought the story was funny too in a scatological way but it also had a point he drove that point home the big uglies are ignorant but they are far from stupid within their limits they can be very dangerous they have learned harry turtledove better than to stand up to us in largescale combat but at these little pinprick raids they excel this raid was more than a pinprick straha insisted strategically yes but not tactically atvar said the big uglies also use this worlds revolting weather to good advantage they are accustomed to wet and cold even to the various forms of frozen water which occur on tosev we have to learn to deal with these case by case and they are making our education expensive straha said in my opinion this world may not be worth our settling the weather is not its only revolting feature the big uglies themselves certainly merit that description as may be atvar said the emperor has ordained that we bring tosev into the empire and so it shall be done that statement of unconditional obedience to the emperors will brought up short the shiplords who before had plainly agreed with straha atvar went on many parts of this world will suit us well and its resources which the big uglies exploit only inefficiently will be most valuable to us if this be so let us use its resources as if they were on a lifeless planet of one of our own solar systems straha said kill all the big uglies and we solve most of our problems with tosev atvar did not like the number of shiplords who looked as though they agreed with straha he said you forget one thing the colonizing fleet is already on its way behind us it will be here in less than forty years twenty turns for this planet and its commander will not thank us for presenting him with a dead world given a choice between presenting him with a dead world and a lost war wherein the big uglies learn of nuclear weapons exalted fleetlord which would you prefer straha demanded even the shiplords of his aggressive faction stirred restlessly at that such acid sarcasm was rare among the race the best way to defuse it atvar thought was to pretend not to recognize it he said shiplord i do not believe those are the only choices left to us i intend to present the commander of the colonizing fleet a planet ready for his settlers if the war went well that still remained possible even atvar though was beginning to doubt whether tosev would be as ready for the colonists as the plans back home called for conditions on the planet were too different from what the race had expected too many big uglies here with too many of their own factories and straha curse him would not shut up he said exalted fleetlord how can we claim to be winning this war conquering this world when even the little gimcrack tosevite empires which have allegedly surrendered to us continue to maintain armed resistance to our occupying forces worldwar in the balance if the sagacious shiplord has a solution to this difficulty hearing it would gladden my spirit atvar replied we continue to defend ourselves of course and to strike back against raiders as we may what else would you have us do straha was never short on opinions he said retaliate massively for every act of banditry and sabotage slay ten big uglies for every truck damaged a hundred for every soldier of the race harmed force them to respect us and eventually they will exalted fleetlord may i speak to this issue kirel asked speak atvar said i thank you exalted fleetlord straha i want you to know i formerly held a view similar to yours as you may or may not have heard i strongly advocated the destruction of the big ugly city called washington to terrify the tosevites of the united states into ceasing their resistance to us the strategy likely would have succeeded against the hallessi or rabotevs or even against the race against the tosevites it has failed traha started to interrupt kirel stuck out his tongue to stop him let me finish if you please i do not claim we have failed to cow many of the big uglies by massive shows of force but there also exists among the tosevites a strong minority impelled to ever greater resistance by such acts on our part your policy plays into the hands of these fanatics why should the big uglies be different from any civilized species straha said our scholars will be debating that for thousands of years to come as they review the records of this campaign kirel said mouths lolled open here and there among the assembled shiplords the races scholars were notoriously more sure but slow than slow but sure kirel went on i howeveck the luxury of leisure as is true of everyone here on tosev were to speculate i would say the big uglies differences go back to their peculiar i might say unique mating patterns straha made a disgusted noise always we come back to mating do the miserable big uglies think of nothing else the answer to this may be no atvar said the intense emotional bonds they form with sexual partners and with offspring make them willing to take risks any member of the race would reckon insane and also provoke them to take vengeance should partners or offspring be harmed there may even be more to it than that kirel added some of our scholars speculate that the big uglies because of the familial attachments they are accustomed to forming also are predisposed toward forming equally strong attachments to the causes of their little empires and their implausible religious systems we are in effect dealing with a species full of fanatics and fanatics by definition are not to be constrained by threats of force which would deter more rational individuals let me see if i understand you honored shiplord straha said you harry turtledove are advancing the hypothesis that tosev may never be as fully pacified as halless i and rabotev are and that the big uglies may continue suicidal resistance to us even after overall military victory is achieved you extrapolate further than i have been willing to go but the answer is basically yes kirel said unhappily atvar said let us eat the worms ahead of the soup shiplords before we can discuss ways to reduce harassment of our forces after we conquer we must first complete our conquest the truly atrocious winter weather prevailing over much of the northern hemisphere of tosev makes matters no easier for us our males should have been better trained to withstand such conditions straha said the fleetlord wished one of the fearsome tosevite snipers would draw a bead right in the middle of strahas snout all he did was complain and intrigue he didnt care for solving the problems he pointed out atvar said i might remind the shiplord that no territory within the empire closely simulates the climate of the tosevite lands wherein to our misfortune our most formidable opponents dwell several males even of strahas faction showed their agreement with that it relieved atvar a little he was coming to dread these assemblages too often he had bad news to report and news bad in ways he never would have imagined before the fleet left home hed expected his principal concern on this campaign to be how many soldiers carelessly got hurt in traffic accidents not whether the big uglies would soon be fighting him with nuclear weapons of their own hed also expected much better data from the races probes hed already resigned himself to their missing the weird technological jump the tosevites had taken after they departed that was the big uglies fault not theirs but they should have done a better job of reporting on tosevite social and sexual habits so kirels research crews wouldnt have had to start learning about them from scratch what really worried him was the thought that maybe the probes had sent accurate data back to home only to have those data ignored misinterpreted or downright disbelieved by scholars who analyzed them from a racecentered perspective if similar mistakes had been made before the conquests of the rabotevs and hallessi the race not only got by with them but didnt even notice them the subject species really werent very different from their overlords but the big uglies were and finding out how much so was proving more costly than anyone could have imagined exalted fleetlord how shall we minimize the mischief the tosevites may cause with nuclear material in their possession kirel asked i shall summarize for the shiplords new orders which will soon reach them in written form atvar answered in essence we will increase our bombardment of major urban centers in which important scientific re worldwar in the balance search is likeliest to take place let us see how well they do at such research if for instance their facilities lack electrical power horrep one of the males of strahas faction waggled his tailstump to ask to be recognized when atvar turned both eyes in his direction he said i would respectfully remind the exalted fleetlord that our own stockpiles of munitions are not so high as they might be we have used far more than we anticipated when we set out from home and our replenishment facilities have not been established here at the pace originally planned due to both commitment of our resources to the actual fighting and unexpectedly heavy damage from tosevite resistance several other males spoke up to support horrep again atvar had that unsettling mental image of expending his last round of ammunition only to see one more big ugly landcruiser crawl out from behind a pile of rubble do you say you cannot obey the forthcoming order he demanded no exalted fleetlord it shall be done horrep answered but i must warn you that such a program cannot be sustained indefinitely i very much hope the results it achieves will be in proportion to the munitions it expends so do i atvar thought he thanked the forethoughtful spirits of emperors past that the race had brought far more weapons of war to tosev than would have been necessary to conquer the semisavages theyd expected to find here if his people had done things hastily they might have walked headlong into ignominious defeat on the other hand if the race had been hasty and come to tosev a few hundred years sooner the big uglies would have been much easier prey because they wouldnt have had the time to develop their own technolo did that mean haste would have been advisable here the harder onoked at a complicated question the more complicated it generally becme the fleetlord reluctantly decided to scrap for the time being another part of the order hed intended to issue hed wanted to command increased efforts against the boats on which the big uglies lavished so much effort and ingenuity because tosev had so much water the locals made much more use of it than any species within the empire atvar had the feeling they used water transport enough to make suppressing it worthwhile for the race but with munitions in shorter supply than he would have liked hed have to preserve as much as he could for targets of the highest priority he sighed back on home the aptitude tests had said he might make a successful architect as well as a soldier the choice had been his hed always been an idealist eager to serve the emperor and the race as fully as possible only when confronted with the unending morass of the conquest of tosev had he seriously started wondering whether he wouldnt have been happier putting up buildings after all harry turtledove he sighed again that choice was dead for him now he had to do the best he could with the one hed made he said shiplords i know this meeting has been imperfectly satisfying the big uglies have shown a revolting knack for making everything we do appear unsatisfactory before i dismiss you back to your commands has any of you anything further to note more often than not the formal question went unanswered this time however a male named relek signaled for recognition when atvar acknowledged him he said exalted fleetlord my vessel the th emperor osjess is grounded in the eastern part of tosev s main continental mass in the big ugly empire called china lately a fair number of males have made themselves unfit for duty due to excessive consumption of some local herb which apparently has a stimulant and addictive effect on them my ship is based in the center of that continental mass and ive had the same experience with a handful of my troopers said another shiplord this one called tetter i thought i was the only shiplord so affected you are not said mozzten a shiplord whose vessel was based in the usa portion of the smaller continental mass atvar took notice of that mozzten went on the big ugly name a big ugly name i should say for the herb is ginger its effects on the males in my command have been deleterious i shall issue a general order condemning this herb in no uncertain terms atvar declared to add to its effectiveness i would have each shiplord especially you three who have indicated a problem issue his own order forbidding the individuals under his jurisdiction from having anything to do with this ginger was that the name i heard it shall be done the shiplords chorused excellent atvar said theres one problem settled at least the mechanic spread his thickfingered greasy hands shook his head helplessly i am very sorry comrade pilot he said but i cannot find the cause of the trouble as best i can tell the devils grandmother has set up shop in your engine move out of the way then and i will see for myself ludmila gorbunova snapped she wanted to kick some sense into the stupid muzhik but both his head and his arse were probably hard enough to break her foot she wished she still had her old mechanic unlike this oaf katya kuznetsova had actually understood engines and gone after problems instead of babbling about the devil and his stupid relatives it wasnt as if the little fivecylinder shvetsov radial was the most complicated piece of machinery ever built either it was about as simple as an engine could be and still work and as reliable as anything that didnt walk on all fours worldwar in the balance as soon as she got a good look at the engine she became certain this idiot mechanic walked on all fours she reached up asked do you think this loose sparkplug wire might have something to do with the aircrafts poor performance of late as she spoke she connected the wire firmly the mechanics head bobbed up and down as if on a string da comrade pilot very likely it could she wheeled on him why didnt you see it then she shouted shrilly she wished she were a man she wanted to bellow like a bull im sorry comrade pilot the mechanics voice was humble as if she were a priest who had caught him at some sordid little sin i am trying i do the best i can with that ludmilas rage evaporated she knew the fellow was telling the truth the trouble was his best just wasnt good enough the soviet unions pool of skilled manpower had never been big enough to meet the countrys needs the purges of the s hadnt helped either sometimes simply knowing something was enough to make one an object of suspicion then the germans came and after them the lizards ludmila supposed it was a miracle any reliable technicians were left alive if any were she knew she hadnt seen one lately she said we have here manuals for the kukuruznik and its engine study them carefully so we wont have this kind of problem any more da comrade pilot the mechanics head bobbed up and down again ludmila was dully certain they wouldnt have this kind of problem any less either she wondered if the mechanic could read the manuals before the war hed probably been a tinker or a blacksmith at a kolkhoz good enough at patching a pot or hammering out a new blade for a shovel whatever hed been he was hopelessly out of his depth when it came to engi the best you can she told him and left the shelter of the us enclosure it had been cold in there away from the heaped banks of earth that shielded from blast away from the roof of camouflage netting covered over with dead grass the wind bit with full force driving sleet into her face she was glad for her flying clothes of fur and leather and thick cotton padding for the oversized felt ualenki that kept her feet from freezing now that winter was here she seldom took anything off the ualenki acted almost like snowshoes spreading her weight as she squelched along the muddy edge of the equally muddy landing strip only the slushfilled ruts from her plane and others distinguished the runway from any other part of the steppe even more than most soviet aircraft the kukuruznik was made to operate from landing fields that were fields in truth her head came up her right hand went to the pistol she wore on her hip someone not part of the battered red air force detachment was harry turtledove trudging across the airstrip very likely without realizing it was one a red army man maybe he had a rifle slung across his back no not a red army man he wasnt dressed warmly enough and the cut of his clothes was wrong ludmila needed only a moment to recognize the nature of the wrongness shed seen it enough germanski she yelled half to call to the fellow half to warn the rest of the russians on the little base the german spun grabbed for his rifle flopped down on his belly in the mud a combat veteran ludmila thought unsurprised most of the german soldiers still alive in the soviet union were the ones with reactions honed by battle this one was also smart enough not to start blazing away before he knew what hed walked into even if his thick red whiskers gave him the look of a bandit ludmila frowned shed seen whiskers like those before on the kolkhoz thats right she thought what had the fellows name been schultz she murmured to herself then she shouted it going on in german is that you ja who are you the redbearded man yelled back like her he needed a few seconds to make the connection when he did he exclaimed youre the pilot right as it had back at the collective farm the word sounded exotic with a feminine ending tacked onto it she waved for him to approach he got to his feet though he didnt resling his rifle he didnt point it at her either he was grimy and ragged and looked cold if not quite the pathetic winter fritz of soviet propaganda still a long way from the deadlydangerous figure hed seemed back in the summer shed forgotten how tall he was he was skinnier than he had been too which further exaggerated his height he asked what are you doing here out in the middle of nowhere this isnt nowhere this is an airfield she answered he looked around there wasnt much to see he grinned impudently you ivans really know how to camouflage things she let that pass she wasnt sure whether it was a compliment or he was saying there wasnt anything here worth hiding she said i didnt expect to see you again i thought you and your major were on your way to moscow as she spoke she saw out of the corner of her eye that several pilots and mechamcs had come out of their shelters and were watching her talk with the german they all carried guns no one who had fought the nazis was inclined to trust them not even now when the soviet union and germany both faced the same foe we were there schultz agreed he saw the russians too his eyes were never still not even for a second he scanned everything around him all the time he unobtrusively shifted his feet so ludmila stood between him and most of her countrymen with a wry smile he went on your worldwar in the balance people decided theyd rather have us go out and work for a living than sit around eating their kasha and borscht so we did and here i am here you are she said nodding where is the major he was alive last i saw him schultz answered we got separated it was part of the operation i hope hes all right yes ludmila said she still kept the letter jager had sent her shed thought about answering but hadnt done it not only did she have no idea how to address a reply but writing to a german would make another suspicious mark go down in her dossier shed never seen that dossier she never would unless charges were brought against her but it felt as real as the sheepskin collar of her flying jacket schultz said anything to eat here after what ive been stealing lately even kasha and borscht would seem mighty fine we havent much for ourselves ludmila answered she didnt mind feeding schultz once or twice but she didnt want to turn him into a parasite either then she had a new thought how good a mechanic are you pretty good he said not arrogant but confident enough i had to help keep my panzer running after all do you think you could work on an aircraft engine he pursed his lips i dont know i never tried do you have the manuals for it yes theyre in russian though ludmila switched to her own language you didnt know any back at the kolkhoz do you understand it better now da a little schultz answered in russian his accent not too scurrilous but he dropped back into german with every sign of relief i still ca nad it worth a damn though but numbers dont change and i can makense out of pictures let me see what you have all right ludmila led him back toward the u shed just left members of the ground crew watched with hard mistrustful stares as she approached some of that mistrust was aimed at ludmila for having anything to do with a german she thought about her dossier again but she said i think he can help us he knows engines ah everyone said almost in unison ludmila didnt care for that much more than she liked the mistrustful stares along with hating and fearing germans too many russians were in the habit of attributing nearly magical abilities to them just because they came from the west she hoped she knew better they were good soldiers yes but they werent supermen when georg schultz saw the kukuruznik he rocked back on his heels and started to laugh youre still flying these little bastards are you what about it ludmila said hotly hed have done better to insult her family than her beloved u harry turtledove but the panzer man answered we hated these stupid things every time i had to go out and take a dump i figured one of em would fly by and shoot my ass off i swear they could stand on tiptoe and peek in through a window and i bet the lizards dont like em one bit bettern we did ludmila translated that into russian as if by magic the ground crews hostility melted hands fell away from weapons somebody dug out a pouch of makhorka and passed it to schultz he had some old newspaper in an inside pocket that hadnt got wet when hed rolled himself a cigarette a russian gave him a light he shielded it with one hand from the drips that splattered down off the camouflage netting walked around so he could get a good look at the engine and twobladed wooden prop on the nose of the wheatcutter when he turned around he wore a disbelieving grin it really flies it really flies ludmila agreed gravely hiding her own smile she said it again in her own language a couple of the mechanics laughed out loud she returned to german do you think you can help keep it flying why not he said it doesnt look near as bad as keeping a panzer going and if that engine were any simpler youd run it off a rubber band like a kids toy hmm ludmila said not sure she cared for the comparison the little shvetsov was made to be rugged as a mule but surely that was something to be proud of not to scorn she pointed to schultz turn your back jawohl he clicked his heels as if she were a field marshal in redstriped trousers and performed a smart aboutturn she gestured for a couple of russians to stand behind him so he couldnt see what she was doing then loosened the sparkplug wire shed noticed and her alleged mechanic hadnt you can turn back now find out whats wrong with the machine schultz walked over to the u inspected the engine for perhaps fifteen seconds and fixed the wire ludmila had tampered with his smile seemed to say why dont you ask me a hard one next time the mechanic who had failed to find the same defect glared at the german as if suspecting the devils grandmother had somehow migrated from the shvetsov to him this man will be useful on this base ludmila said her eyes dared the ground crew to argue with her none of the men said anything though several looked ready to burst with what they werent saying the german panzer sergeant seemed at least as bemused as his soviet counterparts first i fight alongside a bunch of jewish partisans and now im joining the red air force he said maybe more to himself than to ludmila i hope to god none of this ever shows up in my file so the nazis worried about dossiers too the thought gave ludmila worldwar in the balance something in common with schultz though it wasnt one shed be able to share with him somehow that didnt matter either they both knew what was safe to talk about and what wasnt schultz also knew what the hostile looks he was getting meant he undid his canteen tossed it to the mechanic who was glaring hardest vodka russki vodka he said in his pidgin russian he smacked his lips ochen khorosho the startled groundcrew man undid the stopper sniffed then grinned and enfolded schultz in a bear hug that was clever ludmila said as the ground crew passed the flask from one eager hand to the next a moment later she added your major jager would have approved do you think so shed found the right praise with which to reach him his long bony face glowed as if he were a small boy whod just been told hed written his schools prize essay for the year he went on the major miss i think hes one hell of a man yes ludmila said and realized she and schultz might have something else in common after all bicycling across ohio indiana and illinois to chicago had seemed a good idea when jens larssen set about it in summer in a country that had never known invasion it might even have been a good idea in winter pedaling through territory largely occupied by the lizards it looked stupider with every passing moment hed seen newsreel footage of halffrozen german soldiers captured by the russians in front of moscow the russians in their white snow suits many of them on skis had looked capable of going anywhere any time that was how jens had thought he would do if hed really thought about it at all instead he feared he much more closely resembled one of those nazi ice cubes with legs he didnt have the clothes he needed for staying out in the open when the temperature dropped below freezing and stayed there hed done his best to remedy that by piling on several layers at a time but his best still left him shivering the other thing he hadnt thought about was that nobody was plowing or even salting the roads this winter in a car he would have done all right a car was heavy a car was fast best of all his plymouth had had a heater but drifted snow brought a bicycle to a halt as for ice hed fallen more times than he could count only dumb luck had kept him from breaking an arm or an ankle or maybe god really did have a soft spot in his heart for drunks children and damn fools jens looked at a map hed filched from an abandoned gas station if he was where he thought he was hed soon be approaching the grand metropolis of flat by god indiana he managed a smile when he saw that and declaimed and god said flat indiana and there was indiana his breath puffed out around him in a cloud of halffrozen fog a couple of times on really frigid days hed had it freeze in the mustache and beard he was growing he hadnt seen himself in a mirror any time lately so he didnt know what he looked like he didnt care either hed decided scrounging for razor blades was a waste of time and shaving without ei worldwar in the balance there mirror or hot water hurt too much to be worthwhile besides the new growth helped keep cheeks and chin warm he wished he could sprout fur all over as he had on most of his journey he owned the road cars and trucks just werent moving especially not in this lizardoccupied stretch of country trains werent moving much either and the few hed seen had lizards aboard hed wished for a white snow suit of his own to keep from drawing their notice but the aliens hadnt paid any attention to him as they chugged by he supposed that was one advantage to having been invaded by creatures from another planet as opposed to say nazis or japs the lizards didnt have a feel for what was normal on earth a gestapo man spotting a lone figure pedaling down a road might well have wondered what he was up to and radioed an order to pick him up for questions to the lizards he was just part of the landscape he rolled past a burnedout farmhouse and the twisted wreckage of a couple of cars snow covered but did not erase the scars of bomb craters in the fields there had been fighting here not so long ago jens wondered how far west into indiana the lizards control reached and how hard crossing back into americanheld territory would be down deep he wondered if chicago was still free if barbara was still alive if this whole frozen trek wasnt for nothing he seldom let those thoughts rise to the surface of his mind whenever he did the urge to keep going faltered he peered ahead shielding his eyes against snow glare with the pahn of his hand yes those were houses up there either flat or if hed botched his navigation some other equally unimpressive little hamlet to one side of the road he saw little dark figures moving against the lttesplashed background hunters he thought in hard times anything you could add to your larder was all to the good a deer might mean the difference between starving and getting through the winter he was not a great outdoorsman but one good glance at how the dark figures moved warned him his first hasty thought was wrong hunters at least of the human variety did not walk like that it was some sort of lizard patrol and worse luck theyd seen him too they broke off whatever they were doing and came toward the road he thought about diving off his bike and running away from them but no surer way to get himself shot came to mind better to assume the air of an innocent traveler out and about one of the lizards waved to him he waved back then stopped his bicycle and waited for them to come up the closer they got the more motley and miserable they looked that struck him as somehow wrong bugeyed monsters werent supposed to have troubles of their own at least they never did in the buck rogers and flash gordon serials harry turtledove but a couple of the lizards were tricked out in their own kinds shiny coldweather gear while the rest had draped themselves with a rummage sales worth of stolen human coats mufflers hats snow pants and boots they looked like sad little tramps and they also looked frozen in spite of everything they had on they were in fact so many winter fritzes in the scaly flesh the one who had waved led the squad out onto the roadway which was hardly less snowcovered than the surrounding fields who you he asked larssen in english his exhaled breath steamed around him my name is pete smith jens answered hed been questioned by lizard patrols before and never gave his real name on the off chance that theyd somehow compiled a list of nuclear physicists he didnt give the same alias twice either what you do pete ssmith why you out the lizard turned the first sound in larssens assumed surname into a long hiss and pronounced the th at the end as a cockneys if im going to visit my cousins they live a little past montpelier jens said naming the small town just west of flat on his map you not cold the lizard said not cold on that that thing hed evidently forgotten the word bicycle of course im cold larssen answered he had the feeling the lizard would have shot him if hed dared deny it hoping he sounded properly indignant he went on have to go by bike if i want to go though dont have any gas for my car that was true for everybody these days he didnt mention that his dead car was back in eastern ohio the lizards sounded like steam engines as they talked among themselves the one whod been questioning larssen said you come with us we ask you more things he gestured with his gun to make sure jens got the point i dont want to do that larssen exclaimed which was true for both his pete smith persona and his very own self if the lizards did any serious questioning eyd find out he didnt know much about his alleged cousins west of montpelier they might even find out he didnt have any cousins west of montpelier and if they found that out theyd likely start serious digging about who he really was and why he was bik doing some ing across eastern indiana not care what you want the lizard said you come with us or you stay he brought the rifle up to point straight at the middle of larssens chest the message was clear if he stayed here hed stay forever the lizard spoke in his own language maybe translating for his friends what hed told jens their mouths fell open larssen had seen that before often enough to figure out what it meant they were laughing at him ill come he said as he had to the lizards formed up on either side of his bicycle and escorted him into flat worldwar in the balance the town wasnt even a wide spot on highway just a few houses a general store an esso station and a church along the side of the road the store was probably the main reason the town existed a couple of children ran shouting across the empty pavement of the highway pelting each other with snowballs they didnt even look up when the lizards went past by now they were used to them kids adapt fast larssen thought he wished he did the lizards had turned the general store into their headquarters a razorwire fence ringed the building to keep anyone from getting too close a portable pillbox sat in front of the store larssen wouldnt have envied a human on duty in there it had to seem even chillier for one of the invaders a blast of heat hit him in the face when the lizards opened the stores front door he went from too cold to too hot in the space of a few seconds sweat glands hed thought dormant till summer suddenly returned to life in his wool hat overcoat and sweater he felt like a main dish in a covered kettle that had just been moved from the icebox to the oven ahh the lizards all said it together as one they stripped off their layers of insulation and drank in the heat they loved so well they did not object when larssen shed his own coat and hat and a moment later his sweater even in shirt and trousers he was too warm but while the lizards took nudity in stride the last time hed been naked in public was at a swimming hole when he was thirteen years old he left the rest of his clothes on the lizard who spoke english led him to a chair then sat down across a table from him the alien reached forward and poked a knob on a small lizardy gadget that lay on the table behind a small transparent window song inside the machine began to spin jens wondered what it was for who you the lizard asked as if seeing him for the first time he repeated his pete smith alias what you do the alien said and he gave back his story about the mythical cousins west of montpelier the lizard picked up another contraption and spoke into it larssen jumped when the contraption hissed back the lizard spoke again he and the machine talked back and forth for a couple of minutes in fact larssen thought at first that it was some kind of funnylooking radio or telephone but the more the lizard used it the more he got the feeling the device itself was doing the talking he wondered what it was saying especially when it spoke his name the lizard turned one of its turreted eyes toward him we have of you no record pete smith it might have been pronouncing sentence how you explain this well uh sir uh what is your name i am gnik the lizard said you call me superior sir harry turtledove well superior sir gnik i guess the reason you dont have any record of me is that till now ive just stayed on my own little farm and not bothered anybody if id known id run into you id have stayed there longer too that was the best excuse larssen could come up with on the spur of the moment he wiped his forehead with a sleeve it could be gnik said neutrally these cousins of you who what they are theyre my fathers brothers son and his wife his name is olaf smith hers is barbara they have two children martin and josephine by naming the imaginary cousins whats the square root of minus one cousin flashed across his mind after his father wife brother and sister he hoped hed be able to remember who they were gnik talked to his gadget again listened while it talked back no record of these big uglies he said and larssen thought he was doomed then the lizard went on not have all records yet and he breathed again one day soon put in machine here gnik tapped the talking box with a clawed forefinger what is that thing anyway larssen asked hoping to get the lizard to stop asking him questions about relatives he didnt have but gnik though too short for basketball and too little for football was too smart to go for a fake you not ask questions at i i ask questions at you lizards didnt have much in the way of facial expressions but what gnik had larssen didnt like you ask questions at me to spy out secrets of race yes yes jens thought though he didnt think coming out and admitting it would be the smartest thing hed ever done he didnt have to fake a stammer as he answered i dont know anything about your secrets and i dont want to know anything about them i just never saw a box that talked back to somebody before thats all yes you big uglies are primitive gnik pronounced the threesyllable english word with obvious relish larssen guessed hed learned it so he could score points off uppity humans he was still suspicious too maybe you find this things out pass on to other sneaky big uglies eh i dont know anything about sneaky big uglies i mean people larssen said noticing that the lizards had as unflattering a nickname for human beings as humans did for their kind i just want to go see my cousins thats all now he wanted gnik to ask questions about olaf and his nonexistent family that suddenly seemed safer than being grilled about spies who might very well be real gnik said we see more about this pete smith you not leave town called flat now we keep your travel thing here he still couldnt remember how to say bicycle ask more questions to you later larssen started to exclaim you cant do that he opened his mouth but shut it again in a hurry gnik damn well could do that and if he didnt worldwar in the balance care for the cut of jens jib he could reslice it and jens into a shape that better pleased his fancy losing a bicycle was the least of his worries no that wasnt so along with the bike he was also losing precious time how long would he take to hike across indiana in the dead of winter how long before another lizard patrol picked him up and started asking unanswerable questions not long he feared he wanted to ask gnik where the lizardhuman frontier through indiana ran but didnt think it wise for all he knew the invaders had conquered the whole state by now and even if they hadnt gnik almost certainly wouldnt answer and almost certainly would get even more suspicious he couldnt fail to make some kind of protest though not if he wanted to keep his selfrespect so he said i dont think you ought to take my bicycle when i havent done anything to you you say this i not know this gnik retorted you put on now your warm things we take you to other big uglies we keep here putting on sweater overcoat and hat in the sweltering general store and then going outside reminded jens of the runs from steam room to snow hed shared with his grandfather when he was a kid the only thing missing was his father standing out there to whack him with birch twigs the lizards didnt seem invigorated when they left the store they just seemed cold they took him over to the church lizard guards stood outside it when they opened the closed door he found it was heated to a more humanly tolerable level he also found gnik was using it as a holding pen for people who came through or near flat people sat up on the pews turned around to look him over and started talking both at him and among themselves look another poor su what did they get him for what did they get you for stran ger sstay here one of the lizards said to jens his words accented almost past comprehension then he left the church as the door swung shut larssen saw him and his companion racing back toward the general store and what they thought of as a decent temperature what did they get you for stranger repeated the woman whod asked the question before she was a brassy blonde not far from jens age she might have been pretty if her hair hadnt been a snaky mess and if she didnt look as if shed been wearing the same clothes for quite a while everybody in the church had that same grubby look the faces that turned toward larssen were mostly clean but a strong almost barnyard odor in the air said no one had bathed lately he was sure he contributed to that odor he hadnt seen a bar of lifebuoy for a while himself without hot water baths in winter were more likely to be next to pneumonia than to godliness harry turtledove he said hello folks i dont know just what they got me for i dont think they know either one of their patrols spotted me on my bicycle and pulled me in so they could ask me questions now they dont want to let me go sounds like the little bastards the woman said she wore no lipstick but as if to make up for it had rouged her cheeks almost bloodred her words touched off a torrent of abuse from the other involuntary churchgoers id like to squeeze their skinny necks till those horrible eyes of theirs pop said a man with a scraggly reddish beard put em in a cage and feed em flies suggested a skinny swarthy grayhaired woman i wouldnt mind if they bombed us off the face of the earth here so long as the lizards went with us added a stout redfaced fellow the scaly sons of bitches wont even let us go out to scrounge around for cigarettes larssen missed his nicotine fix too but redface sounded as though hed forgive the lizards anything up to and including bombing washington if theyd only let him have a smoke that struck jens as excessive he gave his pete smith alias and was bombarded with the others names he wasnt especially good at matching faces and monickers and needed a while to remember that the grayhaired woman was marie and the bleached blonde sal that the fellow with the red beard was gordon and the man with the red face rodney then there were also fred and louella and mort and ron and aloysius and henrietta to keep straight hey we still have pews to spare rodney said make yourself at home pete looking around larssen saw people had made nests of whatever clothes they werent wearing sleeping wrapped in an overcoat on a hard pew did not strike him as making himself at home but what choice had he he asked wheres the mens room everyone laughed sal said aint no such thing or powder room neither no running water see weve got what do you call em slop buckets aloysius said he wore a farmers denim overalls by the matteroffact way he spoke he was more than familiar with such appurtenances of rural life the buckets were set in a hall behind a door which stayed sensibly closed larssen did what he had to do and got out of there as fast as he could my father grew up with a twoseater he said i never thought id have to go back to one wish it was a twoseater aloysius said dang sight easier on my backside than squattin over one o them buckets what do you folks what do we i mean do to pass the time here jens asked cuss the lizards sal answered promptly which brought a chorus of worldwar in the balance loud profane agreement tell lies she batted her eyes at him i can make like i was in hollywood so good i almost believe it myself he found that more pathetic than alluring and wondered how long shed been cooped up here gordon said ive got a deck of cards but pokers no damn good without real money ive won a million dollars three or four times and thrown it away again on nothing better than a pair of sevens do we have four for bridge larssen was an avid contract player you dont need to have money to enjoy bridge i know how to play gordon admitted i think pokers a better game though a couple of other people also said they played at first jens was as close to ecstatic as a prisoner could be study and work had never left him as much time for cards as he would have liked now he could play to his hearts content without feeling guilty but the men and women who didnt know bridge looked so glum that his enthusiasm faded was it really fair for some people to enjoy themselves when others couldnt the church door opened a tall thin woman with her hair pulled back in a tight bun and her face set in disapproving lines put down a box of canned goods heres your supper she said each word clipped as precisely as if by scissors without waiting for an answer she turned and walked out slamming the door behind her whats eating her larssen said eatings the word sal tossed her head in fine contempt she says were eating the people who live in this miserable little town out of house and home as if we asked to get stuck here you notice were eating out of tin cans rodney added his features daing even more with anger nothing but farms around here but thejave all the good fresh food for themselves we havent seen any of it anyhow thats for sure there werent enough spoons to go around the town woman either hadnt noticed or hadnt cared that the church held a new arrival jens ate with somebody elses washed in cold water and dried on a trouser leg even though hed given up on hygiene since leaving white sulphur springs that was a new low as he chewed on tasteless beef stew he worried what if anything chicago was eating these days rather more to the point he worried about barbara flat had at the outside a couple of hundred people for the surrounding countryside to feed chicago had three million and was under lizard attack not safely under the lizards thumb he wished hed never left for washington hed thought he was going into the worse danger himself not leaving his wife behind to face it like most americans under the age of ninety hed thought of war as something harry turtledove that happened only to unfortunate people in faroff lands he hadnt thought through all the implications of its coming home to roost something strange happened as he was getting to the bottom of the can of stew a lizard skittered into the church peered down into the box of food the grimfaced woman had brought the alien looked up in obvious disappointment hissed something that could equally well have been english or its own language whatever it was larssen didnt understand it the people whod been stuck in church longer did sorry marie said no crabapples in this batch the lizard let out a desolate hiss and slunk away crabapples larssen asked what does a lizard want with crabapples to eat em sal said you know the spiced ones in jars the ones that go so nice with a big ham at christmas time the lizards are crazy about em theyd give you the shirt off their backs for a crabapple except they mostly dont wear shirts but you know what i mean i guess so larssen said crabapples isnt that a hell of a thing gingersnaps too gordon put in i saw a couple of em damn near get into a fight one time over a box of gingersnaps marie said they look a little like gingerbread men dont they theyre not all that far from the right color and the paint they wear could do for icing dont you think it was without a doubt the first time a baptist church had ever resounded to the strains of run run as fast as you can you cant catch me im the gingerbread man laughing and cheering one another on the prisoners made up verses of their own some were funny some were obscene some the best ones were both jens flogged his muse sang ive blown up your cities and ive shot up your roads and i can take your crabapples too i can he knew it wasnt very good but the chorus roared out run run as fast as you can you cant catch me im the gingerbread man when at last they ran out of verses sal said i hope that sour old prune who brings us our food is listening course she probably thinks having a good time is sinful especially in church if she had her way the lizards would shoot us for having a good time in here mort said sal chuckled one thing is the lizards dont pay no more attention to what she wants than we do other thing is she dont know what all goes on in here neither got to make our own fun aloysius agreed aint nobody gonna do it for us never thought how much i liked my radio till i didnt have it no more worldwar in the balance iii thats true thats a fact several people said together as if they were echoing a preachers amens the short winter day wore on darkness poured through the windows and seemed to puddle in the church rodney walked over to the box the local woman had brought god damn her he said loudly she was sup posed to bring us more candles have to do without marie said no use complaining about it well get by as long as we dont run out of coal for the furnace and if we do aloysius said well be frozen hard enough that we wont start to stink till they got around to buryin us that cheerful thought pretty well halted conversation sitting huddled in his overcoat in the darkness larssen thought how important the dis covery of fire had been not just because it heated neanderthal mans caves but because it lit them as well a man with a torch could go out at mid night unafraid knowing it would show him any lurking danger and elec tricity had all but banished night altogether now the ageold fears proved not dead but merely sleeping ready to rouse whenever precious light was lost he shook his head the best way he could think of to fight the night terrors was to sleep through them sleep was what dayloving animals did in the dark stay cozy and quiet so nothing dangerous could find them he stretched out on the hard pew it wouldnt be easy after a long spell of tossing and turning and twisting and once al most rolling onto the floor he managed at last to fall asleep when he woke he almost fell off the pew again before he remembered where he was he looked at his wrist the luminous dial on his watch said it was half past one tyinside of the church was absolutely dark it was not however ab solu quiet he needed a few seconds to identify the noises floating up from a few rows behind him when he did he was surprised his ears didnt glow brighter than his watch people had no business doing that in church he started to sit up and see who was screwing on the pews but paused before hed even leaned onto one elbow for one thing it was too dark for him to tell anyway and was it any of his business his first shock had sprung straight from the heart of his upper midwestern lutheran upbringing but when he thought about it a little he wondered how long most of these people had been cooped up together and where else they were supposed to go if they wanted to make love he lay back down but sleep would not return the whispered gasps and moans and endearments the small creaking of the pew itself shouldnt have been enough to keep him awake they werent not really not by themselves listening to them though smote him with the realization of how long it had been since hed slept with barbara he hadnt even looked at another woman in his erratic journey back harry turtledove and forth across the eastern half of the united states pedaling a bicycle a good many hours a day he thought wryly was liable to take the edge off other physical urges besides it was cold but if just then sal or one of the other women in here had murmured a suggestion to him he knew he would have pulled his pants down without a moments hesitation then he wondered what barbara was doing about such matters hed been gone a long time a lot longer than hed thought when he set out in the late lamented plymouth she might think he was dead for that matter she might be dead herself but his mind refused to dwell on that hed never imagined he needed to worry about whether shed stay faithful but then hed never thought he needed to worry about whether he would either the middle of the night on a cold hard pew was hardly the time or place for such thoughts that didnt keep him from having them it did keep him from going back to sleep for a long long time so zolraag said moishe russie knew the lizards accent was the main thing that stretched the word into a hiss but the knowledge didnt make it sound any less menacing the governor went on so herr russie you will no longer for us speak on the radio this is your measure of what is the deutsch word gratitude is that it gratitude is the word yes excellency russie said sighing hed known this day was coming now it had arrived excellency not a jew in warsaw is ungrateful that the race delivered us from the germans had you not come when you did there might be no jews left in warsaw so i have said on the radio for your benefit so much i would say again the lizards had shown him the extermination camp at treblinka theyd shown him the much bigger one at owiecim the germans called it auschwitz which had just been starting up when they came both places were worse than anything hed imagined in his worst nightmares pogroms malignant neglect those were standard tools in the antisemites kit but murder factories his stomach twisted whenever he thought of them zolraag said if you are gratitudeful we expect you to show this in ways of usefulness to us i thought i was your friend not your slave russie answered if all you want of me is to repeat the words you say better you should find a parrot there must be one or two left in warsaw his defiance would have been more impressive even to himself if he hadnt had to go back and explain to zolraag what a parrot was the lizard governor took a while to get the whole idea one of these animals then would speak our message in your words this could be done he sounded astonished maybe home didnt have any animals that could learn to talk he also sounded excited you tosevites would listen to such an animal russie was tempted to say yes let the lizards make laughingstocks of worldwar in the balance themselves reluctantly he decided he had to tell the truth instead that much he owed to the beings who had saved his people excellency human beings would listen to a parrot but only to be amused never to take it seriously ah zolraags voice was mournful so was the lizards whole demeanor his office was heated past what russie found comfortable yet he still draped himself in warm clothing he said you know our studio has been repaired after the damage the deutsch raiders caused yes russie also knew the raiders had been jews not nazis he was glad the lizards had never figured that out zolraag went on you know you are now in good health yes moishe repeated suddenly the governor reminded him of a rabbi laying out a case for his interpretation of a talmudic passage this was so and that was so and therefore he didnt like the therefore he saw ahead he said i will not go on the radio and thank the race for destroying washington the irrevocable words the ones hed tried so long to evade were spoken at last a large lump of ice seemed to grow in his belly in spite of the overheated room he had always been at the lizards mercy just as before he and all the warsaw jews were at the mercy of the germans a quick gesture from the governor and rivka would be a widow zolraag did not make the gesture not yet anyhow he said i do not understand your trouble surely you did not object to the identical bombing of berlin which helped us take this city from the deutsche how does the one differ from the other it was so obvious but not to the lizards looked at dispassionately the distinction wasnt easy to draw how many germans incinerated in berlad been women children old men people who hated everything for lch the regime centered there stood thousands upon thousands surely their undeserved deaths were as appalling as anything washington had suffered but that regime itself was so monstrous that no one least of all moishe russie could look at it dispassionately he said you know the kinds of things the germans did they wanted to enslave or kill all their neighbors rather like you lizards he thought saying that out loud however seemed less than expedient he went on the united states though has always been a country where people could be freer than they are anywhere else what is this freedom zolraag asked why do you esteem it so a quotation from a scripture not his own ran through russies mind pilate saith unto him what is truth unlike the roman zolraag seemed to want a serious answer that only made russie the sadder for him he suspected he would be explaining music to a deaf man nonetheless he had to try when we are free we may think as we harry turtledove like believe as we like and do as we like so long as what we do does not harm any of our neighbors all this you would enjoy under the beneficent rule of the race no zolraag heard no music but we did not do not choose to come under the rule of the race beneficent or not russie said another side of freedom is being able to choose our own leaders our own rulers rather than having them forced upon us if you enjoy the other freedom how could this one possibly matter zolraag sounded all at sea though he and moishe both used a hodgepodge of lizard and german words they did not speak the same language if we cannot choose our own leaders we keep the other freedoms only on sufferance not because they are truly ours russie replied we jews we know all about having freedom taken away from us at a rulers whim you still have not answered my very first question the lizard governor insisted how can you condone our bombing of berlin while you condemn the bombing of washington because excellency of all the countries on this world germany had the least freedom of either kind and when you came was busy trying to take away whatever freedom its neighbors possessed thats why most of the countries empires you would say though most of them arent had banded together to try to defeat it the united states now the united states gives its citizens more freedom than any other country in hurting berlin you were helping freedom in hurting washington you were taking it away russie spread his hands do you understand what i am trying to say excellency zolraag made a noise like a leaky samovar coming to a boil since you tosevites cannot come close to agreeing among yourselves in matters political i hardly see how i am to be expected to grasp your incomprehensible feuds but have i not heard that the deutsche chose their what is his name their hitler for themselves in the senseless manner you extol so highly how do you square this with your talk of freedom excellency i cannot russie looked down at the floor he wished the lizard had not known about how the nazis came to power i do not claim any system of government will always work well only that more folk are likely to be made content and fewer harmed with freedom than under any other arrangement not so zolraag said under the empire the race and its subject species have prospered for thousands upon thousands of years without ever worrying about choosing their own rulers and the other nonsense of which you babble to this i say two things moishe answered first that you have not been trying to govern human beings worldwar in the balance to which i say on short experience that i am heartily glad zolraag broke in humanity would be glad if you still werent russie said he did not stress that though as hed already admitted he and his people would have been exterminated had the lizards not come he tried another tack how would these subject races of yours feel about what you say they would agree with me i believe zolraag said they can scarcely deny their lives are better under our rule than they were in their barbarous days of what you i suppose would call freedom if they like you so well why havent you brought any of them with you to earth russie was trying to make the governor out to be a liar the germans had had no trouble recruiting security forces from among the peoples theyd conquered if the lizards had done the same why werent they using their subjects to help conquer or at least police this world but zolraag answered the empires soldiers and administrators come only from the ranks of the race this is partly tradition dating from the epoch when the race was the only species in the empire but then you tosevites care nothing for tradition russie wanted to bristle at that belonging as he did to a tradition that stretched back more than three thousand years but hed gotten the idea that to zolraag three thousand years was about the equivalent of summer before last hardly worth mentioning if you wanted to talk about a long time ago the lizard governor went on that the security of the races rule is another consideration i will not deny you should be honored that you are allowed to aid us in our efforts to pacify tosev such a privilege would not forded to a hallessi or a rabotev i assure you though the members subject races may freely pursue careers in areas not affecting the government and safety of the empire we do not use the word freely in the same way russie said if i werent useful to you im sure you wouldnt grant me this privilege he packed all the irony he could into that last word zolraag had as much as said that if the lizards brought earth into their empire humans would be reduced to hewers of wood and drawers of water with no voice in their own fate forevermore zolraag answered you are undoubtedly correct herr russie i suggest you bear that in mind make the most of the opportunity you are presented and cease your foolish complaints against our dominion using irony against him was about as futile as german antitank guns firing on lizard panzers russie said i cannot do as you ask of me not only for the sake of my own selfrespect but also because no human who heard me praise you for destroying washington could ever take my words seriously again harry turtledove you have been useful to us up until this time so i have given you many chances to change your mind more than i should have very likely but after this you will have no more chances do you understand what i say to you yes do what you want to me i cannot speak as you wish russie licked dry lips as he had when the nazis ruled the ghetto he hoped he could endure whatever the lizards inflicted on him zolraag said we will not do anything to you herr russie direct intimidation has shown itself to be less valuable on this world than we might have wished russie stared at him hardly believing his own ears but the governor was not finished research has suggested another tactic which may prove more effective as i said you will not suffer personally for this refusal but we shall exact reprisals upon the female with whom you are mated and upon your hatchling i hope this may suggest a possible change in your view moishe stared at him not so much in disbelief as in dreadful disappointment and here i thought id helped drive the nazis out of warsaw he said at last the deutsche are indeed well and truly driven from this city and with your help zolraag said missing the point completely we seek your continued assistance in persuading your fellow tosevites of the justice of our cause the governor spoke without apparent irony russie concluded hed noticed none but even a nazi might have hesitated to threaten a woman and child in one breath and proclaim the justice of his cause in the next alien russie thought not till now had he had his nose rubbed in the meaning of the word he wanted to point out to zolraag the errors in his reasoning as if he were a rabbi correcting a young yeshivabucher in the first days after the lizards came he could have done just that since then little by little hed had to learn discretion and now his temper could endanger not just himself but also rivka and reuven softly then you understand you offer me no easy choice he said your lack of cooperation has forced me to this step zolraag answered you ask me to betray so much of what i believe in russie said that was nothing but truth he tried to put a whine in his voice please give me a couple of days in which to think on what i must do getting sick wouldnt be enough this time he was already sure of that i ask you only to go on working with us and for our cause as you have in the past just as russie was getting more cautious in what he said to zolraag so zolraag was getting more suspicious about what he heard from russie why do you need time in which to contemplate this the governor spoke in his own language to the machine on the desk in front worldwar in the balance of him it was no telephone but it answered anyway sometimes moishe thought it did zolraags thinking for him the lizard resumed our research demonstrates that a threat against a tosevites family is like to be the most effect way to ensure his obedience something in the way he phrased that made russie notice it is the same not true among the race he asked hoping to distract zolraag from wondering why he needed extra time to think the ploy worked at least for a little while the governor emitted a most humansounding snort his mouth fell open in amusement hardly herr russie among our kind matings are but for a season driven by the scent females exude then females brood and raise our young that is their role in life but we do not have these permanent families you tosevites know how could we when parentage is less certain among us the lizards were all bastards then in the most literal sense of the word moishe liked that notion especially with what zolraag was putting him through now he asked this is so even with your emperor zolraag cast down his eyes at the mention of his rulers title of course not foolish tosevite he said the emperor has females reserved for him alone so his line may be sure to continue so it has been for a thousand generations and more so shall it ever be a harem russie thought that should have made him all the more scornful of the lizards but somehow it did not zolraag spoke of his emperor with the reverence a jew would have given to his god a thousand generations with a past of that depth upon which to draw no wonder zolraag saw the future as merely a continuation of what had already been the governor returned to the question hed asked before with your family as security for your obedience why do you still hesitate this ap peartrary to the results of our research on your kind tvvnat sort of research russie wondered he didnt really want to know the bloodless word too likely concealed more suffering than he could think about with equanimity in doing as they pleased to people without worrying about the consequences of their actions the lizards werent too different from the nazis after all but all of mankind was for them as jews were for the germans i should have seen that sooner russie thought yet he could not blame himself for what hed done before his own people were dying then and hed helped save them as so often happened though the shortterm solution was proving part of a longterm problem please answer me herr russie zolraag said sharply how can i answer now russie pleaded you put me between impossible choices i must have time to think i will give you one day the governor said with the air of one making a great concession past that time i shall have no more patience with these delaying tactics harry turtledove yes your excellency thank you your excellency russie scurried out of zolraags office before the lizard got the bright idea of attaching a couple of guards to him whatever invidious comparisons hed drawn he had to recognize that the invaders were less efficient occupiers than the nazis had been what do i do now he wondered as he went back out into the cold if i praise the lizardsfor bombing washington i deserve an assassins bullet if i dont he thought of killing himself to escape zolraags demands that would save his wife and son but he did not want to die hed survived too much to throw away his life if any other way was open he would seize it he was not surprised to find his feet taking him toward mordechai anielewiczs headquarters if anyone could help him the jewish fighting leader was the man trouble was he didnt know if anyone could help him the armed guards outside the headquarters came if not to attention then at least to respectful alertness as he approached he had no trouble getting in to see anielewicz the fighter took one look at his face and said whats the lizard said hes going to do to you not to me to my family russie told the story in a few words anielewicz swore lets go for a walk reb moishe i have the feeling they can listen to whatever we say in here all right russie went out into the street again warsaw this winter even outside the former ghetto was depressingly drab smoke from softcoal and wood fires hung over the city tinting both clouds and scattered snow a dingy brown trees that would be green and lovely in summer now reached toward the sky bare branches that reminded russie of skeletons arms and fingers piles of rubble were everywhere swarmed over by antlike poles and jews out to take away what they could so anielewicz said abruptly what did you have in mind to do i dont know i dont know we expected this would happen and now it has but i thought they would strike only at me not at rivka and reuven russie rocked back and forth on his heels as if mourning lost chances anielewiczs eyes were hooded theyre learning they arent stupid by any means just naive all right heres what it comes down to do you want to disappear do you want your family to disappear or should you all vanish at the same time ive set up plans for each case but i need to know which to run what i would like russie said is for the lizards to disappear ha anielewicz gave that exactly as much laughter as it deserved a wolf was devouring us so we called in a tiger the tiger isnt eating us right now but we are still made of meat so hes not a good neighbor to have either worldwar in the balance neighbor landlord you mean russie said and he will eat my family if i dont throw myself into his mouth i asked you once already how you want to keep from doing that i cant afford to disappear russie said reluctantly he would have liked nothing better zolraag would just pick someone else from among us to mouth his words he may decide to do that anyhow but if im here i serve as a reproach to whoever might want to take such a course and to zolraag himself not that he cares much about reproaches from human be ings but if you can get rivka and reuven away i think i can i have something in mind anyhow anielewicz frowned thinking through whatever his scheme was in what seemed a non sequitur he asked your wife reads doesnt she yes of course good write a note to tell her whatever you need to say about escap ing id bet the lizards can hear what goes on at your flat too id be able to do that if i were wearing their shoes russie looked at the jewish fighting leader in sharp surprise some times anielewicz was amazingly matteroffact about his own devious ness maybe only accident of birth separated him from a gestapo man the thought was depressing even more depressing that in times like these the jews desperately needed such men anielewicz had barely paused now he went on out loud you talk to her about the three of you going out shopping to the marketplace on gesia street then go but in a couple of hours have her wear a hat that stands out what will happen then the fighting leader let out an exasperated snort reb moishe the moru know the more somebody can squeeze out of you even after you what we do you wont know all of it which is for the best be lieve me all right mordechai russie glanced over at his companion i hope youre not putting yourself in too much danger on account of me life is a gamble weve learned about that these past few years havent we anielewicz shrugged sooner or later you lose but there are times when you have to bet anyhow go on do what i told you im glad you dont want to go into hiding yourself we need you youre our con science moishe felt like a conscience a guilty one all the way back to his block of flats he paused along the way to scribble a note to his wife along the lines anielewicz had suggested as he stuck it back into his pocket he wondered if hed really have to use it when he turned the last corner he saw lizard guards standing at the entrance to the apartment building they hadnt been there the day before guilt evaporated to save his fam ily he would do what he must harry turtledove the lizards scrutinized him as he approached you russie one of them asked in hesitant german yes he snapped and pushed past two steps later he wondered if he should have lied the lizards seemed to have as much trouble telling people from one another as he did telling them apart he stamped angrily on the stairs as he climbed up to his own flat maybe hed wasted a chance whats the matter rivka asked blinking when he slammed the door behind him nothing he answered as lightly as he could mindful zolraags minions might be listening why dont we go shopping with reuven this afternoon well see what theyre selling over on gesia street his wife looked at him as if hed suddenly taken leave of his senses not only was he anything but an enthusiastic shopper his cheery manner did not match the way hed stormed into the apartment before she could say anything he pulled out the note and handed it to her what is she began but fell silent at his urgent shushing motions her eyes widened as she read what hed written she rose to the occasion like a trouper all right well go out she said happily though all the while her glance darted this way and that in search of the microphones hed warned her about if we could spot them so easily they wouldnt be a menace he thought he said when we go why dont you put on that new gray fur hat you bought it goes so nicely with your eyes at the same time he nodded vigorously to show her he wanted to be certain she did just that i will in fact ill fetch it now so i dont forget she said adding over her shoulder you should tell me things like that more often she sounded more mischievous than reproachful but he felt a twinge of guilt just the same the hat a sturdy one with earflaps had once belonged to a red army soldier it wasnt feminine but it was warm which counted for more in a city full of scarcity and too near empty of fuel and it did set off her eyes well they made small talk to kill the time anielewicz had asked them to kill then rivka buttoned her coat put a couple of extra layers of outer clothes on reuven who squealed with excitement at the prospect of going out and left the apartment with moishe as soon as they were outside she said now what exactly is this all about why are we while they walked to the stairs and then down them he explained more than hed been able to put in his note he finished so theyll spirit the two of you away somehow to keep the lizards from using you to get a hold on me what will they do with us she demanded where will we go i dont know he said mordechai wouldnt tell me he may not know himself but leave the choice to people the lizards wont automat worldwar in the balance ically question though any rabbi would have a fit to hear me say it sometimes ignorance is the best defense i dont want to leave you she said running from danger while you stay in it isnt right i before she could say wont he broke in this is the best thing you can do to keep me safe too he wanted to say more but by then they were at the entrance to the flats and he couldnt be sure how much yiddish or polish the lizard guards there knew somehow he wasnt surprised when those guards instead of staying at their post started following him and his family they didnt come right alongside as if they were jailers but they never let the russies get more than ten or twelve meters ahead if he or rivka had tried to break and run the lizards would have had no trouble capturing or shooting them besides if they broke and ran theyd wreck whatever plan anielewicz had made so they kept walking outwardly as calm as if nothing unusual were happening by the time they got to the market four lizards trailed them and two more walked ahead with their swiveling eyes the aliens could keep watch without constantly turning their heads back over their shoulders gesia street as usual boiled with life hawkers loudly peddled tea coffee and hot water laced with saccharine from samovars turnips from pushcarts a man with a pistol stood guard over a crate of coal another sat behind a table on which he had set out spare parts for bicycles a woman displayed bream from the vistula the weather was cold enough to keep the fish fresh till spring several stands sold captured german and russian military clothing morerman gear was available but the red army equipment brought higherprices the russians knew how to fight cold rivka had bought her hat at one of these stands now moishe saw even lizards crowded around them that made him abruptly move away where are we going rivka asked when he swerved i dont exactly know he said well just wander about and see what there is to see wander about and let anielewiczs men see us he thought as if from a distant dream he remembered the days before the war when he could walk into any tailors or grocers or butchers in warsaw find what he wanted and be sure he had the zlotys to buy it compared to those days the market on gesia street was privation personified compared to what the ghetto market had been like when the nazis ruled warsaw it seemed cigarsmoking wall street capitalist affluence people surged this way and that buying and bartering trading bread for books marks for meat vodka for vegetables the lizards who were watching russie and his family had to get closer to make sure their quarry harry turtledove did not somehow vanish in the crowds even then they had no easy time because they couldnt even see over or through the taller humans who kept stepping between them and the russies moishe suddenly found himself in the middle of a large knot of large men by main force of will he made himself keep his face straight a lot of them came from the ranks of mordechai anielewiczs fighters whatever happened would happen now one of anielewiczs men bent down muttered something in rivkas ear she nodded squeezed moishes hand hard then let go he heard her say come on reuven a couple of burly fighters shouldered themselves between him and his wife and son he looked away biting the inside of his lip and fighting back tears a few seconds later a hand joined his again he spun round half afraid something was wrong half delighted he wouldnt have to be separated from rivka and reuven after all but the young woman whose fingers interlaced with his though a fairskinned grayeyed brunette who wore rivkas hat was not his wife nor was the boy beside her his son well wander around the marketplace a few more minutes then go back to your flat she said quietly russie nodded this impostors coat was much like his wifes the hat was hers he didnt think the ploy would have fooled say ss men but to the lizards one human looked much like another they might well have recognized rivka by her hat rather than her features that obviously was anielewiczs gamble at any rate russies first urge was to crane his neck to see where the fighters were taking his family he fought it down then he really realized he was holding the hand of a woman not his wife he jerked away as if shed suddenly become redhot he would have been even more mortified if shed laughed at him to his relief she just nodded in sympathetic understanding but his relief did not last long could we leave now he asked its not only the lizards and its not that im not grateful but people will see us together and wonder what on earth were doing or rather they wont wonder theyll decide they know yes that is one of the things that can go wrong the woman agreed as coolly as if she were one of anielewiczs rifletoting fighters herself but this was the best way we could come up with to make the switch on short notice we russie thought she is a fighter then regardless of whether she carries a gun so is the boy he said whats your name how can i thank you properly if i dont know who you are she smiled im leah and this is david hello david russie said david nodded back as soberly as any adult might have moishe felt a stab of guilt at using a child to protect himself worldwar in the balance a short woman with curly gray hair pushed her way between the fighters around him reb moishe i need to ask you she began her words trailed away as she noticed leah was not rivka she backed off her eyes as wide and staring as if russie had sprouted a second head thats torn it leah muttered youre right reb moishe wed better go im sorry for the damage im doing to your reputation if i have to choose between my reputation and my family i know which is more important russie said firmly adding besides the way we gossip here before long everyone will know why im playing this game he spoke for leahs benefit but also eased his own mind because he realized he was probably right for the moment though what would spread was scandal before people started gathering around and pointing fingers he and leah and david left the market and strolled not too fast and not too slow back toward his home the lizard guards moving along in front and behind them were in a way a blessing because they kept most folk from coming too close and puncturing the masquerade russies conscience twinged again when he closed the door to his flat behind him bringing a woman a young attractive woman here shameful was the mildest word he thought of but leah remained utterly prosaic she took off the fur hat handed it back to him smiled without saying anything she must have been warned the lizards might be listening she pointed to the hat then to herself and shrugged as if to ask how anyone even a lizard could imagine she was rivka if she didnt have it on her head then she walked out the door and was gone the simplicity of the escape took moishes breath away the lizards hadnisted guards right outside the flat only at the entrance to the buildmaybe they didnt want to act as if they were intimidating him even though they were or maybe as anielewicz had said they were just naive about how tricky human beings could be whichever was true leah now that she was no longer disguised as rivka plainly intended to stroll right past them and off to freedom the boy david sat on the floor and played with reuvens toys for a little while then he got up and stood by the door moishe opened it for him he nodded again with that surprising gravity then went out into the hall russie closed the door the flat seemed achingly huge and achingly empty now that he was here alone he walked into the bedroom shook his head came out again in a hurry then he went into the kitchen and shook his head for a different reason he was no cook and now hed have to feed himself for a while he found some black bread and a slab of cheese on the counter he picked a knife from the dairy service made himself a sandwich if he wanted anything fancier than that hed need to get someone else to fix it for him harry turtledove of course the lizards might fix things so he wouldnt have to worry about food any more he tried not to dwell on that he went back into the main room pulled out an old medical text on diseases of the large intestine his eyes went back and forth he turned pages but he remembered nothing of what he read he slept badly that night rivkas bed next to his reuvens little cot painfully reminded him his loved ones were not here he was used to soft breathing and occasional snores in the bedroom with him the silence their absence imposed on him somehow was more disturbing than a dreadful racket he felt smothered in thick wool batting he ate more bread and cheese the next morning he was still puttering around afterward trying to figure out what to do next when something clicked against the front door lizard claws tapping the wood in the quick little drumrattle the aliens used in place of a knock russies mouth went dry hed hoped hed have a full day in which to pretend to be making up his mind but no he opened the door to his surprise zolraag himself stood in the hall along with a large contingent of guards excellency russie stammered i am honored wwont you come in there is no need zolraag answered i ask you one question herr russie will you speak over the radio as we desire and require of you no excellency i shall not moishe waited for the sky to fall the lizard governor remained businesslike then we shall persuade you his eyes swiveled toward one of the guards your males shall now seize the tosevite female and hatchling he spoke of course in his own language but russie followed him well enough it shall be done the guard officer hissed orders to the lizards with him one of them pointed his rifle at russie who stood very still you will not interfere herr russie zolraag said i will not interfere moishe agreed some guards went into the kitchen others into the bedroom all returned in short order the other big uglies are not here superior sir provincelord one of them reported had he been a man russie would have said he sounded worried what the guard leader and zolraag said together the lizard governors eyes drilled into russie where are they excellency i do not know russie wished he could be as brave as anielewiczs fighters who seemed to go into combat without a trace of worry if zolraag had been angry at him before hed be furious now but at least he could no longer vent that fury on the innocent russie went on as your male said they are not here where did they go zolraag demanded i dont know that either you cannot deceive me as easily as you would hope zolraag said worldwar in the balance the female and hatchling were observed to return to this dwelling with you yesterday they were not seen to leave therefore they must be in the building somewhere he turned to the guard officer with whom hed spoken before summon more males we shall peel this hovel as if it were a kleggfruit provincelord it shall be done the guard spoke into one of the incredibly small incredibly light radiotelephones the lizards carried watching him russie tried not to show the jubilation he felt whatever happened to him rivka and reuven were out of zolraags clawed scaly hands the lizards were welcome to search the block of flats from now until the messiah came they wouldnt find what wasnt there they made a good game try of it though moishe didnt hear their lorries pull up as he had too many times when the nazis rumbled into the ghetto on a sweep but the noises that came through his open doorway after the lizards swarmed into the building were all too familiar rifle butts hammering on doors frightened jews wailing as they were herded into hallways overturned furniture crashing to the ground excellency out of all the people in the world we hailed you as rescuers when you came to warsaw and fought on your side against other men russie said now you are doing your best to turn us into foes you turn yourselves into foes by failing to obey zolraag answered we were happy to be your allies i told you before that being your slaves obeying because we have to rather than because we think you are in the right is something else again zolraag made his unhappysamovar noise your effrontery is intolerable t dragged on every so often a lizard would come in and report to the gnor not surprisingly the searchers had no luck zolraag kept right on sounding like a teakettle with something wrong with it russie wondered if he could have hidden his wife and son in plain sight maybe so the lizards had already shown they werent any good at telling one human from another what they were probably doing now was looking for anyone in hiding they did bring one little old man with a white beard up in front of zolraag but the governor knew enough to dismiss him as a likely spouse for moishe by late afternoon the lizards confessed failure zolraag glared at russie you think you have won a victory do you big ugly he hardly ever hurled the lizards offensive nickname for humanity into moishes face that he did so now was a meastre of his wrath let me tell you you shall not prove the happier for it do what you like with me excellency russie said from your point of view i suppose you have that right but i think no one has any business taking hostages and enforcing his will through fear harry turtledove when i seek your opinions be assured i shall request them of you the governor replied until that time keep them to yourself russie tried to figure out what he would do in zolraags position probably stick a gun to the recalcitrant humans head hand him a script and tell him to read it or else and what would he do himself in the face of a threat like that he hoped for defiance but was far from sure he could come up with it few men had within them the stuff of martyrs zolraag was not quite so peremptory as hed feared the lizard said i shall consult with my superiors herr russie over the proper steps to take in response to this unprecedented act of defiance on your part he strode away his retinue trailing after him limp as a wet blotter russie sank down onto the sofa unprecedented he decided was the word that had saved him the lizards were not good at thinking on their feet at knowing what to do when something failed to go according to plan that didnt mean he was out of danger though only that it was deferred for the moment somewhere higher in the lizards hierarchy was a male who could tell zolraag what to do and zolraag russie knew would do it whatever it was he went into the kitchen ate more bread and cheese then he opened the door the bathroom was down at the end of the hall two armed lizard guards stood outside theyd been so quiet hed had no clue they were there they marched to the toilet with him despite his indignant protest one went inside and kept watch on him while he made water then they marched him back to the apartment he wondered if theyd come in with him but they didnt still they made sure he wasnt going anywhere they didnt want him to go as mordechai had said they werent stupid he looked around the flat he was trapped awaiting sentence an hour outside chicago crouched behind an overturned drill press in a shattered factory building in aurora illinois mutt daniels reflected that this was about as close to the windy city as hed come since he fell out of the big leagues thirty years before the noise he made was half laugh half cough steam swirled from his mouth thick as cigarette smoke even in a sheepskin coat he shivered snow drifted down on him through holes in the roof he kept his hands jammed in his pockets if he happened to brush them against the frozen bare metal of the drill press he knew it would strip off his skin like a scaling knife getting a bluegill ready for the frying pan clanking outside in the rubblestrewn street a few feet away sprawled in back of a lathe lay sergeant schneider that theres a lizard tank daniels whispered hoping schneider would tell him he was wrong but thteran noncom just nodded daniels swore we didnt have to worry ilut these goddamn things when we were over there in the last war too goddamn right we didnt schneider said and all the time then i thought things couldnt get any worse he spat on the floor shows what i know dont it yeah daniels shiver had only a little to do with the cold that snuck into his very bones hed read about tanks since the new war began seen them in newsreels but until the lizards turned the whole world upside down he hadnt really understood what they did to fighting it wasnt just that they picked up big guns and put them on tracks worse still behind their thick armor the crews that served those guns were almost invulnerable to infantry almost mutt scuttled forward on hands and knees if that tank if any lizard tank forced its way to the eastern bank of the fox river the job of defending chicago would take another step on the road to impossibility the tanks machine gun chattered firing at one of the americans de harry turtledove fending aurora or else at random to make humans keep their heads down combat here was housetohouse concentrated in fact it reminded daniels of the trench warfare hed known in france aurora marked the western edge of the factory belt that spread out across the prairie from chicago fighting all the way into the big city would be like this if anyone lived to retreat all the way into the big city mutt had his doubts about that hed had his doubts in too but then hed been on the side with more men and bigger guns now he was getting a taste of how the poor damned boches must have felt as everything rained down on them the germans had kept fighting like bastards right up till the armistice mutt felt a similar obligation to keep going as long as he could the front wall of the factory had been bombed not long before he holed up in it its bricks were part of the rubble through which the lizard tank was forcing its way he crawled toward what had been a window opening and was now just a hole a little squarer than most knifesharp shards of glass tore his pants and his knees ever so cautiously he peered out the tank was about thirty yards east of him it had slowed to shove aside some burnedout trucks the americans were using as a roadblock the commander had nerve in spite of rattling smallarms fire he stood head and shoulders out of his cupola so he could see what was going on around him his back was to daniels mutt had grown up hunting squirrels and possums for the pot he swung the rifle up to his shoulder exhaled saw the front of the lizards head explode in a red mist a split second before he threw himself away from his firing position nailed the son of a bitch he shouted through the din of gunfire and explosions the other americans sheltering in the ruined factory raised a cheer such a clearcut cry of victory came their way too seldom had the lizards had the numbers to match the might of their marvelous machines daniels knew the fight would have been long since lost nor did he get more than a moment to exult in his successful piece of sniping bullets from the tanks machine gun lashed the factory building he huddled in back of another broken power tool grateful for the heavy chunk of iron and steel that shielded him from flying death good job mutt sergeant schneider bawled you diverted him from the advance he was making taking us out doesnt mean a thing strategically daniels wondered whether hed be any less dead if he got killed in an action strategically meaningless he didnt think so damn shame he muttered he also marveled that schneider could still think and talk like a professional soldier while being hosed down by machinegun slugs then there was a sudden hot yellow glare outside as if the sun had come on in the middle of the street the roar that accompanied it was loud the whamcrash of the shell from the tanks big gun ewn louder worldwar in the balance chunks of brick rained down on daniels a timber that would have smashed him like a bug was instead smashed itself against the machine behind which he cowered the tank gave the factory two more rounds flash boom crash flash boom crash mutt screamed for all he was worth but couldnt hear himself or anyone else he wondered if hed ever hear anything again at the moment it was the least of his worries he realized hed wet his pants but he didnt care about that either when he tried to scramble away his arms and legs shook so much he could hardly move shell shock he said feeling the words on his lips but not hearing them at all hed seen men like this in the trenches after a good german barrage other soldiers would jeer at them but not too hard it wasnt as if the poor bastards could help themselves he marveled at being alive hey schneider he called you think them lizards are fucking diverted enough for now he didnt hear schneider answer but that was all righthe hadnt heard himself ask the question he glanced over to where the sergeant had been hiding any further jokes stuck in his throat the veteran was nothing but splashed blood and raw meat ground not too fine daniels gulped jesus he whispered schneider was the best soldier hed ever knownby a wide margin in this crazy war and he thought also better than any of the top sergeants hed served under in france one way you told good soldiers from bad was that the good ones lived to learn new things while the bad ones bought their farms in a hurry seeing a good soldier dead reminded you that you could end up the same way yourself mutdnt want reminders like that iilsmelled smoke sharp and fresh it was a reminder too a reminder there were nastier ways to die than getting chewed to pieces by a storm of shell splinters schneider at least never knew what hit him if you roasted youd have plenty of time to regret it all at once daniels shaky limbs worked if not perfectly then well enough he looked around the gloomy inside of the factory building considerably less gloomy now that the lizards had done some fresh ventilation work on the front for the rest of the americans whod been in here with him a couple of them werent going anywhere they lay dead as gruesomely as schneider three or four others as lucky as hed been himself were getting away from the fire as fast as they could and a couple of wounded men flopped on the floor like freshlanded fish in the bottom of a boat both mutts grandfathers had fought in the war between the states and both as old men will told stories to the wideeyed boy hed been he remembered pappy daniels long white beard stained with tobacco juice talking about the battle of the wilderness and how wounded men there harry turtledove had shot themselves before any of the little blazes all the musketry had started could wash over them that memory one he hadnt called to mind in years told him what he had to do he hurried forward grabbed one of the injured soldiers and dragged him away from the spreading flames over to a tumbledown wall that might shelter him for a little while thanks the fellow gasped its okay daniels quickly bandaged the worst of the mans wounds then went back to pick up his comrade he had to sling his rifle the other fellow had passed out and was a twohand carry hed just taken him onto his shoulders when a lizard infantryman skittered into the factory he was sure he was dead after what seemed an age but had to have been only a heartbeat the lizard pointed the muzzle of its rifle to the floor gestured with its free hand get your wounded buddy out of here sometimes far from always the germans had extended that courtesy in france sometimes just as far from always the americans returned it daniels never expected to encounter it from a thing that looked like one of the monsters in the serials his ballplayers liked to watch obliged he told the lizard though he knew it couldnt understand then he raised his voice to the men hiding somewhere in the ruins dont shoot this one fellas hes all right staggering under the weight of the soldier hed lifted he carried him back to the wall behind which hed laid the other wounded man at the same time the lizard slowly backed out of the factory building nobody fired at it the tiny truce held for perhaps half a minute mutt rolled the second injured soldier off his shoulder discovered he wasnt breathing he grabbed the fellows wrist his finger found the spot just on the thumb side of the tendons no pulse the soldiers arm flopped limply when he let it fall aah shit he said dully the strange moment of comradeship had gone for nothing lost in the waste that was war more lizards dashed into the building they fired their automatic weapons from the hip not aiming at anything in particular but making the americans keep their heads down only a couple of rifle rounds answered them the fellow who shoots first has the edge daniels thought hed learned that in the trenches and it still seemed true all at once he realized that with schneider dead he was the senior noncom present hed been in charge of more men than these as a manager but the stakes hadnt been so high nobody shot you for hanging a curve ball no matter how much people talked about it the first wounded man hed dragged to cover was still very much alive fall back mutt yelled he started crawling away dragging the hurt soldier after him stand up now and youd stop one of those sprayed bullets just as sure as sunrise worldwar in the balance a beam crashed down behind him flames crackled then roared at his back he tried to crawl faster over here somebody shouted he changed direction hands reached out to help pull the wounded man behind a file cabinet that between its metal and the reams of paper spilling from it probably could have stopped a lizard tank round mutt got in back of it himself and lay there panting like a dog on a mississippi summer day smitty still alive up there asked the soldier already under cover daniels shook his head for all i know he couldve been dead when i picked him up goddamn shame he didnt say anything about the lizard whod refrained from shooting him he had the strange feeling that mentioning it would take the magic away as if it were the seventh inning of a building nohitter the other soldier his name was buck risberg pointed and said the fires holding the lizards back good to know somethin can daniels made a sour face he was turning cynical fast in this fight im gettin old he thought and then gettin hell i am old but he was also in command he dragged his mind back to what needed doing right now get hank here out of this mess he told risberg there ought to be a medic a couple blocks north ohere lessn the lizards drove him out by now but you gotta try okay mutt half dragging half carrying the nowunconscious hank risberg made his way out of the firing line the burning beam helped light his way through the gloom and also provided a barrier the lizards hesitated to cross shells screamed down on the factory and the street outside not from lizard cannon these but out of the west from american batteries still inllace on stolps island in the middle of the fox river the gunners were bringing the fire right down onto the heads of their own men in the hope of hitting the enemy too daniels admired their aggressiveness and wished he werent on the receiving end of it the incoming artillery made the lizards who were poking their snouts into the factory building stop shooting and hunker down at least that was what mutt assumed they were doing it was certainly what he was doing himself but all too soon even in the midst of the barrage they started up again with nasty three and fourbullet bursts that would chew a man to rags mutt felt as inadequate with the springfield jammed against his shoulder as pappy daniels must have if hed ever tried to fight yankees toting henry repeaters with his singleshot muzzleloading rifle musket then from in back of him came a long ripping burst of fire that made him wonder for a dreadful instant how the lizards had got round to his rear but not only did the lizards usually have better fire discipline than that the weapon did not sound like one of theirs when daniels recognized it he yelled you with the tommy gun get your ass up here harry turtledove a minute later a soldier flopped down beside him where they at corporal he asked mutt pointed right over that way leastways thats where they shot from last the tommy gun chattered the fellow with it not a man from daniels unit went through a fiftyround drum as if he were going to have to pay for all the rounds he didnt fire off another submachine gun opened up behind daniels and to his left grinning at mutts surprised expression the soldier said our whole platoon carries em corporal we got enough firepower to make these scaly sons of bitches think twice about messin with us daniels started to say thats crazy but maybe it wasnt out in open country it would have been a tommy gun fired ascaliber pistol cartridge and was accurate out to only a couple of hundred yards but in street fighting or buildingtobuilding combat like this volume of fire counted for a lot more than accuracy since the usa couldnt match the lizards automatic rifles submachine guns were probably the next best thing so instead of cussing the high command for a worthless brainstorm mutt said yeah some of the german assault troops in france carried those damn things too i didnt much care to go up against em either the tommygunner turned his head you were over there were you i reckon this is worse daniels thought about it yeah probably not that that was any fun mind you but its always easier being on the long end of the stick and this here fightin in factories i didnt used to think they made anything worsen trenches but im comin round to believe i was wrong an airplane roared by just above rooftop height ours the tommygunner said in glad surprise daniels shared it american planes were all too few these days the aircraft pounded the advancing lizards for a few seconds machine guns bellowing then came another bellow an almost solid wall of noise from the ground the airplanes engine stopped screaming the machine guns cut off at the same time the plane crashed with a boom that would have broken windows had aurora had any windows left to break damn the tommygunner and daniels said together mutt added i hope he came down on top of a whole pile of the bastards yeah said the soldier with the thompson gun i just wish he could have got away so hed be able to hit em again tomorrow daniels nodded he sometimes thought no american ever lived to fly more than one mission against the lizards using up pilots as fast as planes was a losing way to do business the tommygunner squeezed off a burst in the direction of the lizards he said corporal ill cover you if you want to slide away from here you aint much ood in thilimit worldwar in the balance had he left off the second sentence daniels might have taken him up on the offer but he discovered he had pride left to flick he could think of himself as old and hed already thought of his rifle as antiquated but he wasnt about to let this punk kid tell him he couldnt cut it ill stick he said shortly however you want it the tommygunner said shrugging mutt got the idea that only his stripes kept the kid from tacking pop onto the end of the sentence the lizards skittered forward firing as they came the flames that leapt from the burning beam lit them up but also helped screen their movements daniels snapped off a shot a skitter turned into a tumble he raised a rebel yell his grandpappy would have been proud of no good in a fight am i the soldier beside him looked innocent did i say something the kid got up on one knee to fire then went over backwards with almost the grace of a circus acrobat something hot and wet splashed daniels the flickering firelight showed redstreaked gray on the back of his hand he violently wiped it against his trouser leg brains he said shuddering when he glanced over at the tommygunner the top of the youngsters head was clipped off as if by a hatchet a spreading pool of blood reached toward him he didnt have time to be as sick as he would have liked as far as he could tell he was the forwardmost american still fighting he fired at one lizard a miss he thought but he made the little monster duck then whirled through a quartercircle to shoot at another he had no idea what if anything that second round did he did know that ihhad to keep using a boltaction rifle against what were in essence machlguns he was going to get his ass killed and the rest of him with it he snatched up the tommy gun the kid lying dead beside him was carrying another couple of drums of ammo so he could use it for a while it bucked against his shoulder like an ornery horse when he opened up he sprayed bullets hosefashion out in front of him the prolonged muzzle flash nearly blinded him before he dropped back behind cover hell of a way to fight he thought lay down a lot of lead and hope the bad guys walk into it it was he realized a hell of a place to fight too gloomfilled ruins lit only by fires and muzzle flashes echoing with gunshots and screams the air thick with smoke and the smells of sweat and blood and fear he nodded if this wasnt hell what the hell was it the hospital ship ith emperor poropss the merciful should have been a taste of home for ussmak and so in a way it was it was heated to a decent temperature the light seemed right not the slightly too blue harry turtledove glare that lit tosevs third world and best of all no big uglies were trying to kill him at the moment even the food was better than the processed slop he ate in the field he should have been happy had he felt more like himself he might have been but when the big uglies blew the turret off his landcruiser hed bailed out of the drivers escape hatch into a particularly radioactive patch of mud the detectors had chattered maniacally when males in protective suits got near him and so here he was being repaired so he could return to action and let the tosevites figure out still more ways to turn him into overcooked chopped meat radiation sickness had left him too nauseated to enjoy the good hospital food at first by the time that subsided his treatment was making him sick hed had a wholebloodsystem transfusion and a cell transplant to replace his damaged bloodproducing glands the immunitysuppressing drugs and the others that resuppressed triggered oncogenes made him sicker than the radiation had hed spent a good many days being a very unhappy male indeed now his body was beginning to feel as if it might actually be part of the race again his spirit however still struggled against the most insidious hospital ailment of all boredom hed done all the reading played all the computer simulations he could stand he wanted to go back to the real world again even if it was tosev full of large ugly aliens with large ugly cannon and mines and other unpleasant tools yet at the same time he dreaded going back theyd just make him part of another patchedtogether landcruiser crew another piece of a puzzle forced into a place where he did not quite fit hed already had two crews killed around him could he withstand that a third time and stay sane or would he die with this next group that would solve his problems but not in a way he cared for an orderly shuffled by pushing a broom like a lot of the males who did such lowly work he had green rings painted on his arms to show he was being punished for a breach of discipline ussmak idly wondered what hed done these days idle wondering was about the only sort in which ussmak indulged the orderly paused in his endless round of sweeping turned one eye toward ussmak ive seen males who looked happier friend he remarked so ussmak said last i heard the fieetlord hadnt ordered everybody to be happy all the time youre a funny one friend you are the orderlys mouth fell open the two males were alone in ussmaks chamber all the same the orderly swiveled his eyes in all directions before he spoke again you want to be happy for a while friend worldwar in the balance ussmak snorted how can you make me be happy except by ieavlng he added to himself if this petty deviationist kept bothering him hed say it out loud the orderlys eyes swiveled again his voice fell to a dramatic halfwhisper got what you need right here friend you bet i do what ussmak said scornfully cold sleep and a starship ride back home and its right there in a beltpouch is it tell me another one he nodded slightly while opening his own mouth a sarcastic laugh but he did not faze the other male what ive got friend is better than a trip home and ill give it to you if you want it nothing is better than a trip home ussmak said with conviction still the fasttalking orderly stirred his curiosity that didnt take much in the middle of stultifyingly dull hospital routine anything different sufficed to stir his curiosity so he asked what do you have in there anyhow the orderly looked all around again ussmak wondered if he expected a corrector to leap out of the wall and bring new charges against him after that latest survey he took a small plastic vial out of one of the pouches he wore brought it over to ussmak it was filled with finely ground yellowbrown powder some of this is what you need some of what ussmak had guessed the male was somehow absconding with medications but hed never seen a medication that resembled this stuff youll find out friend this stuff makes you forgive the big uglies for a whole lot of things yes it does nothing ussmak thought could make him forgive the big uglies either the miserable world they inhabited or for killing his friends and landdlser teammates but he watched as the orderly undid the top of the vial poured a little powder into the palm of his other hand he held that hand up to ussmaks snout go ahead friend taste it quick before somebody sees ussmak wondered again why the orderly was sporting green stripes had he poisoned someone with the stuff all at once he didnt care the doctors had been doing their level best to poison him after all he sniffed at the powder the smell startled him sweet spicy tempting was the word that sprang to mind of itself his tongue flicked out and licked the fine grains off the scales of the orderlys hand the taste was like nothing hed known before the powder bit at his tongue as if it had sharp little teeth of its own then the flavor filled his whole mouth after a moment it seemed to fill his whole brain as well he felt warm and brilliant and powerful as if he were the fleetlord and at the same time in the bosom of the races deceased emperors he wanted to go out hop into a landcruiser by himself for he felt capable of driving gunning and commanding all at the same time and blast big uglies off their harry turtledove planet so the race could settle here as it should getting rid of the tosevites seemed as easy as saying it shall be done you like that friend the orderly asked his voice sly he put the vial of powder back into the pouch ussmaks eyes followed it all the way i like that he said the orderly laughed again he really was a funny fellow ussmak thought he said figured you would glad you found out it doesnt have to be a mope in here he made a few haphazard swipes with his broom then went out into the hallway to clean the next healing cubicle ussmak reveled in the strength and might the tosevite herb he supposed it was had given him he desperately wanted to be out and doing not cooped up here as if he were being fattened for the stewpot he craved action danger complication for a while then the feeling of invincibility started to fade the harder he clung to it the more it slipped between his fingers finally too soon it was gone leaving behind the melancholy awareness that ussmak was only himself all the more melancholy because he so vividly remembered how hed felt beforei and a craving to know that strength and certainty once more dull hospital routine was all the duller when set against that brief bright memory the day advanced on leaden feet even meals till now the high points on ussmaks schedule seemed hardly worth bothering over the orderly who took away ussmaks tray not the same male whod given him his moments of delight made disapproving noises when he found half the food uneaten ussmak slept poorly that night he woke up before the daytime bright lights in the ceiling went on he lay tossing in the gloom imagining time falling off a clock until at last the moment for the broompushing orderly to return arrived when that moment came however he was not in his cubicle the doctors had trundled him into a lab for another in a series of metabolic and circulatory tests before he tasted the tosevite powder he hadnt minded being poked prodded and visualized by ultrasound and xrays none of it hurt very much and it was more interesting than sitting around all day like a longunexamined document in a computer storage file today though he furiously resented the tests he tried to get the technicians to hurry through them snapped when they sometimes couldnt and had them snapping back at him im sorry landcruiser driver ussmak one of the males said i didnt realize you had an appointment with the fleetlord this forenoon no it must be an audience with the emperor another technician suggested fuming ussmak subsided he was so upset he almost forgot to cast down his eyes at the mention of his sovereign as if to punish him the worldwar in the balance males at the lab worked slower instead of faster by the time they finally let him go back to his cubicle the orderly with the green rings on his arms was gone another desolate day passed ussmak kept trying to recapture the sensation the powder had given him he could remember it and clearly but that wasnt the same as or as good as feeling it again when the orderly did show up at last ussmak all but tackled him let me have some more of that wonderful stuff you gave me the other day he exclaimed the orderly put up both hands in the fendingoff gesture the race used to show refusal cant do it he sounded regretful and sly at the same time a combination that should have made ussmak see warning lights but ussmak wasnt picking up subtleties not at that moment what do you mean you cant do it he stared in blank dismay did you use it all up dont tell me you used it all up as a matter of fact i didnt the orderly nervously turned his eyes this way and that keep your voice down will you friend listen theres something i didnt tell you about that stuff the other day and you better hear it what ussmak wanted to grab the cutpurse or malingerer or whatever he was and shake the truth or at least some more powder out of him here come on settle down friend the orderly saw would have needed to be blind to miss his agitation well what you need to know is this stuff the big uglies call it ginger so you know that too anyhow this stuff is under ban by order of the fleetlord ehat ussmak stared again why orderly spread clawed hands am i the fleetlord but you had this ginger did you say before ussmak said suddenly breaking regulations seemed a lot less heinous than it had the ban was in force then too the orderly sounded smug of course he had the green arm stripes to show what he thought of regulations he found inconvenient in one way or another up until the moment his tongue touched ginger ussmak had been a lawabiding male as most males of the race were looking back on things he wondered why what had obeying laws and following orders ever gained him only a close of radiation poisoning and the anguish of watching friends die around him but breaking a lifetime of conditioning did not come easy hesitantly he asked could you get me some even if even if it is banned the orderly studied him i might just might you understand be able to do that friend oh i hope you can ussmak broke in but if i do its gonna cost you the orderly finished unperturbed harry turtledove ussmak was confused what do you mean cost me just what i said the orderly spoke as if he were a hatchling still wet with the liquids from his egg you want more ginger friend youre gonna have to pay me for it ill take commissary scrip voluntary electronic transfer from your account to one i have set up big ugly souvenirs that i can resell all kinds of things im a flexible male youll find that out but you gave me the first bit of ginger for nothing ussmak said confused more than ever and hurt now too i thought you were just being kind helping me get through one of those endless days the orderlys mouth dropped open why shouldnt the first taste be free it shows you what ive got and you want what ive got dont you friend ussmak hated to be laughed at the orderlys arrogant assumption of superiority also angered him suppose i report you to the disciplinemasters well see how you laugh then by the emperor but the orderly retorted suppose you do yeah ill draw some more punishment and likely worse than this but you friend youll never taste ginger again not from me not from anybody else either if thats how you want it you go ahead and make that call never taste ginger again the idea appalled ussmak so much he never wondered if the orderly was telling the truth what did he know about ethics or lack of ethics among ginger sellers quickly he said how much do you want thought youd be sensible the orderly ticked off rates on his claws if its just another taste you want thatll cost you half a days pay but if you want a vial like the one you saw the other day with enough ginger in it for maybe thirty price eh tastes thats a tendays worth of pay cheap at the yes with little to spend his money on ussmak had most of it banked in the fleets payroll accounting system let me have a vial whats your account code so i can make the transfer transfer it to this code the orderly gave him the number written down on a scrap of paper ill be able to use it but the computer wont pick up that its mine how did you manage that ussmak asked genuinely curious males could be bought perhaps but how did you go about bribing a computer the orderly let his mouth fall open again but only a little he wanted ussmak to share the joke lets say theres somebody who works in payrolls and likes ginger just as much as you do im not gonna tell you any more than that but i dont need to tell you any more than that do i youre a clever male friend i dont have to draw you a circuit diagram well well ussmak thought he wondered how long this clandestine trade in ginger had hewn worldwar in the balance among the race and whether anyone in authority had the slightest notion it was there those were all interesting questions none though was as urgent to ussmak as getting his tongue on some of the precious powdered herb like any compartment in a starship his cubicle had a computer terminal he used his own account code to access his payroll records transferred a tendays salary to the code the orderly had given him there he said now when do i get my ginger eager arent you the orderly said lets see what i can do naive though he was ussmak belatedly realized the orderly might keep his money and give him nothing in return if that happened he resolved to tell the authorities about the ginger trade and take the cheater down into punishment with him but the orderly with the air of a stage magician producing a bracelet from someones snout handed him a vial full of what he craved he wanted to pop it open and start tasting it right then somehow though he didnt feel easy about doing it in front of the orderly he didnt want the fasttalking male to see what a hold he had on him he knew that was probably foolish how could the orderly not have a good notion of how much he desired ginger he held back even so he wondered about something else suppose i start running out of pay but still want more ginger what do i do then you could do without the cold callous ring in the orderlys voice chilled ussmak then the fellow said or you can find friends of your own to sell it to and use what you make to buy more for yourself i see ussmak wondered about that it might work for a while but befohtoo long it seemed to him every male in the invasion fleet would be jng ginger to every other male he started to ask the orderly about thati the fellow certainly acted as if he had all the answers but the male having made his profit left the healing cubicle without so much as a farewell ussmak opened the plastic vial poured a little ginger onto his palm as hed seen the orderly do his tongue flicked the precious powder into his mouth and again for a while he felt powerful clever capable as the wonderful sensation faded he realized hed do whatever he had to do to keep on having it as often as he could against that stark need the careful planning that had been a hallmark of the race for millennia suddenly was of small import if getting more ginger for himself meant peddling it to his friends he hesitated after the disasters that had befallen his landcruisers few friends were left alive but if he had to hed make more friends and then sell ginger to them he nodded to himself pleased he could still plan after all deliberately or not he turned both eyes away from the shape of his plan harry turtledove liu han looked down at her belly it did not bulge not yet but it would her homage to the moon had failed her breasts would never be large but they felt tight and full a new tracery of veins showed just below the skin her appetite was off she knew the signs she was with child she didnt think bobby fiore had noticed the absence of her monthly courses she wondered if telling him she was pregnant was a good idea she had no doubt the baby was his given the way she was caged here how could she but she remembered how even her true husband had lost interest in her while she was carrying their child if a chinese treated her so how would a roundeyed foreign devil react she was afraid to have to find out not too long after she began to worry the door to her bare cubicle hissed open little scaly devils with guns escorted bobby fiore into the room after so many trips where nothing untoward happened she thought human guards would have fallen under the spell of routine the scaly devils still acted as if they expected him or her to pull a gun out of the air and start shooting they carefully backed out of the room weapons at the ready all the time liu han got up from her mat walked up to embrace bobby fiore while the door was still sliding shut shed long since resigned herself to the little devils watching knowing everything she did besides she was starved for even the simplest contact with another human being his arms closed round her back he kissed her one hand slid down to cup a buttock his manhood stirred against her hipbone she smiled a little knowing he still wanted her was always reassuring his mouth might lie or even his hand but not that part of him the kiss went on he pulled her tightly to him when at last he had to breathe he asked her shall we now yes why not she answered if she did decide to tell him what better time than when he was lazy and happy after love and besides what else was there to do in here they lay down together his hands and mouth roamed her body he was she thought as she closed her eyes and let herself enjoy what he was doing a much better lover than he had been when the scaly devils first put the two of them in the same cubicle and made them couple shed found ways to show him some of what she wanted without hurting his pride while some hed picked up on his own all at once she gasped and quivered yes hed learned quite nicely and the hair of his beard and mustache added a little to what his tongue could do something she hadnt imagined when shed known only smoothfaced men he sat back on his haunches again he asked her no not right now she said after considering for a few seconds well then he said with a smile my turn worldwar in the balance she didnt mind taking him in her mouth he kept himself as clean as he could with only warm water for washing and she could tell how much pleasure she gave him a sudden thought flashed through her mind hed been teaching her while she was teaching him shed never noticed till now his breath caught as she pulled back his foreskin he was hot in her hand but almost as soon as her lips and tongue touched him she started to gag and had to pull away are you all right he asked surprised whats the matter liu han knew what the matter was just another proof she was pregnant she thought she hadnt been able to please her husband that way either not until she gave birth maybe that was one reason hed ignored her so much whats the matter bobby fiore said again she didnt know how to answer if she told him and he turned cold to her she didnt think she could stand that but hed find out before too long anyway she remembered how good having the initiative with yi min had felt even if only for a little while she also wondered for a very little while what the scoundrel was up to something to his own advantage she had no doubt that memory helped make up her mind she didnt know how to say baby in english or the little devils speech she knew bobby fiore wouldnt understand it in chinese she sat up used her hand to sketch the shape her belly would take in a few months he frowned he didnt get it she pantomimed cradling a newborn in her arms if that didnt put the idea across she didnt know what shed do eyes widened baby he said in english giving her the word he poi to her to himself made the cradling motion yes babee liu han repeated the word so shed remember it baby shed need to use it a lot in the months in the years to come you me baby then she waited to see how he would react at first he didnt seem sure what to do what to say he muttered something in english goddamn who woulda thought my first kid would be half chink she didnt completely follow but she thought he was talking more to himself than to her then he reached out and laid the palm of his hand on her stillflat belly really really she said she had no doubts if shed had any before and she hadnt not in truth choking on him blew them away how about that he said a phrase he used when he was thinking things over his hand slid lower down between her legs will you still want to instead of finishing the question with words he rubbed gently she wondered if he cared for her only because she gave him her body but the worry that raised was more than balanced by relief that he did still harry turtledove want her the other she could think about later for now she let her thighs fall open yes she said and did her best to prove it when he climbed on top of her they separated quickly after hed spent himself the little scaly devils kept the chamber too hot for them to lie entwined when they werent actually joined bobby fiore kept staring at her navel as if trying to peer inside her a baby he said how about that she nodded yes a baby not surprising when we do she twitched her hips so much i suppose not not when you think about it like that but it sure surprised me behind the hair that half masked him his face was thoughtful she wondered what was going on in his mind to make his eyebrows lower and come together the slight furrows on his forehead deepen at last he said i wish i could do more hell i wish i could do anything to take care of you and the kid when hed gone through the usual backing and filling to make her understand liu han looked down at the smooth gray mat on which she was sitting she didnt want him to see the tears that stung her eyes her husband had been a good enough man but she wondered if he would have said as much for a foreign devil to think that way shed known next to nothing about foreign devils before she was snatched up into this airplane that never landed and bobby fiore was making her see that most of what shed thought she knew was wrong what is it he asked her whats the matter now she didnt know how to answer him we both have to find a way to take care of as he had done before she set her hand in the space between her navel and the small patch of short black hair that covered her secret place yeah he said aint that a hell of a thing how are we gonna be able to do anything at all for junior cooped up here like we are as if to underscore his words the door to the cubicle opened a little scaly devil set down opened cans of food then backed away from liu han and bobby fiore she wondered if he thought it unsafe to turn around in their presence she found that ludicrous the more so as she knew herself to be so completely in the little devils power but the presence of armed devils in the doorway covering their comrade argued that they feared her kind too she thought that foolish but the little devils always did it the food as usual was not much to her taste some sort of salty pork in a square dark blue tin flavorless green beans the little yellow lumps bobby fiore called corn and canned fruit in a cloyingly sweet syrup she missed rice vegetables briefly steamed or stirfried all the flavorings shed grown up with soy sauce ginger different kinds of peppers she missed tea even more bobby fiore ate methodically and without complaint this meal like worldwar in the balance most theyd received came from supplies canned by his people liu han wondered if the foreign devils ever ate anything fresh then another more urgent concern suddenly replaced that idle curiosity she wondered if the pork and the rest were going to stay down she hadnt been sick during her first pregnancy but village gossip said every one was different saliva flooded into her mouth she gulped the tremor subsided you okay bobby fiore asked you looked a little green there for a minute liu hah puzzled at the idiom but he explained it a moment later you coming down with what do they call it morning sickness i dont know liu han answered faintly please dont talk about it while discovering that foreign devil women suffered from the same infirmity as chinese was interesting she didnt want to think about morning sickness thinking about it might make her she got to the plumbing hole just in time bobby fiore rinsed out the can the fruit had come in filled it with water and gave it to her so she could rinse her mouth he put an arm around her shoulders ive got two married sisters this happened to both of em when they were expecting i dont know if you want to hear that or not but they say misery loves company liu han did not understand all of what he said which was perhaps just as well she did appreciate the water after shed rinsed and spat a couple of times to take away the horrid taste she felt much better it wasnt like throwing up when she was ill now that her body had done what it needed to do it seemed willing to let her alone for a while i wish the lizards had a priest up here bobby fiore said i want the kid et brought up catholic i know im not the best christian there ever s but i try to do whats right liu han hadnt thought much of the christian missionaries shed seen in china how to raise the baby was however the least of her worries at the moment she said i wonder what the little scaly devils will do to me when they find out i am with child she did not think her fear was idle after all the little devils had snatched her from her village then from the prison camp while she was up here in the airplane that did not land theyd made her submit to several men and how relieved she was not to be carrying a baby by any of them they could do as they pleased with her do whatever interested them without caring in the least what she thought about what they wanted whatever they do theyll have to do it to both of us bobby fiore said stoutly she reached out and set a hand on his arm grateful he stood by her she would have been more grateful had she thought his brave words bore any relation to reality if the little devils decided to keep the two of them in separate cubicles what could he possibly do about it harry turtledove he said you ought to try and eat some more youve got company in there after all i suppose so dutifully but also cautiously liu han ate a little corn some of the beans and even the last mouthful of pork left in the tin she waited for her stomach to give them back but it stayed quiet having emptied once it now seemed willing to relent she hoped it would keep on being so forbearing then too late she realized the little scaly devils would not have to wait until her belly bulged to learn she was pregnant shed grown so resigned to the moving pictures they made of her not just when she was coupling but almost all the time that shed almost forgotten about them but if the scaly devils could sort through the mix of chinese english and their own language that she and bobby fiore spoke with each other theyd know at once and what would they do then if they were human theyd have known when my courses didnt come she thought but the devils hadnt noticed that bobby fiore didnt think they were devils at all but creatures from another world most of the time liu han remained convinced that was nonsense but now and then she wondered could real devils be so ignorant of matters earthly as her captors sometimes acted in the end what they were didnt much matter they had her and bobby fiore in their power either way liu han wondered if any of the other women theyd brought up to the airplane that never landed were also pregnant if theyd been used as she was some probably were she hoped so she didnt want to face the ordeal alone she glanced over at bobby fiore hed been watching her when her eyes met his he looked away wondering if ill throw up again liu han guessed she smiled wryly what did a man know about a woman who was with child not much which was why she hoped some of the others up here shared her predicament then all at once she clung to bobby fiore man though he was foreign devil though he was as she had not clung to him since the first day when he astonished her with his kindness he might not know much about expectant mothers but he was a veritable kung futze when set alongside even the wisest of the little scaly devils smoke and a blast of heat greeted david goldfarb when he walked into the white horse inn shut the bloody door three people yelled from three different parts of the pub goldfarb quickly obeyed then pushed his way through the crowd to get as close to the fireplace as he could the crackling wood fire the torches that blazed in place of electric lights dark for want of power took the white horse inn a long step back toward its medieval origins shadows jumped and flickered like live worldwar in the balance things and puddled in corners as if they might creep out and pounce at any moment goldfarb had never been afraid of the dark but these days he better understood why his ancestors might have been the reek of unwashed bodies was another step away from what had been the civilized norm goldfarb knew he added to it but what could he do hot water was impossible to come by and bathing in cold invited pneumonia besides when everyone stank no one in particular stank after a few breaths the nose accepted the smell as part of the background and forgot about it just as a radar operator learned to ignore echoes from the countryside in which his set was placed had been placed goldfarb corrected himself groundbased radars had saved britain against the germans but not against the lizards his own nervous forays in the belly of ted embrys lanc continued he hadnt been shot down yet which was about as much as he could say for the project the boffins were still trying to figure out whether the aircraftmounted radar used as intermittently as it had to be helped them shoot down more lizard planes sylvia snaked her way through the crush smiling at goldfarb she asked whatll it be dearie in the firelight her hair glowed like molten copper a pint of whatever you have he answered the white horse inn had never yet run out of beer but it never got in the same brew twice running any more as he spoke goldfarb slipped his arm around the barmaids waist for a moment she didnt pull away or slap his hand as she would have before he std climbing up into the cold and frightening night instead she leaneeloser tilted her head up to brush her lips against his and then slid away to find out what more drinkers wanted wanting her goldfarb thought had been more exciting than having her was or maybe hed just expected too much knowing she shared her favors with a lot of men hadnt bothered him when he was on the outside looking in it was different now that hed become one of those blokes himself he hadnt thought of himself as the jealous type he still didnt not really but he would have wanted more of her than she was willing to give not he admitted to himself that thinking of her bare under the covers didnt warm him when he sucked in frigid rubbertasting oxygen at angels twenty her white blouse reappeared from out of the dark forest of raf blue and civilian tweeds and serges she handed goldfarb a pint mug here ygo love tell me what you make of this she took a step back and cocked her head awaiting his reaction he took a cautious null some of the alleged bitters hed drunk since harry turtledove the lizards came made the earlier war beer seem ambrosial by comparison but his eyebrows went up in surprise at the rich nutty taste that filled his mouth thats bloody good he said amazed he sipped again thoughtfully smacked his lips its nothing ive drunk before but its bloody good whered our sainted landlord come by it sylvia brushed red wisps of hair back from her eyes he brewed it his own self go on goldfarb said in automatic disbelief he did sylvia insisted indignantly me and daphne we helped too its dead easy when you know how maybe after the war if there ever is an after the war ill start my own little brewery and put a pub in front id invite you there if i didnt think youd drink up my profit goldfarb emptied the mug with a practiced twist of the wrist if you do as well as this id surely try bring me another will you he kept staring after her once shed disappeared among the acres of dark cloth she was the first person hed heard speak of what might be after the war since the lizards came thinking of what to do once jerry was beaten was one thing but as far as he could see the fight against the lizards would go on forever unless it ended in defeat hullo old man said a blurry voice at his elbow he turned his head by the list jerome jones had developed hed taken on several pints of ale below the waterline and would likely start sinking at any moment the other radarman went on dyou know what i had with my spuds tonight baked beans thats what his eyes glittered in sodden triumph anything with spuds is reason enough to shout goldfarb admitted britain was hungry these days not only because the island could not grow enough to feed itself but also because lizard bombing of the railway net kept what food there was from moving around the country so you neednt feel so bloody smug about moving in with your bloody aircrew baked beans jones smacked his lips exhaled in goldfarbs direction he didnt smell like baked beans he smelled like beer im not smug jerome goldfarb said sighing its what i was ordered to do so i did it he knew the other radarman resented not being chosen to take a seat aloft in the lancaster not only did he crave the duty but being stuck on the ground he still had no luck with the white horse inns barmaids at the moment he was probably too drunk to do either of them justice even if she performed a striptease in front of him and then dragged him into the bushes he blinked stared at goldfarb as if he had no idea who his friend former friend goldfarb hoped not hoped his jealousy didnt run so deep was then his pale eyes focused again he said we had electricity in the barracks yesterday worldwar in the balance ingly random remark would lead and wishing sylvia would fetch him another pint so he wouldnt have to worry about it power had been out at his own quarters for several days yes we did jones said electricity in the barracks we had it why did i want to tell you that as if i knew goldfarb felt like shouting but jones though his own mental railway net had taken some bombing got his train of thought through i was listening to the shortwave thats it got warsaw in clear as day we did did you the words were the same as before but informed with a whole new meaning was russie on the air not a word from him not a word jones repeated himself with owlish solemnity thats what i wanted to tell you hes some sort of cousin of yours what yes im afraid so his grandmother was my grandfathers sister no one had been more astonished than goldfarb when his cousin surfaced as the lizards human spokesman unlike his gentile comrades hed believed most of what russie said about nazi horrors in warsaw though he remained unconvinced life under the lizards was as invigorating as russie painted it then a few weeks before his cousin disappeared from the airwaves as abruptly as hed arrived the lizards had blamed illness at first now they didnt bother saying anything which struck goldfarb as ominons bloody traitor maybe the sod sold them out too and they put paid to him for it jones mumbled goldfarb drew back a fist to smash him in the face no one he told himself former friend friend or not talked about his relatives like that and way with it but sylvia chose that moment to return ere now daviont even think of it she said sharply you start the fight youre out of the pub for good thems the rules and i wont see you any more the first threat was trivial the second goldfarb considered opened and lowered his hand sylvia put a new pint mug in it jones just stood swaying slightly not knowing how close hed come to getting his features rearranged thats better sylvia said goldfarb wasnt sure it was but finally decided smashing a helpless drunk didnt count toward upholding the family honor he emptied the third pint with one long pull sylvia surveyed him with a critical eye that should be about right for you unless you want to get as lost as he is what else have i to do goldfarbs laugh sounded thick even in his own ears as the potent brew swiftly did its work but the question despite its sardonic edge was serious without electricity radio and the cinema vanished as amusements and reading through long winter nights became next thing to impossible that left getting out among ones fellow men and going up into the sky again and again to be shot at brought a need for harry turtledove the release only alcohol or sex could give since slvia was working tonight she sighed it was not goldfarb thought as if he were the first lover shed seen who also had a need to get drunk probably not even the first tonight resentment flared in him then died if he was out for what he could get how could he blame her for acting the same way jerome jones nudged him is she good he asked as if sylvia werent standing beside him do you know what i mean his wink was probably meant to be that of a man of the world but the beery slackness to his features made it fail of its intention well i like that sylvia said with an indignant squeak she swung round on goldfarb are you going to let him talk about me that way probably goldfarb answered which made sylvia squeak again louder he waved his hands in what he hoped was a placating gesture you stopped a fight a few minutes ago and now you want to start one by way of reply sylvia stamped on his foot and then stamped off he didnt figure hed see that next pint let alone the inside of her bedroom any time soon try and figure women he thought he was no knight in shining armor and she was a long way from being a maiden whose virtue needed defending but if hed said that hed probably have got a knee in the family jewels not a spikeheeled foot on the instep jones nudged him again fight what fight he asked sounding more interested than he had been in how sylvia performed suddenly the absurdity of it all was too much for goldfarb he forced his way out through the crowd that jammed the white horse inn then stood on the sidewalk wondering where to go next the first breath of frosty air in his lungs the nip of night against his nose loudly insisted leaving had been a mistake but he couldnt make himself go back into the pub the night was clear stars burned in the dark sky more stars than he ever remembered seeing in the days before the blackout the milky way shone like sparkling sugar crystals spilled across a black the floor before the lizards came the stars had been friendly or at worst remote now they felt dangerous as any enemys homeland would to the south the gray stone pile of dover castle concealed some of those stars from view the saxons had had a fort there when louis viii failed to take the place in it likely staved off a french invasion of england henry viii had added to it and more brickwork had gone up against another feared french invader napoleon later in the nineteenth century a turret with a sixteeninch gun was added to ward the port from attack by sea but the turret designers never foresaw attack by air goldfarbs own radar masts had done more to defend dover to defend all of england from hitlers wrath than all the stone and brickwork put together against the worldwar in the balance lizards even the wizardry of radar seemed if not futile then surely inadequate a little red dot fainter than a summer glowworm came floating down st james street toward him his hand twitched he hadnt had a cigarette in it for a long time with imports even of food cut first by german submarines and then by lizard aircraft tobacco had all but disappeared during the depression people had scooped cigarette butts out of the gutter to smoke goldfarb was never reduced to that though the scorn hed felt the first time he saw it had dwindled first to pity and then to acceptance but that scavenging sprang from a shortage of money not a shortage of cigarettes now goldfarb called to whoever hid behind that seductively burning coal here friend have you got another fag you can sell me the smoker stopped the lit end of the cigarette glowed brighter for a moment then moved as its owner shifted it to the side of his mouth sorry chum im down to my last three and i wont sell em i couldnt use the money on anything id sooner have but you can take a drag off this one if you like goldfarb hesitated in a way that struck him as worse than nipping up fagends but the unseen smoker sounded kindly even if he wouldnt give up what he had hed share a little thanks goldfarb said and stepped quickly forward he held the single lungful of smoke as long as he could let it out with real regret the owner of the cigarette puffed again in the faint crimson glow his face was rapt with pleasure bloody war he said on the exhale too right goldfarb said he coughed however much he liked it his bodts out of the habit of smoking i wonder what well run short of nexttea maybe theres a horrible thought youre likely right though dont raise a lot of bloody tea in the fields of kent eh no goldfarb said morosely he wondered what hed do when his morning cuppa ran out hed do without was what hed do what did we do before there was tea drank beer i expect the smoker carefully extinguished the cigarette thats what im about to do now dont want to go in there with this lit though ive heard of men knocked over the head for a pipes orth of tobacco and i dont fancy it happening to me clever goldfarb said nodding theres enough smoke inside already that no one will smell it on you my very thought now the other man was just a voice in the darkness he went on i might want to try and get close to that redheaded barmaid they have here too whats her name sylvia goldfarb said dully sylvia thats right have you seen her without waiting for an an harry turtledove swer the smoker added id spend a cigarette on her i would he found the door to the white horse inn by ear slipped inside goldfarb stood out in the cold a few seconds longer then started the long hike back to his quarters he didnt think sylvia could be bought for a fag but what did it matter she wasnt his now and shed never really been his slaking your lust was all very well was when you got down to it better than all very well but you had to be sensible about it if that was all you were doing with a woman stopping oughtnt to be the end of the world far away like distant screams he heard the shriek of lizard aircraft engines his shiver had nothing to do with the cold he wondered who was up in the night sky with a balky radar and whether the chap would make it back to the ground again antiaircraft guns began their almost surely futile pounding goldfarb shivered again losing sylvia was not the end of the world off in the distance he could hear the sound the end of the world made ff in the distance antiaircraft guns yammered heinrich jager listened enviously if the wehrmacht had had guns like those red air force planes would have had a thin time of it indeed going up against the lizards the red air force still had a thin time of it but as the stutter of aa fire proved the russians kept coming jager had found out about that too in the eleven months before the lizards invasion shoved the war between national socialism and communism onto the back burner now the lizards were learning about soviet stubbornness jager hoped they enjoyed their education as much as hed liked his maybe the russians hadnt lied when they told him his horse had served as a cavalrymans mount it only twitched its ears at the distant gunfire of course how it would react if he had to shoot from its back was anyones guess with luck he wouldnt have to find out e sons of whores should have put me in a plane he said aloud as muclo hear the sound of his own voice in this snowy wilderness as for any other reason the horse snorted it didnt understand german theyd given him a list of russian commands for it but it seemed glad to be reminded it was carrying a human if ever there was a country for wolves this was it jager slapped his leaddined saddlebags with a gloved hand they held the reichs fair share of the metal the partisan raid had stolen from the lizards outside kiev and here he was alone on horseback carrying it to germany they want me to fail he said the horse snorted again he patted its neck they really do when he and foulmouthed max made contact with a red army unit still in the direct chain of command from moscow the soviets had been effusive in their praise and scrupulously exact in sharing out the precious booty germans and russians had combined to seize only afterward did things get difficult no hed been told unfortunately air transportation wasnt available harry turtledove yes the red army colonel understood his urgent need to return to germany but did he understand how likely he was to be shot down before he got there no the colonel could not in good conscience let him risk his life by flying now jager snorted louder than the horse had when a russian colonel says he wont risk a life you know somethings screwy somewhere against the germans in the last war and this one the russian way of putting out a fire was to throw bodies on it till it smothered with knees reins and voice jager urged the horse forward he hadnt done much riding since before world war i broke out but he still remembered the basics it was a very different business from traveling by panzer inside that heavy steel turret you felt cut off from the world and immune to whatever it might do to you unless it decided to hit you with a shell of course but on horseback you met the world face to face at the moment the world was snowing in jagers face the russians had given him a fur hat a padded jacket and felt boots so he wasnt chilly now that he was inside some of it he discovered for himself how good russian coldweather gear really was no wonder the ivans had given the wehrmacht such grief the winter before he leaned down spoke confidentially into the horses ear if anyone ever asks the kremlin about this theyll be able to say they gave me all the help they thought they could but i just didnt make it back to germany with this stuff he slapped a saddlebag again but do you know what russian horse im going to fool them im going to get there whether they want me to or not and if they dont like it they can go piss themselves for all i care the horse of course had no idea what he was talking about not only was it a dumb animal it was a russian dumb animal till recently it had been either pulling a plow for the enemy or carrying a red army cavalryman into action but for the time being its fate and his were bound together the snow muffled the animals hoofbeats its body heat warmed the insides of his thighs and his rear end his panzer iii he remembered fondly had had a heater that would warm all of him on the other hand he liked the horses grassy smell better than the oil petrol cordite reek of the panzer yes thats how the kremlin wants it horse he said they needed german help to get this metal but do they want the reich to have the benefit of it not on your life they dont they want to be the only ones who can make bombs like this yes they do they will use one on the lizards and if they beat the lizards wouldnt it be nice for them if they could hold one over germanys head too but i already told you horse i dont intend to let that happen worldwar in the balance he peered ahead through the spattering snow unfortunately what he intended to let happen and what would in fact happen were not necessarily one and the same he didnt think he was inside what had been soviet territory before the war any more but rather in what was formerly polishheld ruthernia much of that land after getting overrun first by the russians and then by the germans was now in the lizards hands and here as perhaps nowhere else on earth the lizards had their willing puppets their quislings the british would have called them jager thought with wry amusement in moscow hed listened to moishe russie on the shortwave a couple of times hed judged the man a hysteric a liar and a traitor to mankind now now he was not so sure every time he tried to laugh off what the jew said as just another atrocity story he kept remembering the scar on the side of maxs neck and the jewish partisans obscenely embellished tale of slaughter and horror at babi yar much as he wanted to he didnt think max lied and if maxs horror was true then moishe russies might be also riding a horse alone through winter gave you a chance to think maybe more of a chance than you really wanted what had the reich been doing behind the lines of the territory it held jager was a fieldgrade officer not a policymaker but german officers were supposed to think for themselves not blindly follow superiors orders like their soviet or lizard counterparts he could not for the life of him see how massacring jews moved the war effort forward even a centimeter massacring jews might in fact push the war effort back it had driven the polish jews who survived into the lizards arms a lot of those jews lay ben jager and the reich if they spotted him and let their new masteknow a german was loose on their territory if they did that the russians scheme would be realized in full stupid he muttered what did jews do in battle against the reich except get in the way like any other civilians he rode by a deserted farmhouse shook his head so much devastation how long would people take to recover from it even more to the point on what terms would they recover would they be their own mas or slaves to the lizards for untold centuries to come jager found no ters sure answer humanity had discovered ways to hurt the lizards but not to beat them not yet maybe he hoped he held a way to beat them in his saddlebags the road he was following took him into a stand of palebarked birches a few hundred meters past the farmhouse he unslung his rifle set it across his knees unpleasant things and even more unpleasant people could lurk among trees he showed his teeth in a notquitehumorless grin a few weeks before hed been one of those unpleasant people or so the lizards would have said harry turtledove a man stepped out from behind a tree trunk like jager he wore a mixture of russian and german winter gear also like jager he carried a rifle he didnt aim it at the german but he looked ready to use it he said something in polish jager didnt know any polish he weighed his chances as he reined in if he could get in a quick sure shot no guarantee while on horseback then set spurs to his mount he had a chance at getting away from this bandit the fellow might have been thinking along with him i wouldnt try that he said now in accented german or was it yiddish look behind you jager didnt look the man standing in the track laughed leaned his rifle against the nearest tree no trick go ahead and look this time jager did he could see two men both with guns he wondered how many he couldnt see he turned back to the fellow in front of him all right you have me he said equably what happens now he didnt know which nonplussed the fellow more his calm or his clear german the man grabbed his rifle a mauser just like jagers ti thought you were one of those nazi bastards he growled you dont ride like a pole or a russian i ought to shoot you now he was speaking yiddish jagers heart sank hold on yossel called one of the men in back of the german were supposed to take him in to if youre going to take me to the lizards do me the favor of shooting me instead jager broke in here was his worst nightmare coming to life around him if the lizards made him talk and who knew what the lizards could do along those lines he might imperil the russians efforts with the stolen metal and germanys would never be born why should we do any favors for a german yossel said jager heard snarls from behind him here indeed was pointless cruelty coming home to roost but jager had an answer because i fought alongside russian partisans most of them jews to get what im carrying away from the lizards and bring it back toward germany there it was done if these were truly the lizards creatures hed just done himself in but he was done in anyhow the instant the lizards found what his saddlebags held and if his captors were men yossel spat youre a fast liar i give you that much where was this on the road to treblinka seeing that that meant nothing to jager he spoke a word of pure german vernichtungslager extermination camp i dont know anything of extermination camps jager insisted the men behind him growled he wondered if they would shoot him before he could go on he spoke quickly i never heard of this trcblinka but one of the jews in the partisan band came back alive from a place called babi yar outside kiev he and i worked together for this common good worldwar in the balance something changed in yossels face so you know of babi yar do you nazi tell me what you think of it it sickens me jager answered at once i went to war against the red army not not he shook his head i am a soldier not a murderer as if a nazi could tell the difference yossel said scornfully but he did not raise his rifle he and the other well what were they soldiers partisans merely bandits talked back and forth partly in yiddish which jager could follow and partly in polish which he couldnt had the jew in front of him looked less alert jager might have made a break as it was he waited for his captors to figure out what to do with him after a couple of minutes one of the men behind him said all right off the horse jager dismounted his back itched uncontrollably he was ready to whirl and start shooting at the least untoward sound they would not find a passive victim if that was what they wanted but then the fellow he could not see said you can sling that rifle if you care to jager hesitated the invitation could have been a ruse to relax him for easier disposal but the jews already had him at their mercy and no fighting man with even a gram of sense left an enemy armed maybe theyd decided he wasnt altogether an enemy then he slid the sling strap over his shoulder asked what do you intend to do with me we havent decided yet yossel said for now youll come with us well take you to someone who can help us figure it out jagers face must have said something for yossel added no not a lizard one of us all right jager said but bring the horse too what he has in these saddlebags is more important than i am and your officer will need to kno wdti asked the fellow whod told jager to get off the horse he didnt want the jews to think he was just someone to be robbed no not gold if the nkvd doesnt miss its guess i have there some of the same kind of stuff as the lizards used to bomb berlin and washington that got a reaction all right wait a minute yossel said slowly the russians are letting you take this this stuff to germany how does that happen why dont they keep it all themselves he meant if they could have kept it all they would have im sure jager answered smiling but as i said it was a joint german soviet combat group that won this material and however much reason the russians have to dislike us germans they know also our scientists are not to be despised and so he slapped a saddlebag further colloquy now almost entirely in polish among the jews finally yossel said all right german if nothing else youve confused us come along you and your horse and whatever hes carrying harry turtledove you have to keep me out of the lizards sight jager insisted yossel laughed no no we just have to keep you from being noticed its not the same thing at all get moving weve already wasted too much time here on jabber the jew proved to know what he was talking about over the next few days jager saw more lizards at closer range than he ever had before not one even looked at him they all assumed he was just another militiaman and so to be tolerated encounters with armed poles were more alarming although hed grown a graystreaked beard jager was ironically aware he looked not the least bit jewish dont worry about it yossel told him when he said as much theyll think youre just another traitor that stung jager said you mean the way the rest of the world thinks of you polish jews hed been with the band long enough now to speak his mind without fearing someone would shoot him for it yes about like that yossel answered calmly he was hard to rile of course what the rest of the world still doesnt believe is that we had good reason to like the lizards better than you nazis if you know about babi yar you know about that since he did know about that and didnt like what he knew jager changed the subject some of those poles looked like theyd just as soon start shooting at us as not they probably would they dont like jews either yossels voice was matteroffact but they dont dare because the lizards have given us enough in the way of weapons to hurt them bad if they play their old games with us jager chewed on that for a while the jew frankly admitted his kind depended on the lizards yet hed had endless chances to betray jager to them and hadnt done it jager admitted to himself that he didnt understand what was going on with luck hed find out that evening they came to a town bigger than most of the others through which theyd passed whats the name of this place jager asked at first he thought yossel sneezed then the jew repeated himself hrubieszw the town boasted cobblestone streets threestory buildings with castiron awnings and a central boulevard that had a median strip planted with trees perhaps to achieve a parisian effect having seen the real paris jager found the imitation laughable but kept that to himself yossel went up to one of the threestory buildings spoke in yiddish to the man who answered his knock he turned to jager you go in here take your saddlebags with you well get your horse out of town a strange animal that stays around is plenty to make people start asking questions worldwar in the balance jager went in the grayhaired jew who stood aside to let him pass said hello friend im lejb what shall i call you while youre here ch heisse heinrich jdiger jager answered hed grown resigned to the looks of horror he got for speaking german but it was his only fluent language and for better or worse he was a german he could hardly deny it stiffly he said tti hope my presence will not disturb you too much sir a nazi in my house they want to put a nazi in my house lejb was not talking to jager the german didnt think he was talking to himself either whom did that leave god maybe as if wound into motion by a key lejb bustled over and shut the door even a nazi should not freeze especially if i would freeze with him with what seemed a large effort of will he made himself look at jager will you drink tea and theres potato soup in the pot if you want it yes please thank you very much the tea was hot the potato soup both hot and filling lejb insisted on giving jager seconds the jew apparently could not force himself to be a poor host but he would not eat with ager he waited until the german finished before feeding himself that pattern persisted over the next two days jager noticed he got the same chipped bowl the same cup at every meal he wondered if lejb would throw them away once hed left along with his bedding and everything else hed touched he didnt ask for fear the jew would tell him yes just when he started to wonder if yossel and the rest of the jewish fighters had forgotten about him his first captor returned again under ovealkness yossel said somebody here wants to see you nazi from nlike from lejb the word had somehow lost most of its sting as if it were a label and nothing more an unfamiliar jew stepped into the living room of lejbs house he was fair and thin and younger than jager would have expected for someone obviously important enough to be sent for he did not offer to shake hands so youre the german with the interesting package are you he said speaking german himself rather than yiddish yes jager said twho are you the newcomer smiled thinly call me mordechai by the way yossel started in surprise that might even have been his real name bravado jager thought the more the german studied mordechai the more impressed he grew young yes but an officer all the way those light eyes were hooded and alert alive with calculation if hed worn german fieldgray hed have had a colonels pips and his own regiment before he hit forty jager recognized the type the jews had themselves a hotshot here the hotshot said i gather youre a panzer soldier and that youve sto harry turtledove len something important to the lizards what ive heard from yossel here is interesting but its also secondhand tell it to me yourself jager just a minute jager said yossel bristled but mordechai only grunted waiting for him to go on he did you jews cooperate with the lizards yet now you seem ready to betray them show me i can trust you not to hand me straight over to them if we wanted to do that we could have done it already mordechai pointed out as for how and why we work with the lizards hmm think of it like this back three winters ago russia swamped the finns when you nazis invaded russia finland was happy enough to ride on your coattails and take back its own but do you think the finns go around yelling heil hitler all day long mmm maybe not jager admitted and so and so we helped the lizards against you nazis but for our own reasons survival for instance not theirs we dont have to love them now ive told my story and more than you deserve you tell yours jager did mordechai interrupted every so often with sharp probing questions the germans respect for him grew at every one hed figured the jew would know something of war and especially partisan operationshe had him pegged for a high military official but he hadnt figured mordechai would know so much about the loot he carried in his saddlebags he soon realized the jew though hed never seen the mudencrusted chunks of metal understood them better than he did himself when jager was through the felt squeezed dry mordechai steepled his fingers and stared up at the ceiling you know before this war started i worried more about what marx thought than about god he remarked his speech grew more guttural his vowels shifted so jager had to think to follow him hed fallen out of german into yiddish he went on ever since you nazis shut me up in the ghetto and tried to starve me to death ive had my doubts about the choice i made now im sure i was wrong why now in particular jager asked because i would need to be the wisest rabbi who ever lived to decide whether i ought to help you germans fight the lizards with their own filthy weapons yossel nodded vehemently i was thinking the same thing he said mordechai waved him to silence i wish this choice fell on someone besides me all i wanted to be before the war was an engineer his gaze and jagers clashed swordlike all i am now thanks to you germans is a fighting man thats all ive ever been jager said once before another war hed had hopes of studying biblical archaeology but hed learned in the trenches of france what he was good at and how much the fatherland needed folk with talents like his set against that knowledge biblical archaeolokґ was small beer worldwar in the balance and so on us the future turns mordechai mused i dont know about you jager it was the first time hed used the germans name but i wish my own shoulders were wider yes jager said mordechai eyed him again this time with a soldiers calculation simplest would be to shoot you and dump your body into the vistula so many have gone in that no one would notice one more toss your saddlebags in after you and id never have to wake up sweating in the night for fear of what you damned nazis were going to do with this stuff youve stolen no instead youd wake up sweating in the night that no one could do anything to fight the lizards jager tried to keep his voice and manner calm hed hazarded his life often enough on the battlefield but never like this it felt more like poker than war he tossed another chip into the pot and no matter what you do to me stalin already has his share of the loot will you also sweat for what the bolsheviks do with it as a matter of fact yes mordechai sighed a sound that seemed to flow out from his whole body not just his chest better this choice should have fallen to solomon the wise than a poor fool like me then we would have some hope of a decision rightly taken he started to sigh again but the noise turned into a sudden sharp inhalation halfway through when he looked at jager now his eyes blazed yes the german thought an officer indeed one men would follow into hellmaybe solomon shows the way after all mordechai said softly what do you mean but even if he hadnt thought of archaeology in years jager knew his bible well enough of themselves his eyes went to the lebags leaning against the wall you want to cut the baby in half do yl thats just what i want to do jager mordechai said just exactly all right keep some of what you have you nazi bastards are smart i give you that maybe youll figure out what to do with it but someone besides you and the russians ought to have a chance with it too whom did you have in mind you jager asked the idea of polish jews with such horror weapons alarmed him as much as the prospect of the germans with them appalled mordechai these jews had too good a reason to want to use it on germany but mordechai shook his head no not us we havent the men we havent the research facilities wed need to figure out what wed have to do and thered be too many lizards underfoot for us to keep the work secret who then jager said i was thinking the americans mordechai answered theyve lost washington so they know in their bellies this thing is real for all we know they were working on it already they have enough scientists there plenty who fled to america away from you fascists by all ac harry turtledove counts and its big like russia theyd have plenty of places to hide from the lizards while they figured things out jager thought about that he had an instinctive reluctance to hand over strategic material to the enemybut compared to the lizards the americans were allies and even in terms of purely human politics the more counterbalances to moscow the better but one large question remained how do you propose to get this stuff across the atlantic hed expected mordechai to blanch but the jew was unperturbed that we can manage easier than youd think the lizards dont trust us as far as they used to but we can still move pretty freely through the countryside and we can get to the sea then what jager said put your saddlebag on a freighter and sail for new york you say it as a joke but i think we could do it mordechai answered theres a surprising lot of water traffic going on the lizards dont automatically attack it the way they do trains and lorries but no i hadnt intended to put it on a freighter we have ways of getting a submarine here without the lizards noticing weve done it a couple of times already and it ought to be good for one more run a submarine american jager thought no more likely british the baltic had been a german lake a few months earlier a british uboat captain would have been suicidal to poke his periscope into it now though germany had more urgent worries than british subs a submarine this time jager made it a statement you know that might be crazy enough to work oh were crazy all right mordechai said if we werent crazy before the war you nazis made us that way his laugh was full of selfmockery and now i must be crazier than ever dickering to help nazis make something that might be the end of the world only some ends are worse than others eh yes jager felt just as strange dickering with communists and now jews now that he was close to germany again he suddenly wondered how his superiors and the gestapo would view his dealings since the lizards blew his panzer iii out from under him but unless the world had turned completely insane what was in the leadlined saddlebag would redeem almost any amount of ideological contamination almost we are agreed mordechai asked we are agreed jager said afterward he was never sure which of them first stuck out a hand they both squeezed hard atvar was busy checking the latest reports on how the race was coping with the insane winter weather of tosev when a musical note from his computer reminded him of an appointment he spoke into the intercom mike drefsab are you there worldwar in the balance exalted fleetlord i am came the reply from an antechamber of course no one would presume to make the commander of the races force wait but formality persisted nonetheless enter drefsab atvar declared and pressed a button on his desk that made it possible for the operative to enter the fleetlord hissed in shocked dismay when drefsab came into the office the investigator had been one of his brightest males infiltrating trahas staff to try to learn how the shiplord was spying on him and also dueling with big ugly intelligence agents who lacked his tools but made up for that with deceit unmatched even around the emperors court hed always been dapper and crisp now his body paint was smeared his scales dull his pupils dilated by the emperor whats happened to you atvar exclaimed by the emperor exalted fleetlord i find i must report myself unfit for duty drefsab answered casting down his eyes even his voice sounded as if he had rust in the works somewhere i can see that atvar said but whats wrong how have you become unfit i took it in my mind exalted fleetlord to investigate how traffic in the tosevite herb called ginger was affecting our males i realize i did so without orders but i judged the problem to be of sufficient importance to justify the breach in conduct go on atvar said males who did things without orders were vanishingly rare in the race though that kind of initiative seemed all too common among the big uglies if this was what happened when the race tried to match the tosevites for sheer energy the fleetlord wished his star shipd never left home fsab said exalted fleetlord to evaluate both the traffic in ginger and the reasons for its spreading use i deemed it necessary to seek out and sample the herb for myself i regret to have to inform the fleetlord that i myself have fallen victim to its addictive properties males of the races primitive ancestors had been hunters carnivores atvar bent his fingers into the position that gave his claws the best opportunity to rend and tear he did not need more bad news not now tosev and especially winter on tosev s northern hemisphere were giving him plenty of bad news by themselves he had to say something he didnt know what at last he tried how could you do such a stupid thing knowing your value to the race drefsab hung his head in shame exalted fleetlord in my arrogance i assumed i could investigate could even sample the illicit herb with no ill effects i was unfortunately mistaken even now the craving burns in me what is it like to be under the influence of this ginger substance the fleetlord had read reports but his confidence in reports was not what harry turtledove it had been back home the report on tosev for instance had made it sound like an easy conquest i feel bigger than myself better than myself as if i am capable of undertaking anything drefsab said when i dont have that feeling i long for it with every scale of my skin does this druginduced feeling have any basis in reality atvar asked that is viewed objectively do you in fact perform better while taking ginger than without it he had a moment of hope if the noxious powder turned out to be a valuable pharmaceutical some good might yet spring from drefsabs initiative but the agent only let out a long whistling sigh i fear not exalted fleetlord i have examined work i produced shortly after tasting ginger it contains more errors than i would normally find acceptable i made them but simply failed to notice them because of the euphoria the drug induces and when i have not tasted ginger in some time exalted fleetlord it is very bad then very bad atvar echoed in a hollow voice how do you respond to this craving drefsab do you indulge it at every opportunity or do you resist as best you can the latter drefsab answered with a certain melancholy pride i go as long as i can between tastes but that period seems to decrease as time passes and i am also at less than maximum effectiveness in the black interval between tastes yes although with regret atvars thoughts now turned purely pragmatic how could he get the best use out of this irrevocably damaged male decision came quickly if you find yourself more valuable to the race than without taking it use it at whatever level you find necessary for your continued function ignore all else i so order you for the good of the race it shall be done exalted fleetlord drefsab whispered atvar went on i further order you to record in diary form all your reactions to this ginger physicians views of the problem are necessarily external your analysis from the ginger users perspective will furnish them valuable data it shall be done drefsab repeated more heartily now further continue your investigation into the trafficking in this drug bring down as many of those involved in the foul trade as you can it shall be done exalted fleetlord drefsab said for the third time for a moment he sounded like the keen young male the hunting solmek he had always been for atvar but then he wilted before the fleetlords eyes asking piteously exalted fleetlord if i bring them all down whence shall my further supply of ginger come atvar hid his disgust seize all you need to ensure your own stock for as long as you wish tn ffintinlp rn r lk k ti worldwar in the balance drefsab on ginger was likely to make a better agent than he would pining for the herb and was also likely to remain a better agent than any male no matter how sober he appointed in his place to salve his conscience atvar added our physicians will continue to seek a cure for this tosevite herb spirits of dead emperors grant they find it soon aye exalted fleetlord even now i crave with a shudder drefsab broke off in the middle of the sentence have i the exalted fleetlords gracious leave to depart yes go on drefsab and may emperors past look kindly on you drefsabs salute was ragged but the male seemed to pull himself together as he left the fleetlords office if nothing else atvar had imbued him with fresh purpose the fleetlord himself was depressed as he returned to his paperwork i hate this cursed world he thought one way or another it is made only for driving the race mad his treatment of drefsab left him no happier subordinate males owed their superiors obedience superiors in turn were bound to grant those males under them support and consideration instead hed treated drefsab exactly as he would have handled a useful but inexpensive tool hed seen the cracks but hed go on using it till it broke then worry about acquiring another one back home hed not have used a male so back home he had luxuries long forgotten on tosev not least among them time to think the race made it a point never to do anything without due reflection when you planned in terms of millennia what was a day or a year more or less but the big uglies did not work that way and forced haste and change on him because they were so cursedly mutable themselves eyve corrupted me along with drefsab he said mournfully and wenjack to work what is this thing anyway sam yeager asked as he lifted a piece of lab apparatus off a table and stuck it in a cardboard box a centrifuge enrico fermi answered which left yeager little wiser than he had been before the nobel laureate crumpled old newspaper not much in the way of new newspaper around these days and padded the box with it dont they have uh centrifuges where were going yeager said fermi threw his hands in the air in a gesture that reminded yeager of bobby fiore who knows what they have the more we are able to bring the less we shall have to rely on that which is and remains uncertain thats true professor but the more we bring the slower were liable to move and the bigger the target we make for the lizards what you say is so but it is also a chance we must take if having relocated we cannot perform the work required of us we might as well harry turtledove have stayed here in chicago we flee not just as individuals but as an operating laboratory fermi said youre the boss yeager closed the box sealed it with masking tape pulled a grease pencil out of his shirt pocket how do you spell centrifuge when fermi told him he wrote it on the top and two sides of the box in big black letters he ran out of tape while sealing another centrifuge so he went down the hall to see if he could snag another roll the supply room had plenty these days the metallurgical laboratory got the best of whatever was left in chicago he was heading back to give fermi more help when barbara larssen came out of a nearby room the frosted glass window in the door from which she emerged was striped with tape to keep splinters from flying if a bomb hit nearby hi sam barbara said hows it going not bad he answered pausing for a moment tired how about you about the same she looked tired from somewhere shed got hold of some face powder but it couldnt hide the dark circles under her eyes the slump in her shoulders had nothing to do with the stack of file folders she carried it spoke more of not enough sleep too much work too much fear yeager hesitated then asked any good news about jens you mean barbara shook her head ive just about given up oh i still go through the motions i just now left a note with andy reilly do you know andy saying where we were going to give to jens in case he ever does come back the janitor you mean sure i know andy thats a good idea hes reliable yeager said where are we going nobodys bothered to tell me of course im just a cook and bottlewasher around here so its not surprising denver barbara said if we can get there denver sam repeated yeah i played there i was with omaha i think that had been in the days before he broke his ankle when the class a western league was a step up on a road he hoped would lead to the big leagues somehow hed stayed even when he knew the road went nowhere he shook his head forcing his thoughts back to the hereandnow why denver well have the devils own time getting there from here i think thats part of the idea barbara said the lizards havent bothered it much especially since winter started well be safer there with a better chance to work if as i said we can get there yeager noticed that as i said from his lips it would have come out like i said but then he hadnt done graduate work in english they probably ran you out of the university on a rail if you used bad grammar it had worldwar in the balance to be a sin on the order of trying to go from second to third on a ball hit too short he snorted he still had baseball on the brain barbara said listen id better take these downstairs she hefted the folders ive got to get back to it too yeager said you take care of yourself you hear ill see you on the convoy okay sam thanks she walked down the corridor toward the stairway sams eyes followed her too bad about her husband he thought now even shed started admitting to herself that he wasnt coming back but even worn as she was she remained too pretty and too nice to stay a widow forever yeager told himself hed do something about that if and when he got the chance not now back to work he taped up the second centrifuge box then grunting piled both of them onto a dolly he set the sole of his army boot against the bar in the back tilted the dolly into the carrying position hed learned the trick as a moving man one offseason hed learned how to get a loaded dolly downstairs too backwards was slower but a lot safer and from what fermi said every gadget here had to be treated as irreplaceable he was sweating from effort and concentration both by the time he got down to ground level camouflage netting covered a large expanse of lawn in front of eckhart hall under it with luck concealed from lizard fighterbombers huddled a motley collection of army trucks moving vans stakebed pickups buses and private cars uniformed guards with loaded rifles and fixed bayonets surrounded them not so much to keep them from being stolen as from having their gas tanks siphoned dry they were all full up and in warravaged chicago gasoline was more precious thanies didnt begin to understand all the things people were stowing in them one olivedrab studebaker truck was full of nothing but blocks of black smeary stuff each with a number neatly stenciled onto the end it was as if somebody had taken apart a threedimensional jigsaw puzzle and planned on putting it back together once he got to colorado but what was the thing for he turned and asked one of the men whod got stuck behind him in a stairway traffic jam the fellow said its graphite to moderate the pile slow down neutrons so uranium atoms have a better chance of capturing them oh the answer left yeager less than enlightened he clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth not for the first time he found that reading science fiction while it put him ahead of where he would have been without it didnt magically turn him into a physicist too bad went barbara came outside with another load of file folders yeager back and gave the graphite blocks another look so he could walk back up harry turtledove stairs with her if she noticed what he was doing she didnt complain but let him fall into step beside her theyd just got to the doorway when antiaircraft guns began to pound off to the west in moments the noise spread through the city above it through it came the scream of lizard planes jet engines and then the flat hard cruump of bombs going off barbara bit her lip those are close she said mile maybe two north yeager said like everyone else in chicago hed become a connoisseur of explosions he put a hand on barbaras shoulder happy for the excuse to touch her you get under a roof shrapnelll start falling any minute and you arent wearing a tin hat he rapped his own helmet with his knuckles right on cue pieces of antiaircraft shell casing pattered down like hail barbara scurried inside eckhart hall you didnt want to be under one when it landed she said those were between here and navy pier i hope they dont fubar the evacuation route i hope they dont too sam stopped and stared you he said severely have been listening to too many soldiers what oh barbaras eyes widened in a good simulation of innocence it means fouled up beyond all recognition doesnt it fouled up yeah right among other things the noise yeager made was hmf cough half chuckle barbara stuck out her tongue at him laughing they climbed the stairs together more lizard planes hit chicago that afternoon and more again after night fell they hadnt pounded the city so hard in a while yeager wished for bad weather which sometimes kept the enemy away faint in the distance he heard the wailing siren of a fire engine that still had fuel he wondered if the firemen would find any water pressure when they got where they were going by the next morning the loading was done yeager was crammed into a bus along with a bunch of boxes that could have held anything a couple of other soldiers and with ullhass and ristin the two lizard pows were coming along to denver for whatever help they could give the met lab project though swaddled in navy peacoats that hung like tents on their slight frames they still shivered the bus had several broken windows it was as cold inside as out all over the lawn men grumbled about the cut fingers and mashed toes theyd gotten loading the convoy then one after another engines started up the roar and vibration sank deep into yeagers bones soon hed be on the road again after god only knew how many trips between towns getting rolling felt good felt normal maybe he was a nomad by nature diesel and gasoline fumes wafted into the bus yeager coughed he worldwar in the balance didnt remember the stink being so bad but then lately he hadnt smelled it much not a lot was on the roads these days to make a stink inside of two gear changes yeager was convinced he had more business behind the wheel than the clod driving the bus no he thought with a touch of pride any fool can drive guarding the lizards was more important to the war effort the convoy rumbled north up university to fiftyfirst then swung left one vehicle at a time the streets were mostly clear of debris and not too bumpy rammed earth and rubble filled bomb craters and the subsidence caused by ruptured water mains the sidewalks were something else again bulldozers and pickandshovel crews had shoved up onto them all the garbage that had clogged the streets these trucks were going to get through no matter what to help make sure it got through soldiers had nests in the rubble and stood menacingly at streetcorners here and there colored faces eyes huge and white within them stared at the passing traffic from windows of houses and apartment buildings bronzeville chicagos black belt began bare blocks from the university and indeed almost lapped around it the government feared its negro citizens only a little less than it feared the lizards before the aliens came a quarter of a million people had been jammed into bronzevilles six square miles a lot fewer than that were there now but the district still showed the signs of crowding and poverty the storefront churches the shops advertising mystic potions and charms the little lunch counters whose windows advertised chitlins and sweet potato pie hot fish and mustard greens poor mans fare yes and poor black mans fare to boot but the thought of fresh greens and hth was plenty to set yeagers stomach rumbling hed been living out of as too long that was even worse than the greasy spoons hed haunted as he bounced from one minorleague town to the next some of those diners he hadnt thought anything could be worse why we leave this place where we so long stay ristin said i like this place as much as can like any place on this cold cold world where we go now is warmer he and ullhass both swiveled their eyes toward yeager waiting hopefully on his reply they squeaked in disappointment when he said no i dont think it will be much warmer he didnt have the heart to tell them it would be colder for a while once on the great lakes theyd almost certainly sail north and then west because the lizards held big stretches of indiana and ohio and controlled most of the mississippi valley the colder the country the better as far as evading them went yeager continued as for why were leaving were tired of having your people drop bombs on us thats why we tired of that too ullhass said hed learned to nod like a human harry turtledove being to emphasize his words so had ristin their heads bobbed up and down together i wasnt real fond of it myself yeager said adding the lizards emphatic cough he liked the way it served as a vocal exclamation point his two charges let their mouths fall open they thought his accent was funny it probably was he laughed a little too he and ullhass and ristin had rubbed off on one another more than he would have imagined possible back when he became their link to humankind the convoy chugged past the domed byzantine bulk of temple isaiah israel then past washington park barebranched and brown and dappled with snow it swung right onto michigan avenue picking up speed as it went there were advantages to being the only traffic on the road and not having to worry about stop lights though it was winter though the lizards had cut off most rail and truck transport into chicago the stink of the stockyards lingered wrinkling his nose yeager tried to imagine what it had been like on a muggy summer afternoon no wonder colored folk had taken over bronzeville they usually ended up settling in places no one else much wanted he also wondered that jens and barbara larssen had chosen to get an apartment somewhere near here maybe they hadnt known chicago well when they moved maybe they wanted to be close to the university for the sake of his work but yeager still thought barbara lucky to have had no trouble getting back and forth each day at the corner of michigan and forty seventh a sign proudly proclaimed michigan boulevard garden apartments the brick buildings looked as if they held more people than some of the towns yeager had played for one of them had taken a bomb hit and fallen in on itself more bomb craters scarred the gardens and courts around the apartments skinny colored kids ran back and forth running like banshees what they do ristin asked probably playing lizards and americans sam answered it could be cowboys and indians though he spent the next few minutes trying to get the alien to understand what cowboys and indians were to say nothing of why they were part of a game he didnt think he had much luck the convoy kept rolling north up michigan avenue before long though the bus yeager was riding slowed then stopped what the hells going on the driver said this was supposed to be a straight shot its the army one of the other passengers explained the next time something goes just according to plan will be the first the fellow wore a majors gold oak leaves so no one presumed to argue with him besides he was obviously right after a minute or so the bus started rolling again more slowly now yeager leaned out into the aisle to peer through the front windows at the worldwar in the balance corner of michigan and eleventh soldiers waved vehicle after vehicle onto the latter street the driver opened the front door with a hiss of compressed air what got screwed up now he called to one of the men on trafficcop duty why you movin us offa michigan the soldier jerked a thumb back over his shoulder you cant get through no more on michigan the goddamn lizards knocked down the stevens hotel this morning and theyre still clearin the bricks and shit away so what am i supposed to do now go over a block then up wabash to lake you can get back onto michigan there okay the driver said and swung through the turn no sooner had he rolled past the womans club building than more soldiers waved him right onto wabash one block west st marys church there had had its spire blown off the cross that had topped it lay half on the sidewalk half in the gutter since wabash hadnt been cleared to let the convoy get through the going was slow and bumpy once the bus had to jounce up onto the sidewalk to get around a crater in the road two empty gas stations one shell the other sinclair stood across the street from each other at wabash and balbo a dusty sign in front of the sinclair station advertised its regular gasoline six gallons for ninetyeight cents tax paid a fifteenfoottall plywood cutout of a waving man in a parking attendants uniform plugged the parking lot next to the gas station twentyfive cents for one hour or less but for parked cars and rubble the lot was empty ger shook his head up until the lizards came life in the united states ad been within shouting distance of normal war or no war now hed seen newsreel film of wreckage in europe and china seen blackandwhite images of stunned people trying to figure out how to go on with their lives after theyd lost everything and often everybody that mattered to them he thought theyd sunk in but the difference between seeing pictures of war and having war brought home to you was like the difference between seeing a picture of a pretty girl and going to bed with her the elevated train curled round the corner of wabash and lake lizard bombs had torn great gaps in the steelandwood superstructure the trains in chicago did not run on time not any mere back onto michigan avenue half a block north of lake the forty story carbide and carbon building had been a chicago landmark with its black marble base dark green terra cotta walls and gilded trim now scorch marks ran up its flanks piles of the wall hell pieces of the building were chewed out by bomb hits as if a dog the size of king kong harry turtledove had tried it for taste the glass from hundreds of windows had been swept out of michigan avenue but still glittered on the sidewalk the bus driver was evidently a native chicagoan just past the carbide and carbon building he pointed to the opposite side of the street and said this here used to be the north michigan building now it aint now it aint a mournful pronouncement but accurate enough the pile of debris marble facings wood floors endless cubic yards of reinforced concrete twisted steel girders beginning to be mangy with rust now that they were open to the snow and rain had been a building once it wasnt any more nor was the doubledecked michigan avenue bridge a bridge any more army engineers had run a temporary pontoon bridge across the chicago river to get the convoy to the other side it would come down again as soon as the last truck rattled over it if it didnt the lizards would blast it in short order armchair strategists said the lizards didnt really understand what all human beings used boats for yeager hoped they were right hed been strafed in a train the night the aliens came crashing down on earth getting strafed on board ship would be ten times worse no place to run no place to hide but if the lizards didnt understand boats they sure knew what bridges were all about looking west as he bounced over the steel plates of the makeshift span the engineers had thrown up yeager saw that bridges had leapt over the chicago river at every block they didnt overleap it now every one of them like the michigan avenue bridge had been bombed into oblivion aint it a bitch the driver said as if reading his mind this here bridge was only about twenty twentyfive years old my old man was back from france to watch em open it up fuckin waste if you ask me on the north side of the river the gleaming white wrigley building looked intact but for broken windows across the street though the tribune tower had been gutted yeager found a certain amount of poetic justice in that even when reduced to a skinny weekly by paper shortages the chicago tribune hadnt stopped laying into roosevelt for not doing something about the lizards just what he was supposed to be doing was never quite clear but he obviously wasnt doing it so the paper piled scorn on him yeager felt like thumbing his nose at the ruined building about all anyone could do about the lizards was fight them as hard as he could for as long as he could the united states was doing as well as any other country on earth and better than most but sam wondered if that would be enough along with the rest of the convoy the bus turned right on grand av worldwar in the balance enue toward the navy pier the morning sun gleamed off lake michigan which seemed illimitable as the sea the pier stretched more than half a mile into the lake the bus rattled past sheds once full of merchandise now mostly bombedout shells at the east end of the pier were playgrounds a dance hall an auditorium a promenade all reminders of happier times waiting at what had been the excursion landing was a rusty old freighter that looked like the maritime equivalent of the beatup buses yeager had been riding all his adult life also waiting were a couple of companies of troops antiaircraft guns poked their noses into the sky if lizard planes swooped down on the convoy theyd get a warm reception even so yeager wished the guns were someplace else from everything hed seen they were better at attracting the lizards than shooting them down but he wasnt the one who gave the orders except to his lizardy charges come on boys he told them and let them precede him off the bus and onto the pier at his urging ullhass and ristin headed toward the freighter on whose side was painted the name caledonia the gathered soldiers swarmed onto the convoy vehicle like army ants yeager smiled as the comparison struck him one truck after another was emptied and sped back down navy pier toward chicago working transport of any sort was precious these days watching them head west yeager got an excellent view of the proud city skyline and of the gaps the lizards had torn in it barbara larssen came over and stood by him they just want us small fry out of the way she said unhappily they put the physicists on board first and now the equipment they need afterward if theres any roozlnd any time theyll let people like us get on ven the military needs of the moment those priorities made sense to yeager but barbara wanted sympathy not sense he said you know what they say theres the right way the wrong way and the army way she laughed maybe a little more than the tired joke deserved a chilly gust of wind off the lake tried to flip up her pleated skirt she defeated it with the quick twohand clutch women seem to learn as a tribal gesture but shivered just the same brr i wish i were wearing pants why dont you he said with all the heaters to hell and gone i bet youd be a lot more comfortable i wouldnt want to freeze my well i wouldnt want to freeze myself in a skirt just on account of fashion if shed noticed what he started to say she didnt let on if i find some that fit me i think i will she said long johns too yeager let himself indulge in the fantasy of peeling her out of a pair of long johns until somebody bawled come on get those goddamn lizards on board we aint got all day he urged ullhass and ristin ahead of him then had a happy after thought grabbing barbaras hand he said make like youre a lizard harry turtledove keeper too she caught on fast and fell into step behind him she didnt shake off his hand either the two lizard pows hissed in alarm as the gangplank swayed under their weight its all right barbara reassured them playing her part to the hilt if humans carrying heavy equipment didnt break this you wont yeager had come to know ullhass and ristin well enough to tell how unhappy they were but they kept walking they hissed again when they got up onto the deck of the caledonia and discovered the ship was still shifting slightly to and fro it will fall over and put us all at the bottom of the water ristin said angrily he didnt know nautical english but got his meaning across yeager looked around at the faded paint the rust that streaked down from rivets the worn woodwork the greasestained dungarees and old wool sweaters the crew wore i dont think so he told the lizards this boats done a lot more sailing in its day i expect its good for some more ye i i think youre right sam barbara said perhaps as much to reassure herself as to console ristin out of the way there an officer in navy uniform yelled at yeager and get those damned things into the cabin weve set up for them yes sir yeager said saluting uh sir where is this cabin nobody told me before i got here the navy man rolled his eyes why doesnt that surprise me he grabbed a passing sailor by the arm virgil take this guy and his pet lizards up to cabin nine that one can be locked from the outside heres the key he turned to barbara who are you maam when she gave him her name he checked a list then said you can go along if you like since you dont seem to mind being around these things they give me the creeps anyway youre in cabin fourteen just up the corridor i hope thats all right sure why not barbara said the navy man looked at her looked back to the lizards rolled his eyes again he obviously didnt want to have anything more to do with them than duty required come on virgil said he had an engaging hillbilly twang and seemed more curious than repelled by the lizards nodding to ristin he said you speak english yess ristin answered fixing him with a baleful stare you are sure this thing will not fall over into the water yup the sailor laughed hasnt yet anyhow just then other sailors cast off lines at stern and bow tike ships engine roared into life making the deck vibrate ristin and ullhass both glared at virgil as if theyd just convicted him of perjury in their minds black smoke poured from the caledonias twin stacks she slowly pulled away from the navy pier back on the pier some of the soldiers whod done stevedore duty worldwar in the balance waved farewells more though were too worn to do anything but stand or sit at the end of the pier yeager wondered how many of them had any idea why the cargo theyd loaded onto the freighter was so important a handful if any he guessed he was looking back toward chicago when he saw flames and dust and smoke spurt up from an explosion and then from another and another oddly flat across a widening stretch of water the blasts reached his ears at about the same time he heard the screaming jets of the lizard fighterbombers the antiaircraft gunners on the navy pier started firing for all they were worth all that accomplished was to draw the lizards attention to them one of the planes zoomed along the length of the pier turned loose a couple of bombs the aa fire cut off as sharply as a chickens squawks when the cleaver comes down the lizard plane shot over the caedonia so low yeager could see the seams where pieces of its skin were joined together he breathed a sigh of relief when it screamed out over the lake along with his charges virgil had stopped to watch the enemy aircraft again now he said lets get you movin again but he kept his head cocked as yeager did listening to the sound of the jet engine worry crossed his face i dont much like that its before he could say comin back a sharp bark rose above the scream yeager had been under fire often enough to make his reaction almost reflexive hit the deck he yelled and had the presence of mind to knock barbara down beside him cannon shells raked the caledonia from starboard to port glass shatterxetal screamed a moment later so did men the lizard pilot hapiwith the strafing run darted westward toward his base something hot and wet splashed yeager when he touched it his hand came away smeared with red he looked up there on the deck a little in front of him lay virgils stilltwitching legs a few feet away were the soldiers head and shoulders and arms nothing but that red smear was left of the parts in between ullhass and ristin stared at the ruin of what had been a man with as much horror as if theyd been men themselves as yeager did barbara larssen looked up into carnage she was as smeared with blood as he from her wavy hair to her pleated skirt and beyond a neat line between silkcovered pink and crimson on her calf showed just how far down theskirt had gone she saw what was left of virgil stared down at the slaughterhouse survivor shed become oh god she said oh god and was noisily sick on the deck in the middle of the blood she clung to yeager and he to her his hands digging like claws into the firm marvelously unbroken flesh of her back her breasts pressing against his chest as if they grew harry turtledove there her head was jammed down into the hollow of his shoulder he didnt know if she could breathe and he didnt care in spite of the stink of the blood and the puke he wanted her more than hed ever wanted a woman in all his life and from the way his hardon rubbed her leg and she didnt pull away but moaned and just shoved herself to him harder than ever he knew she wanted him too and of course it was crazy and of course it was shock but he didnt care about that either not one bit move he growled to the lizards in a voice not his own they skittered round the pieces of poor dead virgil he followed still clutching barbara hoping desperately he could find the cabins before the moment broke the numbers on the doors of the first corridor he ducked into showed him hed been lucky he opened cabin nine marched ullhass and ristin in slammed the door behind them turned the key then almost running he and barbara hurried up the echoing metal hallway to fourteen the cabin was tiny the bunk even tinier neither of them cared they fell on it together she happened to land on top it could have been the other way round just as easily his hand dove under her shirt he stroked her smooth thigh above the top of her stocking then yanked at the crotch of her panties at the same time she pulled his pants down just far enough she was so wet he went deep into her the moment she impaled herself on him hed never known such heat he exploded almost at once and in the first instant of returning selfconsciousness feared hed been too quick to satisfy her but her spine was arched her head thrown back she made little mewling noises deep in her throat as she quivered above him then her eyes opened like him she seemed to be coming to herself after a hard bout of fever she scrambled off him he hastily put his trousers to rights theyd both left bloodstains on the blanket that covered the bunk barbara stared wildly around the cabin as if really seeing it for the first time maybe she was oh god she moaned what have i gone and done to myself now but of that there could be no possible doubt sam took a step toward her made as if to take her in his arms he said what countless men have said to women after lust takes them by surprise darling itll be all right dont you call me that she hissed dont you touch me dont you come near me she backed as far away from him as she could which wasnt very far get out of here this instant i never want to see you again go back to your damned lizards ill scream ill yeager didnt wait to find out what shed do he left the cabin in a hurry closed the door behind him by sheer dumb luck the corridor was empty through the steel door he heard barbara start to cry he wanted to go back in and comfort her but she cfmldnt i worldwar in the balance she wanted no comfort from him since they were quartered right down the corridor from each other shed have to see him again and soon he wondered what would happen then itll be all right he said without much conviction then shoulders slumped he walked slowly along the corridor to see how ristin and ullhass were they didnt have to worry about the whole business of male and female out of sight was truly out of mind for them hed never thought hed be jealous of that but right now he was a lizard threw open the door to the baptist church in flat indiana the people inside jerked their heads around in surprise and alarm this was not a usual time for the aliens to bother them theyd learned a basic lesson of war and captivity anything out of the ordinary was frightening jens larssen started with the rest though as he already faced the big double doors he didnt have to spin toward them hed been standing around kibitzing a game of hearts sal the waitress was going for it trying to take the queen of spades and all the hearts and stick all three of her opponents with twentysix points each he didnt think she had the cards to make it but you never could tell she played like a barracuda he never found out what happened with the hand the lizard stalked into the church automatic weapon at the ready two others covered it from the doorway the creature hissed put ssmiff larssen needed a second to recognize his alias in the aliens mouth as the lizard started to repeat it he said thats me what do you want come the lizard said which might have come close to exhausting its english a jerk of the gun barrel however was hard to misconstrue what do you want larssen said again but he was already moving the lizards were not long on patience with captives good luck pete sal called softly as he headed out toward the doorway thanks you too he answered he hadnt put a move on her not yet he still had hopes of making it home to barbara but day by day not yet was rising higher in his thoughts than hadnt put a move on her and when he did he was pretty sure no he was sure shed come across once or twice shed put what imght have been a move on him a couple of other people also wished him luck the lizard just waited for him to arrive then fell in behind him outside the church cold smote his eyes filled with tears hed been inside the gloomy building so long that sun sparkling off snow was almost overpoweringly bright worldwar in the balance his guards marched him along to the store the lizards used as their flat headquarters as soon as he went inside he started to sweat the place was at the bakeoven heat the aliens enjoyed the three who had brought him there hissed blissfully he wondered how they escaped pneumonia from the drastic temperature shifts they endured whenever they went in or out maybe pneumonia bugs didnt bite lizards he hoped they wouldnt bite him the guards led him back to the table where gnik had interrogated him before the lizard lieutenant or whatever he was waited there now he was holding something lizardy in his left hand without preamble he said open your mouth pete smith huh jens said taken aback open your mouth i say you do not understand your own speech no superior sir uh i mean yes superior sir larssen gave that up as a bad job and opened his mouth with guns all around him he had no real choice gnik started to reach up with the gadget in his left hand then paused you big uglies are too tall he said peevishly nimble as his earthly reptilian namesake he scrambled up onto a chair put the muzzle of the gadget into larssens mouth squeezed a trigger the lizardy thing hissed like a snake a jet of something stung jens on the tongue ow he exclaimed and involuntarily pulled back what the devil did you just do to me injected you gnik answered at least he didnt seem angry about jens retreat now we will find out the truth injected me but when larssen thought about injections he thht about needles then he took a long look at gniks scaly hide w a hypodermic pierce it he didnt know the lizards only easily available soft tissue was inside their mouths some sort of compressed gas jet must have forced the drug into his system but what was it find out the truth he asked new from our base gnik was one smug lizard you will not lie to me you cannot lie to me the injection will not permit it uhoh jens thought the sweat that sprang out on his forehead now had nothing to do with the hot dry interior of the store he felt woozy he needed a distinct effort of will not to see double may i sit down he said gnik jumped off the chair hed used larssen sank into it his legs did not seem to want to support him why not he thought vaguely i always supported them gnik stood and waited for a few minutes presumably to let the drug take full effect larssen wondered if hed throw up all the canned goods hed been eating lately his mind felt detached from his body it was almost as if he were looking down on himself from the ceiling gnik asked what is your name harry turtledove what is my name jens wondered what a good question he wanted to giggle but didnt have the energy what had he been calling himself lately anyhow remembering was a triumph pete smith he said proudly gnik hissed he and the other lizards talked among themselves for a couple of minutes the officer swung his turreted eyes back toward larssen where you going when we catch you on that thing he still couldnt remember the name for a bicycle to to visit my cousins west of of montpelier sticking to his story wasnt easy for jens but he managed maybe hed already told it so many times that it felt true for him and maybe the lizards drug wasnt as good as they thought it was in a pulp sciencefiction story it was easy enough to imagine something one day create it the next and use it the day after that reality was different as hed found out time and again at the met lab nature usually proved less tractable than pulp writers made it out to be gnik hissed again maybe he wasnt convinced the drug was everything it was supposed to be or maybe he had been convinced jens was lying through his teeth and had got a nasty shock when he didnt come out with something new under the drug not only was the lizard stubborn he was sneaky as well tell me more of the male of this grouping of yours this cousin osscar he put a hiss in the middle of the name too his name is is olaf larssen said scenting the trap just in time hes my fathers brothers son he quickly rattled off the names of the fictitious olafs equally fictitious family he hoped that would keep gnik from trying to trip him up with them it also helped fix them in his own mind the lizards went back to talking to one another again after a while gnik returned to english we still do not find this these cousins of yours anywhere about i cant help that larssen said for all i know maybe its because youve killed them but i hope not more probably because their neighbors do not tell us who they are did gnik sound conciliatory larssen hadnt heard conciliation in a lizards voice often enough to be sure some of you big uglies do not care for the race why do you suppose that is jens asked it is a puzzlement gnik said so seriously that larssen knew he really was puzzled are they that stupid he wondered but the lizards werent stupid not even slightly or theyd never have been able to come to earth never have been able to make and drop their atomic bombs they were sure naive though had they expected to be welcomed as liberators even under the mildly euphoric buzz of the notquitetruth drug larssen worried a little suppose the lizards decided to let him go and worldwar in the balance then followed him while he tried to find his cousins farm that would be the best way to make him out a liar or would it he could always point to a ruined one and claim olaf et mythical cetera had lived there the lizards were chattering back and forth one more time gnik cut off debate with a sharp motion of his hand he swung his eyes toward larssen what you say with the drug in you must be true so my superiors have told me thus so it must be and if it is true you is are no danger to the race you may go take up the things that are yours and travel on pete smith just like that larssen blurted an instant later he bit his tongue which made him yelp it was sore but did he want the lizard to change its mind like hell he did his next question was distinctly more practical wheres my bike gnik understood the word even if he couldnt recall it it will go to where you are being kept go there now yourself to take up the things that are yours along with the druginduced euphoria jens now had his own genuine variety he put his coldweather gear back on all but floated over the snow back to the baptist church questions rang out what happened whatd they want with you theyre letting me go he said simply he was still absorbing the magnitude of his own luck back in white sulphur springs colonel groves or was it general marshall had told him the lizards were worse than russians for depending on their higherups to tell them what to do gniks higherups had told him he had a real live truth drug here and as far as he was concerned that made it holy writ as long as the ups were right it was a good enough system when they were half the people in the church came running forward to pound his back and shake his hand sals kiss was so authoritative his arms automatically tightened around her she molded herself to him ground her hips against his crotch lucky bastard she whispered when she finally pulled away yeah he muttered dazed all at once he wanted not to leave at least for one night but no if he didnt get out while he could the lizards were liable to wonder why and liable to change their minds that did not bear thinking about he pushed through the friendly little crowd to get his belongings from the pew hed come to call his own as he slung his knapsack over his shoulders he noticed for the first time the men and women whod hung back from offering best wishes not to put too fine a point on it they looked as if they hated him several women and men both turned away so he would not see them cry he all but ran toward the doorway no even if the lizards allowed it he could not stay another night not for sal harry turtledove and all her blowsy charms even a few seconds of that envy and rage were more than he could stand the lizards were efficient enough by the time he got outside one of them had his bicycle waiting as he swung up onto it he got a last glimpse of pale hungry faces staring out from inside the church at the freedom they could not share hed expected to feel a lot of different things when he was set free but never shame he started to pedal snow kicked up from under his wheels in bare seconds the hamlet of flat vanished behind him after less than an hour he stopped for a blow he wasnt in the shape hed enjoyed before the lizards put him out of circulation for a while gotta keep going or ill stiffen up he said aloud unlike his wind the habit of talking to himself came back right away when he came upon the signs announcing montpelier he skirted the town on the best paths he could find then returned to highway for the next few days everything seemed to go right he rode around marion as he had montpelier sailed right on through sweetser and converse wawpekong and galveston whenever he needed food he found some whenever he was tired a hayloft or an abandoned farmhouse seemed to beckon once in a bureau drawer he even found a pack of philip morrises he hadnt had a cigarette since he couldnt remember when he smoked himself lightheaded and halfsick in an orgy of making up for lost time worth it he declared as he coughed his way through the next day he saw few people as he rolled through central indiana that suited him fine he saw even fewer lizards and that suited him better how was he supposed to explain what he was doing a good many miles west of where hed told gnik he was going luck stayed with him he didnt have to the war between humans and aliens seemed far away from that nearly deserted winter landscape although of course it wouldnt have been deserted but for the war a couple of times though off in the distance he heard gunfire the widely spaced barks of sporting or military rifles and the chatter of the lizards automatic weapons and once or twice lizard planes screamed high overhead scrawling trails ice crystals the physicist part of him said across the sky somewhere between young america and delphi a new noise entered the mix intermittent explosions the farther west he traveled the louder they got maybe half an hour after he first noticed them his head went up like a hunted animals when it catches a scent thats artillery is what that is he exclaimed excitement coursed through him artillery meant people still fighting the lizards on a level higher than bushwhacking it also meant danger since it lay in the direction he was riding worldwar in the balance the duel he noticed as he drew near was anything but intense a few shells would come in a few more go out he rode past a lizard battery instead of being towed the guns were mounted on what looked like tank chassis the lizards serving them paid no attention to him shortly after he passed the lizard position he started going by wrecked combat vehicles most of them now just big shapes covered over with snow the road which had been pretty good suddenly developed not just potholes but craters the fighting hereabouts wasnt intense now but had been not too long before he got off his bike before he went headlong into a snowfilled hole frustration ate at him after fairly flying through lizardheld territory was he going to get delayed by humans hed started believing hed get home to chicago again fairly soon getting hopes up and then having them dashed seemed cruel and unfair then he came to the first belt of rusty barbed wire it was like something out of a movie about world war i how am i supposed to get through that he demanded of an uncaring world how am i supposed to get my bike through that a hiss a whistle a scream a crash frozen earth flew through the air off to his left so did fragments of steel one tore through a couple of spokes of the bicycles rear wheel it could have torn through jens leg just as easily all at once the artillery duel turned real for him it wasnt just abstract shells flying back and forth on trajectories dictated by newtonian mechanics and air resistance if one of those shells hit a little nearer or no nearer but with an unlucky spray of fragments he wouldnt have to worry about getting to chicago any more another freighttrain noise in the air this time larssen dove into the snofore the shell burst it landed in the middle of the barbedwire belt and cunks of wire probably flew along with its own fragments getting hit by one sort of jagged metal would be about as bad as the other jens thought he cautiously raised his head hoping the shell had cleared a way through the wire a generation of young englishmen whod fought at the somme or at any rate the fraction of that generation which survived could have told him he was wasting optimism tanks could crush wire but shells couldnt smash it aside how to cross then with shells still falling in the neighborhood every so often he didnt even want to get up and walk around to look for a path to the other side of the wire he turned his head so he could see how far to the north and west the barrier ran farther than his groundlevel mark one eyeball carried anyhow was it nomansland all the way from here to chicago with his luck it might well be okay pal dont even blink or youll get yourself some caliber ventilation the voice came from the direction in which larssen wasnt harry turtledove looking he obediently froze lying in the snow he already had a good start on freezing anyhow awright the voice said turn toward me nice and slow i better see your hands every second too jens turned nice and slow as if hed sprouted there like a mushroom a fellow in a khaki uniform and a tin hat sprawled not fifty feet away his rifle pointed right about at larssens brisket jesus its good to see a human being holding a gun again jens said shut up the soldier told him the springfield never wavered likeliest guess is youre a god damned lizard spy a what are you crazy we shot two last week the soldier said flatly ice grew inside larssen to go with the snow all around the fellow meant every word of it jens tried again im no spy and i can prove it by god tell it to the marines mac im a harder sell than that goddammit will you listen to me jens shouted furious now as well as frightened im on my way back from white sulphur springs west virginia jesus i talked with general marshall while i was there hell vouch for me if hes still alive yeah pal an i was in rome last week for lunch with the pope but the unwashed unshaven soldier did move his rifle so it wasnt aimed at larssens mi iff awright ill take you in you can peddle your papers to my lieutenant if he buys what youre pushin thats his business cmere no dummy leave the bike sans bicycle larssen came he wondered how he was supposed to get through that impenetrablelooking mass of barbed wire but a path was cut with strands looking as if they were firmly attached to their support posts but in fact just hanging from them he didnt have much trouble crawling along after his captor though he never could have navigated by himself although he tried to be careful he got punctured a couple of times he tried to remember when his last tetanus shot had been more dirty faces peered out at him from the zigzagging trenches behind the wire the lieutenant instead of a britishstyle tin hat wore a domed steel helmet that looked very modern and martial he listened to larssens story reached into a shirt pocket then laughed at himself i still want a butt to help me think but i havent seen one in weeks hellfire buddy i dont know what to do with you ill bump you on up the line see if somebody else can figure you out escorted by the soldier whod found him the fellows name turned out to be eddie wagner larssen made the acquaintance of a captain a major and a lieutenant colonel by then he expected to be kicked on to a bird colonel but the lieutenant colonel shortcircuited the process saying im going to send you to general pattons headquarters bud if you say youve met marshall hes the one to decide what to do with you worldwar in the balance general pattons headquarters proved to be in oxford something like twenty miles west the march there starting at dawn the next day ended near dark and left larssen footsore weary and mourning his lost bike little by little as he tramped along he began to notice how many field guns were disguised as tree trunks with branches wired onto their upright barreis how many tanks inhabited barns or crouched under haystacks how many airplanes rested beneath nets that hid them from the sky you guys have a lot of stuff built up here he remarked some time in the afternoon howd you manage to do it right under the lizards snouts wasnt easy wagner answered whod apparently decided he might not be a spy after all we been movin it in a little at a time just about all of it at night the lizards theyve let us do it we hope to jesus that means they aint really noticed what were up to theyll find out they sure as hell will larssen started to ask what the lizards would find out then thought better of it he didnt want to stir up his guides suspicions again not only that he could make a good stab at figuring it out for himself some sort of big push had to be in the offing he wondered in which direction it would go general pattons headquarters was in a white frame house on the outskirts of oxford though the town with fewer than a thousand people was barely big enough to have outskirts the sentries on the covered porch like everything else military hereabouts they were concealed from aerial observation were well shaved and wore neater uniforms than any jens had seen for a while kne of them nodded politely to him weve been expecting you sir linantcolonel tobin telephoned to say you were on your way the general will see you at once thanks larssen said feeling more draggled than ever in the presence of such allbutforgotten spit and polish that feeling intensified when he went into the house major general patton he wore two stars on each shoulder of a sheepskincollared leather jacket was not only cleanshaven and neat he even had creases in his trousers the buttery light of a kerosene lamp left black shadows at the corners of his mouth in the lines that grooved their way up alongside his nose and beneath his pale intense eyes he had to be getting close to sixty but jens would not have cared to take him on he ran a hand through his short brush of graying sandy hair then stabbed a finger out at larssen i risked a radio call on you mister he growled his raspy voice lightly flavored by the south general marshall told me to ask you what he said to you about the lizards in seattle panic quickly swamped relief that marshall lived sir i dont remember him saying anything about the lizards in seattle he blurted harry turtledove pattons fierce expression melted into a grin good thing for you that you dont if you did id know you were just another lying son of a bitch sit down son as larssen sank into a chair the general went on marshall says youre important too though he wouldnt say how not even in code ive known general marshall a lot of years now he doesnt use words like important just for show so who and what the devil are you sir im a physicist attached to the metallurgical laboratory project at the university of chicago jens saw that didnt mean anything to patton he amplified even before the lizards came we were working to build a uranium weapon an atomic bomb for the united states lord patton said softly no general marshall wasnt kidding was he his laugh could have sprung from the throat of a much younger man well mr larssen no youd be dr larssen wouldnt you if you want to get back to chicago youve come to the right place by god sir we are going to grab the lizards by the nose and kick em in the ass patton said with relish come over here to the table and have a look at this map larssen came and had a look the thumbtackimpaled map had come from an old national geographic were here patton said pointing larssen nodded patton went on ive got second armored here other assets infantry air support and up here his finger moved to an area west of madison wisconsin is general omar bradley with even more than ive got now all were doing is waiting for a good nasty blizzard sir jens said again weve found the lizards dont like fighting in winter conditions not even a little bit patton snorted like any pansies they wilt when its cold the bad weatherll help keep their aircraft on the ground when the snow flies my forces move northwest while bradley comes southeast god willing we join hands somewhere not far from bloomington illinois and put the spearhead of the lizard forces attacking chicago in a pocket a kessel the nazis were calling it in russia he shaped the movements of the two american forces with his hands made larssen see them too a real chance to hit back at the invaders from outer space that made jens catch fire too but a lot of people all over the world had tried to hurt the lizards not many had much luck sir im no soldier and i dont pretend to be one but can we really pull this off its a gamble patton admitted but if we dont the united states is washed up because we wont get another chance to make troop concentrations like these and i refuse to believe my country is washed up well be confused and scared in the attack i dont doubt it for a second but the enemyll be more confused and scared than we are because well be taking the fight to him not the other way round worldwar in the balance a gamble a chance larssen slowly nodded a real victory against the lizards would lift morale around the world a defeat well humanity had known a lot of defeats why should one more be noticed patton said youll have to stay here now till the attack goes in we cant let you head through lizardheld territory not knowing what you do why not their truth drug doesnt work larssen said dr larssen you are a gentle soul and have led what is i fear a sheltered life patton answered there are methods far more basic than drugs for extracting truth from a man im sorry sir but i cannot afford the risk in any case hard fighting will start soon youll be far safer with us than traveling on your own jens wasnt sure about that either trucks and tanks were far more likely to draw more fire than a lone man on a bicycle or now afoot but he was in no position to argue the point besides just then an orderly brought in a tray with a roasted chicken and several baked potatoes and a bottle of wine along with it youll take supper with me patton asked yes thank you larssen had all he could do not to grab the savory goldenbrown chicken and tear at it like a starving wolf after cans in the church and a fast but hungry trip across indiana it looked wonderful beyond belief a little later sucking the last scrap of meat off a drumstick he said all i want to do is get back to my work get back to my wife lord she probably thinks im dead by now for that matter he could only hope barbara was still alive yes i miss my beatrice too patton said with a heavy sigh he lifted vineglass to dr larssen snow to snow jens said the glasses clinked together moishe russie had gone into the lizards broadcasting studio a good many times before but never at gunpoint zolraag stood beside the table with the microphone you may be doing this broadcast under duress herr russie the lizard governor said but you will do it he added the emphatic cough youve brought me here anyhow russie was amazed at how little fear he felt almost three years in the ghetto under german torment had been a sort of dress rehearsal for death now that the time had come he murmured in hebrew shma yisroyal adonai elohaynu adonai ekhod he didnt want to die with the prayer unspoken zolraag said you would not have even this last chance to make yourself useful in our eyes if you had not shown you truly knew nothing about the disappearance of your mate and hatchling so you have told me excellency russie made his voice submissive harry turtledove let the governor think he was cowed inside he exulted though he didnt know everything of how rivka and reuven had vanished he knew enough to endanger a lot of people his tongue twitched at the memory of the lizards gas jet in action but in spite of their drug hed been able to lie mere human nostrums all too often did much less than what they claimed as a onetime medical student he had some feel for how complex the human organism was hed feared the lizards had mastered it though especially when he went all dreamy after his close somehow though he managed to withhold the truth he wondered what went into the drug even if it didnt work as advertised it had promise no time to worry about that now zolraag said read the script to yourself herr russie then read it aloud for our broadcast you know the penalty for failure to comply russie sat down in the chair it and the table in front of it were the only humansized pieces of furniture in the room one of the lizard guards stepped up behind russie set the muzzle of his rifle against the back of the jews head zolraag wasnt playing games not any more moishe wondered who had typedand probably written the script some poor human accommodating himself to the new masters as best he could so many poles even so many jews had accommodated themselves to the nazis as best they could so why not to the lizards as well the words were what hed expected sycophantic praise for the aliens and for everything they did including the destruction of washington the lizard studio engineer looked at a chronograph spoke first in his own language and then in german quiet all we begin herr russie you speak russie whispered the shma to himself one last time bent low over the microphone he took a deep breath made sure he spoke clearly this is moishe russie because of illness and other personal reasons i have not broadcast in some time that much was on the paper in front of him what came next was not i doubt i shall broadcast ever again zolraag spoke german well enough to realize hed deviated from the script he waited for the bullet to crash through his skull he wouldnt hear it he hoped he wouldnt feel it it would disrupt the program by god but the lizard governor gave no sign he noticed anything wrong the bullet did not come russie went on i have been told to sing the praises of the races destruction of washington to point out to all mankind that the americans had it coming because of their stubborn and foolish resistance that they should have surrendered all these things are lies again he waited for some reaction from zolraag for the bullet that would blow his head all over the studio zolraag just stood there listening russie plowed ahead squeezing as much as he could from the lizards strange forbearance i told the truth when i said what the germans did in worldwar in the balance warsaw i am far from sorry they are gone to us the jews of warsaw the race came as liberators but they seek to enslave all men what they did in washington proves this for any who still need proof fight hard that we may be free better that than subjection forever goodbye and good luck the silence in the studio lasted more than a minute after he stopped then zolraag said thank you herr russie that will be all but having prepared himself for martyrdom moishe felt almost cheated at failing to attain it what i said what i told the world i recorded herr russie the lizard engineer said go out tomorrow your regular time oh moishe said in a hollow voice of course the broadcast would not go out tomorrow once the lizards listened to it carefully really understood it theyd hear the sabotage hed tried to commit the shadow of death had not lifted from him he would just have to wear it a little longer in a way it might have been better had the lizards shot him now that would have been quick given time to reflect they might come up with a more ingenious end for him he shivered hed overcome fear once to say what hed said he hoped he could nerve himself to do it again but feared the second time would be harder take him away zolraag said in his own language the lizard guards led moishe out to one of their vehicles parked outside the studio as they always did they hissed and complained about the few meters of frigid cold they had to traverse between the bake ovens they thought comfortable back in his flat russie puttered around read the bible and the apocry tale of the maccabees cooked himself supper with bachelor ineffici he did his best to sleep and eventually succeeded in the morning he heated up some of the potatoes he hadnt finished the night before it wasnt much of a last meal for a condemned man but he lacked the energy to fix anything finer a few minutes in front of the appointed hour he turned on the shortwave set hed never listened to himself before all his previous broadcasts had gone out live he wondered why the lizards chose to alter the pattern this time music a martial fanfare then a recorded tag here is free radio warsaw hed liked that back when the city was freshly out from under the nazis bootheels now it seemed sadly ironic this is moishe russie because of illness and other personal reasons i have not broadcast in some time was that voice really his he supposed it was but he didnt sound the way he did when he listened to himself from inside so to speak he dropped that thought as he listened to himself go on i sing the praises of the races destruction of washington i point out to all mankind harry turtledove that the americans had it coming because of their stubborn and foolish resistance they should have surrendered for any who still need proof better subjection forever than to fight hard that we may be free what the race did to washington proves this goodbye and good luck russie stared in blank dismay at the speaker of the shortwave radio in his minds eye he saw zolraags mouth falling open in a hearty lizard guffaw zolraag had tricked him hed been ready to give up his life but not to live on to be used to anothers purpose suddenly he understood why rape was called a fate worse than death had his words not been raped employed in a way he would have died to prevent distantly abstractly he wondered how the lizards had managed their perversion of what hed said whatever recording and editing technology theyd used was far ahead of anything men could boast and so theyd threatened him with what seemed a sure and grisly end let him make his defiant cry for liberty and then not only smothered that cry but held up the surgically altered corpse to the world and pretended it had life as far as the rest of mankind could tell he was a worse collaborator now than ever before rage ripped through him he was not used to feeling anything so raw it left him giddy and lightheaded as if hed drunk too much plum brandy at purim the shortwave set brayed on more propaganda this time in polish had the fellow talking really said these words in this order who could tell moishe lifted the radio over his head it fit in the palm of one hand and weighed hardly anything it was of lizard make a gift from zolraag but even had it been a heavy bulky humanmade set fury would have fueled his strength and let him treat it the same way he smashed it to the floor as hard as he could the lies the pole was squawking died in midsyllable bits of metal and glass and stuff that looked like bakelite but wasnt flew in every direction russie trampled the carcass of the radio ground it into the carpet turned it into a forlorn puddle of fragments that bore no resemblance to what it had been a moment before not half what the mamzrim did to me he muttered he threw on his long black coat stormed out of his flat slammed the door behind him three people along the corridor poked their heads out their doorways to see whod just had a fight with his wife reb moishe a woman exclaimed he stomped past without even looking her way lizard guards still stood at the entrance to the block of flats moishe stomped past them too though he wanted to snatch one of their rifles and drop them both bleeding to the sidewalk he knew just what the muzzle of a lizard rifle felt like jammed against the curly hair at the back of his head what would it be like to hold one in his arms have it buck as he squeezed the trigger he didnt know but he wanted to find out worldwar in the balance halfway down the block he stopped in his tracks gevalt he exclaimed deeply shocked am i turning into a soldier the prospect was anything but appetizing as a medical student he knew too well how easy a human being was to damage how hard to repair in the german siege of warsaw and since hed seen that proved too many times too many horrible ways and now he wanted to become a destroyer himself he did his feet figured it out before the rest of him knew he found himself on the way to the headquarters of mordechai anielewicz before he consciously realized where he was going a light snowfall swirled through the air not many people were on the streets every so often one of them would nod to him from beneath a black felt fedora like his own or a russianstyle fur cap he braced himself for shouts of hatred but none came if only the rest of the world paid as little attention to his broadcast as the jews of warsaw here came someone striding briskly toward him who his spectacles didnt help enough to let him be sure his eyes had grown weaker lately what had suited them in wasnt good enough any more he scowled hed been shortsighted a lot of different ways whoever it was the fellow waved vigorously at him he recognized the motion if not the man fear flooded through him while hed gone looking for mordechai anielewicz anielewicz was looking for him too which meant anielewicz if no one else hereabouts had heard him on the radio which meant the fighting leader without a doubt had blood in his eye hich he did reb moishe are you meshuggeh he yelled i tight you werent going to turn into the lizards tukhuslekher the lizards tukhuslekher that was what it had come to mortification almost gagged moishe i havent as god is my witness i havent he choked out what do you mean you havent anielewicz said still loudly with my own ears i heard you he looked to right and left lowered his voice was it for this we made your wife and little boy disappear so you could say what the lizards wanted you to say but i didnt russie wailed anielewiczs face was full of flinty disbelief stammering almost sobbing russie told how he had gone into the lizards broadcast studio expecting to die how hed hoped and intended to give one last cri de coeur before he did and how zolraag and the lizards engineers cheated him out of a death that had meaning do you think i want to be alive to have my friends call me filthy names on the street he took a clumsy unpracticed swing at anielewicz the jewish fighting leader easily blocked the blow he caught russies harry turtledove arm twisted a little russies shoulder creaked like a dead branch about to fall off a tree fire shot through the joint he bit back a gasp sorry anielewicz let go at once didnt mean to jerk it quite so hard there force of habit you all right russie gingerly tested the injured member for that yes otherwise and im sorry about that too anielewicz said quickly but i heard you with my own earshow could i not trust my ears of course i believe you reb moishe dont even think you need to ask me you couldnt have guessed the lizards would do things to a recording they outfoxed you it happens the next question is how do we get our revenge revenge moishe tasted the word yes it was right he hadnt found a name for it himself thats what i want ill tell you something mordechai anielewicz laid a finger alongside his nose it may just be taken care of you havent played a direct part but all us jews owe you a lot of what freedom we have and if we hadnt been free to move through poland none of what im talking about would have happened what are you talking about russie demanded you havent really said anything no and i dont intend to either anielewicz answered what you dont know you cant tell and the lizards may find better more painful ways of asking questions than that verkakte drug of theirs but one fine day before too long the lizards may have cause to notice something for which youll be partly responsible and if they do youll have your revenge i promise you that all sounded very good and anielewicz was not in the habit of talking about what he couldnt deliver nonetheless i want more russie said i want to hurt the lizards myself reb moishe a soldier youre not anielewicz said not unkindly but very firmly i could learn no now the jewish fighting leaders voice turned hard if you want to fight them there are ways you can be more valuable than with a gun in your hand youd be wasted as a common soldier what then youre serious about this to moishes relief it was not a question anielewicz studied him as if trying to figure out how to fieldstrip some new kind of rifle well what could you do the fighting leader rubbed his chin hows this how would you like to tell the world how much of a liar the lizards have made you out to be you could arrange for me a broadcast russie asked eagerly a broadcast no too dangerous anielewicz shook his head a recording though just possibly then we might smuggle it out for others to worldwar in the balance broadcast that would make the lizards blush if they knew how to blush that is only one trouble well more than one but this you have to think about especially hard once you make this recording if you make it you have to disappear yes i see that zolraag would not be pleased with me would he but id sooner have him angry than laughing as he surely is now russie let his mouth hang open in an imitation of a lizard chuckle then in a sudden completely human gesture he stabbed a finger out at anielewicz could you arrange for me to vanish into the same place where rivka and reuven have gone i dont even know where that place is anielewicz reminded him but thats more of your not knowing so you cant talk in case youre interrogated dont tell me you cant arrange to have me sent there without ever learning directly about that place because i wont believe you maybe you should disappear youre getting too cynical and suspicious to make a proper reb any more but amusement glinted in anielewiczs pale eyes i wont say yes to that and i wont say no he waggled his hand back and forth for that matter i dont even know for certain if i can arrange for you to make this recording but if you want me to ill try try russie said at once he cocked his head peered sidelong at the jewish fighting leader i notice you dont say youre worried about smuggling the recording out of warsaw once its made oh no anielewicz looked like a cat blowing canary feathers off its nose if we make the recording well get it out that we can manage weve had practice dmila gorbunova stared at her co but comrade colonel she ex laimed her voice rising to a startled squeak why me because your aircraft is suited to the task and you are suited to be its pilot colonel feofan karpov replied the lizards hack all sorts of aircraft out of the sky in large numbers but fewer kukuruzniks than any other type and you senior lieutenant gorbunova have flown combat missions against the lizards since they came and against the germans before that do you question your own ability no comrade colonel by no means ludmila answered but the mission you have outlined is not or should not become let me say one involving combat it should not become such no karpov agreed it will be the easier on account of that though not the more difficult and having a combatproved pilot will increase its chances for success so you any further questions no comrade colonel what am i supposed to say ludmila thought harry turtledove good karpov said he is expected to arrive tonight make sure your plane is in the best possible operating condition lucky you have that german mechanic yes hes quite skilled ludmila saluted ill go check out the airplane with him now pity i cant take him with me back at the revetments she found georg schultz already tinkering with the kukuruznik wire to one of your foot pedals here wasnt as tight as it could have been he said ill have it fixed in a minute here thank you that will help she answered in german speaking it with him every day was improving her own command of the language though she had the feeling several of the phrases she now used casually around him were unsuited for conversation with people who didnt have greasy hands feeling her way for words she went on i want the machine to be as good as it can i have an important flight tomorrow when isnt a flight important its your neck after all schultz checked the feel of the pedal with his foot he was always checking always making sure just as some men had a feel for horses he had a feel for machines and a gift for getting them to do what he wanted there that ought to fix it good this one though is important for more than just my neck im to go on a courier mission she knew she should have stopped there but how important the mission was filled her to overflowing and she overflowed i am ordered to fly the foreign commissar comrade molotov to germany for talks with your leaders i am so proud schultzs eyes went wide well you might be after a moment he added id better go over this plane from top to bottom pretty soon youre going to have to trust it to russian mechanics again the scorn in that should have stung in fact it did but less than it would have before ludmila saw the obsessive care the german put into maintenance she just said well do it together they checked everything from the bolt that held on the propeller to the screws that attached the tailskid to the fuselage the brief russian winter day died while they were in the middle of the job they worked on by the light of a paraffin lantern ludmila trusted the netting overhead to keep the lantern from betraying them to the lizards bell above the center horse the one in shafts jangling a troika reached the airstrip about the time they were finishing ludmila listened to the team approaching the revetment the lizards mostly ignored horsedrawn sledges though they shot up cars and trucks when they could anger filled her more even than the nazis the lizards aimed to rob mankind of the twentieth century comrade foreign commissar she said when molotov came in to have a look at the airplane that would fly him to germany worldwar in the balance comrade pilot he answered with an abrupt nod he was shorter and paler than shed expected but just as determinedlooking he didnt bat an eye at the sight of the beatup old u he gave georg schultz another of those diecut jerks of his head comrade mechanic good evening comrade foreign commissar schultz said in his bad russian molotov gave no overt reaction but hesitated a moment before turning back to ludmila a german da comrade foreign commissar she said nervously russians and germans might cooperate against the lizards but more out of desperation than friendship she added he is skilled at what he does so the word hung ominously in the air behind his trademark glasses molotovs eyes were unreadable but at last he said if can talk with them after they invaded the rodina no reason for those who are here not to be put to good use ludmila sagged with relief schultz did not seem to have followed enough of the conversation to know hed been in danger but then hed been in danger since the moment he rolled across the soviet border perhaps hed grown used to it though ludmila never had you have the flight plan comrade pilot molotov asked yes ludmila said tapping a pocket in her leather flying suit that made her think of something else comrade foreign commissar your clothing may be warm enough on the ground but the kukuruznik as you see is an airplane with open cockpits the wind of our motion will be savage and we will be flying north to get to germany at all the little u would have to fly around three sdesof a rectangle the short way across poland lay n the lza ds ha so it would be north past leningrad then west through finland swden and denmark and finally south into germany ludmila hoped the fuel dumps promised on paper would be there in fact the kukuruzniks range was only a little better than five hundred kilometers it would have to refuel a number of times on the journey on the other hand if travel arrangements for the foreign commissar of the soviet union went awry the nation was probably doomed can i draw flying clothes like yours from the commandant of this base molotov asked i am certain colonel karpov will be honored to provide you with them comrade foreign commissar ludmila said she was just as certain the colonel would not dare refuse even if it meant sending one of his pilots out to freeze on the fellows next mission molotov left the revetment schultz started to laugh ludmila turned a questioning eye on him he said a year ago this time if id shot that little hardnosed pigdog the fhrer would have stuck the knights cross harry turtledove the swords and the diamonds on me likely kissed me on both cheeks too now im helping him bloody strange world to that ludmila could only nod when the foreign commissar returned half an hour later he looked as if hed suddenly gained fifteen kilos he was bundled into a leather and sheepskin flight suit boots and flying helmet and carried a pair of goggles in his left hand will these fit over my spectacles he asked comrade foreign commissar i dont know ludmila had never heard of a red air force flier who needed spectacles you can try them though molotov looked at his wristwatch just getting to it under the bulky flight suit was a struggle we are due to depart in less than two hours i trust we shall be punctual there should be no trouble ludmila said a lot of the mission would be flown at night to minimize the chance of interception the only problem with that was the us aggressively basic navigational gear compass and airspeed indicator were about it as things happened there was a problem the little shvetsov engine didnt want to turn over when georg schultz spun the prop in the seat in front of ludmilas molotov clenched his jaw he said nothing but she knew he was making mental notes that chilled her worse than the frigid night air but this problem had a solution borrowed from the british a hicks starter mounted on the front of a battered truck revolved the propeller shaft fast enough to kick the engine into life goddamned sewing machine schultz bawled up to ludmila just to see her glare the acrid stink of the exhaust was perfume in her nostrils the u taxied to the end of the airstrip bumped along the couple of hundred meters of badly smoothed ground as it built up speedand at the end of one bump didnt come back to earth ludmila always relished the feeling of leaving the ground the wind that blasted into her face over and around her little windscreen told her she was really flying and tonight she relished taking off for another reason as well as long as the kukuruznik stayed in the air she was in charge not molotov that was a heady feeling like being on the way to drunk if she did a tight snap roll and flew upside down for a few seconds she could check how well hed fastened his safety belt she shook her head foolishness foolishness if people had disappeared in the purges of the thirties and they had in great carload lots the german invasion proved there were worse things some soviet citizens had been willing to collaborate with the nazis but the germans showed themselves even more brutal than the nkvd worldwar in the balance but now soviets and nazis had a common cause a foe that threatened to crush them both regardless even heedless of ideology life ludmila thought with profound unoriginality was very strange the biplane droned through the night snowdraped fields alternated with black pine forests below ludmila stayed as low as she dared not as low as she would have during the day for now a swell of ground could be upon her before she knew it was there her route swung wide around the valdai hills just to cut that risk the farther north she flew the longer the night became also it was as if she drew darkness around the aircraft though winter nights anywhere in the soviet union were quite long enough her first assigned refueling stop was between kalinin and kashin on the upper reaches of the volga she buzzed around the area where she thought the airstrip was until her fuel started getting dangerously low she hoped she wouldnt have to try to put the u down in a field not with the passenger she was carrying just when she thought she would have to do that better with power than dead stick she spied a lantern or electric torch swung the kukuruznik toward it more torches came on briefly to mark the borders of a landing strip she brought in the u with gentleness that surprised even herself whatever molotov thought of the landing he kept it to himself he rose stiffly for which ludmila could hardly blame him after four and a half hours in the air she too had cramps and kinks aplenty ignoring the officer in charge of the airstrip the foreign commissar stumped off into the darkness looking for a secluded place to piss ludmila guessed the most nearly human response shed yet seen from mov lhe officer the collar tabs of his greatcoat were air force skyblue and bore a winged prop and a majors two scarlet rectangles turned to ludmila and said we are ordered to render you every assistance senior lieutenant gorbunov gorbunova sir ludmila corrected only a little put out the heavy winter flight suit would have disguised any shape at all gorbunova pardon me the major said eyebrows rising did i read the despatch wrong or was it written incorrectly well no matter if you have been chosen to fly the comrade foreign commissar your competence cannot be questioned his tone of voice said he did question it but ludmila let that go the major went on more briskly now what do you require senior lieutenant fuel for the aircraft oil if necessary and a mechanical check if you have a mechanic who can do a proper job ludmila put first things first she also wished she could have lashed georg schultz to the us fuselage and carried him along almost as an afterthought she added food and someplace warm for me to sleep through the day would be pleasant harry turtledove would be necessary molotov amended as he came back to the kukuruznik his face remained expressionless but his voice betrayed more animation ludmila wondered how hard hed been fighting to hold it in her own bladder was pretty full too perhaps confirming her thought the foreign commissar continued tea would also be welcome now not before ran through ludmilas mind he would have exploded she knew that feeling the major said comrades if you will come with me he led ludmila and molotov toward his own dwelling as they kicked their way through the snow he bawled orders to his groundcrew the men ran like wraiths in the predawn darkness easier to follow by ear than by eye the majors quarters were half hut half dugout cave a lantern on a boardandtrestle table cast a flickering light over the little chamber a samovar stood nearby so did a spirit stove atop the latter was a pot from which rose a heavenly odor with every sign of pride the major ladled out bowls of borscht thick with cabbage beets and meat that might have been veal or just as easily might have been rat ludmila didnt care whatever it was it was hot and filling molotov ate as if he were stoking a machine the major handed them glasses of tea it was also hot but had an odd taste a couple of odd tastes in fact cut with dried herbs and barks im afraid the major said apologetically and sweetened with honey we found ourselves havent seen any sugar for quite a while given the circumstances it is adequate molotov said not high praise but understanding at any rate comrade pilot you may rest there the major said pointing to a pile of blankets in one corner that evidently served him for a bed comrade foreign commissar for you the men are preparing a cot which should be here momentarily not necessary molotov said a blanket or two will also do for me what the major blinked well as you say of course excuse me comrades he went back out into the cold returned in a little while with more blankets here you are comrade foreign commissar thank you be sure to awaken us at the scheduled time molotov said oh yes the major promised yawning ludmila buried herself in the blankets they smelled powerfully of their usual user that didnt bother her if anything it was reassuring she wondered how molotov who was used to sleeping softer than with blankets on dirt would manage here she fell asleep herself before she found out some indefinite while later she woke with a start was that horrible noise some new lizard weapon she stared wildly around the air force worldwar in the balance majors quarters then started to laugh who would have imagined that illustrious vyacheslav mikhailovich molotov foreign commissar of the ussr and second in the soviet union only to the great stalin snored like a buzzsaw ludmila pulled the blankets up over her head which cut the din enough to let her get back to sleep herself after more borscht and vile honeysweetened tea the flight resumed the u droned slowly through the night an express train could have matched its speed north and west snowdappled evergreen forests slid by below ludmila hugged the ground as tightly as she dared then without warning the trees disappeared to be replaced by a long stretch of unbroken whiteness lake ladoga ludmila said aloud pleased at the navigational check the lake gave her she flew along the southern shore toward leningrad well before she got to the city she skimmed low over the lunar landscape of the german and soviet lines around it the lizards had pounded both impartially before they came though the heroism and dreadful privations of the defenders of leningrad home and heart of the october revolution had rung through the soviet union how many thousands how many hundreds of thousands starved to death inside the german ring no one would ever know and now she was flying molotov to confer with the germans who had subjected leningrad to such a cruel siege intellectually ludmila understood the need for that emotionally it remained hard to stomach yet the kukuruznik she flew had been efficiently maintained by a german and from what georg schultz had said he and major jager had fought alongside russians to do something important either he didnt understand exactly what or he was keeping his mouth shut about that or boo it could be done it would have to be done in fact but ludmila did tt like it as the shore of lake ladoga had before now the gulf of finland gave her something to steer by she began to peer ahead looking for landing lights the next field was supposed to be not far from vyborg when ludmila finally spotted the lights she bounced the biplane in a good deal more roughly than she had at the last airstrip the officer who greeted her spoke russian with an odd accent that was not unusual in the polyglot soviet union but then she noticed that several of his men wore coalscuttle helmets are you germans she asked first in russian and then auf deutsch nein he answered though his german sounded better than hers we are finns welcome to viipuri his smile was not altogether pleasant the town had passed from finnish to soviet hands in the winter war of but the finns took it back when they joined the nazis against the ussr in can one of your mechanics handle this type of aircraft she asked harry turtledove with an ironic glint in his eye he scanned the kukuruznik from one end to the other meaning no disrespect but i think any twelveyearold who is handy with tools could work on one of these he answered since he was probably right ludmila kept her annoyance to herself the finnish base had better food than ludmila had tasted in some time it also seemed cleaner than the ones from which shed been fighting she wondered whether that was because the finns hadnt seen as much action against the lizards as the soviets had partly the officer whod greeted her said when she asked his greatcoat she noticed once they were inside was gray not khaki it had three narrow bars on the cuffs she wondered what rank that made him and partly again meaning no disrespect you may see that other people are often just generally neater about things than you russians but never mind that would you care to use our sauna when he saw she didnt understand the finnish word he turned it into german steambath oh yes she exclaimed not only was it a chance to get clean it was a chance to get warm the finns didnt even leer at her when she went in alone as russians would have done she wondered how manly they were flying over finland and then over sweden she thought about what the finnish officer had said just looking down at countryside that war had not ravaged was new and different flying past towns that werent burnedout ruins took her thoughts back to better days shed almost forgotten in the midst of combats urgency even under snow though she could see the orderly patterns of fields and fences everything was on a smaller scale than in the soviet union and almost toylike in its tiny perfection she wondered if the scandinavians were neater than russians simply because they had so much less land and had to use it more efficiently that impression grew stronger in denmark where even forest had all but vanished and every square centimeter seemed put to some useful purpose and then past denmark she flew into germany germany she saw at once had been at war though her flight path took her a couple of hundred kilometers west of murdered berlin she saw devastation that matched anything shed come across in the soviet union in fact first the british and then the lizards had given germany a more concentrated beating from the air than the soviet union as a whole had received town after town had factories train stations and residential blocks pounded to ruins for that matter the lizards were still pounding germany when ludmila heard the roar of their jets she flew doubly low and slow as if her u were a tiny gnat buzzing by the floor too small to be worth noticing the germans were still fighting back too tracers spiderwebbed across the night sky like fireworks searchlights stabbed trying to pin liz worldwar in the balance ard raiders with their beams once or twice off in the distance ludmila heard piston engines racing so she thought the luftwaffe still has fighters in the air too as she flew farther south the land began to rise her landing strip the fourth night of her flight outside a little town called suilzbach was in what looked to have been a potato field a ground crew dragged her plane to cover while a luftwaffe officer drove her and molotov to town in a horsedrawn wagon the lizards are too likely to shoot at automobiles he explained apologetically she nodded it is so with us too ah said the luftwaffe man every so often pravda or izvestia would describe the atmosphere in diplomatic talks as correct ludmila hadnt quite understood what that meant now seeing the way the germans treated her and molotov she did they were polite they were attentive but they couldnt hide that they wished they didnt have to deal with the soviets at all it was mutual ludmila thought at least as far as she was concerned as for molotov he was seldom more than civil to anyone russian or german ludmila had to work hard to suppress a yelp of glee at the prospect of sleeping in a real bed for the first time in she couldnt remember how long suppress it she did lest the nazis take her for uncultured she also studi ously ignored the luftwaffe officers hints that he wouldnt mind sleeping in that same bed with her to her relief he didnt get obnoxious about it he did say you will i hope forgive me but i would not recommend trying to fly to berchtesgaden by night fraulein gorbunova my rank is senior lieutenant ludmila answered why would you noommend thisjlying at night is difficult enough i have flown a good many night attack missions both against the lizards and against you germans she said let him make of that what he would his eyes widened but only momentarily then he said maybe so but those i dare say were out on the russian steppe not in the mountains he waited for her response she nodded yielding the point he went on the danger is worse in the mountains not only because of the terrain but also from gusts of wind your margin of error would be unacceptably low for a mission of this importance especially since you will want to stay as low to the ground as you can what do you suggest then a flight by day the lizards are too likely to shoot me down the german said i admit this to protect you as you fly by day though we will sortie several squadrons of fighters not to escort you for harry turtledove that would attract unwanted attention to your aircraft but to distract the lizards from the area through which you will be passing ludmila considered that given the inequality between german planes and what the lizards flew some pilots would almost certainly be sacrificing their lives to make sure she and molotov got through to this berchtesgaden place she also knew she had no experience in mountain flying if the nazis were willing to help her mission so she decided she had to accept thank you she said heii hitler the luftwaffe man answered which did nothing to make her happier about working with germans when she and molotov went clipclopping out to the airstrip next morning she discovered the german ground crew had daubed the us wings and fuselage with splotches of whitewash one of the fellows in overalls said now youll look more like snow and rocks soviet winter camouflage was more thoroughly white but snow drifted more evenly across the steppe than it did in mountains she didnt know how much the whitewash would help but supposed it couldnt hurt the groundcrew man grinned as she thanked him in her accented german when she got a good look at the mountains toward which she was flying she was glad shed taken the luftwaffe officers advice and not tried to make the trip by night the landing field to which she was ordered lay not far outside the village of berchtesgaden when she set the kukuruznik down there she assumed hitlers residence lay within the village instead a long wagon ride up the side of the mountain obersalzberg she learned it was called followed molotov sat staring stonily straight ahead the whole way up he said nothing much whatever went on behind the mask of his face he kept it there he glared right through the soldiers at two checkpoints ignored the barbed wire that ringed the compound hitlers berghof when the wagon finally reached it reminded ludmila of a pleasant little resort house swallowed up by a residence that met the demands of a world leader molotov was whisked away into the berghof ludmila thought she recognized his german counterpart von ribbentrop from newsreels during the strange couple of years when the soviet union and germany held to their friendship treaty she wasnt important enough to be lodged in the berghof the germans escorted her over to a guesthouse not far away as she stood in the splendid lobby all she could think was how many workers and peasants had had their labor exploited to create it she was primly certain no one in the classless soviet union cared to live in such unnecessary splendor down the staircase came an officer in the natty black uniform and beret of the german panzer formations a colonel by the two pips on each braided shoulder strap on his right breast he wore a large garish eight worldwar in the balance pointed gold star with a swastika in the center he was lean and perfectly shaved and looked quite at home here close by his fhrerjust watching his smooth stride made ludmila feel short and dumpy and out of place she swung the knapsack that held her few belongings over one shoulder the motion drew the natty colonels eye he stopped stared then hurried across the parquet floor to her ludmila he exclaimed and went on in fair russian what the devil are you doing here she recognized his voice even if she hadnt known his face heinrich she said trying hard not to pronounce it with an initial g as russians often did she was so glad to find someone she knew that heedless equally of startled looks from her german escorts and of what molotoy would think when the news got back to him she gave jiger a hug he enthusiastically returned youve been promoted two grades she observed thats wonderful his grin was selfdeprecating they offered me a choice lieutenantcolonel and the knights cross or colonel and just hitlers fried egg here he patted the gaudy medal excuse me the german cross in gold they thought id take glory i took rank rank lasts hitlers fried egg ludmila echoed in delicious amazement she noticed her escorts were ostentatiously pretending they hadnt noticed that she shook her head my well have a lot to talk about yes we will for a moment jagers face assumed the watchful expression shed first seen at the ukrainian kolkhoz then the smile came back yes we will he repeated quite a lot atvar stared out at the assembled shiplords they silently stared back he tried to gauge their mood before he called the meeting to order nothing short of mutiny maybe not even that would have surprised him well past one of the races years into a campaign even expected to be a walkover no one had yet turned one eye turret let alone two toward victory the fleetlord decided to confront that headon assembled males i know we face new problems almost every day on tosev sometimes we are even forced to face old problems over again as in the tosevite empire called italia the shiplord straha stood crouched and waited to be recognized when atvar pointed to him he asked how did the deutsche manage to kidnap whatshisname the big ugly in charge of italia mussolini atvar supplied thank you exalted fleetlord yes mussolini how did the deutsche manage to steal him when we shut him up in that castle away from everything after he had surrendered his empire to us how they learned where he was we do not know atvar admitted they are skilled at such irregular warfare and i must concede the move has embarrassed us embarrassed us i should say so straha added an emphatic cough his radio broadcasts from deutschland negate much of the value we got from that big ugly from warsaw the one who spoke so convincingly against the deutsche russie atvar said after a quick glance at a tickler file on the computer screen in front of him the file also told him something else wed reached the point of diminishing returns with that one in any case his last statement had to be electronically altered to make it conform to our requirements the big uglies have not yet adjusted themselves to the idea that the race will rule over them the shiplord kirel said mournfully worldwar in the balance and why should they straha retorted his voice dripping sarcasm as far as i can see they have no reason to this affair with mussolini is but one more embarrassment in a long series now italia seethes with sabotage where before it was among the calmest of the empires under our control feneress a male of strahas faction chimed in moreover it lets the deutsche make a folk hero of this he checked his own computer for the name he sought this skorzeny who led the raid and encourages other tosevites to try to emulate his feat kirel started to come to atvars defense but the fleetlord held up a hand what you say is true feneress he replied for his failure the male in charge of the big ugly mussolinis security would normally have found himself liable to severe disciplinary action as however he perished in the tosevite raid this has become impracticable the assembled shiplords stirred and murmured among themselves for the fleetlord to admit failure so frankly was strange and untoward no wonder they murmured they had to be trying to figure out what atvars concession meant did it signal a change in strategy did it mean atvar would resign his post perhaps in favor of straha if so what did that imply for each shiplord atvar raised his hand again slowly the murmurs died away the fleetlord said i did not summon you to the bannership to dwell on failure assembled shiplords on the contrary i summoned you here to outline a course which i believe will give us victory the officers stirred and murmured all over again some of them atvar knew had begun to despair of victory others still thought it could be attained but the means they wanted to use would leave tosev a ruin unfit forllement by the colonization fleet now traveling across interstellar spactoward the planet if he could prove them wrong and still make the big uglies submit atvar would be ahead indeed and he thought he could he said we have been discomfited by the disturbingly advanced technology the tosevites have demonstrated were it not for those advances whose causes we are still investigating the conquest of tosev would have been routine and we all would have been a lot happier kirel put in atvar saw shiplords mouths fall open that they could still laugh was a good sign we have been perhaps slower than we should in appreciating the implications of the big uglies technology the fleetlord said compared to the tosevites the race is slow they have used that fact to their advantage against us but we are also thorough compare our empire the empire to the ephemeral makeshift empires and irrational administrative schemes under which they live and now we have found a flaw in their technology which we hope we can exploit harry turtledove hed grabbed their attention by the way they stared hungrily at him he might have been some powdered ginger in front of a crowd of addicts he made himself put that problem out of his mind for now he had to dwell on advantages not problems he said our vehicles and aircraft are fueled by hydrogen and oxygen produced electrolytically from water with energy from the atomic engines of our starships getting all the fuel we need has never been a problem if tosev possesses anything in excess it is water and perhaps not surprisingly we have evaluated the big uglies capabilities in terms of our own this evaluation has proved erroneous the shiplords murmured yet again highranking members of the race were usually less candid about admitting error especially when it reflected discredit on them atvar would also have been less candid than he was had the advantage he gained here not outweighed the damage he suffered for acknowledging previous wrong instead of hydrogen and oxygen tosevite aircraft and ground and sea vehicles run on one distillate of petroleum or another he said this has disadvantages not least among them the noxious fumes such vehicles emit while operating thats true by the emperor straha said go into one of the cities that we rule and your nictitating membranes will sizzle from all the garbage in the air indeed atvar said pollutants aside however our engineers assure me there is no reason for petroleumbased engines to be less efficient than our own in fact they may even have certain minor advantages because their fuels are liquids at ordinary temperatures they dont require the extensive insulation around our vehicles hydrogen tanks and thus save weight kirel said still it is criminal to waste petroleum by simply burning it when it may be put to so many more advantageous uses truth when the conquest is complete we shall phase out this profligate technology atvar said i might note however that our geologists believe tosev has more petroleum than any of the empires other planets perhaps more than all three put together in part due to its anomalously large percentage of water surface area but this takes us away from the point on account of which i summoned todays assembly what is that point three shiplords said it together in other circumstances the blunt question would have come perilously close to insubordination now though atvar was willing to forgive it the point assembled males is that even on tosev petroleum is as the shiplord kirel said a precious and relatively uncommon commodity the fleetlord answered it is not found worldwide the empire or rather the notempire of deutschland for example has but one primary worldwar in the balance source of petroleum that being in the subordinate empire called romania he used a hologram to show the shiplords where romania lay and where inside its boundaries sat the underground petroleum pool a question exalted fleetlord called shonar a male of kirels faction he waited for atvar to recognize him then said shall we be required to occupy the petroleumproducing regions not already under our control that could prove expensive in terms of both males and munitions it will not be necessary atvar declared in some instances we need not even attack the areas where petroleum comes from the ground as i noted before the big uglies burn not just petroleum in their vehicles but rather distillates of petroleum the facilities which produce those distillates are large and prominent identify and destroy them and we have destroyed the tosevites ability to resist is this clear by the excited hisses and squeaks that came from the assembled shiplords it was atvar wished the race had found this strategy as soon as the conquest began wish as he would though he could not blame anyone too severely tosev was simply so different from what the race had expected to find that his technical staff had needed a while to figure out what was important and what wasnt now he hoped they had by a year from now he said tosev shall be under our claws the males in the conference chamber gobbled and hooted the races applause filled atvar with a warm glow of pride he might yet go down in the annals of his people as atvar the conqueror subduer of tosev the shiplords took up a chant may it be so may it be so at first atvar took that as an expression of confident expectation after a moment though he realized it could also have another meaning if the race hadnt conered the big uglies within the coming year how much trouble wcit face by that years end grinding through the air high above the isle of wight george bagnall thought he could see forever the day was for once brilliantly clear as the lancaster wheeled through another of its patrol circuits the english channel france across it and england were in turn spread out before him like successive examples of the cartographers craft wonder how they ever made maps and got the shapes right back before they could fly over them and see the way they were supposed to look he said in the pilots seat beside him ken embry grunted i wonder what it looks like to the lizards they get up high enough to take in the whole world at a glance hadnt thought of that the flight engineer said it would be something to see wouldnt it he was filled with sudden anger that the lizards had a privilege denied mankind under the anger he realized lay pure and simple envy harry turtledove well just have to make the best of what weve got embry leaned forward against the restraint of his belts pointed down toward the grayblue waters of the channel what do you make of that ship for instance what do you think i am a bloody spotter but bagnall leaned forward too its a submarine by god he said in surprise submarine on the surface in the channel one of ours id bet it is embry said lizards or no lizards somehow i dont think winnie is dead keen on having uboats slide past the skirts of the home islands cant blame him for that bagnall took another look westbound he observed wonder if its carrying something interesting for the yanks theres a thought lizards arent much when it comes to sea business are they i expect a subd be all the harder for them to take out embry leaned forward once more himself a bit of fun to guess eh most days wed be all swaddled in cotton batting up here and not have the sport of it thats true enough now bagnall twisted around in his chair to peer back into the bomb bay which for some time had housed no bombs most days goldfarb has a better view of the world than we do radar cares nothing for clouds it peers right through them so it does embry said on the other hand given the choice of jobs id sooner peep out through the perspex on a scene like this or even on the usual clouds come to that than be stuck in the bowels of the aircraft watching electrons chase themselves you get no arguments from me bagnall said none whatever but then i dare say goldfarbs a bit of a queer bird all the way around fancy spending so long mooning after that barmaid sylvia finally getting her and then throwing her aside bare days later the pilot laughed goatishly maybe she wasnt as good as hed hoped i doubt that bagnall spoke from experience never a dull moment there id have thought as much from her looks but one cant always judge by looks enjoyable as it may be to try embry shrugged well its not my affair in either the literal or figurative sense of the word and just as well too speaking of goldfarb however he flicked the intercom switch any sign of our scaly little chums radarman no sir goldfarb said dead quiet here dead quiet embry repeated do you know i quite like the ring of that yes rather bagnall said one more mission from which we have some reasonable hope of landing the flight engineer chuckled weve been living so long on borrowed time by now that i sometimes entertain hopes we shant have to repay it one day worldwar in the balance disabuse yourselves of those my friend the day they took the limit off the number of missions an aircrew could be ordered to fly they signed our death warrants and no mistake the trick lies in evading the inevitable as long as one can after you got us down safe in france i refuse to believe anything is impossible bagnall said i was at least as surprised at surviving that as you believe me nothing like a bit of luck what embry laughed but if the lizards choose not to stir about for another couple of hours i concede we shall have had an easy time of it today we are occasionally entitled to one such dont you think the lizards did stay quiet at the appointed hour embry gratefully swung the lanc back toward dover the return descent and landing were so smooth that the pilot said thank you for flying boac today as the bulky bomber rolled to a stop no commercial passengers however ever deplaned so rapidly as the men who flew with him as bagnall scrambled out of the cockpit and down onto the tarmac one of the groundcrew men gave him a cheeky grin ere you mustve heard theyve got the power on again youre out an eadin for the barracks so quick have they the flight engineer stepped up his pace from quick to doublequick all sorts of delightful visions danced in his head light by which to read or play cards an electric fire a working hotplate on which to brew tea or heat water for a proper shave a phonograph that spun the possibilities seemed to stretch as far as the horizon had up in the lancaster one that had entirely slipped his mind was listening to the bbc several weeks had gone by since the barracks last had power while the beeb wa the air the lizards kept plastering the transmitter trying to silenk the human broadcast just hearing the newsreader made bagnall once more feel part of a world larger than the airbase and its environs it had a different effect on david goldfarb by god he said cocking his head toward the wireless set i wish i could talk like that having a pretty fair publicschool accent himself bagnall took the broadcasters smooth tones for granted when it was pointed out to him though he could see how theyd rouse jealousy in the heart of one from londons lower middle class he was no henry higgins but his ear pretty accurately placed goldfarb the bbc man said we now present in its entirety a recording recently received in london from underground sources in poland the speaker is mr moishe russie hitherto familiar to many as an apologist for the lizards a translation will follow the recording began bagnall had a little german but found it didnt help much unlike russies previous propaganda broadcasts this one was harry turtledove in yiddish the flight engineer wondered if he should ask goldfarb what russie was saying perhaps not the jewish radarman was humiliated at having a quisling for a cousin goldfarb plainly had no trouble following russie without translation he stared at the wireless set as if he could see his relative there every so often his right fist would come down thump on his thigh in the brief moment of silence that followed the end of russies statement the radarman exclaimed lies i knew it was all lies before bagnall could ask what was all lies the bbc newsreader re turned that was mr moishe russie he said his voice even more mel low than usual when heard hard on the heels of yiddish gutturals and i now as promised the translation here is our staffer mr nathan jacobi a brief rustle of papers then a new voice just as cultured as the one that had gone before mr russie spoke as follows my last broadcast for the lizards was a fraud from top to bottom i was forced to speak with a gun to my head even then the lizards had to alter my words to force them into the meaning they desired i categorically condemn their efforts to enslave mankind and urge all possible resistance some may wonder why i ever spoke on their behalf the answer is simple their attack on germany aided my people whom the nazis were murdering when a folk is being slaughtered even slavery seems a preferable alternative and an enslaver can be looked upon with gratitude but the lizards have proved murderers too not just of jews but of mankind in its entirety god help each and every one of us find the strength and courage to resist them after more rustlings the first bbc man came back on the air that was mr nathan jacobi translating into english mr moishe russies repu diation of recent statements he has made on behalf of the lizards this cannot fail to embarrass the alien invaders of our world who see even their seemingly loyalest associates turn against their vicious and aggres sive policies the prime minister mr churchill has expressed his admi ration for the courage required of mr russie in making this repudiation and his hope that mr russie will succeed in escaping the lizards ven geance in other news david goldfarb sighed deeply nobody here has any notion of how fine that makes me feel he announced to the barracks at large oh i think we might ken embry said bagnall had been about to say something along those lines himself but decided the pilots under statement did the job for both of them goldfarb laughed the british way of speaking used to drive my fa there mad he learned english quick enough after he got over here but he never has fathomed how people can get along without screaming at each other now and again whether theyre angry or happy what do you think we are a pack of bloody fishwives bagnall did worldwar in the balance his best to sound deeply offended the restrained publicschool accent didnt make it any easier i was talking about him not me goldfarb said i can read between the lines you might say i you mean youre a grand and know what lot of chaps every bloody one of you he laughed again and i know thats more than a proper englishman ought to say but who says im proper i wish i could get some leave its been too damned long since i got to go home and shout at my relations what a bizarre notion bagnall thought family ties were all very well but the aircrew had largely replaced his relatives at the center of his life only after a few seconds did he think to wonder whether goldfarb had something he lacked through his interpreter adolf hitler said good day herr foreign commissar i hope you slept well come in come in we have much of which to speak thank you chancellor vyacheslav molotov followed hitler into the small living room which had been part of the german leaders berchtesgaden retreat before that was incorporated into the grander berghof surrounding it molotov supposed being ushered into hitlers sanctum sanctorum was an honor if so he would willmgly have forgone it everything in the room screamed petitbourgeois at him the overstuffed furniture with its oldgerman look the robber plants the cactus good heavens the place even had a bass canary cage stalin would laugh when he heard about that strewn here and there on the chairs and couches were embroidered pils most of them decorated with swastikas swastikabedizened knnacks crowded tables even hitler looked embarrassed at their profusion i know they arent what youd call lovely he said waving at the display but the german women make them and send them to me so i dont like to throw them away petitbourgeois sentimentality too molotov thought scornfully stalin would also find that funny the only sentiment stalin had in him was a healthy regard for his own aggrandizement and that of the soviet union but the twisted romantic streak made hitler more dangerous not less because it meant he acted in ways that could not be rationally calculated his invasion of the ussr had sent stalin into several days of shock before he began rallying soviet resistance compared to german imperialism that of the british and french was downright genteel now though the whole world faced imperialism from aliens whose ancient economic and political systems were joined with a technology more than modern molotov had repeatedly gone through the words of harry turtledove marx and engels to try to grasp how such an anomaly could be but without success what was clear was that advanced capitalist and socialist societies had to do everything in their power to resist being thrown catastrophically backward in their development hitler said you may thank general secretary stalin for sharing with germany the possible explosive materials which were obtained by the combined germansoviet fighting team i shall do so molotov inclined his head in a precise nod as well he had long schooled his features to reveal nothing for they did not show hitler the consternation he felt so that damned german tankman had got through after all that was very bad stalin had intended proffering the image of cooperation not its substance he would not be pleased hitler went on the government of the soviet union is to be commended for thinking this explosive too valuable to be flown to germany and letting it come by the overland route where even you herr foreign commissar traveled here by air the sarcasm there was enough to raise welts not least because molotov loathed flying of any sort and had been ordered by stalin into the horrible little biplane that brought him to germany pretending everything was serene molotov said comrade stalin solicited the advice of military experts and then followed it he is of course delighted that your consignment reached you safely by the plan he devised a thumping lie but how was hitler supposed to call him on it especially since the courier had somehow beaten the odds of the journey but hitler found a way please tell herr stalin also that he would have done better to fly it here as then we should not have had half of it hijacked by jews whats that molotov said hijacked by jews hitler repeated as if to a backward child molotov concealed his irritation in the same way he concealed everything not immediately relevant to the business at hand hitler gestured violently his voice rose to an angry shout as the good german major was traversing poland he was halted at gunpoint by jewish bandits who forced him to divest himself of half the precious treasure he was bringing to german science this was news and unsettling news to molotov he could not resist a barb in return had you not so tormented the jews in the states your armies overcame no doubt they would have been less eager to interfere with the courier but the jews are parasites on the body of mankind hitler said earnestly they have no culture of their own the foundations of their situation of living are always taken from those around them they completely lack the idealistic attitude the will to contribute to the development of worldwar in the balance others look how they more than anyone else have cozied up to the lizards backsides look why they have molotov returned his wife polina zhemchuzhina was of jewish blood though he did not think hitler knew that anyone drowning will grab for a spar no matter where he finds it so the british joined us in the fight against you he thought aloud he went on besides has not the lizards former chief spokesman among the polish jews repudiated them and gone into hiding hitler waved that aside aliens themselves in europe they find their fit place toadying to the worse aliens who now torment us what do you mean molotov asked sharply have they turned over to the lizards the explosive metal they took from the courier if so i demaud that you allow me to communicate with my government immediately stalin would have to know at once that the lizards knew for certain human beings were working to duplicate their much greater weapons so he could apply yet another layer of secrecy to his project no not even they were so depraved as that hitler admitted he sounded reluctant to make any concession no matter how small well what then did they keep it for themselves molotov wondered what the polish jews would do if they had kept the explosive metal would they make a bomb and use it against the lizards or would they make one and use it against the reich that question would have been going through hitlers mind too but the german leader shook his head they did not keep it either they are going to try to smuggle it to the fellow jews in the united states hitlers little toothbrush mustache quivered as if hed just smelled something rotten lotov wondered how many of those jews would have fled to the unid states had the nazis not forced them out of germany and its allies the tsars and their pogroms had done the same thing in precommunist russia and the present soviet union was the poorer for their shortsightedness molotov was too convinced an atheist to take any religion seriously as far as doctrine but jews tended to be both clever and well educated valuable traits in any nation that aspired to build and grow with a scissorslike effort of will the foreign minister snipped off those irrelevant threads of thought and returned to the matter at hand he said i need to inform the general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union of this development it wasnt as urgent as if the lizards had learned what stalin was up to but it was important news america after all not germany or britain was the most powerful capitalist state and so the most likely future opponent of the soviet union assuming such concerns kept their meaning in a world with lizards in it arrangements will be made for you to communicate hitler said harry turtledove the telegraph through scandinavia remains fairly reliable and fairly secure that will have to do molotov said fairly reliable he could deal with nothing could be expected to work perfectly but fairly secure the nazis were bunglers indeed if they tolerated security that was only fair inside where it did not show the soviet foreign minister smiled the germans had no idea how thoroughly agents of the ussr kept stalin informed about everything they did the nefarious jews came close to preventing our brilliant aryan scientists from having the amount of explosive metal with which they needed to work hitler said molotov made a mental note of that it meant the americans also probably had a marginal quantity of the material and it meant the soviet union had plenty stalin had a right to expect results from his own researchers then but hitler wasnt thinking about that what he had in mind was vengeance the lizards must come first he said i admit this they are the greatest present danger to mankind but after them we shall punish the jewish traitors who true to their nature aligned themselves with the alien against the aryan essence of true creative humanity his voice rose almost to a screech in that last sentence now abruptly it turned low conspiratorial and you russians owe the poles a little something eh whats that molotov said caught off guard and stalling for time even though he needed the interpreter to follow hitlers words he could hear the control the german leader had over his tone that made him a formidable orator certainly more effective there than stalin who was not only pedantic but had never lost his georgian accent come come hitler said impatiently you must have heard the lizards polish collaborators going on about the socalled massacre of their officers at katyn trying to discredit the soviet union in the same way the jews paint the reich with a big black brush i do not trouble myself with the lizards propaganda broadcasts molotov said which was true he had underlings listen to them for him as for katyn he thought the poles had little to fuss about after the soviets reannexed the eastern half of poland which had after all belonged to russia for more than a century before the chaos of the revolution broke it loose and let pilsudski establish his fascist state there what were they to do with the reactionary officers who had fallen into their hands turn them loose and let them foment rebellion not likely by soviet standards getting rid of those few thousand unreliables was but a small purge hitler said both your government and mine have reason to be unhappy with those who dwell in the anomalous territory of poland we were wise to divide it between ourselves once when the lizards are dealt worldwar in the balance with we can join in punishing the inhabitants of that land to the full ex tent they deserve by which you mean with bombs of this explosive metal molotov asked hitler nodded molotov said i cannot view this proposal favorably our scientists report the wind spreads poisons from these weapons over an area far broader than the site of the explosion itself and since the prevail ing winds are from west to east the soviet union would be adversely af fected by this devastation however much the poles may deserve it well we can discuss it further at another time hitler sounded casual but looked unhappy had he expected molotov to cooperate in dev astating his own country maybe he had the germans had even less use for russians than they did for poles but russian scientists and engineers had already shown themselves better than the nazis expected a great many times no let us discuss it now molotov said hitler looked unhappier yet as he had back in when molotov demanded specifics on the workings of the germansoviet nonaggression treaty no wonder hed looked unhappy then he was already plotting the nazi attack on the ussr what was he plotting now the soviet foreign minister repeated let us discuss it now let us assume for example that we manage to de feat the lizards completely what then will be the proper relations what then will be the proper boundaries between the german reich and the so viet union both i and general secretary stalin await your reply to this question with great interest the interpreter stumbled a couple of times in translating that perhaps he tried to shade its bluntness hitler gave molotov a baleful stare his german toadies did not talk to him like that for that matter had molotov tallyho stalin that way he would have vanished within days perhaps wit minutes if the lizards are completely defeated we will then review our relations with the soviet union as with all nations of the world the fhrer answered how they are defeated will obviously have a great deal to do with the nature of that review molotov started to complain that hitler hadnt really said anything but left those words unuttered the nazi leader had a point who did what to beat the lizards would play a role in what the world looked like after they were beaten if they were beaten not a complaint molotov decideda warning you must be aware of one thing he told hitler who assumed an apprehensive expression as if a dentist had just announced he needed more work molotov went on your earlier remark indicated that you hoped to exploit soviet ignorance of these explosivemetal bombs this behavior is intolerable and makes me understand how and why the jews of poland preferred the lizards harry turtledove yoke to yours we have need of one another now but comrade stalin will never again trust you as he did after august i never trusted your pack of jews and bolsheviks hitler shouted better to be under the hissing lizards than the red flag his whole body quivered molotov braced himself to endure a ranting speech like those that came hissing and popping out of the worlds shortwave sets but then with an almost physical effort of will hitler made limself be calm living alongside the red flag however may yet be possible as you say herr molotov we have need of each other da molotov said hed pushed hitler hard as stalin had ordered and the german still seemed to think cooperation even if on his own terms wherever possible a better gamble than any other on one thing i think we can agree hitler persisted when all this is done the map of europe need no longer be stained by what has been miscalled the nation of poland perhaps not its existence has sometimes been inconvenient for the soviet union as well as germany molotov said where would you place the boundary between german and soviet control on the line our two states established in hitler looked pained well he might molotov thought with a frosty smile the nazis had overrun sovietoccupied poland in the first days of their treacherous attack their line ran hundreds of kilometers to the east when the lizards came but if they were serious about working with the ussr they would have to pay a price as i said before precise details can be worked out come the day hitler said for now let me ask again if we agree in principle first the lizards then the untermenschen between us in principle yes molotov said but as with all principles details of implementation are critical i might also note in passing speaking of principles that in times past german propaganda has frequently identified the people and communist party of the ussr as subhuman this produces yet another difficulty in harmonious relations between our two nations when we announce that you and i have conferred we shall make no such statements hitler assured him you and i both know that what one advances for purposes of propaganda is often irrelevant to ones actual beliefs that is certainly true molotov said the example that flashed through his mind was all the progerman material his own government had pumped out in the year and ten months before june the converse also applied but he had no doubts about where the nazis sincere feelings lay hitler said you will of course take lunch with me thank you molotov said resignedly the meal proved as abstemi worldwar in the balance ous as hed expected beef broth a dry breast of pheasant hitler did not touch his portion and a salad the fhrer kept his personal life simple that did not however make him any more comfortable to deal with i havent ridden on a hay wagon since i got off the farm sam yeager said as the wagon in question rolled west on us into the outskirts of detroit lakes minnesota and i havent been through here since was it something like that when i was in the northern league and wed swing through on the way from fargo to duluth duluss i know for we get off horrible boat thing there said ristin who huddled in the wagon beside him but what is fargo the lizard pow made the name sound like a bronx cheer mediumsized town maybe fifty miles west of where we are yeager answered barbara larssen rode in the wagon too though she sat as far away from him as she could still her voice was casual as she asked is there any place in the united states you havent been one time or another i havent been up through the northeast much new york new england the towns there they either belong to the international league or the bigs and i never made it there yeager spoke without bitterness simply stating a fact barbara nodded yeager cautiously watched her after those frenzied couple of minutes in her cabin on the caledonia he hadnt touched her not even to help her in or out of a wagon she hadnt spoken to him at all the first three days they were on the ship and only in monosyllables the fourth but since theyd unloaded at duluth and started the slow plod weshed traveled in the same part of the wagon convoy as he did and thlt couple of days in the same wagon yesterday shed talked more witltullhass and ristin than with him but today everything seemed well not quite all right but at least not too bad he looked around the low rolling hills were white with snow it also covered the ice that sealed northern minnesotas countless lakes its not like this in summer he said everythings smooth and green and the lakes sparkle like diamonds when the sun hits them at the right angle the fishing is good around these parts walleyes pike pickerel i hear they fish here in the wintertime too cut holes in the ice and drop a line down i dont see much sport in going out and freezing when you dont have to myself so much water ullhass said turning one eye turret to the left and the other to the right it seems not natural it seems not natural to me too barbara said im from california and the idea of fresh water just lying around all over the place strikes me as very strange the ocean is all right but fresh water forget it harry turtledove ocean is not natural too ullhass insisted have seen pictures of tosev this world from what do you say outer space yes looks all water sometimes looks wrong he emphasized the last word with the emphatic cough seeing earth from space yeager said dreamily how long would it have been before men managed that in his lifetime maybe on the north shore of detroit lake a little south of the actual town of detroit lakes stood a tourist camp with cabins and picnic bnches and a couple of bigger resort hotels all looking much forlorn half a year out of the season for which they were built this place just buzzes in july yeager said they have themselves a summer carnival that wont quit with floats and swimming and diving races for canoes races for speedboats bathing beauties yes youd like that barbara murmured sams ears got hot but he gamely went on with what hed been about to say and all the beer a man could drink even though it was still prohibition when i went through here i dont know if they brought it down from canada or brewed it themselves but the whole team got blitzed course we didnt call it that back then good thing the road back to fargo ran straight and flat or the bus driver wouldve killed us all i expect though the cabins were intended for summer use several of them were open now with wagons pulled up alongside barbara pointed some of those arent from our convoy theyre in the group that came by way of highway good to see theyve made it here yeager said the refugees from the met lab hadnt traveled west across minnesota all together for fear such a large wagon train would bring lizard aircraft down on them in some places though the roads came together detroit lakes was a scheduled layover point the wagon driver looked back from his team of plodding horses and said look at all the firewood the people round about here got chopped for us its like if theyd known we were coming theydve baked a cake when he got down from the wagon yeager discovered the locals had baked a cake in fact theyd baked a lot of cakes though some he noted were made from potato flour and none had any frosting but such details were soon lost in a great profusion of eggs and turkey steaks and fried chickens legs of lamb he lost track of what he was eating as he stuffed himself after so long living out of tin cans in chicago i almost forgot they made spreads like this he said to a detroit lakes man who carried around yet another platter of drumsticks weve got more than we know what to do with when it comes to livestock the fellow answered we used to ship all the way to the east coast before the damned lizards came now everythings just bottled up worldwar in the balance here well run short of feed before too long and have to really start slaughtering but for now were still fat happy to share with you folks its a christian thing to do even for those critters with undisguised curiosity the local watched ristin and ullhass eat the lizards had manners though not identical to those of earthlings their technique for eating a drumstick was to stab it with a fork hold it up to their snouts and then nibble off bits every so often their forked tongues would come out to clean grease off their hard immobile lj ps wagons kept coming into detroit city every fifteen or twenty minutes theyd been widely spread out to minimize damage from any air strikes that did descend on them so far none had for which yeager was heartily grateful coming under air attack once was a thousand times too many the natives greeted each one as if it held the prodigal son when shelters were assigned yeager found himself with a double cabin that had been altered in advance for use by him and his alien charges each of the two rooms had its own woodburning stove and a bountiful supply of fuel by now ullhass and ristin knew how to keep a fire going the windows on the lizards side had boards nailed across them to prevent escape though yeager was willing to bet they wouldnt have tried to run away from their heater the connecting door between the rooms opened only from his side he got ullhass and ristin settled for the evening then went back to his own half of the cabin it wasnt luxuriously furnished a table with a kerosene lantern clothes tree slop bucket better that he thought than going to an outhouse in the middle of the night itd probably freeze right offcot piled high with extra blankets so it isnt the biltmore he the itll do he sat down on the cot he wished he had something to read an astounding by choice he wondered what had happened to astounding since the lizards came the last issue hed seen was the one hed been reading the day the train down from madison got shot up but science fiction wouldnt be the same now that real live bugeyed or at least chameleoneyed monsters were loose on earth and bent on conquest he bent down to untie his shoes the only item of clothing he intended to take off tonight hed grown so used to sleeping in his uniform to stay warm that doing anything else was starting to seem unnatural hed just grabbed a shoelace when someone scratched at the door whos that yeager wondered out loud it had to be something to do with the lizards he thought but whatever it was couldnt it wait till morning the scratching came again evidently it couldnt muttering under his breath he got up and opened the door oh he said it wasnt anything to do with the lizards it was barbara larssen may i come n she asked harry turtledove oh he said again and then sure youd better in fact or all the heat will get out there was no place to sit but the cot so that was where she sat after what had happened on the caledonia and the way shed acted since yeager didnt know if he ought to sit down beside her with the instincts of a man who automatically moved back a few steps to prevent the extrabase hit in the late innings he decided to play safe he paced back and forth in front of the stove barbara watched him for a few seconds then said its all right sam i dont think youre going to molest me thats what i wanted to talk about with you anyway yeager perched cautiously near the head of the cot at the opposite end from barbara what is there to talk about he said it was just one of those crazy things that happens sometimes if you want to pretend it never did he started to finish with thats all right but it wasnt not quite he tried a different phrase you can that was better no i owe you an apology she wasnt looking at him she was looking at the worn grayishyellow boards of the floor i shouldnt have treated you the way i did afterward im sorry its just that after we did it i really realized jens is is dead he has to be dead and that all came down on me at once i am sorry she covered her face with her hands after a few seconds he realized she was crying he slid down the cot toward her put a hesitant hand on her shoulder she stiffened at his touch but then spun half around and buried her face against his chest his arms could hardly help folding around her its okay he said not knowing whether it was okay or not not even knowing whether she heard him or not its okay after a while her sobs subsided to hiccups she pushed herself away from him then reached into her purse and dabbed at herself with a hanky she ruefully shook her head i must look like hell sam considered that tears still glistened on her cheeks and brimmed in her eyes she wasnt wearing any mascara or shadow to streak and run if her face was puffy from crying it didnt show in the lantern light but even if it had so what barbara you look real good to me he said slowly ive thought so for a long time have you she said you didnt really let on not until wasnt my place to he answered and stopped there not as long as there was any hope jens was still alive you mean she said filling it in for him he nodded her face twisted but she forced it back to steadiness youre a gentleman sam do you know me i dont know anything about that all i know is he stopped again what had started to come out of his mouth was all i know is baseball and ive spun my wheels there for too damn many years that was true but it wasnt what barbara needed to hear right now he gave another worldwar in the balance try all i know is ill try to be good for you if thats what you want me to do yes thats what i want she said seriously times like these nobody can get through by himself if we dont help each other hold onto each other whats the use of anything youve got me hed been on the road by himself for a lot of years but he hadnt really been alone hed always had the team the pennant race the hope of moving up substitutes for family goal and dreams he shook his head no matter how deeply baseball had dug its claws into his soul this was not the time to be thinking about it still wary still a little unsure he put his arms around barbara again she looked at the floor and let out such a long sigh he almost let go but then she shook her head he had a pretty good idea what she was telling herself to forget she tilted her face up to his later he asked do you want me to blow out the lamp whichever way youd like she answered she was probably less shy about undressing with it burning than he was he reminded himself she was used to being with a man they got under the covers together not for modesty but for warmth later still after theyd warmed themselves enough to kick most of the blankets onto the floor they lay with their arms wrapped around each other the cot was so narrow it gave them little choice about that yeager ran a hand down barbaras back learning the shape and feel of her there hadnt been time for that aboard the caledonia there hadnt been time for anything except raw driving lust hed never known anything to match that maybe not even the night he lost his cherry but this was pretty fine te felt somehow more certain as if he could be sure it would last barbaras breasts slid against his chest as she leaned up on one elbow she lay between him and the lamp so her face was full of shadow when she spoke though her words werent quite what he thought of as romantic do you want to see if you can buy some rubbers tomorrow sam this place seems in good shape the drugstore may still have a supply uh okay he said taken aback she was indeed used to being with a man he thought he did his best to sound matteroffact as he went on probably a good idea certainly a good idea she corrected were all right about the first time i know and i dont mind taking a chance now and again but if were going to be making love a lot wed better be careful i dont want to be expecting going crosscountry in a wagon train i dont blame you he said ill try and find some uh what happens if i dont he wished he hadnt said that it would make her think he only wanted to lay her he did want to lay her but hed learned you seldom got anywhere treating a woman like a piece of meat especially not a harry turtledove woman like this whod been married to a physicist and had plenty of brains herself he was in luck she didnt get mad her hand wandered now or rather moved for she knew where it was going it closed on him if you dont she said well just have to figure out something else to do she squeezed gently he couldnt decide whether he wanted some detroit lakes drugstore to have rubbers or not behind mutt daniels the preemption house was burning his heart felt like breaking for several reasons it was always sad to see history go up in smoke and the twostory greek revival frame building had been one of naperville illinois prides since more immediately it was far from the only burning building in naperville mutt didnt see how the army could hold the town and there wasnt a hell of a lot behind naperville but chicago itself and more immediately still the preemption house had been napervilles leading saloon daniels hadnt been in town long but hed managed to liberate a fifth of good bourbon he wore three stripes on his sleeves these days just as kids had looked to him on how to be ballplayers now he had to show them how to be soldiers these days he borrowed his precepts from sergeant schneider instead of his own old managers every half a minute or so another liquor bottle inside the preemption house would cook off like a round inside a burning tank looking back mutt saw little blue alcohol flames flickering among the big lusty red ones from the burning timbers he sighed and said hell of a waste you bet sarge said the private beside him a little foureyed fellow named kevin donlan who by his looks would probably start shaving one day fairly soon donlan went on that building must be more than a hundred years old daniels sighed again i wasnt thinkin so much about the building a whistling roar in the sky growing fast made both men dive for the nearest trench the shell went off above ground level fragments hissed through the air so did other things that pattered and bounced off the hard ground like hailstones you gotta watch where you put your feet now son daniels said that bastard just spit out a bunch o little bombs or mines or whatever you want to call em first saw those out around shabbona you step on one youll walk like pegleg pete in the disney cartoons the rest of your days more shells rained down more of the little rolling mines scattered from them a couple went off with short unimpressive cracks hardly louder than the screams that followed them they keep throwin those at us we aint gonna be able to move around at all sergeant daniels donlan said worldwar in the balance thats the idea son mutt said dryly they pound on us for a while freeze us in place like this then they bring in the tanks and take the ground away from us if they had more tanks theydve finished kickin our butts a long time ago donlan hadnt seen closeup action yet hed joined the squad during the retreat from aurora he said how can those things beat on us like this they aint even human one of the things you better understand right quick kid is that a bullet or a shell it dont care who shot it or who gets in the way daniels said besides the lizards got plenty o balls of their own i know the radio keeps callin em pushbutton soldiers to make it sound like all their gadgets is whats whuppin us and keep the civilians cheerful but dont let anybody tell you they cant fight the artillery barrage went on and on mutt endured it as hed endured similar poundings in france in a way france had been worse each of the lizards shells was a lot more deadly than the ones the boches had thrown but the germans had thrown a lot of shells so it sometimes seemed whole steel mills were falling out of the sky on top of the american trenches men would go mad from that shell shock they called it this bombardment was more likely to kill you but it probably wouldnt drive you nuts through a pause in the shelling daniels heard running feet behind him he swung around with his tommy gun maybe the lizards had used their whirligig flying machines to land troops behind human lines again but it wasnt a lizard it was a grayhaired colored fellow in blue jeans and a beatup overcoat running along chicago avenue with a big wicker b under one arm a couple of shells burst perilously close to him he yeld and jumped into the trench with daniels and donlan mutt looked at him boy you are one crazy nigger runnin around in the open with that shit fallin all around you he didnt mean anything particularly bad by his words in mississippi he was used to talking to negroes that way but this wasnt mississippi and the colored man glared at him before answering im not a boy and im not a nigger but i guess maybe i am crazy if i thought i could bring some soldiers fried chicken without getting myself called names mutt opened his mouth closed it again he didnt know what to do hed hardly ever had a negro talk back to him not even up here in the north smart negroes knew their place but a smart negro wouldnt have braved shellfire to bring him food braved was the word too daniels didnt want to be anywhere but here under cover i think maybe ill shut the fuck up he remarked to nobody in particular he started to address the black man directly but found himself brought up short what did he call him boy wouldnt do it and uncle harry turtledove wasnt likely to improve matters either he couldnt bring himself to say mister he tried something else friend i do thank you im no friend of yours the negro said he might have added a couple of choice phrases himself but he had an overcoat and his basket of chicken to set against daniels stripes and tommy gun and mutt had after a fashion apologized the colored man sighed and shook his head what the hells the use here come on feed yourselves the chicken was greasy the baked potatoes that went with it cold and savorless without salt or butter daniels wolfed everything down anyhow you gotta eat when you get the chance he told kevin donlan on account of you aint gonna get the chance as often as you want to you bet sarge the kid wiped his mouth on his sleeve he took his own tack in talking to the negro that was great colonel a real lifesaver colonel the colored fellow spat in the dirt of the trench you know damn well im not a colonel why dont you just call me by my name im charlie sanders and you could have found it out by askin charlie that was good chicken mutt said solemnly im obliged huh sanders said then he scrambled up out of the trench and dashed away toward the next couple of foxholes maybe thirty yards off watch out for them little mine things the lizard shells throw around daniels yelled after him he turned back to donlan hope he makes it he keeps going all around like that though his numbers gonna come up pretty damn quick yeah donlan peered over in the direction charlie sanders had run that takes guts he doesnt even have a gun i didnt think niggers had guts like that youre under shellfire son it dont matter if youve got a gun mutt answered but that wasnt the point and he knew it after a while he went on one of my grandfathers i misremember which one right now he fought against colored troops one time in the states war he said they werent no different than any other damnyankees maybe he was right me i dont know anything any more but youre a sergeant donlan said in exactly the same tone some of daniels ballplayers had used in exclaiming but youre the manager mutt sighed just on account of im supposed to have all the answers son that dont mean i can pull em out from under my tin hat whenever you need em hell come to that it dont even mean theyre really there you get as old as i am you aint sure o nothin no more yes sergeant donlan said by the way things were going mutt thought the kid didnt have much chance of getting that old no general patton said hell no but sir jens larssen spread his hands and assumed an injured worldwar in the balance expression all i want to do is get in touch with my wife let her know im alive no patton repeated no repeat no traffic about the metallurgical laboratory or any of its personnel save in direst emergency from which personal matters of any sort are specifically excluded those are my direct orders from general marshall dr larssen and i have no intention of disobeying them that is the most basic security precaution for any important project let alone one of this magnitude marshall has told me next to nothing about the project and i do not wish to acquire more information i have not the need to know and therefore should not must not know but barbaras not even with the met lab jens protested indeed not but you are patton said are you so soft that you would betray the hope of the united states to the lizards for the sake of your own convenience by god sir i hope you are not i dont see how one message constitutes a betrayal larssen said odds are the lizards wouldnt even notice it possible patton admitted he got up from behind his desk and stretched which also gave him the advantage of staring down at jens possible but not likely if the lizards doctrine is at all like ours and ive seen no reason to doubt that they monitor as many of our signals as they can and try to shape them into informative patterns i speak from experience sir when i say that no one no one can know in advance which piece of the jigsaw puzzle will reveal enough for the enemy to form the entire picture in his mind jens knew about security the met lab had had large doses of it but hed never been subject to military discipline so he kept arguing you could send a message without my name on it just your husband is alive anell or something like that no your request is refused patton said then as if reading larssens mind he added any attempt to ignore what i have just said and inveigle a signals officer into clandestinely sending such a message will result in your arrest and confinement if not worse i remind you i have military secrets of my own here and i shall not permit you to compromise them do i make myself quite clear yes sir you do larssen said dejectedly hed been all set to try to find a sympathetic radioman no matter what patton said he still didnt believe such an innocuous message would have blown the met labs cover but he couldnt gauge how much outgoing messages might endanger the offensive still building here in western indiana that had to succeed too or nothing that happened in chicago would matter because chicago would belong to the lizards if it helps at all dr larssen you have my sympathy patton said in a gruff sort of way he probably even meant it jens thought he said thank you general and walked out of pattons office harry turtledove outside the ground was mottled with melting snow and clumps of yellowish dead grass thick low yellowgray clouds rolled by overhead the wind came from out of the northwest and carried a nip that quickly started to turn jens beaky nose to an icicle it had all the makings of a winter storm but no snow fell his thoughts as gloomy as the weather larssen walked on in oxford indiana potemkin village ran through his mind from the air the little town undoubtedly seemed as quiet as any other gasolinestarved hamlet in the midwest but concealed by houses and garages haystacks and woodpiles gathered armored forces plenty jens thought to give the nazis pause the only trouble was they faced worse foes than mere germans larssen stepped into the bluebird cafe a couple of locals and a couple of soldiers in civvies nobody not in civvies was allowed on the streets of oxford security again jens thought sat at the counter behind it the cook made pancakes on a woodburning griddle instead of his now useless gas range the griddle wasnt vented smoke filled the room he looked over his shoulder at larssen waddaya want mac i know what i want how about a broiled lobster tail with drawn butter asparagus in hollandaise sauce and crisp green salad now what do you have good luck with the lobster buddy the cook said what i got is flapjacks here powdered eggs and canned pork and beans you dont fancy that go fishing ill take it jens said it was what hed been eating ever since that wonderful chicken dinner with general patton he wasnt as skinny as he had been when the army scooped him up but hed long since sworn hed never look a baked bean in the eye again if and when the war ever ended the only virtue he could find to the meal was that he didnt have to pay for it patton had taken over the handful of eateries in town and incorporated them into his commissary department larssen supposed that was fair without the supplies they drew from the army theyd long since have closed down the better to conceal his soldiers patton had also billeted them on the townsfolk as far as jens knew he hadnt asked anybody for permission before he did it either if patton worried about that he didnt let on maybe he had a point the founding fathers hadnt anticipated an invasion from outer space but if you started fiddling with the constitution and pleading military necessity where would you stop jens wished hed been in a better position to take that up with patton it might have made an interesting philosophical discussion if the general hadnt been steamed at him for trying to get a message to barbara as things were patton would either roar at him or ignore him neither of which constituted an enlightened exchange of views worldwar in the balance anybody got a cigarette asked one of the soldiers in civvies the only answer larssen expected to that was a horse laugh and the soldier got one then a civilian a leathery fellow in a hunting cap who had to be pushing seventy looked the kid over and drawled son even if i did have one you aint pretty enough to give me what id want for it the young soldier turned the color of the fire under the griddle the cook solemnly sketched a hash mark in the air larssen whistled the oldtimer let out a dry chuckle to show he wasnt all that impressed with his own wit then returned to his cup of what the army called for lack of a suitable term of opprobrium coffee high overhead above the clouds a lizard jet flew by its wail thin and fading with distance larssens shiver had nothing to do with the weather he wondered how well the aliens sensors whatever they were could peer through the gray mass that shielded oxford and the countryside around it from the sky and how well patton had managed to hide the carefully husbanded gear here hed know soon enough in one corner of the cafe stood a broken pinball machine the mournful word tilt permanently on display since that constituted the places entire potential for entertainment jens handed his plate and cutlery back to the cook and went out onto the street the wind had picked up while he ate he was glad for his overcoat his nose was also relieved at the fresh air full of soldiers as it was and without much working plumbing oxford had become an odorous place if the buildup here went on a little longer the lizards wouldnt need visual reconnaissance to find their human foes their noses would do the job for them something stung jens on the cheek by reflex he brought up his hand btt only a tiny patch of moisture then he got stung again this time on me wrist he looked down saw a fat white snowflake melting away to nothingness more slipped and slid wildly through the air jitterbug dancers made of ice for a moment he just watched the start of a snowfall always took him back to his minnesota childhood to snowmen and snow angels and snowballs knocking stocking caps off heads then the present rose up and smote nostalgia this snow had nothing to do with childhoods pleasures this snow meant attack yi min felt bigger than life felt in fact as if he were the personification of ho tei fat little god of luck who would have imagined so much profit was to be made from the coming of the little scaly devils at first when theyd raped him away from his home village and then taken him up into the plane that didnt land the plane where he weighed nothing and his poor stomach even less hed thought them the worst catastrophe the world had ever known now though he smiled oleaginously now life was good true he still lived in this camp but he lived here like a warlord almost like one of the vanished manchu emperors his dwelling was a hut in name only its wooden sides were proof against the worst winter winds brass braziers gave heat soft carpets cushioned his every stride fine pieces of jade and cloisonne delighted his eye wherever it happened to light he ate duck and dog and other delicacies when he wanted them he enjoyed women who made liu han seem a diseased sow by comparison one waited on his mattress now hed forgotten her name what did it matter and all from a powder the scaly devils craved he laughed out loud what is it man full of yang the pretty girl called from the other room she sounded impatient for him to join her nothing just a joke i heard this morning he answered however full of masculine essence he was he still had too much hard sense to make a hired mattress partner privy to his thoughts what one set of ears heard in the afternoon a score would know by sunrise and the whole world by the next night without false modesty he knew he was far and away the bggest ginger dealer in the camp probably in china maybe in the whole world under him the girl crossed his mind again but only for a moment were not only men who grew the spice and others who cured it with lime to make it particularly tasty to the scaly devils but several dozen scaly devils who bought from him and sold worldwar in the balance to their fellows either directly or through their own webs of secondary dealers how the loot rolled in will you come soon tiger of the floating world the girl said she did her best to make herself alluring but she was too much a businesswoman and too little an actress to keep a strident note from her voice whats keeping you she meant yes ill be there in a moment he answered but his tone suggested she wasnt worth hurrying over having a woman resent him for what he made her do fed his own excitement he wasnt just taking pleasure that way but also control what should we do when i finally go to her he wondered always an enjoyable contemplation something she wouldnt care for shed annoyed him maybe hed use her as if she were a boy he snapped his fingers in delight the very thing women were so proud of the slit between their legs ignoring it in favor of the other way never failed to irritate them besides it would hurt her a little too make her remember to treat him as the person of consequence he was warmth flowed through him tingled across his skin he felt himself rising he took one step toward the bedroom then checked himself anticipation was also a pleasure besides let her stew after a minute or two she called please hurry longing eats at me she played the game too but her mahjongg hand did not have the tiles to beat his when at last he judged the moment ripe he started off to the back part of the dwelling before hed gone three paces though a scratching noise came from the front door he let out a long angry hiss that was a scaly devil the girls comeuppance would have to wait no matter how tlughly he controlled the devils who bought ginger from him the illusim remained that he was servant and they masters he opened the door cold nipped at his fingers and face a little scaly devil indeed but not one hed seen beforehed grown skilled at telling them apart even when as now the swaddlings they wore against winter hid their body paint hed also grown fluent in their speech he bowed low said superior sir you honor my humble hut enter please and warm yourself i come the little scaly devil skittered past yi min he closed the door after it he was pleased it had answered him in its own language if he could do business in that tongue he wouldnt have to send away the courtesan not only would she have longer to wait shed be impressed at how he dealt with the little devils on their terms the devil looked around his front room its eye turrets swiveling independent of each other that no longer unnerved yi min he was used to it he studied the scaly devil the strong color inside its nostrils the way its clawed hands had a slight quiver to them inside he smiled he might not harry turtledove know the devil but he knew the signs this one needed ginger and needed it worse every second he bowed again superior sir will you tell me your name that i may serve you better the little scaly devil hissed as if suddenly reminded of yi mins presence yes i am called drefsab you are the big ugly yi min yes superior sir i am yi min the races insulting nickname for human beings didnt bother yi min after all he thought of its males as little scaly devils he said how may i be of assistance to you superior sir drefsab the scaly devil swung both eyes in his direction you are the big ugly who sells to the race the powder known as ginger yes superior sir i am that humble person i have the honor and privilege to provide the race with the pleasure the herb affords yi min thought about asking the little scaly devil straight out whether it wanted ginger he decided not to though the devils were more direct about such matters than chinese they sometimes found direct questions rude he did not want to offend a new customer you have much of this herb drefsab asked yes superior sir yi min was getting tired of saying that as much as any valiant male could desire if i may say so i think i have given more males bliss with powdered ginger than all but a handful of tosevites he used the little devils less offensive name for his own kind now he did ask if the superior sir drefsab desires a sample of the wares here i would be honored to provide him with one without expecting anything in return this time he added to himself he thought drefsab would leap at that hed hardly ever seen a scaly devil in more obvious need of his drug but drefsab still seemed to feel like talking he said you are the big ugly whose machinations have turned males of the race against their own kind whose powders have spread corruption through the shining ships from home yi min stared no matter how well hed come to use the devils language he needed a moment to understand drefsabs words which were the opposite of what hed expected to hear but the pharmacists reply came fast and smooth superior sir i do but try to give the valiant males of the race what they seek he wondered what game drefsab was playing if the little scaly devil thought to muscle in on his operation hed get a surprise ginger powder had bought yi min the adjutants to several highranking officers and a couple of the officers themselves they would clamp down on any scaly devil who got too bold with their supplier drefsab said this ginger is a tumor eating at the vitality of the race this i know for it has devoured me sometimes a tumor must be cut out yi min again had to struggle to make sense of that he and the scaly devils with whom hed conversed hadnt had any occasion to talk about worldwar in the balance tumors he was still trying to figure out what the word meant when drefsab reached inside his protective clothing and pulled out a gun it spat fire again and again and again inside yi mins hut the shots rang incredibly loud as the bullets clubbed him to the carpet he heard through the reports the girl in the bedroom starting to scream at first yi min felt only the impacts not the pain then it struck him the world turned black shot through with scarlet flames he tried to scream himself but managed only a bubbling moan through the blood that flooded into his mouth dimly ever more dimly he watched drefsab take the head off the plump buddha that sat on a low lacquer table the stinking little devil knew just where he stowed his ginger drefsab took a taste hissed in delight and poured the rest of the powder into a clear bag hed also brought along inside his coat then he opened the door and left the courtesan kept screaming yi min wanted to tell her to shut up and close the door it was getting cold the words would not come he tried to crawl toward the door himself the cold reached his heart the scarlet flames faded leaving only black harbin was falling any day now the race would be in the city it would be an important victory harbin anchored the nipponese line teerts would have been gladder of it had the town not been falling around his head that was literally true during the most recent raid on harbin bombs hit so close to his prison that chunks of plaster rained down from the ceiling and just missed knocking out what few brains he had left after so long in tosevite captivity iutside an antiaircraft gun began to hammer teerts didnt hear any plals maybe the big ugly was just nervous go ahead waste ammunition teerts thought then youll have less to fire off when my friends break in here and then dead emperors willing they wont have to suffer what ive gone through he heard a commotion up the hall orders barked in loud nipponese too fast for him to follow one of the guards came up to his cell teerts bowed with this kind of big ugly you couldnt go far wrong if you bowed and you could go disastrously wrong if you didnt better to bow then the guard didnt bow back teerts was a prisoner and so deserving only of contempt behind the armed man came major okamoto teerts bowed more deeply to his interrogator and interpreter okamoto didnt acknowledge him either not with a bow he spoke in teerts language as he unlocked the cell door you will come with me we leave this city now teerts bowed again it shall be done superior sir he had no idea how it would be done or if it could be done but wondering about such things was not his responsibility as a prisoner as had been true in the harry turtledove days before he was captured his duty was but to obey unlike his superiors of the race though the nipponese owed him no loyalty in return major okamoto threw at him a pair of black trousers and a baggy blue coat that could have held two males his size then okamoto put a conical straw hat on his head and tied it under his jaws with a scratchy piece of cord good the nipponese said in satisfaction now if your people see you from the sky they think you just another tosevite they would too teerts realized dismally a gun camera maybe even a satellite photo might have picked him out from among the swarming masses of big uglies around him bundled up like this though he would be just one more grain of rice among a million he thought about throwing off the clothes if one of the races aircraft came overhead reluctantly he decided hed better not major okamoto would make his life not worth living if he tried it and the nipponese could spirit him away before his own folk who were none too hasty arranged a rescue effort besides harbin was cold the hat helped keep his head warm and if he threw aside the coat he was liable to turn into a lump of ice before either the nipponese or the race could do anything about it okamotos hat and coat were made from the fur of tosevite creatures he understood why the beasts needed insulation from their truly beastly climate and wondered why the big uglies themselves had so little hair that they needed to steal it from animals outside the building in which teerts had been confined he saw more rubble than he ever had before some of the craters looked like meteor strikes on an airless moon teerts didnt get much of a chance to examine them major okamoto hustled him onto a twowheeled conveyance with a big ugly between the shafts instead of a beast of burden okamoto spoke to the puller in a language that wasnt nipponese the fellow seized the shafts grunted and started forward the guard strode stolidly along beside the conveyance tosevites streamed out of harbin toward the east fleeing the expected fall of the city disciplined columns of nipponese soldiers contrasted with the squealing squalling civilians all around them some of those females hardly larger than teerts bore on their backs bundles of belongings almost as big as they were others carried burdens hung from poles balanced on one shoulder it struck teerts as a scene from out of the races prehistoric past vanished a thousand centuries before long the guard got in front of the manhandled conveyance and started shouting to clear a path for it when that failed he laid about him with the butt end of his rifle squeals and squalls turned to screams teerts couldnt see that the brutality made much difference in how fast they went worldwar in the balance eventually they reached the train station which was noisier but less chaotic than the surrounding city the race had repeatedly bombed the station it was more debris than building but somehow still functioned machinegun nests and tangles of wire with teeth kept everyone but soldiers away from the trains when a sentry challenged him major okamoto flipped up teerts hat and said something in nipponese the sentry bowed low answered apologetically okamoto turned to teerts from here on we walk no one but nipponese and you permitted in the station teerts walked okamoto on one side of him and the guard on the other for a little while a surviving stretch of roof and wall protected them from the biting wind then they were picking their way through stone and bricks again with snow sliding down from a gray dreary sky out past the station in the railroad yard troops were filing onto a train again a sentry challenged okamoto on his approach again he used teerts as his talisman to pass he secured half a car for himself the guard and his prisoner you are more important than soldiers he smugly told teerts with a long mournful blast from its whistle the train jerked into motion teerts had shot up tosevite trains when he was still free the long plumes of black smoke they spat made them easy to pick out and they could not flee save on the rails they used for travel theyd been easy enjoyable targets he hoped none of his fellow males would think the one he was riding a tempting target major okamoto said the farther from harbin we go the more likely we are to be safe i do not mind losing my life for the emperor but i am ordered to see that you safely reach the home islands eerts was willing to lay down his life for his emperor the emperor btnot for the parvenu big ugly who claimed the same title given a choice he would have preferred not to lay down his life for anyone hed been given few choices lately the train rattled eastward the ride was toothjarringly rough the race hit the rails themselves as well as the trains that rolled on them but the big uglies as theyd proved all over the planet were resourceful be ings in spite of the bombs the railroad kept working or so teerts thought until some considerable time after the train had pulled out of harbin it shuddered to a stop he hissed in dismay he knew from experience what a lovely tasty target a stopped train was whats wrong he asked major okamoto probably you males of the race have broken the track again okamoto sounded more resigned than angry that was part of war you are sitting by the window tell me what you see teerts peered through the dirty glass i see a whole swarm of tosevites working at the curve ahead how many big uglies labored harry turtledove there hundreds certainly more likely thousands no one carried anything more impressive than a pick a shovel or a crowbar if one of the races aircraft spied them a strafing run would leave great red steaming pools in the snow but if no aircraft came over the big uglies could perform astonishing feats before he came to tosev teerts had taken machinery for granted hed never imagined that masses of beings armed with hand tools could not only duplicate their results but also work nearly as fast as they did he said forgive the ignorant question superior sir but how do you keep them from perishing of cold or from being injured at this hard dangerous work they are only chinese peasants major okamoto said with chilling indifference as we use them up we seize as many more as we need to do what must be done for some reason teerts had expected the big uglies to treat their own kind better than they did him but to the nipponese the tosevites here were not of their own kind however much alike they seemed to a male of the race the reasons for distinction at a level lower than the species as a whole were lost on teerts whatever they were though they let the nipponese treat their laborers like pieces of the machines in whose place they were used and with as little concern about their fate that was something else teerts hadnt imagined before he came to tosev this world was an education in all sorts of matters where he would have preferred continued ignorance the vast swarms of workers teerts thought not so much of people as of the little social hivecreatures that occasionally made nuisances of themselves back on home drew back from the railroad track after a surprisingly short time the train rolled slowly forward three or four laborers lay in the snow too worn to move on to the next stretch of broken track nipponese guards males dressed far more warmly than those in their charge came up and kicked at the exhausted peasants one managed to stagger to his feet and rejoin his comrades the guards picked up crowbars and methodically broke in the heads of the others teerts wished he hadnt seen that he already knew the nipponese had no compunctions about doing dreadful things to him if he failed to cooperate or even failed to be useful to them yet now he discovered that having knowledge confirmed before his eyes was ten times worse than merely knowing the train picked up speed after it passed the repaired curve is this not a fine way to travel okamoto said how swiftly we move teerts had crossed the gulf between the stars at half the speed of light admittedly in cold sleep he ranged the air above this main landmass of tosev at speeds far greater than sound how then was he sup worldwar in the balance posed to be impressed with this wheezy train the only conveyance next to which it seemed fast was the one in which the poor straining tosevite had hauled him to the station but that latter sort of conveyance was what the race had expected to find all over tosev maybe the train decrepit as it appeared to teerts was new enough to be marvelous to the big uglies he knew better than to contradict major okamoto anyhow yes very fast he said with as much enthusiasm as he could feign through the dirty window teerts watched more tosevites chinese peasants he supposed struggling to build new defensive lines for the nipponese they were having a tough time the miserable local weather had frozen the ground hard as stone he had no idea how sick hed become of the train of its endless shaking of the seat that did not conform to his backside because it made no provision for a tailstump of the endless jabber from the nipponese troops in the back of the car of the odor that rose from them and grew thicker as the journey went on he even came to miss his cell something he had not imagined possible the journey seemed to stretch endlessly senselessly how long could it take to traverse one small part of a planetary surface given fuel and maintenance for his killercraft teerts could have circumnavigated the whole miserable world several times in the interval he needed to crawl across this tiny portion of it he finally grew fed up and incautious enough to say that to major okamoto the big ugly looked at him for a moment then asked and how fast could you go if someone kept dropping bombs in front of your aircraft lter heading east for a day and a half the train swung south that pued teerts who said to his keeper i thought nippon lay in this direction across the sea it does okamoto answered but the port vladivostok which is nearest to us belongs to the soviet union not to nippon teerts was neither a diplomat nor a particularly imaginative male hed never thought about the complications that might arise from having a planet divided up among many empires now being forced to stay on the train because of one of those complications he heaped mental scorn on the big uglies though he realized the race benefited from their disunity even when the train came down close by the sea it did not stop but umbled through a land major okamoto called chosen wakarimasen teerts said working on his villainous nipponese i do not understand here is the ocean why do we not stop and get on a ship not so simple okamoto answered we need a port a place where ships can safely come into land not be battered by storms he leaned across teerts pointed out the window at the waves crashing against the harry turtledove shore homes lakes were surrounded by land not the other way round they seldom grew boisterous shipwreck was another concept that hadnt crossed teerts mind till he watched this bruising ruffian of an ocean throwing its water about with muscular abandon it was fascinating to see certainly more interesting than the mountains that flanked the other side of the track at least until teerts had a really horrid thought we need to go across that ocean to get to nippon dont we yes of course his captor answered blithely this disturbs you too bad here in chosen farther from the fighting damage to the railway net was less the train made better time it finally reached a port a place called fusan land ended there running out into the sea teerts saw what okamoto had meant by a port ships lined up next to wooden sidewalks that ran out into the water on poles big uglies and goods moved on and off teerts realized that primitive and smoky as this port was a lot of business got done here he was used to air and space transportation and the weight limits they imposed one of these big ugly big ugly ships could carry enormous numbers of soldiers and machines and sacks of bland boring rice and the tosevites had many many ships back on the planets of the empire transportation by water was an unimportant sidelight goods flowed along highways and railroads all the interdiction missions teerts had flown on tosev were against highways and railroads not once had he attacked shipping but from what he saw in fusan the officers who gave him his targets had been missing a bet off okamoto said teerts obediently descended from the train followed by the nipponese officer and the stolid guard after so long on the jouncing railway car the ground seemed to sway beneath his feet at his captors orders he walked up a gangplank and onto one of the ships the claws on his toes clicked against bare cold metal the floor the big uglies had a special word for it but he couldnt remember what the word was shifted under his feet he jumped into the air in alarm earthquake he shouted in his own language that was not a word major okamoto knew when teerts explained it the nipponese let out a long string of the yips the big uglies used for laughter okamoto spoke to the guard in his own tongue the guard who had hardly said three words all the way down from harbin through chosen laughed loudly too teerts glared at one of them with each eye he didnt see the joke later when out of sight of land the ship really started rolling and pitching he understood why the big uglies had found his startlement at that first slight motion funny he was however too busy wishing he was dead to be amused himself worldwar in the balance a rowboat took colonel leslie groves across the charles river toward the united states navy yard the charlestown bridge which had spanned the river and connected the yard with the rest of boston on the southern bank was nothing but a ruin engineers had repaired it a couple of times but the lizards kept knocking it down the ferryman pulled up under what had been the northern piers of the bridge heah yaah friend he said in broad new england accents pointing to a set of rickety wooden stairs that led up to main street groves scrambled out of the rowboat the steps squeaked under his weight though he like most people was a good deal lighter than he would have been had the lizards stayed away the fellow in the boat was backing oars heading south across the river for his next ferry run as groves turned right onto chelsea street he reflected on how natural his ear found the boston accent though hed not heard much of it since his days at mit more than twenty years before the country had been at war then too but with a foe safely across the ocean not lodged all through the united states itself naval ratings with rifles patrolled the long high wall that separated the navy yard from the town behind it groves wondered how useful the fence was if you stood on breeds hill where history books notwithstanding the americans and british had fought the battle of bunker hill you could look right down into the yard the colonel was however long used to security for securitys sake as he approached he tapped the shiny eagle on the shoulders of his overcoat the navy guards saluted and stood aside to let him enter the yard was not crowded with warships as it had been before the libels came the ships those that survived were dispersed up and do the coast so as not to make any one target too attractive to bombardment from the air still berthed in the navy yard was the uss constitution as always seeing old ironsides gave groves a thrill in his mit days hed toured the ship several times and almost banged his head on the timbers belowdecks any sailor much above five feet tall would have knocked himself silly running to his battle station glancing at the tall masts that probed the sky groves reflected that the lizards had made the whole navy as obsolete as the tough old frigate it was not a cheery thought his own target lay a couple of piers beyond the constitution the boat tied up there was no longer than the graceful sailing ship and much uglier slabs of ruststained iron could not compete against old ironsides elegant flanks the only curves sweeter than a sailing ships groves thought are a womans the sentry who paced the pier wore navy uniform but not quite the one with which groves was familiar nor was the flag that flapped from harry turtledove the submarines conning tower the stars and stripes but rather the union jack groves wondered if any royal navy vessels had used the boston navy yard since the revolution took massachusetts off george iiis hands ahoy the seanyrnph he called as he strode up to the sentry he was close enough now to see that the man carried a leeenfield rifle not the springfields of his american counterparts ahoy yourself the sentry answered his vowels said london not back bay make yourself known sir if youd be so kind i am colonel leslie groves united states army here are my identification documents he waited while the englishman inspected them carefully comparing his photograph to his face when the sentry nodded to show he was satisfied groves went on i am ordered to meet your commander stansfield here to pick up the package hes brought to the united states wait here sir the sentry crossed the gangplank to the seanymphs deck climbed the ladder to the conning tower and disappeared below he came out again a couple of minutes later you have permission to come aboard sir watch your step now the advice was not wasted groves did not pretend to be a sailor as he carefully descended into the submarine he was glad hed lost some weight as things were the passage seemed alarmingly tight the long steel tube in which he found himself did nothing to ease that feeling it was like peering down a dimly lit thermos bottle even with the hatch open the air was closed and dank it smelled of metal and sweat and hot machine oil and faintly in the background full heads an officer with three gold stripes on the sleeves of his jacket came forward colonel groves im roger stansfield commanding the seanymph may i see your bona fides please he examined groves papers with the same care the sentry had given them returning them he said i hope you will forgive me but it has been made quite clear that security is of the essence in this matter dont worry about it commander groves said easily the same point has been impressed upon me i assure you i dont even precisely know what it is ive ferried over to you yanks stansfield said all i know is that ive been ordered to treat the stuff with the utmost respect and have obeyed to the best of my ability good groves still wondered how hed gotten roped into this atomic explosives project himself maybe the talk hed had with the physicist larssen was that the name had linked him and uranium in general marshalls mind or maybe hed complained once too often about fighting the war from behind a desk he wasnt behind a desk any more and wouldnt be for god only knew how long stansfield said having turned this material over to you colonel groves is there any way in which i can be of further assistance worldwar in the balance youd have made my life a hell of a lot easier commander if you could have sailed your seanymph to denver instead of boston groves answered dryly this is the port to which i was ordered to bring my boat the englishman said in a puzzled voice had you wanted the material delivered elsewhere your chaps upstairs should have told the admiralty as much im sure we would have done our best to oblige groves shook his head im pulling your leg im afraid no reason for a royal navy man to be familiar with an american town that to put it mildly was not a port colorado is a landlocked state oh quite to groves relief stansfield didnt get mad his grin showed pointed teeth that went well with his sharp foxy features and hair that was somewhere between sandy and red the do say the new class of submarines was to have been capable of nearly everything but that might have challenged it even had the advent of the lizards not scuttled its development too bad groves said sincerely now i have to transport the stuff myself perhaps we can make matters a bit easier stansfield said one of the seanymphs ratings fetched up a canvas knapsack which he presented to groves with a flourish stansfield went on this arrangement should make rather easier transporting the saddlebag contained inside which is if youll forgive the vulgarity bloody heavy id not be surprised to learn it was lined with lead though ive been studiously encouraged not to enquire probably just as well groves knew the saddlebag was lined with lead he didnt know how well the lead would shield him from the radioaomaterial inside that was one of the things hed have to find out the ay if this mission took years off his life but helped defeat the lizards the government had concluded that was a worthwhile price to pay having served that government his entire adult life groves accepted the estimation with as much equanimity as he could muster he shrugged on the knapsack his shoulders and back did indeed feel the weight if he had to haul it around for a while he might even end up somewhere close to svelte he hadnt been anything but portly or worried about it since his west point days i assume you have plans on how to reach ah denver with your burden there stansfield said i do apologize for my limited ability to help you in that regard but we are only a submarine not a subterrene he grinned again he seemed taken with the idea of sailing to colorado cant talk about that im afraid groves said by rights i shouldnt even have told you where im going commander stansfield nodded in understanding sympathy he would have been even more sympathetic groves thought had he known just harry turtledove how sketchy the americans plans were hed been ordered not to fly toward denver a plane was too likely to get knocked down not many trains were running and even fewer cars that left shanks mare horseback and luck and as an engineer groves didnt take much stock in luck complicating matters further was the stranglehold the lizards had on the midwest here on the coast they were just raiders but the farther inland you went the more they seemed to have settled down to stay groves wondered why the aliens didnt pay more attention to the ocean and to the land that lay alongside it they hit land and air transportation all over the world but ships still had a decent chance of getting through maybe that said something about the planet they came from groves shook his head he had more immediate things to worry about not least of them was the battle breaking out right around halfway between here and denver if that went wrong not only would chicago surely fall but the united states would be hardpressed to put up more than guerrilla resistance to the lizards anywhere outside the east coast for that matter getting to denver might not matter if the battle went wrong though groves knew hed keep going until he was either dead or ordered to turn aside he must have looked grim for commander stansfield said colonel ive heard it said that your navy bans alcohol aboard its vessels fortunately the royal navy observes no such tiresome custom would you care for a tot of rum to fortify you for the journey ahead commander id be delighted by god groves said thank you my pleasure i thought it might do you some good wait here if you please ill be back directly stansfield hurried down the steel tube of the hull toward the rear of the submarine aft groves supposed it was called in proper naval jargon he watched the british officer lean into a little chamber off to the side of the main tube his cabin groves realized stansfield didnt need to lean very far the cabin had to be tiny bunks were stacked three deep with bare inches between them all things considered the seanymph was a claustrophobes nightmare brought to clattering life the squat brown glass jug in commander stansfields hand gurgled encouragingly jamaican than which there is none finer he said pulling the cork groves could almost taste the thick heavy aroma that rose from it stansfield poured two healthy tots handed one glass to groves thanks groves took it with appropriate reverence he raised it high and almost barked his knuckles on a pipe that ran along the low ceiling his majesty the king he said gravely his majesty the king stansfield echoed didnt think you yanks knew to make that one i read it somewhere groves knocked back the rum at a gulp it was worldwar in the balance so smooth his throat hardly knew he swallowed it but it exploded in his stomach like a mortar round throwing warmth in all directions he looked at the empty glass with genuine respect that commander is the straight goods so it is stansfield sipped more sedately he proffered the bottle once more another groves shook his head one of those is medicinal two and id want to go to sleep i appreciate the offer though you have a clear notion of whats best for you i admire that stansfield turned so he faced west the motion was quite deliberate groves imagined as he was supposed to imagine the royal navy man peering out through the subs hull and across two thousand miles of dangerous country to the promised land of denver high in the rockies after a moment stansfield added i must say i dont envy you colonel groves shrugged with the heavy canvas knapsack on his shoulders he felt like atlas trying to support the whole world the job has to be done and im going to do it rivka russie scratched a match against the sole of her shoe it flared into life she used it to light first one shabbas candle then the other bowing her head over them she murmured the sabbath blessing the puff of sulfurous smoke from the matchhead filled the little underground room and made moishe russie cough the fat white candles were a sign he and his family had survived another week without the lizards finding them they also helped light the bunker where the russies sheltered rivka lifted the ceremonial cloth cover from a braided loaf of challah i i some of that bread mama reuven exclaimed et me slice it first if you please rivka told her son look we even have some honey to spread on it all the comforts of home the irony of the phrase echoed in moishes mind instead of their flat they sheltered in this secret chamber buried under another warsaw apartment block in further irony the bunker had been built to shelter jews not from the lizards but from the nazis yet here he used it to save himself from the creatures who had saved him from the germans and yet the words were not entirely ironic the vast majority of warsaws jews lived far better under the lizards than they had when hitlers henchmen ruled the city the wheatflour challah rich with eggs and dusted with poppy seeds would have been unimaginable in the starving warsaw ghetto russie remembered too well the chunk of fatty sour pork for which hed given a silver candlestick the night the lizards came to earth when will i get to go out and play again reuven asked he looked harry turtledove from rivka to moishe and back again hoping one of them would give him the answer he wanted they looked at each other too moishe felt himself sag i dont know exactly he told his son he could not bring himself to lie to the boy i hope it will be soon but more likely the day wont come for quite some time too bad reuven said dont you think we could rivka broke off tried again i mean who would betray a little boy to the lizards moishe usually let his wife run their household not least because she was better at it than he was but now he said no so sharply that rivka stared at him in surprise he went on we dare not let him go up above ground remember how many jews were willing to betray their brethren to the nazis for a crust of bread regardless of what the nazis were doing to us people have cause to like the lizards at least compared to the germans he wouldnt be safe where anybody could see him all right rivka said if you think hed be in danger up there here hell stay reuven let out a disappointed howl but she ignored him anyone who has anything to do with me is in danger moishe answered bitterly why do you think we never get to talk to the fighters who bring our supplies the door to the bunker was concealed by a sliding plasterboard panel with the panel closed the entranceway looked like a blank wall from the other side russie wondered if the anonymous men who kept his family in food and candles even knew whom they were helping he could easily imagine mordechai anielewicz ordering them to take their boxes down and leave them in the basement without telling them whom the things were for why not what the men didnt know they couldnt tell the lizards he made a sour face he was learning to think like a soldier all hed wanted to do was heal people and then after the lizards came like a sign from heaven set people free and the result here he was in hiding and thinking like a killer not a healer not too long after supper reuven yawned and went to bed without his usual fuss in the dark closed bunker night and day no longer had much meaning for the little boy had the fighters not furnished the place with a clock moishe would have had no idea of the hour either one day hed forget to wind it and slip into timelessness himself the shabbas candles were still burning by their light moishe helped rivka wash the supper dishes though without electricity the bunker had running water she smiled at him the time you lived by yourself taught you some things youre much better at that than you used to be what you have to do you learn to do he answered philosophically hand me that towel would you hed just slid the last dish into its stack when he heard noise in the worldwar in the balance cellar next to the hidden bunker men moving about in heavy shoes he and rivka froze her face was frightened he was sure his was too had their secret been betrayed the lizards wouldnt shout juden heraus but he didnt want to be caught by them any more than by the nazis he wished he had a weapon he wasnt altogether a soldier yet or hed have had the sense to ask for one before he sealed himself away here too late to worry about it now the footsteps came closer russie strained his ears trying to pick out the skitters and clicks that would have meant lizards were walking with the humans he thought he did fear rose up in him like a smothering cloud the people and aliens stopped just on the other side of the plasterboard barrier moishes eyes flicked to the candlesticks that held the sabbath lights these were of pottery not silver like the one hed given up for food but they were heavy and of a length to serve as bludgeons i wont go down without a fight he promised himself someone rapped on the barrier russie grabbed for a candlestick then caught himself two knocks a pause then another knock was the signal anielewiczs men used when they brought him supplies but theyd just done that a couple of days before and the bunker still held plenty they seemed to have a schedule of sorts and even though the signal was right the timing wasnt rivka knew that too what do we do she mouthed silently i dont know moishe mouthed back what he did know though he didnt want to dishearten his wife by saying so was that if the lizards were out there they were going to take him but the footsteps receded had he really heard skitterings after all dka to a whisper are they gone raised her voice ont know russie said again after a moment he added lets find out if the lizards knew he was here they didnt need to wait for him to come out he picked up a candlestick lit candle still inside the cellar was as dark as the bunker would have been without light unbarred the door took half a step forward so he could slide aside the plasterboard panel no box of food sat in front of it but an envelope lay on the cement floor he scooped it up replaced the concealing panel and went back into his hideyhole what is it rivka asked when he was back inside a note or letter of some sort he answered holding up the envelope he tore it open pulled out the folded sheet of paper inside and held it close to the candlestick so he could see what it said the one great curse of this underground life was never having either sunlight or electric light by which to read the candle sufficed for something short though he unfolded the pa harry turtledove per on it was a neatly typed paragraph in polish he read the words aloud for rivkas benefit just so you know your latest message has been received elsewhere and widely circulated reaction is very much as we had hoped sympathy for us outside the area has increased and certain parties would have red faces under other circumstances they still would like to congratulate you for your wit suggest you let them continue to lavish their praises from a distance thats all rivka asked when he was through no signature or anything no he answered i can make a pretty good guess about who sent it though and i expect you can too anielewicz she said thats what i think moishe agreed the note had all the hallmarks of the jewish fighting leader no wonder it was in polish hed been thoroughly secular before the war being typewritten made it harder to trace if it fell into the wrong hands so did its elliptical phrasing someone who didnt know for whom it was intended would have trouble figuring out what it was supposed to mean anielewicz was careful every way he could think of moishe was sure he wouldnt know how the note had got down to the bunker rivka said so the recording got abroad thank god for that i wouldnt want you known as the lizards puppet no thank god im not moishe started to laugh id like to see zolraag with his face all red after what the lizard governor had done to him he wanted zolraag both embarrassed and furious from what the note said he was getting his wish one of the things with which the bunker had been stocked was a bottle of slivovitz till now moishe had ignored it he pulled it off the high shelf where it sat yanked out the cork and poured two shots handing one glass to rivka he raised the other himself confusion to the lizards he said they both sipped the plum brandy fire ran down moishes throat rivka coughed several times then she lifted her glass quietly she offered a toast of her own freedom for our people and even one day for us yes moishe finished the slivovitz one of the sabbath candles went out filling the bunker with the smell of hot tallow and cutting the light inside almost in half new shadows swooped the other one will go soon rivka said watching that flame approach the candlestick too i know moishe answered gloomily up where reuven could not knock them over two little oil lamps burned but for being made out of tin they probably werent much different from the ones the maccabees had used when they took the temple in jerusalem away from antiochus worldwar in the balance and his greeks the tiny amount of light they gave made moishe think they were primitive anyhow he carefully refilled them all the same waking up in absolute blackness in the crowded little underground room was a nightmare hed suffered only once the dreadful groping search for a box of matches made him vow never to go through it again hed lived up to the vow so far reuven rivka and he all shared one crowded bed he gently rolled his son against the far wall reuven mumbled and thrashed but didnt wake up moishe got into bed next to him held up the covers so rivka could slide in too his hand brushed her hip as he let the blankets down over them she turned toward him the lamps gave just enough light to let him see the questioning look on her face the touch had been as much an accident as a caress but he drew her to him just the same the questioning look turned to a smile later they lay nestled together like spoons her backside warm against the bottom of his belly it was a gentle way to make love and one not likely to disturb their son moishe stroked rivkas hair she laughed quietly whats funny he asked he could hear sleepiness blur his voice she laughed again we didnt do this so much when we were first married well maybe not he said i was just starting medical school and busy all the time and then the baby came and now he thought what else is there to do its too dark to read much were both sleeping a lot if we didnt take our pleasure from each other wed be as cross as a couple of bears cooped up down here he didnt think saying he enjoyed rivkas body because there wasnt anyg else to do would endear him to her instead he said with mock sevety most women i hear kvetch because their husbands dont pay them enough attention are you complaining because i pay you too much i didnt think i was complaining she moved away from the edge of the bed and against him pressed tight against her firm flesh he felt himself begin to rise again so did she without a word she raised a leg enough to let him slip himself back into her her breath sighed out when he did no hurry he thought we arent going anywhere unhurriedly he tried to make the best of where they were the door to bobby fiores cell hissed open it wasnt the usual time for food as well as he could judge without any clock he looked around hopefully maybe the lizards were bringing in liu han but no it was only lizards the usual armed guards and another one the latter with more elaborate body paint than the others hed figured out that was a mark of status among them just as a man who wore a fancy harry turtledove suit was likely to be a bigger wheel than one in bib overalls and a straw hat the lizard with the expensive paint job said something in his own language too fast for fiore to follow he said as much i dont understand being a phrase hed found worth memorizing the lizard said come with in english it shall be done superior sir fiore answered trotting out a couple of other stock phrases he got to his feet and approached the lizard not too close though because hed learned that made the guards anxious he didnt want anybody with a gun anxious about him the guards fell in around him all of them too far away for him to try grabbing one of those guns he wasnt feeling suicidal this morning assuming it was morning only god and the lizards knew for sure so he didnt try when the lizards took him to liu hans cell they turned right out the door this time they turned left he didnt know whether to be curious or apprehensive and finally settled for a little of each heading someplace out of the ordinary might be dangerous but it gave him the chance to see something new after being cooped up so long with essentially nothing to see that counted for a good deal the trouble was just because something was new didnt necessarily make it exciting corridors remained corridors their ceilings unpleasantly close to his head some were bare metal others painted a flat off white the lizards who passed him in those corridors paid him no more attention than he would have given a dog walking down the street he wanted to shout at them just to make them jump but that would have made the guards jumpy too and maybe earned him a bullet in the ribs so he didnt peering through open doorways was more interesting he tried to figure out what the lizards in those rooms that werent cells were up to most of the time he couldnt a lot of the aliens just sat in front of what looked like little movie screens fiore couldnt see the pictures on them just that they were in color the bright squares stood out in the midst of silver and white then came something new an oddly curved stairway but as he descended it fiore discovered that while his eyes saw the curve his feet couldnt feel it and when he got to the bottom he seemed lighter than he had up at the top he shifted his weight back and forth no he wasnt imagining it boy if id been this light on my feet idve made the big leagues years ago he thought then he shook his head maybe not his bat had always been pretty light too the lizards took the weird stairs and the change in weight utterly for granted they hustled him along the corridors on this level which didnt worldwar in the balance seem any different from those up above at last they took him into one of the rooms with the movie screens the lizard whod ordered him out of his own cell spoke to the one who waited in there that one had an even spiffier paint job than the alien whod come in with the guards fiore couldnt follow what the lizards said as they talked back and forth but he heard his own name several times the lizards massacred it worse than liu han did the alien whod been in the room surprised him by speaking decent english you are the tosevite male bobby fiore the one mated to the female liu han in an exclusive the word came out as one long hiss arrangement yes superior si fiore answered also in english he took a small chance by asking who are you superior sir the lizard didnt get mad i am tessrek senior psychologist more hisses there tessrek went on i seek to learn more about this arrangement what do you want to know fiore wondered if the lizards had figured out liu han was pregnant yet he or she would have to spell things out pretty soon if they kept on being dumb about it they knew more than hed thought tessrek turned a knob on the desk behind which he was sitting out of thin air fiore heard himself saying goddamn who woulda thought my first kid would be half chink tessrek turned the knob again then asked this mean the female liu han will lay eggs no will reproduce you big uglies do not lay eggs the female liu han will reproduce uh yeah fiore said this is as a result of your matings tessrek twiddled with another knohe little screen behind him which had been a blank blue square start showing a picture stag film fiore thought hed seen a few in his time this one was in color good enough for technicolor not the grainy blackandwhite typical of the breed the color was what he noticed first only half a heartbeat later did he realize the movie was of liu han and him he took a step forward he wanted to squeeze tessreks neck until the lizards strange eyes popped from his head the murder on his face must have shown even to the guards because a couple of them hissed a sharp warning and trained their weapons on his midsection reluctantly every muscle screaming to go on he checked himself tessrek seemed to have no notion of what had rattled his cage the psychologist went on blithely this mating this spawn you would say you and the female liu han will care for it i guess so bobby mumbled behind the lizard the dirty picture went on liu hans face slack with ecstasy his own intent above her in a distant way he wondered how the lizards managed to show a movie in a harry turtledove lighted room with no projector visible he made himself come back to the question yeah thats what well do if you things let us this will be what you big uglies call a family tessrek pronounced the word with extra care to make sure fiore understood him yeah he answered a family he tried to look away from the screen toward the lizard but his eyes kept sliding back some of his embarrassed anger spilled over into words whats the matter dont you lizards have families of your own you gotta come to earth to poke your snouts into ours no we have none tessrek said not in your sense of word with us females lay eggs raise hatchlings males do other things fiore gaped at him more than his surroundings more than the shamelessness with which the lizards had filmed his lovemaking the simple admission brought home how alien the invaders were men might build spaceships one day sam yeager had read about that rocketstomars stuff all the time bobby wondered if his roommate was still alive plenty of men were shameless starting with peeping torn but not knowing what a family was oblivious to the turmoil hed created tessrek went on the race needs to learn how you big uglies live so we rule you better easier need to understand to how do you say to control that that word i want yeah thats it all right fiore said dully guinea pig ran through his head again and again hed had that thought before but never so strong the lizards didnt care that he knew they were experimenting with him what could he do about it to them he was just an animal in a cage he wondered what guinea pigs thought of the scientists who worked on them if it was nothing good he couldnt blame them when will the hatchling come out tessrek asked i dont know exactly fiore answered it takes nine months but i dont know how long its been since she caught how am i supposed to tell you you dont even turn off the lights in my room nine months tessrek fiddled with something on his desk the dirty movie disappeared from the screen behind him to be replaced by lizard squiggles those changed as he did more fiddling he turned one of his eye turrets back toward them this would be one and onehalf years of the race one year of the race i tell you is half a tosev year more or less bobby fiore hadnt juggled fractions in his head since high school the trouble hed had with them then had helped convince him hed be better off playing ball for a living he needed some painful mental work before he finally nodded yeah i think thats right superior sir sstrange another word tessrek turned into a hiss you big uglies take so long to give birth to your hatchlings why is this how the devil should i know fiore answered again he had the feel worldwar in the balance ing of taking a test he hadnt studied for its just the way we are im not lying superior sir you can check that one with anybody check this means confirm yes i do that the lizard psychologist spoke lizard talk into what looked like a little microphone different squiggles went up on the screen fiore wondered if it was somehow writing down what tessrek said hell of a gadget if it could do that he thought the lizard went on i do not think you lie what is the advantage to you on this question but i wonder why you tosevites are so not like race and other species of the empire you oughta talk to a scientist or a doctor or somebody fiore scratched his head you say you lizards lay eggs of course by his tone tessrek implied that was the only thing a rightthinking creature could possibly do bobby thought back to the chickens that had squawked and clucked in a little coop behind his folks house in pittsburgh without those chickens and their eggs he and his brothers and sisters would have gone hungry a lot more than they did but that wasnt why they came to mind now he said an egg cant get any bigger once you lay it when the chick inside or i guess the baby lizard too is too big for the eggshell to hold it any more it has to come out but a baby inside a woman has more room to grow tessrek brought both eyes to bear on him hed learned a lizard did that only when youd managed to get its full attention hed also learned its full attention wasnt always something you wanted to have the psychologist said this may be worth more study he made it sound like an accolade he leaned close to the microphone went back into his language ag the screen showed fresh lizard writing it really was a notetaker fioirealized he wondered what else it could do besides showing movies that should never have been made tessrek said you big uglies are of the kind of tosevite creature where the female feeds the hatchling with a fluid that comes out of her body it wasnt exactly a question even though he made the interrogative noise at the end he already knew the answer bobby fiore had to take a mental step backward and work out what the lizard was talking about after a second the light bulb went on with milk you mean superior sir yeah we feed babies milk hed been a bottle baby himself not nursed but he didnt complicate the issue besides what had the bottle held milk yes now tessrek sounded as if bobby had admitted humans picked their noses and fed babies on boogers or else like a fastidious clubwoman who for some reason had to talk about syphilis he paused pulled himself together only the females do this am i correct not the males no not the males superior sir imagining a baby nursing at his flat harry turtledove hairy tit made fiore squeamish and also made him want to laugh and it rammed home just when he was starting to get used to the lizards again how alien they were they didnt have a clue about what being human meant even though liu han and he had to use some lizard words to talk with each other they used them in a human context they both understood just because they were people and probably used them in ways the lizards would have found nonsensical that made him wonder how much tessrek in spite of his fluent en glish truly grasped of the ideas he mouthed passing information back and forth was all very well the lizard psychologists grasp of the language was good enough for that but once he had the information how badly would he misinterpret it just because it was different from anything he was used to tessrek said if you males do not give milk to hatchlings what point to staying by them and by females men help women take care of babies fiore answered and they can feed babies too once the babies start eating real food besides they usually make the money to keep families going understand what you big uglies do not understand why tessrek said why males want to stay with females why you have families not males with females at random like the race and other species we know in an abstract way bobby thought males with females at random sounded like fun hed enjoyed himself with the women with whom the lizards had paired him before hed ended up with liu han but he enjoyed being with her too in a different and maybe deeper sense answer me tessrek said sharply im sorry superior sir i was trying to figure out what to say i guess part of the answer is that men fall in love with women and the other way round too love tessrek used the word with almost as much revulsion as he had when he said milk you big uglies talk loudly of this word you do not ever make this a word with a meaning you bobby fiore tell me what this love word means uh fiore said that was a tall order for a poet a philosopher or even cole porter let alone a minorleague second baseman as he would have at the plate overmatched against bob feller he gave it his best shot love is when you care about somebody and want to take care of them and want them to be happy all the time you say what i want why the lizard psychologist said with a discontented hiss is because you big uglies mate all the time use mating as social bond form families because of this mating bond fiore was anything but an introspective man nor had he ever spent much time contemplating the nature of the family families were what you grew up in and later what you started for yourself not only that all the talk about sex even with a lizard embarrassed him worldwar in the balance i guess maybe youre right he mumbled when he thought about it what tessrek had to say did make some sense i am right tessrek told him and added the emphatic cough you help me show the disgusting habits of you big uglies are to blame for you being so strange so what is word so anomalous yes anomalous i prove this yes i do he spoke in his own language to the guards who started marching fiore back to his cell as he went he reflected that while the lizards were massively ignorant of humanity they and people werent so different in some ways just like a lot of people hed known tessrek was using his words to prop up an idea the lizard had already had if hed said just the opposite tessrek would have found some way to use that too jens larssens neck muscles tensed under the unaccustomed weight of the tin hat on his head he was developing a list to the right from the slung springfield hed been issued like most farm kids hed done some plinking with a but the military rifle had a mass and heft to it unlike anything hed ever known technically he still wasnt a soldier general patton hadnt impressed him into the army your civilian job is more important than anything you can do for me hed rumbled but had insisted that he be armed weve got no time to coddle noncombatants jens knew an inconsistency when he heard one but hadnt had any luck convincing the major general he looked at his watch the greenly glowing hands showed it was just before four am the night was dark and cloudy and full of blowing snow but it was anything but peaceful more engines added their roar and the stink of their exhaust to the air every moment the second hand ticked round the dial a minute before four half a minute his watch was synchronized pretty well but not perfectly at by his reckoning what seemed like every cannon in the world cut loose the low clouds glowed yellow for a few seconds from all the muzzle flashes packed together the threeinch howitzers and the mm antiaircraft cannon pressed into service as field guns roared again and again as fast as their crews could keep the shells coming as hed been told jens yelled as loud as he could to help equalize the pressure on his ears the noise was lost in the overwhelming cacophony of the guns lizard counterbattery fire began coming in a couple of minutes later by then the tanks and men of pattons force were already on the move the american artillery barrage eased up as abruptly as it had begun forward to the next firing position an officer near larssen screamed the lizards zero in on you fast if you stay in one place too long some of the howitzers were on their own motorized chassis half worldwar in the balance tracks towed most of the rest of the artillery pieces a few were either horsedrawn or pulled by teams of soldiers if the advance went as patton planned those would soon fall behind for the moment every shell counted come on you lugs get your butts in gear a sergeant yelled with the dulcet tones of sergeants all through history you think youre scared just waitll you see the goddamn lizards when we hit em that was the gospel according to patton whether it was the gospel truth remained to be proved along with the men around him jens tramped off toward the west airplanes roared low overhead carefully husbanded against this day of need and now to be expended win or die larssen waved at the planes as they darted past he didnt think many of the pilots would be coming back if attacking lizard positions in the snowy dark wasnt a suicide mission he didnt know what was of course he realized a few seconds later that was what he was doing too even if he wasnt in a fighter off to one side a soldier with a voice that still cracked exclaimed aint this exciting now that you mention it no larssen said artillery supervisor svallah shouted into his field telephone what do you mean you cant send me any more ammunition right now the big uglies are moving i tell you we havent faced largescale combat like this since just after we landed on this miserable ball of muddy ice the voice that came out of the speaker was cold i am also receiving reports of heavy fighting on the northwestern flank of our thrust toward the major city by the lake supply officers are still evaluating priorities i svallah possessed hair like a big ugly he would have pulled great clunt of it from his head supply still seemed to think they were back home where a delay of half a day never mattered and one of half a year wasnt always worth getting excited about either the tosevites worse luck didnt operate that way listen he yelled were low on cluster bombs our landcruisers are short of both highexplosive and antiarmor rounds we dont have enough antilandcruiser missiles for the infantry by the emperor though its not my province i hear were even short on smallarms rounds yours is not the only unit in this predicament replied the maddeningly dispassionate voice on the other end of the line every effort will be made to resupply to the best of our ability as quickly as possible shipments may not be full resupplies shortages do exist and expenditures have been too high for too long i assure you we shall do the best we can under the circumstances you dont understand svallah wasnt yelling any more he was screaming he had reason tosevite shells had started feeling for his posi harry turtledove tion do you hear those bursts do you hear them may you be cursed with an emperorless afterlife those arent our guns the stinking big uglies have ammunition its not as good as ours but if theyre shooting and were not what difference does it make i assure you artillery supervisor resupply will reach you as expeditiously as is practicable answered the male in supply who wasnt being shot at i also assure you that yours is not the only unit urgently requesting munitions we are making every effort to balance demands the tosevites shells were walking closer fragments of brass and steel rattled off tree trunks and branches svallah said look if you dont get me some shells pretty quick my request wont matter because im about to be overrun here is that plain enough for you by the emperor itd probably make you happy because then youd have one thing fewer to worry about your attitude is not constructive artillery supervisor the male safe in the rear said in hurt tones ask me if i care svallah retorted just so you know im going to order a retreat before i get chopped to pieces those are my only two choices since you cant get me ammunition i a tosevite round landed within a males length of him between them blast and fragments left him hardly more than a red rag splashed across the snow by a freak of war the field telephone was undamaged it squawked artillery supervisor are you there artillery supervisor respond please artillery supervisor for the first couple of days it was easier than larssen would have imagined possible patton really had managed to catch the lizards napping and to hit them where their defenses were thin how the soldiers cheered when they crossed from indiana into illinois instead of running or desperately holding on like a stunned boxer in a clinch they were advancing it made new men of them got their peckers up was the way one sergeant had put it all of a sudden it wasnt easy any more in the open fields in front of a grim little town called cissna park stood a lizard tank it was defiantly out in the open with a view that reached for miles in front of it burning or by now burnt out lay the hulks of at least half a dozen lees and shermans some had been killed at close to three miles they didnt have a prayer of touching the lizard tank at that range let alone killing it the tank crew had highexplosive shells as well as armorpiercers larssen had been on the receiving end of bombardments back in chicago he preferred giving them out he couldnt do anything about it though except throw himself flat when the big gun spoke again that son of a whores gonna hold up the whole brigade all by his worldwar in the balance lonesome somebody said with sick dread in his voice the soldiers peckers might be up now but how long would they stay that way if the onslaught failed a fellow who looked much too young to be wearing a majors gold oak leaves began ticking off men on his fingers you you you you and you head off to the right flank and make that bastard notice you im coming too well see what we can do about him jens was the second of those yous he opened his mouth to protest he was supposed to be a valuable physicist not a dogface but he didnt have the nerve to finish squawking not when the rest of the party was heading out not when everybody was looking at them and at him legs numb with fear he lurched after the others the tank seemed almost naked out there if it had any infantry support the lizards on the ground were holding their fire larssen watched the distant turret it got less distant all the time which meant it got more and more able to kill him if it swings this way i know im going to run he thought but he kept trotting forward one of the soldiers lay flat on the ground opened up with a browning automatic rifle he had about as much chance of hurting the tank with it as a mosquito did blowing holes in an elephant come on keep moving the kid who was a major bawled jens kept moving the farther he got from the brave maniac with the bar the better he liked it a couple of hundred yards farther on another fellow also armed with a bar took cover in some bushes that wouldnt have been there if the field had been tended since last summer he too started firing short bursts at the lizard tank now larssen was close enough to see a couple of sparks as bullets spanged off its turret again he couldnt see that they did any ghe rest of you spread out find what cover you can and start shooting the major said we are a diversion we have to make that gunner pay attention to us diversion indeed jens thought the lizard gunner ought to have extraordinarily good sport chewing up humans who couldnt do him any damage in return but there was another tall patch of snowcovered dead weeds just ahead he dropped down behind them even through several layers of clothes the snow chilled his belly he drew a bead on the tank squeezed the springfields trigger nothing happened scowling he checked the rifle hed left the safety on you idiot he snarled to himself as he clicked it off he aimed again fired the kick hammered his shoulder a lot harder than he remembered from when hed fooled around with a the physicist part of him took over youre sending a heavier slug out at a higher velocity of course itll kick harder newtons second law harry turtledove remember good old if ma he adjusted the sight for long range his first shot with it set for four hundred yards couldnt have come close he pulled the trigger again this time he was better braced against the recoil he still couldnt tell whether he hit it or not as hed been ordered he banged away the rest of the detachment was making a lot of noise too if somebody got real lucky with a round he might mess up a sight or a periscope past that the majors diversion wasnt doing anything more than standing out in the open with a shoot e sign would have accomplished after a while though the lizard commanding the tank must have got tired of just sitting there in a target suit the turret slewed toward one of the bar men having seen american tank turrets in action larssen was appalled at how fast this one traversed fire spurted from the turret not the main armament why swat flies with a sledgehammer but the coaxial machine gun by it snow and dirt spurted up all around the soldier with the automatic rifle it wasnt a long burst the gunner was firing for effect after a few seconds silence the bar man shifted his weapon on its bipod sent back a few defiant rounds here i am he seemed to be saying nyaah nyaah the tank gunner squeezed off an answering burst longer this time another silence fell after he stopped the fellow with the browning automatic rifle did not reply now wounded or dead larssen thought grimly the tank turret turned on to the other bar man he had a better spot from which to shoot back and lasted quite a bit longer than the first gunner had the firefight between him and the tank gunner went on through several exchanges but the fellow with the bar was under orders to keep the tank busy and brave enough to carry out those orders with exactitude that meant he had to keep exposing himself to fire and in any case the dirt and bushes behind which he lay were no match for the inches of armor that sheltered the lizard in the tank turret when the second bar fell silent the tank turret traversed through another few degrees larssen watched it with fearful fascination for now it bore on him he was lying in what had been a plowed furrow when the machine gun began to chatter again he flattened himself out like a snake hoping praying the hard earth would offer some protection the second bar man had lived a little while after all bullets lashed the ground all around him freezing dirt spattered onto his coat and the back of his neck he could not force himself to get up and shoot back not in the face of a machine gun behind armor did that make him a coward he didnt know or care the burst from the tank broke off he lifted his head out of the dirt if by some miracle the turret had moved on to take up the hunt for someone else he thought le might start firing again and then scoot for new worldwar in the balance cover but no the cannon and therefore the machine gun too still bore on him he saw motion on the far side of the lizard tank more human soldiers men whod snuck close to the monster while he and his comrades occupied its attention he wondered if theyd leap aboard and throw explosives into the turret through the cupola lizard tanks had died that way but an awful lot more soldiers had died trying to kill them one of the americans raised something to his shoulder it wasnt a gun it was longer and thicker flame spurted from its rear end trailing fire all the way some kind of rocket round shot across the couple of hundred yards that separated the soldiers from the lizard tank it slammed into the engine compartment at the rear right where the armor was thinnest more fire some blue some orange spurted from the stricken vehicle hatches popped open in the turret three lizards bailed out now yelling like a savage jens fired with ferocious glee suddenly the tables were turned the tormentors all but helpless against those they had bedeviled one lizard fell then another then the tank brewed up as the fire reached the main fuel storage flame washed over the whole chassis a smoke ring spurted up from the turret pops and booms marked ammunition starting to cook off the last lizard whod made it out of the hatch went down under a fusillade of bullets the kid major was up on his feet waving like a madman off to the east the distant roar of engines marked new motion from the tanks and selfpropelled guns the lizard tank had stalled then the major ran back to see how the two bar men were jens ran with him of was gruesomely dead top clipped by them the of his skull off a lizard round and grayred brains splashed in the snow the other had a belly wound he was unconscious but breathing the major pulled aside clothes dusted the bleeding wound with sulfa powder slapped on a field dressing and waved for a medic he turned to larssen you know what i think were really gonna do this maybe jens knew his voice wasnt everything it should be he hadnt hardened himself against human beings looking like selections from the butchers trying not to think of that he asked what did they use to take out the tank as if to punctuate his words more rounds went up inside the blazing hulk the rocket wasnt that great when the major grinned he didnt look a day over seventeen the fancy name is inch rocket launcher but all the teams i know are calling it after that crazy instrument bob burns plays on the radio a bazooka larssen grinned too i like that harry turtledove so do i the majors grin slipped a little i just wish we had a hell of a lot more of em they were brand new last year and of course weve had the devils own time building em since the damned lizards came but what weve got were using all at once he went from informant back to officer now weve got to get moving bust your hump there shouldnt they go ahead sir jens pointed to the lees and shermans just now rattling past the carcass of the lizard tank they need us too the major answered they make the hole we go through it and we support them if the lizards had had some infantry on the ground to support that vehicle we couldnt have stalked it the way we did their machines are marvelous and you cant say theyre not brave but their tactical doctrine stinks colonel groves larssen remembered had said the same thing at the time it hadnt seemed to matter the aliens machines were carrying everything before them but it seemed they might be fought successfully after all the major was already moving west again jens trotted heavily after him giving the pyre of the lizard tank a wide berth assault force commander relhost said no i cant send you more landcruisers up there in your sector on the radio the voice of zingiber the northern flank commander was anguished but i need them the big uglies have so much of their garbage coming at me that theyre pushing me back and its not all garbage any more either i lost three landcruisers today to those stinking rockets theyve started using our crews arent trained to regard infantry as a tactical threat and we cant pull them out for training sessions now hardly relhost didnt want to know whether zingiber was serious or not he might have been some males still hadnt adjusted to the pace war required on tosev relhost went on i say again i have no more landcruisers to send weve lost several on the southern flank as well and the rocket threat is making us deploy them more cautiously there too but i need them zingiber repeated as if his need would conjure landcruisers out of thin air i say again superior sir that as things stand we are losing ground the two big ugly attacks may even succeed in joining yes i know i am also looking at a map screen relhost didnt like what he saw there either if the big uglies did manage to link their thrusts theyd cut support for his principal assault force which was finally pounding into the suburbs of chicago that was expensive too in the rubble of their towns the tosevites fought like ssvapi on rabotev protecting their burrows zingiber said if you cant send landcruisers send helicopters to help me take out some more of the tosevites armor worldwar in the balance relhost made up his mind that if zingiber made one more such idiotic request hed relieve him he hissed angrily before he pressed the transmit button we have fewer helicopters than landcruisers to spare the miserable tosevites have learned something new theyre faster at that than we are the thought worried him he made himself continue theyve brought their antiaircraft artillery as far forward as they can towing it with light armor or sometimes even with softskinned vehicles the helicopters are armored against riflecaliber bullets to armor them against these shells would make them too heavy to fly let them ship us landcruisers from elsewhere on this stinking planet then zingiber said the logistics relhost cringed landcruisers are so big and heavy only two will fit onto even our biggest hauler aircraft and we brought few of those aircraft to tosev not anticipating so large a need besides the haulers are unarmed and vulnerable to the upsurge in tosevite air activity lately it takes only one of those nasty little machines slipping through a killercraft screen to bring down the hauler and the landcruiser both but if we dont get reinforcements from somewhere well lose this battle zingiber said let them put the landcruisers on a starship if they must so long as we get them land a starship in the middle of a combat zone vulnerable to artillery and the emperor only knows what ingenious sabotage the big uglies can devise you must be joking relhost made a bitter decision ill pull a few landcruisers back from the principal assault force maybe more than a few they can return once they rectify the situation i hope he thought the landcruisers didnt run without fuel and the tosevites were doing everything they could to interfere with supply lines no eoved logistics but armies that ignored logistics died xot course the tosevites had fuel problems of their own theyd stockpiled the noxious stuff their machines burned for this campaign but the facilities that produced it were vulnerable to assault relhost looked at the map again he hoped the race would assault them soon a couple of big uglies in long black coats and widebrimmed black hats pushed an ordnance cart toward the flight of killercraft gefron took no notice of them tosevites were doing a lot of menial work these days to let males of the race get on with the business of conquering tosev gefron gave rolvar and xarol his fellow pilots in the flight their last few instructions remember this one is important we really have to plaster that ploesti place the big uglies of deutschland draw much of their fuel from it it shall be done the other two males chorused together gefron went on so much i have been ordered to tell you but for myself i would like to dedicate this mission to the spirit of my predecessor harry turtledove as head of this unit flight leader teerts we shall aid in making it impossible for the big uglies to kill or capture we still do not know his exact fate any more brave males like teerts thanks to us the conquest of tosev shall grow nearer its completion it shall be done the pilots chorused again mordechai anielewicz walked along nowolipie street between closed armaments plants listening to nathan brodsky the jewish fighting leader had long since grown used to taking promenades through warsaw to listen to things he didnt want to take the chance of having the lizards overhear this was one of those things brodsky who worked as a laborer at the airport had picked up a lot of the lizards language no doubt about it brodsky was saying the hem of his coat flapped around his ankles as he walked beside anielewicz their destination is ploesti they were talking about knocking out all the nazis oil nu i know thats important so i told the lizard boss i was sick and came straight to you nu nu anielewicz answered youre not wrong it is important now i have to figure out what to do about it he stopped lets head back toward my headquarters brodsky obediently turned now anielewicz walked with his head down hands jammed into his pockets against the cold he was thinking very hard indeed cooperating with the germans in any way still left the worst of bad tastes in his mouth he kept having second thoughts about letting that damned panzer major through with even half his saddlebag of explosive metal and now again if the lizards wrecked ploesti the nazi war machine was liable to grind to a halt the germans without oil of their own desperately needed what they got from romania the nazis were still fighting hard against the lizards and even hurting them now and again no one could deny they turned out capable soldiers and clever engineers suppose in the end the germans won would they rest content inside their own borders anielewicz snorted not bloody likely but suppose the germans suppose mankind lost would the lizards ever use human beings as anything but hewers of wood and drawers of water that wasnt bloody likely either the jewish fighting leader came around the last corner before the office building his men occupied among many others his bicycle stood out in front of it seeing it there helped him make up his mind he slapped brodsky on the back thank you for letting me know nathan ill take care of it what will you do brodsky asked anielewicz didnt answer unlike brodsky hed come to appreciate the need for tight security what the other jew didnt know he couldnt tell worldwar in the balance anielewicz hopped on his bicycle rode rapidly to a house outside the ghetto he knocked on the door a polish woman opened it may i use your telephone he said im sorry im afraid its quite urgent her eyes went wide few people who are part of contingency plans ever expect the contingencies to arrive but after a moment she nodded yes of course come in its in the parlor anielewicz knew where the phone was his men had installed it he cranked it waited for an operator to answer when she did he said give me operator threetwoseven please one moment he heard clicks from the switchboard then three twoseven speaking yes this is yitzhak bauer i need to place a call to my uncle michael in satu mare please its urgent the operator was one of his people the false name was one for which she was supposed to be alert and she was without a seconds hesitation she said i will try to put you through it may take some time as fast as you can please at full stretch from where he stood anielewicz could just reach a chair he snagged it sank into it polish longdistance phone service had been bad before the war started it was worse now he kept the receiver pressed to his ear what he mostly heard was silence every so often there would be more switchboard clicks or op erators voices at the very limit of hearing time crawled by the polish woman brought him a cup of coffee or rather the burntkasha brew that substituted for it hed long since grown used to the ersatz and besides it was warm but if the call didnt get through pretty soon he wouldnt have needed to bother making it the liz ardsiguld have bombed ploesti and headed back v long to finish their planes he wondered that the arming was biggest variable the flight from here to a little north of bucharest wouldnt take long especially not at the speeds the lizards aircraft used more clicks more distant chatter and then sounding almost as clear as if she were sitting in his lap operator threetwoseven said i am through to satu mare sir he heard another operators voice more distant speaking oddly accented german rather than polish or yiddish go ahead warsaw to whom do you wish to speak my uncle michael michael spiegel that is anielewicz said tell him its his nephew yitzhak lieutenantcolonel michael spiegel he was given to understand commanded the nazi garrison at satu mare the northernmost romanian town still in german hands i will connect you please wait the distant operator said anielewicz listened to still more clicks and then at last a ringing phone someone picked it up he heard a brisk male voice say bitte the operator explained who he claimed to be a long pause followed and then yitzhak is that you i hadnt expected to hear from you harry turtledove i hadnt expected to call either you nazi bastard anielewicz thought spiegels clear german set his teeth on edge by conditioned reflex but he made himself say yes its me uncle michael i thought you ought to know that our friends will want some cooking grease from your family as much as you can spare he felt how crude the improvised code was spiegel fortunately proved quick on the uptake hardly missing a beat the german said well have to get it ready for them do you know when theyre coming i shouldnt be surprised if theyd already left anielewicz answered im sorry but i just found out they felt like getting it myself such is life well do what we can hei goodbye the line went dead he started to say heil hitler anielewicz thought damn good thing he caught himself in case the lizards are listening in as soon as he replaced the receiver the polish woman stuck her head into the parlor is everything all right she asked anxiously i hope so he answered but felt he had to add if you have relatives you can stay with that might be a good idea her pale blue eyes went wide she nodded ill arrange to have someone get word to my husband she said now youd better go anielewicz left in a hurry he felt bad about endangering a noncombatant family and even worse about endangering them to benefit the nazis i hope i did the right thing he thought as he climbed onto his bicycle i wonder if ill ever be sure blips appeared on the headup display that reflected into gefrons eyes from the inside of the killercrafts windscreen some of the big uglies on the ground must have spotted us the flight leader said theyre sending aircraft up to try to keep us away from ploesti his mouth fell open in amusement at the absurdity of the idea the other two pilots in the flight confirmed that their electronics saw the tosevite aircraft too xarol observed theyre sending up a lot of aircraft this fuel is important to them gefron answered they know they have to try to protect it what they dont know is that they cant well have to show them he studied the velocity vectors of the planes the big uglies were fly ing a couple were the new jets the deutsche had started throwing into the air they were fast enough to have been troublesome if they were equipped with radar as it was he knew they were there while they still groped for him ill take the jets he told the other males you two handle the ones with the revolving airfoils knock down a few and keep going we havent any time to waste toying with them worldwar in the balance he chose targets for his missiles gave them to the computer when the tone from the speaker taped to his hearing diaphragm told him the computer had acquired them he touched the firing button the killercraft bucked slightly as the wingtip missiles leapt away one of the jets never knew what hit it he watched electronically as a mkssile swatted it out of the air the other tosevite pilot must have spotted the missile meant for him he tried to dive away from it but his aircraft wasnt fast enough for that he went down too gefrons wingmales salvoed all their missiles wingtip and pylon both at the deutsche aircraft that blasted a gaping hole in their formation through which the killercraft flew rolvar and xarol shouted excitedly they hadnt seen so much opposition since the war was new gefron was pleased too but also a little worried the big ugly pilots werent fleeing they were trying to regroup in the wake of the killercraft returning to base only he would have missiles left to fire at them it shouldnt matter gefron told himself if we cant get by them with our speed altitude radar and cannon we dont deserve to conquer this planet but it was one more thing to worry about he studied the radar display approaching target he said remember the deutsche have set up a dummy target north of the real installation if you bomb that one by mistake i promise that youll never get your tailstumps into a killercraft again as long as you live the real ploesti lay in a little vale gefron had it on his radar set he peered through the windscreen ready to paint the assigned refineries with his laser to guide the bombs in but instead of the towers of the refineries and petroleum wells the big squat cylinders that stored refined hydrocarbons he saw was a spreading thickening cloud of grayblack smoke he d the deutsche werent playing fair his wingmales noticed the problem at the same time he did what are we supposed to do now rolvar asked how can we light up the targets through all that junk gefron wanted to abort the mission and fly back to base but because he was the flight leader anything that went wrong would get blamed on him well bomb anyway he declared whatever in the smoke we hit will hurt the deutsche somehow truth xarol declared the flight went on gefron turned on the laser targeting system in the hope it would penetrate the smoke or find some clear patches through which to acquire accurate targets for the bombs his killercraft carried under its wings no luck instead of the steady tone he wanted to hear all he got was the complaining warble of a system that couldnt lock on the deutsch antiaircraft guns that lined the ridges on either side of the petroleum wells and refineries opened up with everything they had more smoke dotted the sky now in big black puffs around and mostly be harry turtledove hind the flight of killercraft the big uglies at the guns werent leading the races aircraft quite enough even so the display of firepower was impressive the bursts from exploding tosevite shells seemed close enough together for gefron to get out of his aircraft and walk across them once or twice he heard sharp rattles like gravel bouncing off sheet metal it wasnt gravel though it was fragments of shell casing punching holes in his fuselage and wing he anxiously scanned the instrument panel for damage lights none came on the deutsche were defending ploesti every way they knew how above the clotted smoke floated balloons tethered to stout cables that might wreck an aircraft that ran into them more antiaircraft guns some cannons like those on the high ground to either side others mere machine guns that spat glowing tracers fired out of the smoke they had no radar control and so could not see what they hoped to hit but they added more metal to an already crowded sky does anyone have laser lockon gefron asked hopefully both wingmales denied it gefron sighed the results would not be what his superiors had hoped for proceed on purely visual bombing run it shall be done flight leader xarol and rolvar chorused then they were over the billowing smoke gefron poised a claw at the bombrelease button the killercraft lost both weight and drag as the ordnance fell away all at once it seemed a much better performer we did hurt them by the spirits of departed emperors xarol said exultantly the wingmale was right sudden new angry clouds of black greasy smoke roiled up through the screen the deutsche had stretched above ploesti through new smoke and old gefron saw sullen orange fireballs blooming like so many huge terrible flowers the big uglies will be a long time repairing that the flight leader agreed happily he radioed a report of success to the base from which hed set out then returned to the intraflight frequency now we go home as if we had any real home on this cold ball of mud rolvar said part of it the more southerly latitudes can be quite pleasant gefron replied and even this areas not too bad in local summer present conditions of course are something else again i assure you i find frozen water as revolting as does any other male in his right mind he brought his killercraft onto the reciprocal of the course hed flown to ploesti as he did so his radar picked up the big ugly aircraft through which his flight had barreled on the way to the refinery complex they hadnt come straight after the killercraft instead theyd loitered along the likely return route and used the time while he and his wingmales were making their bombing run to gain altitude gefron would have been just as glad to scoot past unnoticed but one of the big uglies spotted him and his comrades they might have been worldwar in the balance radarless but they had radios what one of them saw the others learned in moments their aircraft turned toward the flight for an attack run the range closed frighteningly fast the big uglies flew inadequate aircraft but they flew them with panache and courage darting straight at gefron and his wingmales the flight leader fired his next todast missile and then a moment later his last one two tosevite planes tumbled in ruins the rest kept coming on the headup display gefron saw another enemy aircraft break up and yet another rolvar and xarol were using their cannon to good effect but the big uglies were firing too through the windscreen past the headup display the flight leader watched the pale flashes from their guns he turned the nose of his killercraft toward the nearest big ugly fired a short burst smoke poured from the enemys engine the plane began to fall then the flight was through the horde of tosevites gefron let out a long sigh of relief the big uglies could not hope to pursue he keyed his radio all well wlngmales all well flight leader rolvar answered but xarol said not all well superior sir i took several hits as we mixed it up with the big uglies ive lost electrical power to some of my control surfaces and im losing hydraulic pressure in the backup system i am not certain i will be able to complete return to base i will inspect visually gefron gained altitude and lost speed letting xarol pull ahead of him what he saw made him hiss in dismay part of the tail surface of his wingmales killercraft had been shot away and two lines of dismayingly large holes stitched the right wing and fuselage you didnt just take several hits you got yourself chewed up can you keep it flyinsl for the time being superior sir but altitude control grows increasingly difficult do the best you can if you are able to set down on one of our airstrips the race will have the opportunity to repair your aircraft rather than writing it off i understand superior sir the race had lost far more equipment on tosev than even the most pessimistic forecasts allowed for keeping what was left operational was a priority that grew higher every day but luck was not with xarol he did manage to keep his killercraft airborne until the flight reached territory the race controlled gefron had just radioed the nearest landing strip of his wingmales predicament when xarol announced i regret superior sir that i have no choice but to abandon the aircraft moments later a bluewhite fireball marked the machines impact point when gefron landed back at warsaw he learned his wingmale had harry turtledove ejected safely and been rescued that pleased himbut the next time xarol needed to fly what aircraft would he use smallarms fire rattled through naperville mutt daniels crouched in the trench in front of the ruins of the preemption house every so often when the firing slackened hed stick his tommy gun up over the forward rim of the trench squeeze off a short burst in the direction of the lizards and then yank it back down again kinda quiet today isnt it sarge kevin donlan said just as one such burst was answered by a storm of fire from the aliens whose forward outposts were only a few hundred yards to the east mutt pressed his face against the dirt wall of the trench as bullets whined just overhead you call this here quiet he said thinking hed chill the kid with sarcasm but donlan wouldnt chill yeah sarge i mean it is isnt it just rifle fire right now just rifle fire all day long pretty much i dont miss the artillery one little bit let me tell you me neither rifles are bad enough but that other stuff thats what slaughters you daniels paused played back the days action in his head you know youre right and i didnt even notice they aint done much with their big guns today have they i didnt think so what do you suppose it means damfino mutt wished he had a cigarette or a chew or even a pipe i aint sorry not to be on this end of it either though dont get me wrong about that but why theyre off with it son i couldnt begin to tell you the more he thought about it the more it worried him the lizards didnt have numbers going for them their strength had always lain in their guns their tank and selfpropelled pieces if they were easing off with those maybe our offensive really is putting the screws to them making them pull back donlan said mebbe daniels remained unconvinced hed been falling back be fore the invaders ever since he got strafed out of his train the idea that other troops could move forward against them was galling it seemed to say nothing hed done nothing sergeant schneider as fine a soldier as ever lived had done was good enough he didnt like believing that behind him back toward chicago an american artillery barrage opened up on the lizard position it was an odd pawky sort of shelling on again off again nothing like the endless rains of projectiles that had punctuated combat in france if you kept a gun in the same place for more than two or three rounds the lizards would figure out where it was and blast it mutt didnt know how they did it but he knew they did hed seen too many dead artillerymen and wrecked guns to have any doubt left worldwar in the balance he waited for counterbattery fire to start with the cynical sense of selfpreservation soldiers soon develop he would sooner have had the lizards shelling positions miles behind him than lobbing their presents into his trench american shells kept falling on the lizards when half an hour went by without reply daniels said you know kid you might just be right feels mighty damn good to give it to em instead of taking it dont you reckon hell yes sergeant donlan said happily a runner came down heavily into the trench where the two men sheltered he said check your watches sergeant soldier were advancing against their lines in he glanced at his own watch nineteen minutes he ran down the trench toward the next knot of men you got a watch donlan asked yeah mutt answered absently advancing against the lizards he hadnt heard orders like that since outside shabbona halfway across the state that had been a disaster this time though maybe we really are hurting em out there god damn i hope we are general pattons personal vehicle was a big ungainly dodge command and reconnaissance car one of the kind that had been nicknamed jeeps until the squarish little willys vehicles took the name away from them this one had been altered with a caliber machinegun mount that let patton blaze away as well as command to jens larssen who munched on crackers in the backseat and tried to stay inconspicuous the gun seemed excessive no one had asked his opinion as far as he could see no one ever asked anyones opinion in the armu either gave orders or you went out and did what you were told pon turned to him and said i do regret that you were thrust into the front line dr larssen you bear too much value to your country for you to have been so cavalierly risked its all right larssen said i lived through it somehow he added to himself where are we now anyhow dyou see that hill there the one with the tall building sprouting from it patton asked pointing through the dodge jeeps windshield on the flat prairie country of central illinois any rise no matter how slight stood out patton went on the building is the state farm insurance headquarters and the town he paused for dramatic effect the town dr larssen is bloomington the objective larssen hoped general patton would not take offense at the surprise in his voice the lizards had seemed so nearly invincible ever since they came to earth he hadnt dared believe patton could not only force a breakthrough but exploit it once made the objective patton agreed proudly as if answering the thought harry turtledove jens hadnt spoken he added once we broke through their crust they were hollow behind it no doubt we were confused and scared attacking such a formidable foe but they showed confusion and fright themselves sir not least because they were being attacked the bulky radio console set into the space behind the rear seat of the dodge jeep let out a squawk patton grabbed for the earphones and mike he listened for a minute or so then softly breathed one word outstanding he stowed the radio gear gave his attention back to larssen our scouts sir have met advance parties from general bradleys army north of bloomington we now have the force which was attacking chicago trapped within our ring of steel thats wonderful larssen said but will they stay trapped a legitimate question patton said we will learn soon reports indicated that the armor they had been using to spearhead their advance into chicago has now reversed its direction its bearing down on us jens felt some of the bladderloosening fear hed known while diverting the lizard tank so the fellow with the bazooka could stalk and kill it he remembered the gaggle of american tanks the monster had taken out and the wrecked fighting vehicles that littered the snowy plains of indiana and illinois if lots of those tanks were heading this way how was second armor supposed to stop them patton said i understand your concern dr larssen but fighting aggressively while holding the strategic defensive should let us inflict heavy losses on them and infantry teams firing antitank rockets from ambush will present a challenge they have not previously experienced i sure hope so larssen said he went on if theyre coming from chicago sir when will i be able to go into the city to find out whats become of the metallurgical laboratory and even more important whats become of barbara he thought but hed learned he was more likely to get what he wanted from patton by leaving personal concerns out of the equation as soon as we have destroyed the lizard tank forces of course patton said grandly well do to them what rommel did to the british time and again in the desert make them charge down lines of fire well already have preregistered not only that our forces farther east have gone over to the attack and are pursuing them out of chicago it should be a slaughter of whom jens wondered the lizard tanks were not the slow balky unreliable machines england used would any defenses be enough to hold them back when they wanted to go somewhere as if to underscore his concern half a mile ahead a helicopter skimmed low over the ground like a mechanized shark a rocket lanced out to obliterate an american halftrack and however many men it was carrying patton swore and started hammering away with his heavy ma worldwar in the balance chine gun the noise was overpowering like standing next to a triphammer tracers showed he was scoring hits but the tough machine ignored them then without warning something heavier than a caliber slug must have hit it it heeled awkwardly in the air patton almost shot off his drivers ear as he tried to keep a bead on it the helicopter scurried away back toward the west where the lizards still held the countryside maybe another shell found it then maybe the cumulative damage from all the bullets patton and every other american in range poured into it took a toll or maybe the lizard pilot fleeing under heavy fire just made a mistake the helicopters rotor clipped a tree the machine did a twisting somersault straight into the ground patton yelled like a madman so did jens and the jeep driver patton pounded the physicist on the back do you see dr larssen do you see he shouted theyre not invulnerable not even slightly so theyre not jens admitted lizard tanks though carried more firepower and more armor than their helicopters they might not be invulnerable but they sure had seemed close to it until that crazy bazooka thing took one out even then the rocket round hadnt wrecked it with a frontal hit but with one to the less heavily protected engine compartment yes sir larssen it wont be long before you can head into chicago as a conqueror patton boomed if youre going to do by god do it with style jens didnt care anything about style he would gladly have gone into chicago naked and in blackface if that was the only way to get there and if patton insisted on holding him away much longer hed damn well take frenave and head into town on his own why not he thought its not like in really a soldier atvar increased the magnification on the situation map the races movements appeared in red arrows those of the big uglies in rather fuzzier white ones that reflected the uncertainties of reconnaissance the fleetlord hissed in discontent i dont know whether were going to be able to extricate our forces there or not kirel peered at the situation map too this is the pocket in which the tosevites on the lesser continental map have trapped our assault units exalted fleetlord yes atvar said they have taught us a lesson here never be so concerned about the point of an attack as to neglect the flanks indeed kirel left one eye on the map turned the other toward atvar forgive me exalted fleetlord but i had not looked for you to be so ah sanguine over our misfortunes in the ah notempire called the united states harry turtledove you mistake me shiplord atvar said sharply and kirel lowered his eyes in apology atvar went on i do not enjoy seeing our brave males endangered by the big uglies under any circumstances moreover i have hope we shall still be able to get many of them out if the beastly weather would let up our aircraft ought to be able to blast an escape corridor through which we could conduct our retreat failing that the landcruisers will have to do the job landcruiser losses have been unusually heavy in this action kirel said i know that did pain atvar without those landcruisers his groundbased forces were going to have ever more trouble conducting needed operations he said the big uglies have come up with something new again so they have the disgust with which kirel freighted his words made it sound as if he were cursing the tosevites for their ingenuity the race had had plenty of cause to do that had the big uglies been less fiendishly ingenious all of tosev would long since have been incorporated into the empire atvar said as with most of their innovations we will need a certain amount of time to develop appropriate countermeasures they should be in place about the time the big uglies invent their next new weapon he thought and of course they wont work against that aloud he continued still considering how different this world is from what our probe predicted we should count ourselves lucky that weve not got our tailstumps pinched in the doorway more often as you say exalted fleetlord but kirel sounded anything but convinced atvar let his mouth fall open in case youre wondering shiplord ive not started tasting ginger i dont suffer from the insane selfconfidence the drug induces i have reason for being sanguine as you termed it observe he poked a control with a claw the situation map vanished from the screen to be replaced by images from a killercrafts gun cameras on the screen bombs arced down into drifting blowing smoke moments later fireballs and more smoke mushroomed into the sky the angle of the tape jerked sharply as the killercraft dodged through desperate tosevite efforts to shoot it down that shiplord atvar declared is a tosevite petroleum refinery going up in flames it happens to be the one that supplies deutschland but we have struck several in recent days if we continue on that pattern the embarrassments we have suffered around this town of chicago should soon fade into insignificance as the big uglies run low on fuel how massive is this destruction when compared to the overall production of the facility kirel asked worldwar in the balance atvar replayed the tape he enjoyed watching the enemys petroleum stocks going up in flames do the images not speak for themselves smoke has shrouded this ah ploesti place ever since our attack which means the big uglies have yet to suppress the blazes we started but there was smoke around the facility before kirel persisted is this not part of the tosevites ongoing camouflage efforts infrared imaging indicates otherwise atvar said some of these hot spots have remained in place since our bombs ignited them that is good news kirel admitted it is the best possible news and the story at other refineries is similar the fleetlord said they have gone down to destruction more easily even than i anticipated when i began this series of strikes against them the war for tosev may have hung in the balance up until this time but now we are tilting the balance decisively in our favor may it be so ever cautious kirel accepted nothing new until it was proved overwhelmingly the future of the race here depends on its being so the colony ships are behind us after all so they are atvar played the tape of the burning refinery yet again we shall be ready for them by the emperor he cast his eyes to the floor in reverence for his sovereign so did kirel george patton aimed the jeeps machine gun up in the air squeezed the triggers as the gun roared he tried to outyell it after a few seconds he stopped firing and turned to jens larssen he pummeled the physicist with his fists weve done it by god he bawled weve held the sons of bitches we really have havent we larssen knew he sounded more amazed thanjoyed but he couldnt help it that was how he felt paton didnt get angry nothing jens thought would have angered patton this morning he said this is the greatest victory in the war against the lizards it was also for all practical purposes the first and only victory in the war against the alien invaders but jens didnt want to cut into pattons ebullience by pointing that out now that we know it can be done and how to do it well beat them again and again if confidence had anything to do with anything patton would too he looked as if hed just stepped off a recruiting poster his chin as usual was naked of stubble his uniform clean his boots shiny he smelled of ivory soap and aftershave how he managed that right through a harddriving campaign was beyond larssen whose own face was like a wire brush whose splotched and spotted overcoat helped camouflage him and whose shoes had broken laces and no finish whatsoever patton insisted sprucedup soldiers had better morale seeing the sprucedup patton beside him only reminded jens how grubby he was himself harry turtledove but victory kicked morale harder and higher than mere cleanliness ever could larssen said its a damn shame any of the lizards broke out it is indeed patton said i console myself by remembering that perfection is an attribute belonging only to god this consolation comes easier because we closed off the breakout after the tanks punched through few foot soldiers managed to follow them he pointed to a burntout lizard tank not far away and more of their armor ended up like that larssen remembered the murdered lees and shermans in the front of the lizard tank hed helped stalk a lot of ours ended up that way too sir do you know what the ratio was about a dozen to one patton answered easily jens mouth fell open in dismay he hadnt thought the butchers bill as high as that patton held up a hand before you expostulate dr larssen let me remind you that is far and away the best ratio we have yet achieved in combat with the lizards if we can maintain it the ultimate triumph will be ours but a lizard tank had a crew of three a sherman carried five men a lee six the casualty ratio had to be even worse than the one for vehicles i know i know patton cut off his objection before it could get started we are still manufacturing tanks so far as we know the lizards cannot make good their losses the same applies to crews our pool replenishes itself while theirs does not a couple of men with technical sergeants stripes climbed onto the dead lizard tank one peered down into the turret through the open cupola he called to his companion who scrambled over to take his own look patton beamed at them and you see with every vehicle of theirs we examine we learn more about how to defeat them i tell you dr larssen we are tilting the balance in our favor i hope youre right jens decided to strike while the iron was hot since weve won this battle sir may i finally have permission to go into chicago and see whats become of the metallurgical laboratory the general frowned he looked like a poker player deciding whether to play a hand or throw it in at last he said i dont suppose i can in justice object dr larssen and no doubt your country needs your services with that project he wouldnt say what the met lab was about even with only his driver listening security jens thought patton went on i also want to thank you for the good nature with which you have borne your stay with us larssen nodded politely though there hadnt been anything goodnatured about it not from his end hed simply had to yield to superior force whining about it afterward would only have put him further into the doghouse i will provide you with an escort to take you into the city patton worldwar in the balance said lizard holdouts still infest the territory through which youll have to pass sir if its all the same to you thats an honor id really like to decline larssen said wouldnt traveling with an escort just make me a likelier target rather than safer id sooner hunt up a bicycle and go by myself you are a national resource dr larssen which in some measure gives me continued responsibility for your wellbeing patton chewed on his lower lip you may be right though who can say will you also decline help in the form of ah hunting up a bicycle and a letter of laissezpasser from tle no sir jens answered at once id be very grateful for both those things good patton smiled his wintry smile then he waved to draw the attention of some soldiers not far away they came trotting over to find out what he wanted when hed explained they grinned and scattered in all directions to do his bidding while he waited for them to return he pulled out a sheet of stationery embossed with two gold stars jens marveled that hed still have a supply of such a thing and a fountain pen shielding the paper from blowing snow with his free hand he wrote rapidly then handed the sheet to larssen will this suffice jens eyebrows rose it was more than a laissezpasser it not only ordered the military to feed him but nearly conferred on him the power to bind and to loose larssen wouldnt have cared to be a soldier who ignored it and had word of that get back to patton he folded it stuck it in a trouser pocket thank you sir thats very generous ive given you a hard time since you turned up on my doorstep i donologize for it military necessity took precedence over your needs but iwill make such amends for it as i can inside half an hour the soldiers had come up with four or five bikes for jens to choose from nobody said anything about giving back the springfield hed been issued so he kept it he swung onto a sturdy schwinn and pedaled off toward the northeast chicago he said under his breath as he rolled along but the grin he wore at being at last free of the army soon fell from his lips the country between bloomington and chicago had been fought over twice first when the lizards pushed toward lake michigan and then when they tried to break back through the ring patton and bradley had thrown around them larssen found out firsthand how ugly the aftermath of war could be the only thing hed known about pontiac illinois was that the phrase out at pontiac meant somebody was at the state penitentiary on the southern edge of town the penitentiary was a bombedout ruin now the wreckage of an american fighter plane lay just outside the prison gates harry turtledove the upright tail the only piece intact it was also probably the only cross the pilot whod been inside would ever get the rest of the town was in no better shape machinegun bullet scars pocked the sootstained walls of the county courthouse larssen almost rode over a crumpled bronze tablet lying in the street he stopped to read it it had he found been mounted on a cairn of glacial stones as a monument to the indian chief whod given pontiac its name he looked at the courthouse lawn no cairn stood only scattered and broken stones he pedaled out of town as fast as he could every so often hed hear gunfire from a distance it sounded absurdly cheerful like firecrackers on the fourth of july now that hed been on the receiving end of it though it made the hair on the back of his neck rise those little popping noises meant somebody was trying to kill someone else the next day he came to gardner a little town dominated by slag piles gardner couldnt have been lovely before war raked it coming and going it was a lot less lovely now but the stars and stripes fluttered from atop one of the piles when larssen saw soldiers moving around up there he decided to test pattons letter it worked like a charm the men fed him a big bowl of the mulligan stew they were eating gave him a slug of what he presumed to be highly unofficial whiskey to wash it down and plied him with questions about the general whose signature he flourished the squad leader a wornlooking chunky sergeant whose thinning gray hair said he was surely a first world war veteran summed up the soldiers view of patton by declaring shitfire there pal sure is fine to see somebody going forards instead o back we done went back too much his drawl was thick and rich as coffee heavily laced with chicory he seemed to go by the name mutt it cost us a lot larssen said quietly going back toward chicago wasnt what youd call cheap neither the sergeant said to which jens could only nod he got into joliet just before dark joliet had had a prison too with thick corbeled limestone walls it was just rubble it had been made into a fortress to try to halt the lizards the twisted barrel of a field gun still stuck out through a window and then bombed and shelled into oblivion jens wondered what had become of the prisoners as he had so often in his wandering through wartorn america he found a ruined empty house in which to sleep only after hed already unrolled his sleeping bag did he notice the bones scattered across the floor a cavedin skull left no doubt they were human before the lizards came he wouldnt have stayed there for a minute now he just shrugged hed seen worse than bones lately thinking again of the prisoners he made worldwar in the balance sure his springfield had a round in the chamber and the safety off when he set it beside the sleeping bag no one murdered him in the night when he woke up he flipped on the safety but left the round chambered chicago lay straight ahead he took longer to get there than hed expected the heaviest most sustained fighting had been in the suburbs right on the edge of town hed never seen devastation like that nor had to try to pick his way through it long stretches were impassable by bike he had to lug the twowheeler along with him which also made him slower afoot scavengers were out poking through the ruins some who wore army uniform were busy examining disabled lizard vehicles and aircraft to see what they could learn from them or else salvaging as much american gear from the field as they could others were in no uniform at all and plainly out for whatever they could get their hands on jens flipped the springfields safety off again once he actually got into chicago the going improved rubble still spilled onto roads but on the whole you could tell where the roads were some of the buildings had signs painted across them when shells come in this side of the street is safer a lot of shells had come in along with rubble the streets also had people in them except for soldiers jens hadnt seen so many people in a long time where thered been fighting the civilians were mostly either dead or fled many were dead or fled in chicago too but the town had had three million to start out with and a good many were left too they were skinny and ragged and dirty a lot of them had haunted eyes they didnt look like the americans larssen was used to seeing thel ooked like people youd see in a newsreel people whod been thr a war hed never expected to come across that in the united states but here it was like a kick in the teeth a girl leaned against a streetcorner lamppost her dress was too short for the chilly weather she twitched her hips at jens as he rode by no matter how long hed been celibate he kept riding her face was as hard and merciless as any combat veterans cheap bastard she yelled after him lousy fairy i hope it rots off he wondered how she treated men who actually bought from her better than that he hoped if possible the negroes in the bronzeville district looked even more miserable than the whites in the rest of town jens felt the glances he was drawing as he pedaled along but no one seemed inclined to do more than glance at a man who wore an army overcoat and carried an army rifle the apartment building where hed lived with barbara was on the edge of bronzeville he rounded the last corner used the hand brake to slide to a stop in front of a pile of bricks and tiles and broken glass that wasnt a building any more sometime after hed left it had taken a direct harry turtledove hit a couple of colored kids were pawing through the ruins one of them exclaimed in triumph over a footlong board he stuck it into a burlap bag do you know what happened to mrs larssen the white lady who used to live here jens called to the boys fear rose up in him like a choking cloud he wasnt sure he wanted the answer but both kids just shook their heads never heard of her mistuh one of them said they went back to looking for fuel larssen rode east to the university of chicago campus if he couldnt find barbara the met lab crew was the next best bet they might even know what had happened to her though bare of students the university didnt seem as badly battered as the city around it perhaps because its buildings were more widely scattered jens rode up fiftyeighth and then across the lawns in the center of campus they had been a lot more pleasant before they were pocked with bomb and shell craters off to the right swift hall was a burntout ruin god hadnt spared the universitys divinity school but eckhart hall still stood and but for broken windows looked pretty much intact worn as he was hope made jens all but sprint the bike toward the entrance he started to leave it outside then thought better of that and brought it in no use giving looters temptation they didnt need where is everybody he called down the hallway only echoes answered its after quitting time he told himself but hope flickered all the same he walked to the stairway took the steps two at a time no matter when the secretaries and such went home the met lab scientists were busy almost around the clock but the halls upstairs were empty and silent the offices and labs not only vacant but methodically stripped wherever the metallurgical laboratory was it
