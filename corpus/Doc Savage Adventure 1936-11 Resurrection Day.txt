 chapter the comin miracle it just happened that general ino was the first man who saw a truckload of policemen stop in front of the skyscraper which housed doc savages new york headqtiarters the general would have read about it in his newspaper along with the rest of the world a bit later no doubt but by seeing the truckload of policemen arrive he got in on the ground floor in a manner of speaking the general stopped to watch he was interested in what the policemen had on their truck heavy lumber posts barbed wire and a keg of staples the general had a vocational interest in policemen anyway having spent many of his waking hours as well as manv hours taken from his sleeping time in figuring out ways of keeping out of their clutches the policemen began unloading their posts timbers and barbed wire the orncer in charge gestured and called orders general inos jaw dropped in astonishment the cops were going to build a barbedwire barricade acrossone of the busiest streets in new york city general ino crowded around with some other curious people who had stopped the general was not afraid of cops not for nothing had he stayed awake nights for he could walk new york streets undisguised and practically unafraid there was a commotion at the other end of the block and another truckload of policemen and the makings of a barbedwire barricade came to a stop near the giant skyscrapers it was true that general ino had thus far operated in egypt italy japan and elsewhere places far from newyork but places where they have rich men particularly rich are the new merchant princes of japan one of them had paid a quarter of a million yen ransom for his son his only manchild more trucks were arriving it seemed that the entire block was going to be barricaded that meant the building really the building was a block square and taller than ihe length of the longest ocean liner in the world general ino had killed the japanese merchant princes manchild but the merchant prince didnt know that before the ransom was paid didnt know it yet in fact years later the general had thought he might work off some phony brat as the manchild he had kept the baby clothes of the manchild and the bit of jewelry it had worn there was quite a hullabaloo now with the policemen stopping traffic and beginning to build their barbedwire fences across the most teeming streets in a city noted for its traffic general ino had played the races that took money he had practically kept himself a harem that took more money moreover he had kept his old organization of crooks and killers intact that took the most money of all in that organization he believed he had some of the coldest slickest crooks alive the general had once added up the rewards hanging over the heads of his organization members the total had stunned him but it was an asset which he hadnt yet been able to think out a method of cashing in on for general ino was about broke all ripe for one of the fabulously big cleverly planned cunningly executed hauls which was the only kind he touched general ino walked over to the nearest policeman msieu gendarme he said could you tell me why all thees ees happen the general could fake almost any accent he loved to the cop had come from a long line of brickthrowing ancestors and his grin was big your guess is as good as mine frenchy the officer jerked a thumb upward the powers that be say fence in the streets around here so fence em in we will but m sieu some reason you ave give thees people why you not let zem pas no this is the only reason we have to give em the cop tapped his badge velly stlange said the general singsonging velly stlange the cop watched him walk off then scratched his head dang me he grunted first hes a frog then hes a laundryman the general was at that moment also much the master of evil and profitable schemes he went directly to the offices of proudman shaster proudman shaster gave his visitor a dry smile and a driedup hand then went back behind his huge desk and sat down the result was that proudman shaster about disappeared only his bulging melon of a head showed over the formidable desk proudman shasters head was all that counted anyway it was full of brains and all the ideas they hatched were bad its really a wonderful day he said really wonderful proudman shaster was a wellknown attorney and everything was usually really wonderful with him it was a small habit of speech he had si si senor said the general imitating a spaniard look i have an idea a mucho bueno idea i want it looked into proudman shaster folded his dry hands and looked as if he hadnt heard a word of it i want all of mv men assemblcd here in new york at once said general ino all of my hombres understand can do proudman shaster admitted lighting a cigarette he should have been able to d it he was inos mouth his eyes his ears even a wee bit of his brains when the occasion demanded he had furnished the acid that had disposed of the last bit of epidermis of the japanese merchant princes manchild general ino shook hands with himself chinese fashion and murmured this humble one is most proud of such a worthy servant proudman shaster looked at his finger nails found grime under one and began to clean it with a small sharp tooth who are we going to take to the cleaners now he asked doc savage general ino said proudman shaster gave a violent leap closed his eyes and seemed to stop breathing he dropped his cigarette general ino was plainly quite amused by the actions of his lieutenant not his most valuable one incidentally ino smiled picked up the cigarette stub and extinguished it in a bronze tray oh dont worry i knew youd be quite surprised he said proudman shaster went through some convulsive facial expressions water be gasped faintly and one of the pills out of the box on the water cooler general ino seemed about to laugh as if it were a good bit of acting then be peered closely at his follower he ran to the cooler got the water and pill then administered both to proudman shaster dont you know i have a weak heart were shasters first words i never expected merely mentioning a name would kill you off ino told him shaster got up shakily helped himself to more water and another pill and topped it off with a drink from a brown bottle with a black label he looked closely at his chief look here he said grimly dont you know about this doc savage general ino said it is not my habit to go into things half baked youll come out of this one with your goose cooked said proudman shaster doc savage is one of the most dangerous men in the world to meddle with a reputation murmured general ino is like a snowball doc savage is a man who was taken by his parents at birth and trained intensively and scientifically to become a catcher of crooks and a righter of wrongs explained shaster the snowball continued general ino starts off as a little ball but grows until it becomes as big as hell doc savage is a scientific genius a mental wizard and as strong as the bull of bashan snapped shaster the snowball gets big because it rolls down the hill ino reminded doc savage is not entirely human everybody almost has heard about him his business is righting wrongs aiding the oppressed and sort of putting the kibosh on crooked schemes nature put the hill there general ino pointed out every crook alive when he hears about doc savage crosses his fingers and hopes the man of bronze they call savage that sometimes will not get on his trail a little shove starts the snowball after that it grows by itself doc savage alone is bad enough groaned proudman shaster but he also has five assistants one of them i have personally seen in action he is a lawyer named brigadier general theodore marley brooks and those who are not afraid call him ham not many people call him ham as i have been saying said general ino it does not take much to make a big snowball ham almost got me disbarred once moaned shaster he is the cleverest lawyer i ever saw doc savages other aids are equally clever in their lines one is said to be an engineer another a chemist a third an archaeologist and the fourth an electrical wizard reputations are like snowballs declared ino doc savage is the master of any of his aids in his respective line incredible as it seems according to reports a big reputation can grow out of a little of nothing tno reminded shaster snapped i would rather commit suicide than tackle doc savage general ino calmly drew a revolver out of his coat pocket and laid it on the desk then youd better shoot yourself he said he pressed a small catch on one of his cuff links and it flew open a whitishlooking powder fell out on the desk top or touch your tongue to that its potassium cyanide of a newer and more lethal type proudman shaster gulped but i dont understand well we are going to tackle doc savage general ino told him doc savage is a man after my style he goes after big things and little ones too ive heard shaster put in they say he helps an infinitely greater number of people in small ways but only his big deeds find their way into the newspapers then well wait for one of his big ones said general ino i still dont understand what youre driving at shaster told him nervously did you ever see a seagull wait until a pelican had dived gotten a fish and come up breathless then the seagull would pounce in and grab the fish my acquaintance with seagulls is limited well we are going to play seagull one will get you five said proudman shaster that we all wind up inside looking out general ino chuckled he spoke like an irishman sure an thot reminds me of what brought all this to me mind he said theyre buildin a barbedwire fence around doc savages headquarters no less the afternoon newspapers had pictures of the barbedwire fence fences rather they were four in number one at each street corner and they completely blocked off for anything less than a tank ingress or egress from the cloudpiercing giant of a building one headline said mystery man makes mystery move a second read police prepare for startling event another more doc savage grandstanding the stories were about the same the police were telling nothing passes were being issued to persons employed in the skyscraper which was being fenced off newspapermen and cameramen were not getting passes there was a lot of talk about it over dinner cocktails that evening some people went down to look at the barricade and the cops had trafficjam trouble a little more of it developed the next morning the newspapers all had a paid advertisement one full page it was alike in every paper and in such plain type that some readers passed over it until they heard about it then they went back and read it most of them got the feeling that something was coming and that theyd better hold onto their hats the ad read preliminary announcement we wish to give the public some facts about doc savage although the public may already know them doc savage is clark savage jr a man who has been developed scientifically exactly as a great scientific laboratory would develop a product this scientific development has been carried on for many years and the results are amazing we personally know doc savage to possess one of the most amazing scientific minds in existence he is a wizard tomorrow doc savage will print an announcement it is an announcement that will stir the world we believe it will change the entire course of civilization lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair brigadier general theodore marley brooks major thomas j roberts william harper littlejohn colonel john renwick almost every one knew the identity of the five men who had signed the advertisement theyre doc savages five aids those who didnt know were informed of course it was now generally realized that something was coming and that was why the barbedwire barricade was being erected around doc savages skyscraper headquarters the police around the barricade had more traffic troubles chapter the miracle was real general ino absorbed the morning papers and his coffeeandspotofbrandy simultaneously then he descended to proudman shasters offices proudman shaster was just signing on the dotted line for a bustling young man who looked general ino over hopefully before he was shooed out what have you been doing general ino wanted to know taking out more insurance groaned proudman shaster insurance is a really wonderful thing really wonderful theres a lot of really wonderful things in this said general ino uncle sam makes a lot of them and calls them dollars by the way what of the worthy gentlemen i call my colleagues proudman shaster sighed and put away his new insurance policy i have been in touch with them all yes and they are assembling they will be together in three different hotels at four oclock this afternoon awaiting your visit general ino had long ago stopped assembling his mob all in one body where if things went wrong every one would be nabbed at once by the police good skilled unscrupulous followers were too difficult to obtain to take such chances of losing them good said general ino ill tell them we are going to tackle this doc savage i believe i have picked an excellent time have you seen the late newspapers i have shaster admitted nervously doc savage is getting ready to break something big he has never done a thing like this before shaster said gloomily always he has shunned publicity any one wanting his help goes to him but now he seems to be coming out to the public for some reason or other its big ill agree chuckled general ino and we need something big to line our pocketbooks its so big well choke on it ill bet groaned shaster general ino eyed him narrowly shaky eh i believe ill give my men the choice of going up against this doc savage with me or of not going thatll insure me of having men who are not afraid itll insure you of having no men at all proudman shaster predicted gloomily general ino considered on second thought i wont give them their choice he decided proudman shaster wailed i wish i knew what this doc savage is up to a lot of others had proudman shasters idea nobody seemed to really have a gnats notion of what it was all about the newspapers afternoon editions didnt help any with their second paid ad a second preliminary announcement we having faith in doc savages scientific genius and knowing him as few we really believe none others know him wish to pave the way for what is coming with some more facts for years doc savage has been experimenting along a certain scientific line doc savage in fact has been trying to accomplish something that magicians and fakirs and charlatans have from time immemorial been trying to make people think they could do this thing can be done some day some one will do it that day has come doc savage can now do it but he can do it only once just once and he wants that once to do the world as much good as possible so he is going to ask the aid of the united states public but we will let the details remain for doc savage himself to explain doc savage will speak over the radio at oclock tonight it was signed by the same five men who had signed the previous advertisement quite a few radios which were out of order were hurriedly repaired that afternoon statistically minded persons who figured it up decided doc savage had spent all of a quarter of a million dollars in advertising every newspaper daily in the country had carried the announcements the radio proclamation study of any radio column revealed was to be a really nationwide network every single radio station broadcasting in the united states was on the hookup and those who knew radio knew it had taken plenty of money to swing that but every one knew that doc savage had and had had for years some secret source of fabulous wealth a pin dropping would have sounded like a gunshot on the ether waves of the nation at seven oclock that night doc savage came on the air without any trace of a preliminary announcement nobody was confused nobody thought for an instant that any one except doc savage was speaking and yet doc savage had never before spoken over the radio on a national hookup there was something about the voice it was controlled modulated deep and it somehow conveyed the impression that it was a voice which could do some amazing things and that its owner was an individual who could do even more amazing things anyway doc savages first thirteen words knocked the breath out of his listeners it is in my power to bring a dead man back to life he said then he waited for that to soak in only one man can be brought back to life he went on that is because the process requires the use of a new element in a combination which takes at least ten years to develop you all know how the juice of an apple must he allowed to ferment before it becomes vinegar it is the same with this element combination except that the time process covers years another pause for it to be absorbed it does not matter how long the dead man has been dead the remarkable voice of doc savage continued the body must be intact or the mummy of it intact again a pause now so much for the statement of what can be done here is the real reason for all of the display behind this here is why we have gone to so much trouble to get the public attention of the country we want help we want suggestions in short we want to know who the people of the united states want brought back to life the ether was remarkably quiet all over the nation strangely it happened that there was practically no static so almost every listener got a perfect reception from his set who will do the world the most good if brought back to life these are the names of the committee of men and women who have been appointed to make the final decision they will want your instructions mail telephone or telegraph them to the committee members there followed a list of names and addresses given slowly and strangely enough given in some uncanny fashion so that even the listeners with poor memories had no trouble remembering at least one or two of the names the newspapers commented on this the next day but none of them hit on the truth doc savage had developed a teaching technique the ability to tell a thing so that it was not forgotten it was simply in the manner in which the words were delivered the dramatic emphasis put on them an announcer came on the air and said that was doc savage speaking he nearly scared his listeners out of their skins the announcer had always been credited with a pleasant excellent voice but now after that remarkable voice which had just finished speaking he sounded like a crow dying of course there was excitement talk at least every one had probably at some time or other dreamed what a great thing it would be to bring a dead person back to life so the thing caught the popular fancy the following day was a holiday sunday so every one had plenty of time to talk about it a number of hastily arranged sermons were preached on the subject they were remarkably enough favorable let doc savage go ahead if he could was their consensus there was not much talk about mere man keeping his hands off the celestial arrangement of things telephone operators telegraphers and mailmen had no time to think or talk though the suggestions were already pouring in the judges had a phalanx of secretaries classifying the suggestions and numbering them the following day monday newspapers printed everything they could find about doc savage for the first time in his history doc savage permitted some facts about himself to get out mainly they had to do with his scientific training and there was enough data to convince even the most skeptical that doc savage was little short of an inventive wizard he had perfected it seemed innumerable scientific and surgical discoveries about which the public had no idea of the inventor the skeptics and there were a number dug up plenty of proof that all this was the truth the suggestions from the public continued to pour in there were all kinds as to the man to be brought back to life they wanted the sublime and the ridiculous names advanced ranged from napoleon to lincoln to a grieving neighbor womans dead little daughter innumerable parents wanted departed children resurrected and living children wanted parents back these latter pleas were sincere moving and often came in on tearstained stationery on a number of occasions the secretaries doing the classifying were found sobbing as the result of some particularly heartstirring appeal the general effect was to bring home the undeniable fact that death is one of the profound things of life and that the power of resurrection by science or by a miracle was a thing of fabulous possibilities in the bringing of joy to a bereaved one to say nothing of the feelings of the deceased who might or might not he snatched out of a place where he or she didnt care to be one anonymous suggestor wanted lucrezia borgia brought back so she could administer poison to the current crop of politicians the thing grew every day and it was not to use an old dutch expression all beer and skittles for doc savage and his idea and plan there is probably no such thing as getting the press of the united states all in accord about one thing and this was no exception while one newspaper would sing doc savages praises in print another would demand that he be drawn quartered and hung out for inspection so the public could see just what kind of a mechanism he was that be should get the country so stirred up over something he couldnt obviously accomplish he was a fakir thats what a humbug an overrated publicity snatcher the name and the fame as it were of doc savage were growing of course his picture was in all the newspapers and commentators on the radio discussed him some reverently some with the sharp scalpels of ridiculing disbelief the comedians on the stage began to crack their bum jokes and those on the radio worse ones naturally it all took a few days the barbedwire fences around doc savages skyscraper offices proved a wise precaution because most of new york city took turns at trying to pay the place a visit newspapermen writers photogra phers and cranks and quacks and wise guys of every descrip tion were turned away doc savage was in seclusion on the eightysixth floor of the skyscraper communication with the public was handled by two of doc savages aids commonly called monk and ham monk was practically as broad as he was tall he had no forehead to speak of enough mouth for several men and with only a little more stubby red hair his skin would have made a fair apeskin rug his full name was lieutenant colonel andrew blodgett mayfair and he had a pet pig named habeas corpus which was as funny a hog as monk was a human monk was also one of the worlds leading chemists ham was brigadier general theodore marley brooks and harvard acclaimed him as its greatest lawschool graduate and the rest of the world admitted that might be right that part of the world interested in snappy clothes admitted also that ham was the best dressed man in new york if not in the united states ham not only admitted the distinction he claimed it and was practically willing to use his innocentlooking black cane in reality a sword cane with the tip chemically treated so that a prick produced quick unconsciousness on any one willing to argue the point ham also had a pet chemistry chemistry had been named after monks profession that was to aggravate monk chemistry by himself also aggravated monk because chemistry was a runt edition of some kind of an ape and he was what they call in the missouri hills just about a spittin image of monk these four monk ham habeas corpus chemistry got along as far as the outside world could see in an alarming way it seemed only a question of time until they ate each other up a newspaper reporter asked questions through the barbedwire fence tell me one thing you two doc savage has always dodged publicity now hes handing it out by the barrel why monk said its this way doc can bring a guy to life and a guy said the newsman dryly the women of the country wili like that why not bring a woman to life doc aint never gone for the fems monk grinned that end is my specialty ham put in crisply whoever the committee selects will be brought back to life it will be necessary for the country to have faith in doc savage and his scientific wizardry or some people will think the thing is a fake the person brought back to life is to be one who will do it is hoped infinite good for mankind that person will have to have the confidence of the public the public will have to believe the individual is the real geniline original article who has been brought back to life otherwise it will be impossible to accomplish what we hope for in other words we are bringing a great person back to this troubleridden world to aid humanity and humanity must believe in him to be aided monk put in about half the suggestions coming to the judges are to bring jesus of nazareth back to life that illustrates the point if we tried to make the public think we were going to produce christ theyd know we were fakes because even doc savages assistance would hardly be necessary there this thing is dead on the level and one man and only one can be brought back to life it might be a woman the judges will tell were trying to make the american public understand that doc savage can do this thing incredible as well admit it sounds doc savage has spent a period of years perfecting the method ham said the judges monk repeated will select the subject to be resurrected by modern science chapter schemes senator gustall moab funston was one of the judges the judges met in washington in the senate office building using the suite of senator funston it was a night session it was supposed to be secret but the corridors outside crawled with newspapermen the janitors next morning were to cart out barrels of uised photographic flashlight bulbs the door opened about two oclock in the morning and the judges filed out sorry gentlemen senator funston told the besieging newshawks the announcement of the individual to be brought back to life will be made one week from today but why not now that date was the one decided upon to make the announcement but why senator funston didnt reply to that because he couldnt think of a really good answer they had just done it that way for no good reason except that announcements generally had a date is the one to be brought back to life an inventor im sorry i will not answer that theres a report you selected thomas a edison senator funston kept his silence is it a woman im sorry gentlemen is it george washington silence abraham lincoln more silence rudolph valentino even more silence how about the sphinx a newspaper writer asked dryly senator funston gave them the big hearty laugh he had perfected for use on his constituents permitted himself to be photographed both with and without his fivegallon hat he was a senator from wyoming and then excused himself and went home instead of staying at a hotel senator funston occupied all alone an apartment on southwest delaware avenue a negro woman came in did the cooking and went home in the evenings usually about nine named orchid jones she had been recently hired senator funston came in took his key out of the lock put it into his pocket then looked in surprise at the dark mound of shadow in the chair by the window why orchid he said why havent you gone home yet it aint orchid said the shadowy form but its liable to be lilies if you dont cobperate the voice sounded like a bulldog with a bone when another bulldog comes close so senator funston put his hands up beside his big hat and stood where he was for the moment my nocturnal fellow you are lucky he said heavily i carry as a habit a goodly bit of money with me always you are not welcome to it but it is in a chamois money belt around my waist how much asked the shadowy other twelve hundred dollars poultry provender said the other keep it senator funston tried to wet his lips but his tongue was as dry as a rope for this was not so good moreover he had caught sight of the weapon his murky visitor was holding and he didnt like the looks of it to all appearances it was some kind of a water pistol the liquid in this thing the visitor moved the water pistol slightly will kill you instantly it throws a liquid gas sometimes used in warfare the muzzle aperture is closed by a tiny bit of wax but when i press the discharge slide or trigger he left it unfinished what do you want the answer to a question said the other senator funston an observing solon had perceived by now that the unwelcome person wore a darkblue suit little different from thousands of others being worn in washington that night the face was completely encased in a remarkably black and enveloping mask while black gloves were on the hands ahem coughed senator funston lets have it the name of the man or woman doc savage is going to bring back to life nothing doing im not fooling neither am i then were wasting our time talking the masked man stood up calmly extended his water pistol and it was instantly evident he was going to shoot or squirt wait croaked senator funston im a fool to resist you of course theres a slip in my pocket a slip of paper bearing a name the masked man came over and got it he was not as tall nor as burly as senator funston and at close range he smelled a little like a flower shop he looked at the paper ill be damned he said turn around and let me tie your hands behind you senator funston turned around the other man hit him on the head with a blackjack stepped over his senseless body and walked out into the kitchen the negro woman orchid was there bound and gagged the masked man walked on out he met lawyer proudman shaster on a nearby street and got into the limousine with him he had by now removed his mask revealing his face it was general ino do any good proudman shaster asked him were all set said ino youre not overlooking any bets the shyster lawyer asked uneasily not a bet what was the name general ino produced the slip he had taken from senator funston and let proudman shaster read the name on it thomas jefferson the great democrat exclaimed proudman shaster senator funston revived with a series of lusty groans rolled over several times got up stumbled to his suitcase and got a big singleaction sixshooter after which he went looking for his visitor a policeman found him wandering up and down delaware avenue with the gun and almost threw him into jail after which senator funston stamped back to his apartment into the kitchen for a drink and found the poor negro maid orchid when she was untied orchid said things that convinced senator funston that the lady of complexion had either been a truck driver or married to some one who was the masked man it seemed had simply walked in early in the evening tied orchid up then waited senator funston went to a telephone and called doc savage longdistance in new york city when the remarkable voice of the bronze man answered the senator explained what had happened but i was too slick for them he said then he turned his head and directed quit that cussing orchid orchid was draped on a couch near the telephone saying blistering things in a low tone the negro maid became quiet under the wintry eye of the senator senator funston told doc savage there was a slip of paper in my pocket bearing the name of the individual whom i as a good and loyal party democrat consider the greatest man mortal man who ever lived that of course was thomas jefferson founder of the democratic party i gather said doc savage that he was not the one chosen correct the chosen name will not be announced until the date named the resurrected man will not be thomas jefferson i was outvoted thank you for this information doc savage said quietly thats all right said senator funston i guess you know more about what it might mean and what to do about it than i do that ended the conversation when senator funston had hung up orchid jones got up off the couch pulled a revolver out of a voluminous dress bosom and started to point it at the solon only started for senator funston was still mad and the instant he saw the gun he gave a wrathful leap and the next instant there was a fight funston started a haymaker it missed a fist hit him in the eye another mashed his nose another or the same one loosened teeth the senator snorted blood teeth and cowcountry profanity he got hold of orchid cloth tore garments gave came away they proved to be padding hell roared funston you aint a female chairs upset fists smacked the men groaned hissed cursed clawing funston got more of orchids clothing a white man funston gritted damn my soul ive been took in he was going to be taken again too the white foe was too much for him younger more skill more strength the old senator who had dieted too long on cigars beer and speeches went down orchids gun got in his eye whom has the committee selected for the resurrection orchid asked uglyvoiced senator funston was student enough of human nature to know when he saw threatened death and he saw it now he gave a name a oneword name orchid seemed surprised who suggested that name orchid demanded well it was submitted by doc savages aid the eminent archaeologist and geologist william harper littlejohn yeah said orchid thoughtfully i dont know for a minute i thought doc savage might have a smell of our plan i wish said senator funston that i had never heard of this thing you would have been better off orchid agreed orchid then used all six bullets from his revolver to splash the brains of senator funston thoroughly over the rug chapter carson alexander olman orchid jones now did something that cost a great many persons their lives in the course of time the thing was done in an effort to save his own neck he simply attempted to cover up all clues by going over the place thoroughly for finger prints using a towel and a bottle of rubbing alcohol out of the senatorial bathroom the finger prints were not many for orchid had worn rubber gloves while washing dishes and cooking and cotton ones while dusting and making the bed a circumstance to which senator funston had failed to attach enough importance orchid listened from time to time but no sounds indicated any one coming he was not worrying too much about being discovered he had a henchman outside to keep a lookout the murderer satisfied that any clues were removed to the last degree left the apartment joined his confederate in the street and they drove away it was then that orchid jones observed his hands but he did not realize he was looking at what was the equivalent of a death warrant for many people he merely noted that the alcohol he had used to remove the finger prints had dissolved some of the unusually good black stain with which he had given himself a negros complexion twenty minutes later orchid jones walked into a hotel room where general ino sat giving proudman shaster a gem of oriental philosophy which he had composed himself on the spur of the moment the success of a careful planner looks like the success of a damn fool to an outsider who doesnt know ino stopped and eyed orchid jones well dark flower what is wrong i had to kill the damn senator said orchid knowing you ill bet you did not said general ino but what were the circumstances the windbag tricked us you dont say who ever heard of a senator being tricky they aint bringing thomas jefferson back to life growled orchid jones no general ino made the one word sound like an inquiry and he had become suddenly serious i thought itd be thomas a fdison said orchid edison was my guess see but i was wrong not an impossible circumstance general ino reminded dryly but you can spare us the drama ino frowned and waited orchid whispered the name which had been yielded by poor senator funston the name gave general ino a shock he was silent for moments ive heard proudman shaster put in uneasily that savage does not miss many bets ham the other lawyer who was one of doc savages aids held about the same ideas of doc savages habit of passing up no bets a big plane slammed over washington with a volleying sound coming from the direction of new york and ham sat in a comfortable seat in the plane and carefully daubed the tip of his sword cane with a fresh supply of the sticky chemical which produced harmless unconsciousness a very few moments after it got into an open wound listen pitiful and stupid ham said were here in washington in such a hurry because that attempt to get the name from senator funston means somebody is up to something and doc wants to look into it youre so bright you cant see nothin but your own glitter monk complained in his small childlike voice dontcha think i know why were here major thomas j roberts better known as long tom sat opposite monk he was a thin pale man who would have been eyed speculatively by any undertaker despite his unhealthy appearance no one could recall his ever having been ill he was an electrical wizard and one of doc savages aids the name long tom had been earned long ago after he had staged a hectic experience with one of those oldfashioned cannons known as a long tom you two have become pickled in your own bile long tom told monk and ham doc savage was flying the plane he slanted it down upon the airport just across the potomac two airport attendants sauntered out one finishing off a sandwich the other picking his teeth they looked at who was getting out of the plane and the one nearly choked on what was left of the sandwich doc savage yeah agreed the other id recognize him anywhere the taxi driver recognized him so did two policemen one of whom was standing on the traffic circle below the capitol building which you pass before you turn to get on delaware avenue they went into senator funstons apartment house and got no answer to their ring the door lock delayed doc savage about half a minute which was long for him and they went in and looked at the senators corpse they had hardly glanced at the body the first time when a strange and fantastic sound came into existence a trilling with a quality that defied description so low that at times its existence seemed more imagination than actuality it rose and fell definitely musical without having a tune it was exotic it might have been the result of a small wind in a naked sleetladen forest this fantastic sound was made without conscious effort by the giant bronze man who was the fourth of the planes party the physical development of this bronze man was striking not alone because he was a giant with herculean muscles but because his development was so symmetrical that his true size was apparent only when he stood close to others to whom his proportions might be compared his skin had a fine texture and a bronze hue that must have come from countless tropical suns his features were regular but not what could be called finely chiseled and the result was a striking handsomeness but the bronze giants eyes were the most unusual thing about him like pools of flake gold stirred away by tiny invisible winds the eyes had something almost weird about them they seemed to have a power to compel to do supernatural things there were many unusual qualities in this bronze giant who was doc savage monk the chemist said well heres my chance to try out my new finger print stuff he was carrying it with him a small case containing what looked like a flat perfume atomizer he pressed the bulb of this and threw an almost invisible spray over the telephone the backs of wooden chairs the table and anywhere else that hands might have touched wherever the vapor settled finger prints came out instantly the prints were as plain as if they had been painstakingly printed there monk looked at doc savage by george you were right about me mixing this junk up wrong doc the suggestion you gave me made an improvement they began to go over the prints doc savage employing a small pocket magnifier senator funston apparently had no visitors at all at his apartment the bronze man said quietly at last there are no prints around except the senators eventually the bronze giant picked up the towel and the bottle of rubbing alcohol with which orchid jones had wiped off his finger prints there was some one here when the senator telephoned me doc said he spoke to the person his exact words being quit that cussing orchid ham you see the apartment superintendent and ask about orchid the dapper lawyer did not take long to report back orchid was orchid jones the cook ham stated doc savages flake gold eyes seemed occupied by the towel he was holding negro black as monks conscience ham admitted doc glanced at monk and the homely chemist at once declared hams a liar as usual my conscience is as pure and white as as doc said have you got your pocket laboratory with you ive got some key chemicals monk said i always carry em stuff you can make a lot of basic tests and combinations and let me have them a moment monk passed them over doc made several simple chemical tests on dark areas of the towel these were hardly smears more like sections where the linen had darkened all right he said we will leave now but the killer ham demanded theres no clue and we can hardly pass this killing up on the contrary doc corrected there is a very definite clue it should lead us directly to orchid jones orchid jones was not afraid he leaned back lolling a cigar around with his tongue he dearly loved cigars and playing the part of orchid jones had not permitted him to smoke them he angrily threw down a washrag with which he had endeavored to make some imprint on the dye on his face and hands the rag smelled of alcohol no dice he complained i thought alcohol would take the stuff off but it only gets a little of it at first then it dont do any more good general ino looked vaguely interested what made you think alcohol would help some of it came off on the towel when i was wiping off my finger prints in the senators apartment orchid explained i see wheres the towel left it it wasnt stained enough that anybodyll notice i see general ino got up and went into another room when he came back he was holding a small packet in his hands and a slip of paper listen he said i told you the only thing that will take that stain off is a certain combination of three rather unusual chemicals you can purchase them at a chemical supply house there is surely one in washington he handed over the slip of paper the names of the chemicals are written on that he said orchid jones looked at them frowned while his lips made futile twistings trying to pronounce the chemical terms then he said you mix one part of each and add enough water to make a paste eh right general ino leaned forward now heres something else i want to talk about orchid put away the paper with the chemical names let fly general ino unwrapped his package you see this he held up a tiny jar of something that might have been a salve the jar had no label what is it orchid asked you take it and put some under your finger nails said general ino not answering the question directly when they catch you if they do you do something that looks perfectly natural you gnaw your finger nails orchid wet his lips and looked as if he didnt like the idea much i gnaw my finger nails eh the stuff under them will make you unconscious for about a week explained general ino they cant question you and by that time well have things straightened out i see orchid said uneasily general ino stood erect everthing bane sat he observed sounding something like a scandinavian aye tank aye ban go home he did orchid jones slept well the rest of the night he had been one of general inos men for years and he knew the general was about as smooth an article as lived or at least as followed criminal ways came nine oclock and orchid jones turned up at the towns leading drug house to ask for the chemicals on his list there was a delay of perhaps ten minutes while the order was filled because it was explained these chemicals were a bit rare and would have to be gotten out of stock orchid jones was dressed as a negro he got his chemicals paid for them walked out of the door and two men came alongside of him and grasped him by the elbows orchid looked at the men and nearly had heart failure one of the men was squat and hairy the other slender and very dapperly clad orchid knew they were doc savages two aids monk and ham he tried to get out his gun they hit him on the head and while he was stunned took his gun away from him they got orchid into a curtained car pretty soft monk said orchid jones has changed his sex but that didnt make no difference orchid swallowed several times and managed to get his heart back somewhere near where it belonged he had not been so scared since he was a small kid and had been caught stealing a revolver hhowd you find me he gulped doc analyzed the stuff on the towel and learned the dye on your skin was a type which had to be removed by a certain mixture of chemicals monk informed him all we did was check on all the drug concerns around here to see who had bought that combination of chemicals nobody had so we waited for somebody to buy em all the drug concerns were to notify us when they telephoned about you we zipped right over orchid jones was silent and looked at his hands the stuff under his finger nails looked as innocent as traces of grime what you gonna do with me he asked nothing monk said but ask you some questions i mean maybe we wont do nothing to you if you answer the questions orchid jones glanced furtively at his captors and read that they meant what they said and that he was in a very bad jam he looked at his finger nails again he began gnawing his finger nails he took only a couple of gnaws and he began to shake a vilelooking foam came to his lips he shook more violently his eyes popped he made some gargling noises a horrible look got into his eyes and showed that orchid jones understood what was happening to him argawrgr he said and it was no more understandable than that what the heck exploded monk orchid jones continued to make noises that he hoped were words but among the words only a name was understandable carson alexander olman was the name orchid jones stopped shaking and frothing after a time monk examined him when the homely chemist looked up from his examination he wore an expression both startled and disgusted orchid jones said monk is as dead as he can be chapter master plotter it took doc savage less than two minutes to find the cause of orchid joness death the poison under the finger nails there is no hope of reviving him the bronze man said monk muttered i dont believe the fellow knew he was takin poison im sure of it dapper ham snapped he did a lot of muttering a dying statement as he passed out any words understandable ham said three of them had been and gave the name carson alexander olman doc savage repeated quietly well our best bet ill be superamalgamated put in a new voice the speaker was very tall and so thin that it made a person ache to look at him he had a high forehead the aesthetic face of a thinker and it was a bet whether or not when he started to walk his clothing would fall off from his lapel dangled a ribbon and to the end of this was attached a monocle with a thick lens ill be superamalgamated said this person my acquaintanceship congenerates a consimilarity of nomenclature the user of the words was william harper littlejohn oftener known as johnny a worldfamed archaologist and geologist and a man who never used a small word where he could think of a big one johnny was another of docs aids monk looked dizzy and said will somebody please translate that for me johnny means doc suggested that the only carson alexander olman he knows is a rather wellknown archaeologist by that name a supereminent whoa monk said them words is too much for me before breakfast try little ones please carson alexander olman is well known in his field said johnny reluctantly pale feeblelooking long tom the electrical wizard who had been in the background saying little now spoke up what id like to know is why all this trouble he growled cant we try to bring a person back to life somebody who will really do this lopsided world some good without a lot of trouble coming to camp on our ears monk snorted youd waste away if you didnt have any excitementi ham eyed long toms pale thinness speculatively id like to know how he could waste away any more long tom sniffed are we going to look up this carson alexander olman we are doc savage said we will telephone him longdistance now then if we cannot get any satisfaction we will have renny the member of our organization who is still in new york look into the matter doc savage went to the telephone and asked the longdistance operator for the home of archaeologist carson alexander olman in new york city in the home of carson alexander olman the telephone rang in regularly spaced jangles for a long time and was not answered although there was one man in the house who could have answered it this man was bending over olmans filing cabinet where all the archaeologists personal correspondence was kept the room was gloomy and the man wore a raincoat collar turned up and a hat with the brim yanked down all around big hornrimmed spectacles otherwise made the real lines of the mans face hard to distinguish carson alexander olman had inherited great wealth from an old pirate of an industrialist father but he had always been a man of very systematic methods it was this trait which had made him a leader in his field with one of the greatest private museums in existence he carried system into his personal life for instance every scrap of his correspondence for years past was carefully filed in the cabinets beside his desk the furtive man was going through that correspondence he was concentrating on the file marked foreign time after time he removed a paper and stowed it into an inside coat pocket outside it rained steadily water stood on the walks streamed off roofs and ran furiously in gutters inside the telephone rang on carson alexander olman did not answer it because his body lay on the floor beside the desk his head was over cooking against a hot radiator the head had left quite a crimson trail rolling across the carpet and the sword which had parted it from the body lay beside the body it was a big twohanded sword of the sixteenth century english the searcher seemed to be about done he went back over the file once more rapidly checking to see that there had been no mistake then he went to the door pulled his collar higher and went out his trouser legs from the knees down got wet in the rain before he reached the sedan parked near by and got into the rear where general ino sat the car moved away making sounds somewhat like a dog swimming hard well mine fran queried general ino imitating an east side new yorker the prowler turned his coat collar down from his face the very pale face of lawyer proudman shaster i got everything he shuddered it was horrible his head against the radiator and i couldnt bear to move it the smell he shook as if he were out in the cold rain vy dont you try for to be calm suggested general ino proudman shaster shook harder gulped im a hell of a crook to get so scared but i cant help it its the crooks who dont get scared who get caught ino assured him lets see what youve got proudman shaster passed the papers over and general ino when he had read them seemed satisfied this was all all im sure of that not a trace of this matter remains in carson alexander olmans correspondence files no one by searching the effects of the dead man will be able to learn that a gentleman named sir rodney dillsworth is selling a certain article to olman the general mused exactly verrry verrry goot murmured general ino in vun hour no less you find yourself mit some other gentlemens on a lot of vater a lot of vater proved to be the atlantic ocean and the other gentlemen proved to be a group of six lads who were as choice a lot of throat cutters as general ino had in his organization proudman shaster somewhat the gentleman although he had lopped off one head with a sword that night had been a bit uneasy about the social status of the six who were to aid him and whom he had never before seen he realized immediately when they introduced themselves this did not take place until the liner was two days out that the six were figuratively speaking wolves in sheeps clothing gentlemen yes indeed outwardly the liner docked in southampton on tuesday on wednesday the dignified british isle had a murder sir rodney dillsworths butler was walking past his masters study when he noted the cat licking at something red that was crawling out from under the door sir rodney was in his study with his head cut off an oldtime battleax had done the work sir rodney had been rather a bit of an archaeologist and most of his manse was a museum containing innumerable relics including the battleax scotland yard was called in and there was a hubbub proudman shaster sat at ease in a london hotel and advised his associates its not the first job weve pulled in england in our time so dont get worried general ino planned all this out and were operating exactly according to plan nothing will go wrong the other men sat around and looked bilious and uneasy and it was not alone because the heavy local food had given them indigestion proudman shaster fingered a pile of papers they were receipts invoices such papers as a man might have after he had bought something in a foreign country and had it shipped to his home then sold it to a man named carson alexander olman in the united states city of new york sir rodney had already shipped the darn thing to olman grumbled proudman shaster well have to take the same steamer and grab it one consolation theres nothing whatever to show that sir rodney ever owned this thing or who he sold it to them two killings might not have been necessary to cover our tracks one of the mob suggested general ino never takes a chance advised shaster our next move is to get hold of this thing before it is delivered in new york youre sure its the right one yes positive proudman shaster tapped the papers the name is given here peydehehghan peydehehghan thats the name the man shuddered whatll it he in an ironbound box proudman shaster said the ironbound box was about four feet high the same width and twice as long it left england on the freighter boisterour and somewhere between there and new york city it apparantly vanished but no one noticed the vanishing the name disappeared from the freight lists as completely as the box did from the hold there was nothing on paper to show it had ever been aboard anyway everybody aboard was excited over something else the third mate he was in charge of the cargo holds was found dead he was a tough guy had a lot of enemies so his demise surprised nobody but the manner of it did the third mate was found with his head cut off and a fireax sticking in the stump proudman shaster told general ino its horrible i think im going to have a nervous breakdown quien sabe murmured the general speaking spanish they cannot talk with their heads off the mate discovered you moving peydehehghan eh proudman shaster wrung his hands i wish i could control myself when i get in a tight place it seems all i can think of is cutting their heads off they were in a small warehouse in a discreet part of jersey general ino walked back and looked at the big ironstrapped box which his truck had just unloaded rather the truck was hired and the driver was one of his men how did you get it off the freighter he asked i lowered it into the launch alongside after night proudman shaster explained we talked to the lookout and one man was on the bridge to hold his attention while the box was hoisted overside you didnt drop it in the water the general demanded anxiously oh no we were very careful and we will continue being careful general ino eyed the big box which contained peydehehghan and sighed rapturously we are all set to cash in on one of the biggest things in history doc savages resurrection stunt chapter wisdom regardless of whether or not it was one of the biggest things in history the united states was going for it in a big way skeptics had about disappeared as the day of the final announcement drew close and this was probably due in large to the astute publicity campaign which doc savage and his aids had conducted as the bronze man had explained in order for the person they were going to bring back to life to do real good in the world the world would have to believe him genuine and that meant believing that doc savage could actually bring one man back to life if the selection was george washington every one would naturally have to believe it was george people would not be likely to take orders from a fellow they considered a fake george more than likely they would have him thrown in jail the day before the announcement the newspapers carried in paid advertising doc savage to announce over radio at oclock at seven oclock they stopped the street cars so people could get off and listen to the radios in the corner drug stores every one knew doc savages remarkable trained voice by now doc savage said many are going to be disappointed and more surprised by the name selected by the committee here are some of the reasons why certain names were passed over napoleon bonaparte suggested by many was not selected because he was primarily a warrior and this poor world has enough of those now william shakespeare was passed over because it will take more than a writer and dramatist to do this world lasting good george washington abraham lincoln and thomas a edison were prominently discussed of these three the field was narrowed down to edison the great inventor whose value to mankind perhaps will not be fully recognized for another hundred years there was a rather long pause and any number of persons reached over hastily and tested to see if they could still bear a station hiss thinking their radios had gone haywire edison is a man of inventions he stands for material progress for the introduction of new machinery another pause but it is doubtful if more scientific progress will help the world doc savage continued what we want is a great thinker not a man of profound mathematical propoundings such as einstein but a man who can keep his head and think out the right and wrong way of doing things the pauses came just often enough to permit what was being said to soak into the minds of the listening public the judges went back into history for their man doc savage said the name which they finally decided upon is that of an ancient whose mortal remains were recently found and positively identified there is absolutely no doubt but that the body of this individual or his mummy is available so that man will be brought back to life once more a pause the world does not need inventions another moment of silence it needs profound wisdom the final pause and solomon is the man to be resurrected said doc savage and went off the air for the next hour or so the nation sat around with a doubtful look and talked solomon almost no one knew whether solomons body was available and even if it was it would have to be intact and that after the passing of many centuries was not exactly reasonable to believe but the extra editions of the papers enlightened everybody it seemed that solomons mummy had been found not many weeks before the find had been made by an eminent group of archaeologists included among whom was doc savages aid william harper littlejohn there had been no fanfare in print over the discovery and nobody had been invited in to make news reels the gentlemen who had found solomons mummy did not need money or publicity hence the affair had been quiet solomons mummy was available there was not the slightest doubt about it the archaeologists had identified it positively and they were too eminent for their words to be doubted solomon it seemed was lying in state in the private museum of william harper littlejohn general ino read this and smiled a thin smile we are now ready to function further he said the mummy of solomon is to be taken to doc savages laboratory at ten oclock tomorrow morning we shall be on hand you have a really wonderful mind of its kind proudman shaster said nervously really wonderful but it strikes me you have waited too long we have known for days thanks to your spies where solomons mummy was lying why havent we acted before he who eats his fish hastily is most apt to choke on a bone general ino murmured singsonging in chinese fashion yeah said proudman shaster and its a fact that the kind of fish who play with the bait and take it slowly usually got hooked in the stomach velly tlue agreed ino thats one thing i like about you proudman my sweet you always think of the worst things that could happen its a very good trait shaster sighed nervously so we put on your next act at william harper littlejohns private museum si si said general ino we do william harper littlejohns private museum had been practically unknown but there were at least ten thousand people in the block in front of it before daylight the next morning the police took one look and decided the hearse that would come for solomons remains would need a police escort a motorcycle squad was ordered to be on hand and to wait for the hearse at eight oclock a hearse drove up to the waiting motorcycle squad well were ready to go get him said the driver i wonder if solomon isnt going to miss his thousand wives a cop called out if i was him chuckled the hearse driver i would the police motorcycle squad roared into formation and acted as a convoy for the hearse guiding it through the mob toward the building which held johnnys museum the building matched william harper littlejohn in architecture it was taller and thinner than it seemed any building could be and still not upset the museum was near the figurative waistline of the thin building and the hearse driver and his assistant both nicelooking men staggered in under the weight of a wicker basket holding the mummy the elevators were barely large enough to accommodate the length of the basket on the way up half a dozen other nicelooking men got into the cage they all got out on the museum floor and walked to a door johnny looked tall and thin enough to fit into the crack of the door which he opened a few inches at their knock weve come for solomon one of the men said johnny said ill be superamalgamated he inade a half gesture at bringing the monocle to his eye an empty move because he hadnt needed it for years and nowadays it was a highpowered magnifier youre not the men who were to come he snapped forgetting himself and using small words monk and ham were to come youre a bunch of fakes this aint a fake the spokesman said and showed johnny the business end of the biggest sixshooter he remembered having seen recently open up long and lean johnny tried to slam the door in the face of the leader the gunman lunged at it johnny who was not weighty was bowled across the room the door flew open the men dived insideand into a human tornado another man had been in the room he was a very big fellow distinguished by a long gloomy face and fists of stunning size the big fists were swinging and he fell upon the men as if the gun the leader carried meant nothing at all this was renny or colonel john renwick his arms were enormous in keeping with the rest of his huge body which tipped the scales close to two hundred and fifty pounds his features had a most puritanical look one that convinced people that his head consisted of nothing more than a spoonful of brains which was wrong for renny was known throughout the world for his engineering accomplishments thats renwick barked the man with the gun watch im hes supposed to be tough rennys toughness was more than supposition as the men soon found out he moved like greased lightning his incredible fists whistled through the air pummeled mobsters heads with blows that echoed throughout the room one big fist took a man under the chin the fellow rose straight up into the air squirming like a fish that had come out of the water caught on a hook and who was trying to shake himself loose falling he seemed to melt against the floor the fellow had hardly touched the floor when rennys other monster fist had another mobster in the same position i gotta shoot im yelled the leader of the attacking group his gun leveled at rennys heart roared spouted flame renny said oof very loudly grabbed the gunman by the throat and whirled him off the floor bodily it was a breathless feat of strength renny seemed actually going to wring the fellows neck bony johnny was dancing around whirling a chair over his head he hit a thug with it and changed the shape of the mans shoulder the bony archaeologist didnt look it but he packed a big wallop the man screamed fell on the floor screamed louder and got up again the fellow jumped around like a jumping jack as if he didnt know what he wanted to do his shoulder pained him so much johnny looked at the fellow as if he enjoyed the antics a telephone hit johnny on the back of the head he dropped as if poled the man who had torn the phone loose and thrown it ran to it picked it up and took aim at renny his arm whipped forward renny saw the motion ducked dived and got clear but not the second time the telephone made clunk of a noise against rennys skull renny weaved three men pounced on him feet fists finally a clubbed chair got renny down gasping and cursing the raiders fell on johnny and renny and tied them up all out of breath from their exertions its lucky you guys had a baseball player along like me gasped the man who had thrown the telephone the one who had fired the shot tore rennys vest open and looked bulletproof vest he snarled i oughta shoot you in the eye big fists there was a loud knock on the door the raiders dragged the two prisoners out of sight then the leader went to the door it was an elevator operator whats the trouble he asked theres been enough noise up here to darn near shake the building down without batting an eye the other said william harper littlejohn and his friend were throwing some smartaleck newspaper reporters and cameramen out they wanted to get a picture of solomon before he was resurrected where did the newspapermen go down the stairs probably if you didnt see them the elevator operator said i thought i heard a shot that was a photographic flashlight bulb breaking grunted the other you tell everybody everythings all right yes sir said the elevator operator and went away the leader went back to his men and said lets get on with the rest of this they carried the wicker basket in opened the lid and carefully dumped out something about as long as a man it was wrapped in a sheet the care they used with it was extreme wheres solomon they asked holy cow rumbled bigfisted renny whats all this about there was another knock at the door the leader went to the door kept his gun in his pocket with a hand on it and peered out hell he said this is a fine time to show up lawyer proudman shaster smiled cheerily at the other i was waiting downstairs to see how you came out he said frankly if you had failed to take the fort i would simply have failed to come up there was no need of us all taking a chance of getting caught i call that a hell of a note snarled the other its my privilege as one of your leaders said proudman shaster i see everything is in hand that is really wonderful really wonderful he whipped out a large purple handkerchief tied it over his face and walked into the room faking a shuffling limp were trying to make em tell which is solomon said the gunman theres a lot of mummies here solomon yes of course murmured proudman shaster shaster glanced about observed a wallpiece consisting of two crossed swords a battleax and a shield he went over and got the battleax down then stood above renny the ax glistened as he swung it all right he said which is solomon a shocking change had come over proudman shaster his eyes were too bright and he had started breathing in short spurts his gaze was fixed hungrily on rennys muscularlooking neck suddenly without another word he lifted the ax it was a big thing probably it had chopped off many heads in its day at least it had been made for that it would not have taken a psychologist to realize that some queer hideous quirk in proudman shasters nature made him a madman when he was in a tense situation with a big sword or an ax in his hand he had a mania for chopping off heads he was going to chop off one now without more fuss about it wait renny yelled that one is solomon renny pointed renny had a sense of values he was not going to lie there and have his head chopped off simply because he did not want to tell this purplemasked maniac which of the mummies was solomon but it was not going to save him proudman shaster bunched his muscles and the ax whistled downward for rennys neck renny was tied so he could not dodge he shut his eyes slug damn you yelled proudman shaster whyd you do that the leader of the mob snarled shakily the guy told you what you wanted to know didnt he renny opened his eyes and saw that the ax was sticking in the floor beside his neck he gathered that the gunman had leaped and deflected the wouldbe killers arm at the last instant the two were now glaring at each other and it looked as if there would be trouble proudman shaster finally shrugged with the ax out of his hands sanity had returned all right he snapped take the two prisoners into the other room all of you go in there and watch them whatre you gonna do asked the gunman im gonna switch mummies said proudman shaster im gonna im going to exchange the mummy we brought with us for that of solomon the gentlemanly looking thugs carried renny and johnny into the outer room then stood over them watchfully guns in their hands fully fifteen minutes elapsed it was such a long interval that the men became impatient whats keeping you one called shut up directed proudman shaster from the other room i am changing the wrappings of the mummies taking the wrappings off solomon and putting them on our mummy why doc savage must think our mummy the one we are going to leave here is the mummy of solomon so that he will go ahead and resurrect it renny and johnny exchanged stunned glances holy cow said renny these lugs are trying to get some guy of their own brought hack to life renny had a remarkable voice it sounded like a very big animal in a big cave highly enraged proudman shaster came out dragging the wicker basket take this he directed its got solomon in it whatll we do with it the gunman wanted to know take it over to the river and dump it with a weight tied to it said shaster but what about the cops the motorcycle escort easy tell them you were a dummy expedition to get the remains of solomon tell the cops you were sent so the crowd would see you think solomon was gone and then clear out doc savage would logically do that he dont like crowds the men picked up the wicker basket they all seemed about to leave wait a minute barked proudman shaster youre forgetting only the two who came with the hearse will leave they can dispose of solomon the rest of you stick here and do what point guns at renny and johnny here when doc savage sends for the mummy of solomon shaster directed renny and johnny will see that doc takes the mummy and dont suspect a thing shoot them if they dont act their part righto agreed the gunman reluctantly proudman shaster smiled while the two who had arrived in the hearse struggled out with the wicker basket everything is going to be really wonderful shaster assured them just do your jobs and dont worry remember you have something to fall back upon as a last resort he went out chapter the mummy swappers the door made a metallic click behind proudman shasters departing back and the leader went to it tried it to make sure it was locked then whirled on his aids get the fellows who are hurt out of sight he directed stick em in a closet or something if any of you have got narcotics on you give em a little to sort of ease their pain they bustled around the private museum instead of being the dark place that such establishments usually are was modernistic with a lot of windows however it carried out a onecolor scheme of decoration the purpose of this was the same as the reason for some museums being dark the exhibits seemed more effective stood out better by contrast be sure everything is cleaned up directed the leader he came over toward johnny and renny im gonna untie you mugs after i take your bulletproof union suits off and if you make funny moves youre going to find yourselves bucking a storm of lead what is behind this renny asked thats our own business the other told him we want a certain fellow resurrected in place of solomon weve gone to a lot of trouble to get that fellow and were going to a lot more to get what he theres such a thing as talking too much a man reminded the leader dryly thanks said the leader and shut up johnny and renny were relieved of their unusually light alloy chainmail undergarments then they were untied and stood on their feet you live here the leader told johnny wheres the bathroom youve got some blood on your puss that needs washing off johnny grumbled ill show you you thug and led the way to a plain door perhaps i had better go in first said the leader of the mob he opened the door and backed in covering his prisoners with his gun that was a bad move he never saw his fate in the shape of two bronze hands that suddenly took bold of his neck the tendons on the backs of the bronze hands somewhat resembled large round files the fingers sank deep into the mans neck flesh as if they were steel in reality and the leader of the mob was lifted off the floor he flailed his arms one of the bronze hands detached and clamped his arms the other fist released his neck and hit his jaw in a combination move that took a good eye to follow renny and johnny stood perfectly still they knew those hands doc savage neither gave a sign to betray the presence of the bronze man to the other members of the mob who were in a position where they could cover renny and johnny but could not see what had happened to their chief doc drew the victim out of sight deposited him in the bathtub and straightened the bronze mans throat tendons tensed and he held his mouth in a peculiar position from his lips came a perfect imitation of the mobleaders voice come in here a minute a couple of you guys doc invited one of the raiders had been put out of commission in the first fight with johnny and renny doc had just disposed of a second there had been six to start with excluding shaster and the two carrying the wicker basket the four in the room behind johnny and renny were now unsuspicious two stepped through the bathroom door they saw docabout the time he took hold of them what the one managed to gasp well have to move this thing doc savage said loudly itll be quite a struggle he had hold of them both in such a way that they couldnt yell well have to kick the darn thing loose the bronze man added the two victims kicked and flailed madly time after time they hit the bronze man with their fists their blows seemed to have no effect kick it again doc said the bronze man was imitating the voice of the leader he had overpowered the two men he held managed to flail him with their legs he worked to get their heads in a position for cracking together were just about to make it doc said once more hit it the two heads went thump and the men stopped struggling silence followed the talking doc had done had been pitched in a loud encouraging voice it had led the two in the other room to think their companions were merely doing a bit of heavy work doc took advantage of the silence which would sound like a rest interval well have to have more help doc called bring the two prisoners in here and make them help us the rest of it was simple the two survivors of the mob walked in unsuspectingly and doc hidden behind the door hit them in turn one sharp blow for each and they fell to the floor after he had made sure the prisoners were all unconscious doc savages flake gold eyes rested on bony johnny it might be advisable he said quietly to move your living quarters and museum down a little closer to headquarters it took me almost twentyfive minutes after the alarm rang to get bere of course there is a terrific traffic jam below but even without that it takes too long we are always in danger we should be in a position to help each other quickly alarm renny boomed what kind of an alarm brought you here doc johnny answered that i had my place wired some time ago for instance there are certain spots under the rug over which tables ordinarily sit or chairs when the chairs or tables are moved and the certain spots pressed it rings a bell in docs headquarters i saw to the pressing doc savage added quietly it just happens that johnnys fire escape goes past his bathroom window now what happened here they told him what had happened the police when doc savage got them on the telephone were not too happy about being doped by the fake hearse for five minutes things crackled five minutes no longer for that was the interval required to catch the fake hearse the hearse was driving near the river when two radiopatrol cars crowded it to the curb the driver and his assistant pulled out their guns then took another look at the cops and changed their minds a sergeant telephoned doc savage about the capture bring them to william harper littlejohns place doc requested we will question them as well as some friends of theirs who are already here yes sir the sergeant had considered the request an order because doc savage held a high honorary commission on the new york police force it had been given him in recognition of work done in the past doc glanced out of the window and saw that the crowd was still jamming the street held there because word that the bronze man was present in person had gone around no doubt doc said renny you watch the prisoners renny blocked out his big fists and rumbled itll be a pleasure doc took johnny the archaeologist into the room where the mummy lay they swapped on us doc questioned yes johnny said so puzzled be used small words i cannot understand it doc said lets examine the mummy they left for us to resurrect the mummy was in a plain black case a modern one the cadaver would probably have given an ordinary person the creeps it hardly looked lifelike it was taller than an average man and had a good breadth of shoulders an aged man the mummy had been quite a physical specimen even at the time of his death mummies are usually seen done up in ancient wrappings but this one was naked except for a plain white gown such as patients wear before they are taken into operating rooms it was split up the back after the fashion of such gowns johnny scratched his head and looked amazed ill be superamalgamated he murmured this mummy is of almost exactly the same period as that of solomon i can say positively that there is no more than a hundred years difference in their age he fingered his monocle miraculously unbroken throughout the excitement solomons physical build and that of this man are practically identical he said the deception might very well have succeeded he sighed deeply i hope they have not damaged solomon he finished they were going to throw him into the river a policeman knocked on the door the hearse is downstairs with solomon he reported what about the two prisoners doc queried the cop shook his head dead what begorra it was the queerest thing the oflicer muttered them two feilers sat there in the squad car bitin their finger nails then all of a sudden they both had fits and died that seemed to remind doc savage he spun and leaped into the room where renny was guarding the prisoners it was a bedroom renny waved one big fist i spread em out on the bed theyre behavin doc ran to the prisoners examined them then glanced at renny did they chew their finger nails any he asked sure renny admitted they were worried why not doc savage said quietly and now theyre dead the story of the dead men got into the newspapers it couldnt very well have been kept out lawyer proudman shaster put a paper bearing the story in front of general ino at the small hotel where the latter had his headquarters for the moment quien sabe murmured general ino havent you ever heard of the oriental custom which spies have of committing suicide these men didnt commit suicide a mere technicality stated ino they thought the poison was a drug that would make them unconscious so they could not be questioned you told them that some one must have grinned general ino he leaned forward suddenly dont be a sap mine fran those men would have told all they knew doc savage would have made them this savage is as clever a man as there is alive today dont get any other idea i have been outfoxing people for many years it is my trade i am merely trying to beat doc savage at my own game and believe me if i succeed i am going to retire because it will be the crowning achievement of my career there will be no more worlds to conquer this one will pay well enough that you can afford to retire proudman shaster pointed out thats an angle too the general admitted there was a small portable radio in the room and it began to give forth a news broadcast as general ino adjusted the knobs the announcer was saying that doc savage and his aids were on the way to the bronze mans laboratory with the mummy of solomon which had nearly been stolen general ino listening began to chuckle his chuckle was queer it sounded like a hen cackling velly good he chortled you are absolutely satisfied with the way things are going demanded proudman shaster perfectly exclaimed general ino it is going exactly as i have planned it as you might say my dear shaster it is all really wonderful there was such a crowd around doc savages skyscraper that the hearse could not get close they transferred the mummy to a subway train had the subway stop near docs building and entered the structure by an underground passage which doc used for leaving and coming when he did not want to be seen on the street they put the mummy on a white slab in the laboratory the public seems to think this resurrection will be a short affair merely a matter of turning on a machine and prestosolomon is alive doc said addressing homely monk you had better announce differently k monk said how long will it take doc hours maybe days monk went out to make this announcement doc savages laboratory was probably exceeded for completeness only by one other the existence of which the world knew nothing about even docs five assistants did not know where it was situated except that it was at some remote spot on the globe which the bronze man called his fortress of solitude and to which doc visited at intervals to spend weeks and sometimes months shut off completely from the world studying and working out scientific experiments it was really at this fortress of solitude that doc had perfected his resurrection process it was there that he had gotten together the extremely rare chemicals so rare that even now he only had enough to revive one patient monk came back said i told em they didnt believe me of course monk whose skill as a chemist was amazing understood enough of docs process to be of some assistance the others experts at other lines could only stand back and watch but they were anxious to help anything we can do pale long tom asked doc savage considered there is something sinister underfoot you two might make some investigations the pallid electrical wizard grunted but weve got nothing to go on renny doc said you say one of these men today the one with the mask sliowed an insane desire to cut your head off holy cow did he renny boomed ill say there have been three beheading muirders since this affair of the resurrection started doc told him one was carson alexander olman of new york the other sir rodney dillsworth of england and the third a mate on a freight steamer investigate them see what you can turn up that connects the three killings and connects us renny ham johnny and long tom immediately went to telephones and got to work they spent money on longdistance calls as if it were water to he dipped up out of an ocean doc savage and monk filled a large glass tank with a chemical mixture the tank was about the size and shape of a bathtub and the chemical mixture had a reddish tinge this is the first step at softening and revitalizing the mummified tissue doc said electric currents passed through the bath will quicken the process monk eyed the mummy critically he looks like hes gonna take a lot of revitalizing if it was anybody but you doc trying this id go out and make myself some money by betting fifty to one that it couldnt be done how about the vital organs being missing renny called from the library didnt they take the entrails out when they embalmed the old mummies not in this process doc told him preservation was accomplished by immersion in a bath the exact nature of which has been lost to knowledge reckon the bath was poison monk queried probably doc admitted we will have to eradicate the poison that may take time monk stood back and scratched his nubbin of a head its been easy to talk about resurrecting somebody he squeaked but it begins to look like quite a job all of a sudden in the library a huge room containing thousands of scientific tomes renny long tom and johnny worked on three telephones in the reception room ham kept another line busy there were occasions when doc savage needed many telephone hookups in a hurry so he had the facilities the bronze man also frequently needed information abruptly his five aids were experts at getting it not only did they do the work themselves but they had a number of good detective agencies who would go to work at the drop of a hat detective agencies being tools to fight the criminals doc savage had long ago subsidized a number and on occasion took a hand in training their operatives since the bronze man paid a part of the expenses these private detective agencies were able to work cheaply enough to help many an ordinary fellow take care of some personal difficulty the private agencies as a matter of fact was doc savages method of taking care of the innumerable calls which he received from persons who were in trivial jams little troubles which did not require the bronze mans developed skill were taken care of by the agencies which doc had established within two hours doc savages informationgathering machine had dug up some interesting facts theres a connection between the beheadings renny reported this englishman sir rodney sold something to the american carson alexander olman the article sold was shipped on the freighter of which the third beheading victim was mate doc had the mummy out of the bath now it looked less like a mummy and the bronze man was going over it with an xray machine how did you get your information he asked from the new york offices of the line which owned the freighter renny explained they had this one article which they had received a bill of lading or whatever they called it for but the article never got here it disappeared somewhere in the process of shipment monk said it looks as if this article was stolen and every one who would know anything about it was killed any clue as to what the thing was doc queried nope said renny except that it was marked down on the steamship company bill as peydehehghan doc was silent a moment an almost weird livelihood seemed to come into his flake gold eyes repeat that name peydehehghan said renny doc was silent pay day again renny grunted i guess thats the way youd pronounce it name mean anything to you doc the name obviously did for there came into being the small fantastic trilling sound which was the peculiar property of doc savage the strange thing which he did in moments of mental excitement it was not loud but every one in the skyscraper headquarters heard it the trilling seemed to have a startled quality call the paris national museum in france and see if a mummy was recently sold to sir rodney the englishman who was beheaded the bronze man directed transatlantic telephone being efficient renny was back in fifteen minutes yep he said four months ago the paris national museum sold a mummy named peydehehghan to sir rodney that explains it doc said quietly explains what later doc told him just now this resurrecting is taking my attention chapter resurrection the resurrection was taking the attention of the rest of the world too almost every one was making a gala day of it nothing for years had so caught public attention the fact that several men had died mysteriously that morning did not cool the excitement the circumstances of the deaths were so fantastic that they merely added to the general fever hawkers in the throngs on the street were already selling solomon balloons solomon noisemakers and handkerchiefs with solomons picture on them solomon ice cream they yelled as cold as solomons thousandth wife five cents an enterprising burlesque press agent came out with the announcements that his entire troupe of beautiful girls was going to offer to marry solomon theres not a thousand of em he stated modestly but theyre so pretty they make up for it bookstores had their windows full of books about solomon signs on the backs of sandwich men parading the streets read be as wise as solomon and eat at jobowskis steak emporium besides all this cheap display there was serious talk and levelheaded editorials some ambitious soul got a finger in the publicity by being the first to organize a solomon for president club he advocated an amendment to the constitution so that the president would not have to be native born just this once the crowd got thicker around doc savages skyscraper for blocks a peanut could hardly have been dropped out of a tall building without hitting a spectator not that there was anything to see except after night came the brilliantly lighted top floor of the enormous building which was docs aerie two dirigibles and umpteen airplanes buzzed around the building keeping three police aircraft busy chasing them away doc savage had put the mummy through six complicated stages of the resurrecting process he was in the seventh now which consisted in treating the body it looked like a body now with ultraviolet and other rays he had explained that this was to replace in it the necessary vitamins which had deteriorated through the centuries the lights by no means supplied all the vitamins other processes had helped the bronze giant was completely encased in a germproof white garment so was monk the others waited in the library they could see through a glass door into the laboratory they stood with their noses flattened against the glass throughout the night its a miracle johnny stated watching the mummy become more and more lifelike its the longest durn miracle i ever had anything to do with complained pale long tom i wish doc would take a shortcut or something johnny the archaeologist was as excited as a hen whose chickens are hatching johnny believed that solomon once he was alive could solve many great archaeological puzzles johnny as the first man to interview him he intended to write a book too saw his name going down in history it would probably go down in history anyway but he was too modest to believe that how can you be impatient he snapped at long tom this is the greatest thing of all time fooey said long tom im tired johnny said scathingly you look something like a mummy yourself and it might be a good idea if doc did some resurrecting on you so you bonepile long tom sniffed for two bits id hang you out in the wind and listen to you rattle bigfisted renny put in now dont you two start monkandhamming it they grinned at each other were tired ham said dryly but look at doc hes been working steadily and poor monk said renny monk ham jeered solomon will take one look at monk and think the human race has gone backward since his day monk came to the door doc says you fellows had better get some sleep he said this may go on and on monk called them at four oclock that evening the crowd downstairs is raising cain he said they think the resurrection has turned out a dud or a fake or something and theyre throwing bricks at the cops aint people funny you are anyway snapped ham eying monks apish physique why did you awaken us ham had awakened about every third minute throughout the day his nerves were raw solomon is in the last process monk said come on in if you want to see it they entered the laboratory and stood around after pulling on white germproof garments what they saw was so spellbinding that they at times forgot to breathe a number of movies usually the horror type of pictures had been made in which people or monsters have been brought to life and docs aids had seen them even erudite johnny who publicly declared movies below his dignity but occasionally slipped out to see one the motion picture resurrections usually consisted of putting a corpse under a bunch of big electrodes showy glass vacuum tubes and a bearded scientist pushed a switch after which there was a blinding deafening display of electrical sparks the favorite gag was to tap the heavens for a lightning bolt there was always enough electricity in evidence to execute a penitentiary full of convicts doc for his final stage used no electricity at all he used no tubes bulbs nor elaborate apparatus the only device employed was a long hypodermic needle which he inserted into the heart emptied it next be turned the resurrection patient over his knee and spanked him violently the idea monk exploded spanking solomon shut up you baby scarer ham advised they spank newborn children like that it starts them to breathing or the pain revives them or something he eyed monk nastily they must have forgotten that in your case it was characteristic of monk and ham that they carried their quarrel into the most critical situation so it did not surprise the others that they would still fight while solomon was being revived hes breathing johnny gasped and pointed solomon is breathing johnny was jumping up and down in his excitement the former mummy was undoubtedly breathing he began to stir the stirrings became movement finally the patient sat up his eyes which had been tightly closed opened he looked around the first individual he saw chanced to be the homely monk the mummy stared intently at monk his eyes shut he lay down again i knew it ham told monk he saw you and thought evolution had backfired it was too much for him ham was kidding because they could all see that the mummy was still breathing the chap had merely lain back to rest i will administer some energy in a chemical form which can be assimilated instantly by his body doc said he did this with a hypodermic needle then he massaged various parts of the patients body he used small electrical therapy devices in this stirring up the circulation doc explained the mummy man on the table had his eyes open and was looking at them he had not moved perceptibly nor spoken the man was a rather handsome fellow being tall robust with an aquiline nose and a fine upstanding shock of white hair as well as an impressive white beard docs revitalizing process had extended with effect even to the hair returning its life and luster doc said at last he should be able to talk now but what language will he speak long tom asked the tongue native to his country in his day of course put in bony johnny i happen to know that doc knows enough of that ancient tongue to converse after a fashion and i myself may be able to do the same unconsciously they all had spoken in a low voice the power of the moment was having its effect on them doc savage stepped back and motioned johnny forward to william harper littlejohn will go the honor of first addressing the patient johnny was overcome it was unexpected no archaeologist could wish for a greater moment johnny stepped forward his lips worked but no sound came he tried again still no noise holy cow rumbled bigfisted renny for once johnny cant think of a big word johnny fully realizing he had flubbed his great opportunity stepped back doc savage spoke to the mummy the bronze mans voice was encouraging inspiring confidence and the words he spoke were while slow well articulated johnny realized they were words of the language of solomons day well spoken the mummy understood that was obvious because he looked startled but the fellow did not answer doc tried again and again after fifteen minutes he had no answer weve got a speechless solomon on our hands complained monk imagine that johnny who was gloomy over his tonguetied interval snapped dont joke about it this is serious doc savage had apparently been thinking perhaps association with familiar objects would move him to speak he said after all this must be an utterly strange environment but whatll we do about it monk asked take him to the metropolitan museum doc said let him look around the ancient exhibits they took their guest who had lately been a mummy to the museum and several interesting things happened en route first the fellow screamed out in terror when the elevator started downward the abject fright in the cry moved monk to mutter in an aside to ham solomon aint a very nervy cuss ham said scathingly if the same thing happened to you thats happened to him youd be jittery too they left the skyscraper by the underground route they had trouble getting the late mummy into a taxicab when they reached the street doc blindfolded the fellow to spare him a lot of surprise the bronze man explained the mummy peered about vacantly when they first entered the museum although the institution was open to the public there were no visitors today probably due to the excitement downtown doc led the way to exhibits of biblical times and ancient egypt immediately their guest perked up doc stopped in front of an exhibit of extremely antique tablets and watched the strange man he had resurrected the fellow became more excited he shuffled forward and thoughtfully touched a number of articles he showed great interest in an ancient picture done in colors so fine that they had withstood the ravages of centuries deep within the tomb walls on whose stone corridor they had been painted johnny the archaeologist said unquestionably he is genuine eh monk grunted that is his own picture he is studying johnny explained it is a hieroglyphic representation of king solomon the mummy man glanced from the painting to doc savage he seemed to be trying to read the bronze mans features but they told him nothing this seemed to disturb him he said something guttural in a strange tongue tall bony johnny looked as if he had been hit by a lightning bolt doc savage was startled too for the first time his face revealed surprise his trilling ethereal and almost without reality was audible for an instant an eerie note monk blinked gulped whatn blazes johnny waved the long bones that were his arms he made explosive gargling trying to get words out then succeeded peydehehghan he squawked this this fake hes not solomon hes peydehehghan chapter the strange mummy man monk made fists a fierce face and leaped forward the crook ill hit im so hard hell turn back into a mummy doc got in front of monk wait it is not his fault then whose fault is it monk yelled doc was silent a moment we have one consolation the bronze man said dryly we are not taken in often you mean weve been foxed thoroughly doc agreed understanding apparently exploded like firecrackers in the heads of johnny and renny simultaneously holy cow renny rumbled in johnnys museum that swap of mummies it was a trick they werent swapped johnny groaned those raiders really hauled off this this fake they made renny and myself think it was solomon we told you they got solomon doc it was our fault renny rumbled gloomily this is a heck of a note contributed long tom the american public ham groaned theyll mob us thats k renny muttered me and johnny here deserve mobbing for being taken in like that doc savage had a quality that his aids thoroughly appreciated he never raked anybody over the coals for a mistake they did their best he gave them credit for that and did not criticize it seems like a strange thing to say doc now informed them calmly but this peydehehghan may prove more interesting than solomon and almost as valuable monk looked startled he jabbed a finger at the mummy man you mean this this pay day again or whatever his name is may be worth something doc said that probably explains why he was switched for solomon pay day renny said scowling at the mummy man just what the heck is this about johnny you ask him that in his lingo johnny did so he got silence for an answer doc tried his results were also negative but he did not seem surprised johnny said frankly i do not get this we will go back to headquarters doc decided in the library there are some unpublished notes made by a little known archaeologist who spent most of his life exploring egypt and the holy land this archaeologist really deserved considerable notice but did not get it because he made no big discoveries nothing spectacular that is they managed to get out of the museum without attracting too much public notice the cab driver they hailed the driver of the first cab for they had to take two seemed to have something else on his mind and did not pay them particular attention until doc gave him the address of his headquarters huh youre going down to see this guy solomon the driver turned his head and saw doc the mummy man monk and ham the hackeys eyes popped he jerked a thumb at the mummy man gleeps is that solomon monk not lying and not telling the whole truth as an answer said this is the man we just resurrected yes so thats the guy who had a thousand wives he sighed what a man doc had not directed the taxi directly to the skyscraper but to a spot abreast of it on the hudson river here stood a huge desertedlooking warehouse the hidalgo trading co according to the legend on it which was really a hangar and boathouse housing the bronze mans armada of conveyances not many persons knew the real purpose of the great structure for it looked innocent enough and the cab driver certainly did not for he shook his head in a puzzled fashion when he let them out then peered curiously at another cab which drew up behind him carrying renny johnny and long tom who now alighted and hurried forward a truck came snorting down the street and stopped almost opposite its horn began to blow loudly there were several lines of queerlooking marks pictures and yet not pictures on the sides of the truck docs voice crashed unexpectedly get under cover he rapped quick then guns began to fill the street with a great banging it must have been doc savages reputation for trouble that had the two taxi drivers on edge the one to the rear slammed his hack into reverse raced his engine and went up the street backward at a speed somewhere near thirty miles an hour it was too fast he went over a curb and glass crashed in the next instant driver and car were out of sight in an abandoned store monk and the rest of docs aids dived for cover the mummy man stood where he was as if bewildered docs taxi driver popped out of his machine tried to crawl under it he was a fat man and his back was low he got caught owww he squawked theyll kill me monk and the others were in an entryway doc seized the fat taxi driver yanked him out the fellow was too plump to run fast doc rushed him to the entryway en route the bronze man stumbled once almost fell it was as if he had been hit by something he did stumble when he reached the entry the others then saw a rip in the back of the bronze mans coat a bullet had made it only the bulletproof undergarments which doc always wore when action was possible had saved him the entry was closed at the back by a gate which had upright iron bars as thick as hams cane one bar was missing making a hole wide enough for a man to squeeze through the mummy man still stood in the street he didnt know what bullets were that was obvious run monk howled at him youll get killed pay day renny roared he may be a fake but hes a human now renny lunged for the street renny was not shy on courage he intended to seize the mummy man pay day as monk called him and drag him to shelter doc grabbed renny and without apparent effort stopped the bigfisted engineer youll get shot so will pay day doc called sharply to pay day in the ancient tongue which was native to the mummy man the words might have set off a percussion cap in peydehehghan he put his head down and ran up the street as fast as he could the taxi driver was trying to get through the hole in the iron gate he had his head in and his body down to his third vest button he was stopped there doc rapped monk your supermachine pistol the homely chemist whipped out one of the weapons they had been developed by doc resembled an overgrown automatic and could pour out bullets faster than a military machine gun mercy bullets doc asked yep the mercy bullets produced unconsciousness only it was the policy of doc and his aids not to take human life if it could be avoided but i got some demolition cartridges monk added monk was inclined to be bloodthirsty one demolition slug would tear down a goodsized house the taxi driver made strangled sounds caught in the hole in the iron gate gunfire was now a deafening roar it was coming from windows from the big truck in the street from everywhere it seemed doc superfirer latched to shoot bullets one by one took careful aim at the running mummy mans legs the weapon made a clean report peydehehghan skipped like a man who had stepped on a thorn he ran on a little farther then he stopped made vague gestures of a man too tired and sleepy to do anything about a pressing situation and laid down loosely in the street ow wailed the taxi driver oh golly renny yelled these bushwhackers are movin in on us it sounded like it bullets were hitting all around the little compact group a few got into the niche where they had taken shelter ricochets they were not too deadly the taxi driver continued his yelling kicked and writhed up the street there was a mushy sort of an explosion and smoke gushed out into the street the gas tank of the taxi that had run backward into the store had exploded following that explosion there was another close too it knocked the hats off the little group showered them with brick dust to say nothing of what it did to their hearing and nerves grenade long tom squawled we gotta get out of here the next one may whoom the next one took up a section of pavement and broke off a fire plug water came out of the fire plug with a guzzling roar oh my moaned the stuck taxi driver to think ive been readin dime novels for excitement monk yelled at the hackey before you get blowed in there so tight youll never get out i better do somethin monk grabbed the cabby and pulled him out of the hole in the iron bars like a cork out of a bottle oh oh wailed the hackman guns and bullets and shouts just about drowned out what he had to say monk keeping his hold on the fat driver aimed him for the hole in the bars and rushed him nix squawled the driver that hole is too little it wasnt he went through but it would probably be days before he would be the same again renny long tom ham johnny went through in quick succession monk looked as if he didnt believe doc would make it but doc did oh complained the fat taximan monk advised you better take my advice and run like heck i cant the taximan was mistaken he did there was a stairway doc and his men went up that another grenade a bigger one took out most of the front of the building and demolished the area way behind them the noise had fixed their ears so they had to scream to be heard the battle of the marne again renny howled renny looked as sad as a dog whose pups had died that meant he was very happy action affected him that way windows doc savage rapped your machine pistols the bronze man did not waste many words giving orders he did not need to some of the windows still had glass they knocked that out the enemy shot into the breaking windows making removal of the glass a quick job monk got into a room where there were two windows one with glass one without he broke the one with glass bullets stormed in monk let his superfirer roar at the glassless windows the weapon sounded like a stick on a picket fence at sixty an hour yeow monk squawled i got two of em crazy as a hoot owl ham told the fat taxi driver he always gets that way when somebody shoots at him i ddont blame hhim stuttered the hackey down in the street men appeared they ran toward the mangled areaway they had grenade sacks on their belts and gasmask sacks around their necks they wore tin hats and carried automatic rifles nine eleven thirteen renny said counting and one more so far behind that i wont count him rennys superfirer all of docs men carried them let out a moan the charging men did not go down at once but in a moment they fell some took a few jumps more than others doc savage had long toms superfirer now he had been to one side shooting single shots not making enough noise to take much attention each of his shots was getting a man quick the bronze man rapped suddenly demolition shells the others except the taxi driver lunged to his side to see what was happening holy cow renny rumbled a car was coming down the street it had a quiet motor or the uproar had kept them from hearing it the machine was black it headed for the prone form of pey dehehghan gonna run over im monk howled the car did not run over the mummy man it stopped beside him almost on him and in such a position that the car was between where doc and his men stood and the mummy man the car door opened and men got out to pick up peydehehghan demolition cartridges doc rapped again monk nearly tore his clothing off in a search lost them he croaked at last renny said here ive gotmine he got the small drum of them out passed them to doc and the bronze man clipped them into the superfirer which he held then leaned out of the window to take a deliberate aim at the street back of the car the machine was backing up now the mummy was inside doc fired once there was a roar bricks fell off cornices windows which had withstood the grenade concussions broke the street back of the car opened up a hole and a cloud of dust fire and smoke concrete pavement chunks stacked as if they were broken ice the car had been blown backward but not over it was against the curb water from the broken main scooting around it monk howled boy weve got em stopped he added a lot more most of it just whooping and hollering and squawling he stopped every once in a while to punctuate it with a moan from his superfirer but the car had not been disabled it began to travel fast and straight ahead doc savage aimed the superfirer to put another demolition shell ahead of the car and stop it one lone gun banged up the street doc savage flopped back into the room and onto the floor the car ran away with peydehehghan chapter the pirate pharaoh monk squawled doc youre shot he sprang for the bronze man doc savage rolled to get away from the window a grenade went off outside obviously doc had seen it coming and that was why he had ducked or why he had rolled perhaps the bullet was the reason for his ducking the concussion of the grenade caused the shape of the wall to change it bulged somewhat oh oh groaned the cab driver im sure gonna get killed ham sword cane tucked under one arm began shooting from a window doc ran out of the room up more stairs and gained the roof the roof next door was higher by two stories doc got on top of it by using a silk cord with a collapsible grapple he took this from his clothing there was a man creeping across the other roof a sack of grenades in his hands he did not see or hear doc until the bronze man was on the roof then he made a mistake he tried to get a grenade out of his hag but couldnt do it before doc whipped forward and upon him he was not big enough to give even an ordinarily strong man much trouble doc knocked him senseless and took away his grenades doc had come to this roof in hopes of sighting the fleeing car which had taken peydehehghan he had no luck if it was near enough to be seen buildings hid it using his silken cord and grapple again the bronze man slid down to a fire escape he discharged two mercy bullets on the way down both times he dropped men who were about to shoot at him he went to a telephone called the police described the peydehehghan car then went back to the war front there was not much war left monk was stamping up and down the street offering a big hairy target and squawling for somebody to come out and fight he had all the noise to himself they vamoosed renny told doc not all of them though long tom put in i judge we laid out at least fifteen of em the fat taxi driver ventured into the street while they were gathering unconscious enemies the mercies had killed no on and piling the forms in a bunch the hackey peered about as nervous as a rabbit that had crawled into a dog kennel by mistake much obliged he mumbled for what monk wanted to know well i didnt get killed gulped the driver stick around it aint over thats just what im afraid of said the taximan so long he lit out running and never looked back doc savage explained to the police they helped carry all the senseless prisoners into the big hidalgo trading co warehouse where doc put the captives in a bulletshaped car which traveled through an underground tube to his skyscraper headquarters he had constructed the tube for quick service between the two places on the headquarters hallway they found some lines of strange characters that were half picture and half symbol i am going to read this one bony johnny declared i did not have time to translate the other one which was on the side of that truck which stopped in the street and started the fight doc savage said both inscriptions were the same huh monk put in what is this anyway it is a hieroglyphic warning doc savage said it is addressed to peydehehghan and tells him that we are his enemies and he should escape from us at the first opportunity so thats why pay day ran for it monk barked yes monk snorted doubtfully they must have had warnings to pay day written all around so he would be sure to see at least one this was true later when they checked monk and the others found identical hieroglyphic warnings painted on the doors of their private apartments inquiring around they also learned that the ambush at the warehouse was only one of many traps that had been set they could hardly have missed barging in upon the enemy bigfisted renny rumbled this bozo who pulled a fast one on us sure didnt overlook any bets but at least weve got some prisoners now and that means we can get some information if they dont chew their finger nails monk said grimly we will take care of that doc declared they stripped each prisoner and submerged him in a chemical bath which would render the underthefingernail poison harmless now doc savage announced while they are regaining consciousness we will check up on the known history of peydehehghan doc spent some time in the great library it was noticed that he did not peruse books but rather pamphlets containing speeches and scientific records made available to archaeological societies finally he put the records away and made very briefly his small trilling there can be no other explanation if theres any explanation monk groaned i dont know what it is peydehehghan was a pharaoh in egypt about the time of king solomons reign doc savage explained a king in egypt eh he was known as the pirate pharaoh doc continued he got that name from his insatiable thirst for sacking cities and gathering wealth johnny had been listening tumbling absently with his monocle now he dropped the monocle my memory is jogged now he exploded pharaoh peydehehghan was so greedy he insisted on taking the loot from his conquests with him and he caused a great tomb to be built and filled with his valuables then he put a curse on the tomb which was far out in the desert somewhere the nubian desert it is believed the tomb has never been found the light monk said is dawning ham who liked to pick discrepancies in any story he heard a relic of his law training said this story doesnt hang together how you figure monk bristled if theyve never found peydehehghans tomb how come they found his mummy johnny explained that promptly peydehehghan attacked king solomon and died in the campaign he said he was entombed away from home and the body was embalmed by his foes namely king solomons experts that accounts for the similarity in embalming which did a lot to fool us monk took two or three stamping turns around the office then stopped and glared dramatically at ham its plain monk squeaked we were tricked into reviving pay day this mysterious master mind whos fighting us snatched pay day and is gonna make im tell where the tomb is ham snarled dont scowl at me you ape johnny groaned if we only knew who were fighting they got that information from their captives doc got the fellows taiking very easily the bronze man simply explained about the poisonunderthefingernails trick doc further explained that the present prisoners had also carried the same poison not under their nails but in their hair a quick analysis of the chemical nullifier bath made by monk had indeed divulged this information the prisoners realized they had a chief who would have sacrificed their lives to keep them from talking they drowned each other out with their angry shouting of information their chief had stolen the mummy of peydehahghan killing every one who might give information a trick had been worked to get the mummy man back so that he could be persuaded to reveal the whereabouts of the treasure tomb doc had guessed as much general ino international crook was the leader he had an assistant named proudman shaster a lawyer that was all the prisoners knew except a lot of minor details of no great value general ino doc savage said and although his voice was low it had a grim quality an almost legendary figure so clever that he has managed to remain almost unknown several times i have made efforts to get on his trail knowing that at some time or other we would tangle monk scratched his nubbin of a bead general ino if you ask me is the slickest article weve hit in some time where dyou suppose he is now renny pondered on his way to egypt doubtless doc said well do some checking about that time general ino was saying everting she ees go too dam smooth oui we mus be more careful monsieurs he sounded like a frenchman who had learned english that year seems to me it is all really wonderful murmured proudman shaster peydehehghan said something which if translated would hardly have been printable he glowered at the shiny steel handcuffs on his wrists the rest of general inos men said nothing the dirigible engines made a great deal of noise it was supposed to be a very modern airship a dirigible not an airplane with silenced motors but there was a racket lots of it a whopping drone the atlantic ocean was below so far down that it looked strange and smooth doc savage will of course learn that we have taken passage for germany on this dirigible said general ino reverting to good english he will have the entire german police force on hand when the airship is due proudman shaster gaped in horror he didnt think that was so really wonderful but murmured general ino we shalt take measures they took measures they took over the dirigible at the point of a gun they made the radio operator radio that the ship was down burning in the middle of the atlantic after that they kept the radio silent the airships legitimate passengers there were not many for general ino had booked most of the seats or cabins for his aids were lined up and shot and the bodies dropped into the sea from three miles up some of the crew were shot for a demonstration all of the crew were shot once the ship had landed in the nubian desert days later then the airship was sent into the air without a soul aboard and its iron mike or automatic pilot a device with which the airship like modern passenger planes was equipped was set to the east and south bueno exclaimed general ino as the great cigar craft took the air i hope it will fall into the red sea and never be seen again proudman shaster he looked like an explorer in his pith helmet and shorts grumbled i think we should have burned it here general ino shook his head nein doc savage dot feller will guess vot happen an he come hunting ja if be find dot burned ship here it woof put him too near our trail the dirigible droned away to the southeast just as if its crew was aboard general ino and his cavalcade took out across the desert sands they carried full equipment for their surroundings a line of almost black snaggletoothed mountains to the west was their destination chapter air fangs the great transatlantic service dirigible came down at two hundred miles an hour and stuck her pose in the sand near jiddah which was in arabia just across the red sea the first hundred feet of her got mashed back into the rest but there was no fire thanks to some of the things man has learned about building big airships learned at the expense of quite a few lives the equivalent of the chief of police of jiddah ran out took one look at the airship drew his pistol had his men do likewise and kept all spectators and thieves away from the wreck twelve hours later doc savage his five aids the pig habeas the apelike whatisit chemistry and much equipment in metal cases arrived their big metal plane was streaked with grimy oil and docs aids if not doc himself looked like men who had just flown the atlantic as they had in the dirigible control cabin doc found the iron mike intact he saw the course on which it was set doc sent several small ordinary weatherobservation balloons aloft and watched them with a strong telescope he got together by radio what dope there was on the air currents over the red sea and the nubian desert part of africa we will make a stab at backtracking the airship he said it was a good stab perhaps it would not have been good if doc using very strong binoculars had not observed many black specks on a rocky stretch of ground they or doc put the big plane down on sand that was so hot that it dried instantly when they spat upon it they went over to look at what the buzzards were interested in it was the crew of the dirigible the bodies had been hidden it took a lot to horrify monk but he was grim and silent on the way back to the plane and didnt even burst out when the whatisit chemistry sprang upon his pet pig habeas to forcibly hunt for fleas something that monk usually considered a personal insult to himself from now on he mumbled the word devil is spelled general ino doc savage did not take the controls to lift the plane into the air as they had expected instead he got out a small radio transmitter receiver no larger than a cine camera of fair size he took concentrated food tablets which he had developed to give quick nourishment to patients in hospitals but which was also good ration for a man traveling hard doc added to the pack flask containing not water but the chemical parts of water minus the unneeded ingredients he added some of his gadgets and remarkable chemicals which he might use in his unusual method of fighting look here renny protested youre not going to leave us here while you go off trying to trail those fellows stick close to the plane doc directed and keep your radio in tune with my set the bronze man walked away circling at first then apparently finding a trail which led westward the heat waves took sight of him away from them shortly the waves looked eerie like a hideous sea separating them from a line of ominous black toothy mountains in the west the bronze mans five aids got inside the plane and turned on the air conditioner which soon cooled them off the outside thermometer on the control panel registered a temperature of over a hundred and thirty part of it probably due to the radiation of the sand but they had iced drinks and a cold meal which they did not eat very heartily the radio informed them that doc had found a trail but stay where you are the bronze man said sighting the plane in the air would warn the enemy wherever they have gone to static bothered them a bit on the radio they watched the buzzards until johnny a bit of a psychologist suggested that it wasnt raising their spirits any blasted murderers ham gritted and began putting fresh dope on the tip of his sword cane one of them is a lawyer in good standing monk suggested pointedly ham glared and you dont seem to be the only one who hasnt advanced much beyond the animal stage monk yelled thats a danged insult you clothes rack ham studied monks homely wrathy visage if i had that puss he said i would certainly visit a good falseface maker pale long tom groaned i guess were in for hours of you two guys they were five hours to be exact by that time monk was outside in the heat whither ham had chased him at the point of the doped sword cane what monk was saying about hams ancestors pigeaters all of them according to monk was interesting if not true and so enraging to ham that the dapper lawyer was holding a chunk of ice secured from the planes galley refrigerator to his head monk stopped reciting suddenly and pointed look he yelled a lot of guys in their nightshirts on horseback they were arabs nearly two dozen in number they rode picturesquely not sparing their horses which looked like good animals from a distance renny took the planes controls and readied the ship for a takeoff long tom and johnny manned their superfirers ham did nothing but stand at the plane door with his sword cane and keep monk from getting in another group of arabs appeared behind the first group all of these rode camels instead of horses and some led other camels bearing packs the arabs on horses stopped a good three hundred yards away one man rode out ahead with a considerable show he stuck his rifle stock in the sand and left the weapon there he means peace i reckon monk said still outside the plane and sounding relieved the arab rode up and asked them in pretty terrible english if they would buy some nice fresh dates very excellent dates most pleasing to eye and palate ham began we do not need any food of well take a few monk interrupted addressing the arab have one of your men bring them the transaction was completed the arabs stood around at a distance eying the plane then they all strung out over a nearby sand dune dates ham sneered at monk what we need is a member of this expedition to take your place one with ten cents worth of gumption monk pretended not to hear and got out his chemical analysis kit monks kit contained a device spectrascopic in principle for analyzing that was a whiz he worked with some of the dates and his contrivance for perhaps two minutes i thought so he exploded you never think ham opined these fruity titbits are poisoned monk announced the poison is the same that friend general ino used to kill off his men in new york to keep them from talking ham gulped yelled those arabs are shhh hairy monk admonished theyre doubtlessly waiting over on yon sand dune to see us die they went into a conference about what to do its a shame to disappoint them fellers monk declared i figured em for phonies an bought some of them dates just to see suppose you continue your brilliant deductioning and tell us what to do about this ham suggested play dead monk said promptly they will then charge over the sand dune get close then well let em have it not a bad idea bigfisted renny agreed were going to have to fight em so we might as well give em a kick in the slats they aint expecting they got out under the planes wings where it was very hot and made a fuss about sampling the dates but actually eating only some which they took from their own stores the dates had been in two big baskets and they stood about these for a while as if talking monk doubled over grabbed his stomach and put on a realistic show of dying they had seen the poisons effects in new york so their acting was very good in the course of the next five minutes they all died with their supermachine pistols under them the hot sand began to drum with the beat of hoofs the charge of the surprised brigade monk chuckled grimly i mean they aint surprised now but theyre gonna be there was a terrific report sand blinded them sand and something else that was awful on their eyes and in their lungs date basket blew up renny squawled false bottom in it monk croaked dazed gass of some kind a dozen seconds later they were all completely blinded surprise had turned out to be a surprise and their one hope was the plane they might get off without cracking long tom found the planes door first he couldnt see a thing but he could feel over here he yelled and kept yelling the other lunged to him they got through the planes door monk was last then be heard an excited squealing behind him habeas he howled habeas we gotta wait for habeas nix ham barked habeas is an arabian hog anyhow isnt he he was monk had got him in arabia long ago but he had no ideas about leaving him this was africa anyway monk leaned out of the door calling renny got the motors turning and fed them the gun he might as well have waited for monk to get his pet hog it made no difference they werent going to escape an attacker rode a dumb camel in front of the plane then dived off so that the plane hit the camel but not the man the ship skewered around and a propeller dashed part of the camel through one wing the plane ran on a short distance before it turned a somersault habeas corpus the pig took one look at the arabs he showed judgment spun and traveled only somewhat slower than a rusty bullet over the sand until he was out of sight the men in the plane were unconscious the gas had done that but it did not last long half an hour and they could see hear and suffer there were arabs all around them and one white man proudman shaster this is really wonderful proudman shaster murmured to think that we bagged all five minnows in one net monk scowled at him then at the buzzards circling above he spoke with his eyes on the buzzards but addressing shaster i bet they get you yet shaster unworried asked where is the big fish doc savage youre wasting your time askin us that monk growled yes i expect i am shaster agreed so i wont ask ill just take you along and proceed with plans monk wet his lips uneasily yeah of course chuckled shaster didnt you ever hear they use live bait to catch the biggest game fish its really wonderful how live bait works the arabs seemed to be some robber band whom general ino and shaster had hired this desert was full of roving groups who had no law except the bloody impulses of their own greed they did not burn the plane the smoke might be seen by doc savage said shaster they knocked the essential parts of the craft to pieces just as they got under way one arab raised his rifle and aimed deliberately at the pig habeas corpus who stood on a sand dune at some distance the rifle banged habeas went up straight and overbackward headoverhoofed down the sloping sand and was lost to sight they knocked monk in the head just as he got his hairy hands on the throat of the rifleman chapter black mountains the pig habeas found doc savage near midnight desert nights are supposed to be clear this one was cloudy so black the bats werent even out desert nights are also popularly supposed to be cool and this one was almost as hot as the day had been in the east the sky was red with sheet lightning and bolt lightning and there was a steady rumble like niagara falls doc had stopped he might have gone on trailing with his flashlight it was springgenerator operated hence no battery to exhaust but the light might be seen he had stopped the pig was breathing loudly pigs are not built for running a long distance although this one did have dog legs and planewing ears that might help some doc savage said nothing he did not even make his trilling he simply gathered habeas under an elbow and began running back the way he had come the glare the roar of the lightning came closer like the charge of astral titans its roar grew and grew with a mushy quality it was as if a lot of exploding cannons and big tin cans were smashing around in an ocean in the sky it got overhead and the wind hit it was quite a wind it took big sand dunes apart in clouds sand moved in whistling strings in volleys the clouds seemed thick enough to walk on doc kept going his coat was tiedaround his face over his eyes ears nose mouth he had habeass head jammed into a pocket when the rain hit it was as if they had fallen into an ocean warm rain mixed at first with sand it left as quickly as it had hit and went thumping and mumbling and sucking across the desert satan in retreat dragging his environment with him the plane when doc found it looked as if it had been there many a year the sand had half buried it had blown into the open cabin doors the water had packed it doc savage made a big circle of the vicinity before he went close he saw nothing alarming then he went over the plane habeas the pig ran in sniffing squealing circles he was baffled there was only one interesting thing a bottle tied to the control wheel a paper was inside savage you have smoke bombs aboard i see set one of them off before four oclock tomorrow afternoon to show you are willing to dicker no bomb and five men friends of yours will have their eyes pulled out a signature was hardly necessary not much of their equipment had been taken it had been stacked neatly perhaps so that it could be secured later doc savage went immediately and got one of the smoke bombs but be also got an alarm clock some wire some string and the mechanics from a hand grenade which made it explode he used also a little powder from the grenade he rigged up a contraption which would set off one of the smoke bombs at three fortyfive the next afternoon then he set out across the desert leaving bomb and plane with habeas at his heels doc carried a heavy equipment pack the black mountains looked as if they stuck up straight out of the sandy desert and they did in the bright moonlight the sand around them was almost white and any moving dark object easily seen doc wore one of the white sheetlike robes of the desert natives which he had brought from the plane their supplies included these habeas tied up in white cloth had sense enough not to tear the covering off after it was coated with a bitter chemical which he didnt like they went into a canyon that was like something a great knife had cut deeply warm stillness was everywhere sounds they had made out in the desert had carried but in here they didnt doc had located the nearest high peak from the desert he was on top of it when the sun came up it had been cold before the dawn this height was much cooler but the rising sun seemed to throw off as much heat as light thirty minutes after the first spurting glare topped the horizon habeas was panting doc savage had a monocular that was as long almost as the old sea captains spyglasses and as powerful as some telescopes even his nerveless hands could hardly hold it steady enough it had a small tripod a mechanical swivel with microscopic screws he kept his eye to the monocular and studied all of the mountains within reach he recessed only when it was long past the hour when even the laziest man would have arose a single metal case comprised most of docs pack it was packed tight he took out a tiny balloon the same kind he bad used to get wind direction back at the town where the dirigible had crashed and a spool containing two thousand yards or so of fine silk thread he fastened a tiny camera to the balloon the camera had been developed for this work it took pictures at oneminute intervals or whatever intervals the tiny watchwork was set for it could take over a hundred they were very tiny doc did a little doctoring on the balloon he blacked some strips of his white silk shirt with ink and fastened them one on each side and one at the back of the balloon when he sent the balloon up it looked just a bit like a buzzard one of any number of buzzards over the black grim mountains the developed pictures showed one thing only there were canyons which could not be photographed unless one was directly over them it was something like the grand canyon country of the united states only this rock was black doc had the balloon and camera up again and was using the monocular out on the desert a string of black smoke crawled upward the clockwork had set off the smoke bomb at the plane doc with the monocular saw a dozen whiterobed men on fast horses gallop out from tlie mountains they were to the west three more groups appeared others appeared from sand dunes far out on the desert all rode madly for the plane it was a big trap that was not going to catch anything doc hauled down the camera put the film through the tiny instantdeveloper tank and viewed it under a glass with microscopic power there were several pictures showing a group of men in a canyon mouth near the desert doc got into motion heading for that point but almost directly opposite the bronze man had made a plain trail thus far they could track him from the plane across the desert they could tell they had been tricked and they were almost certain to follow the bronze mans tracks doc had figured on that and he carefully made plain tracks he traveled an almost straight line as if he had a definite destination but his trail followed the high places and the edges of cliffs and finally he found that for which he searched it was a cliff straight up and down for almost a thousand feet except for a ledge about halfway down the ledge was covered with jagged rocks doc used his silken cord and grapple he always carried it to get down the face of the cliff that and his fabulous strength he made a dummy on the ledge it was more than his clothing stuffed with sand and a few tough dried bushes in the legs the torso the head he put bottles containing a fluid that was made red with chemicals he arranged the body so that it could be seen in part from the cliffs top then he climbed back up he broke loose a bit of rock on the cliff rim so that it would look as if he had fallen they would trail him here see the form below think it was docs body and shoot into it they would be almost certain to do that last and the red fluid would run leading them to think they had finished a wounded man there was about as much chance of them climbing down the cliff to the ledge as there was of them going to the good place when they died stay here doc told habeas habeas remained that would make it more realistic as if the pig had stood by the spot where the bronze man had died habeas could take care of himself the group of men which the aerial camera had showed in the canyon near the desert were not there when dcc savage arrived but their tracks were and they led back into the mountains doc followed the trail rather he paralleled it keeping well to the right or left crossing the trail at times to make sure it was still where he thought a precaution that in case they had left watchers doc left no noticeable footprints himself there was a watcher a white man in a pith helmet and shorts he sat on a ledge at the far end of a narrow highwalled crack in the stone he had rigged a sort of umbrella out of four stakes and some cloth that looked like a blanket a military machine gun was set up on a tripod mount in front of him it must have been a machine gun the arab allies had captured for it was of british manufacture the gunner was stationed just a bit too prominently doc savage studied the surrounding stone the stuff looked as hard as agate there were a few cracks and they ran in fairly straight lines this stone seemed to crack that way doc did not approach the gunner instead he withdrew changed his course and scaled with infinite difficulty the side of the canyon and got around the gunman there was no trail even docs skill cultivated for years was defeated the men had wrapped their shoes or gone barefoot although the latter was unlikely considering how hot the rocks were and nothing much less than a pickax blow would mark the flinty stone general inos men had made a plain trail to the gunner there had to be a reason for that the gunner wasnt the reason he was too prominent doc went back now showing himself and fell to rising his monocular on the route a man would logically follow in creeping upon the gunner there was only one route one particular spot in that route under an overhanging mass of stone was interesting when seen from a distance and through the monocular doc hunted found a loose stone then began a deliberate campaign of deceit he made his voice ventriloquial in quality sounding far away then he imitated a hyenas cackle the gunner looked only vaguely interested the sound belonged to these desert mountains doc brought his hyena a bit closer the gunner scowled shrugged and began to fish for a cigarette doc waited then he put his hyena laugh among the rocks so that the gunner could not tell where it was exactly the man lighted his cigarette ignoring the noise for a moment he had his hands up before his face doc flung his rock it hit the suspiciouslooking spot which the monocular had showed the bronze man was not surprised when there was a roar and the whole side fell out of the canyon the gunner startled turned loose his machine gun it gobbled and bullets clattered and whizzed in the falling rock doc imitated a scared hyena running away as fast as he could the gunner after he had time to think got up and cursed all hyenas at the top of his voice he had a nice fit on he kicked his machine gun over fifteen minutes later he had the gun folded and staggered off under its weight he cursed the british for making such heavy machine guns chapter the devil of the desert general ino said much too calmly men of our kind suffer from one disease which does not afflict others so seriously in our case it often proves fatal the disease is known as mistakes the sweatsoaked machine gunner stopped looking mad and registered hurt unease but it was a hyena he protested the cussed hound mustve walked over the sand that covered the trigger of the trap we had fixed up for doc savage he laughed around for a while before the explosive went off then i heard him leave in a hell of a hurry did you see this hyena ino asked the gunner thought for a moment and decided he had better have seen the hyena sure he lied i threw a rock at im but who the devil wouldve thought hed run toward me instead of away he jumped toward me an hit the trigger si si murmured general ino i see the gunner didnt like the tone he squirmed they stood in impressive surroundings there were rocks around them boulders the size of houses of skyscrapers some were as long as small ocean liners there were almost twenty armed men with general ino three out of four of them burnoosed arabs we heard the trap go off and were coming advised general ino we will take a look at the trap i looked around good said the gunner lying a little there aint nothing i tell you it was a hyena but they went back and looked prying up the rocks and scraping out sand and fragments it must have been a hyena all right general ino admitted at last the gunner wiped off sweat he was relieved general ino paced about in the sand for a time he seemed uneasy his lieutenant proudman shaster was not with the group there is nothing to do but wait general ino snapped finally we might as well go back and join the others as they went back it was noticeable that the white men kept close together and were unusually alert the black wall of rock shoved up about them and probably induced that feeling of inferiority that speckincreation twinge which is one of the big kicks of the grand canyon to most visitors but these men were not the kind to be made uneasy on that account a psychologist would have realized they were a bit afraid of the arabs their associates general inos men were watching the arabs they would probably have wasted their time had they watched their surroundings their back trail it would have taken sharper eyes than they possessed to discover doc savage following them proudman shaster two pistols in two holsters around his middle did not even make him look vicious was waiting at the foot of an inclined stone rampway that sloped upward and passed through a stone ridge this rampway nothing but a steep path had unquestionably been made by human hands and that a long time ago peydehehghan was with shaster pay day as monk called him was handcuffed wrist and ankle he looked quietly unhappy half a dozen whites were with shaster but no arabs this is not what i would call a really wonderful situation he greeted general ino ach himmel complained the general are you going to add to my troubles these arab rascals said shaster after making sure no arabs were close enough to hear hiring them to help us was a good idea as far as it went but this peydehehghan has put a bug in their ears i did not learn until too late that he can speak some kind of an ancient tongue that is similar to arabic general ino peered closely into shasters face you mean to tell me these arabs have learned what we are after iim afraid so general ino said several things about arabs of which mohammed would not have approved proudman shaster added sorrowfully that is not all they know either their sheik has a portable radio broadcast receiver and likes to tune in on cairo and jerusalem stations he heard a news bro dcast telling about us and how we have switched peydehehghans mummy for solomons damn these modern arabs general ino complained im keeping peydebehghan with me so that he cannot cause more trouble explaincd shaster i caught him talking to william harper littlejohn too general ino frowned reproachfully at the mummy man if you didnt know where your own tomb was id mummify you again he said calmly then to shaster come on well ask littlejohn what this backfromthedead lad told him littlejohn wont tell then well shoot him decided general ino in fact well probably shoot him anyway oui monsieur its a good idea peydehehghan did not follow them when they beckoned when they went back and grabbed him he kicked their shins threw sand in their faces and otherwise started putting up a fight but when general ino threatened calmly to slit his throat if he didnt come willingly peydehehghan quieted halfway to johnnys tent ino halted his group general ino frowned as he surveyed the faces of some arabs who were watching their movements they were forming in small groups i think he said quietly that we are in for some trouble the arab allies had withdrawn up the canyon grouped tightly they had been talking in low voices about what it was impossible to say but they glanced furtively and often at general ino shaster and the other whites now a harsh voice cried out in arabic kill the white men it yelled then a grenade went off it made a great roar lifted a cloud of sand and smoke between general ino and the arabs seize peydehehghan and make him tell us where the tomb is shrieked the arabic voice a second grenade made a whup noise this one was a smoker it spouted a mass of sepia vapor that hid general ino and the arabs completely from each other charge them screamed the arabic voice general ino whipped out an automatic pistol and let fly into the smoke pall in the general direction of his burnoosed allies naturally bullets came back more smoke bombs went whup whup a demolition grenade shook rocks off nearby walls black smoke wadded the canyon and in it a fierce fight waged general ino never got mixed up in personal violence if he could help it but he knew how to handle himself when he did he emptied his gun changed position while reloading emptied it again meantime he felt about for a sheltering rock proudman shaster screeched wrathfully and out of his clothing hauled a machete such as jungle travelers use to hack a trail he howled again then he charged straight for the arabs his mad pants drove spray through his teeth and he was not panting from exertion his cutoffahead madness had seized him again he fell over something went down in the black smoke it was impossible to see but he knew he had fallen over a human he struck furiously with his machete here you fool barked general inos voice then general ino located shasters head and gave it a tap with the automatic shaster sat down sober realizing he had almost killed by beheading his boss you bane too quick on trigger general ino admonished then when shaster had revived enough to hear wheres peydehehghan hell said shaster i thought you had hold of him the arabs were shouting and judging from the scattered shots running about a good deal theyre acting like indians shaster mumbled and his eyes began to look wild again while his hands got hard on the machetes handle general ino gave shaster a gentle shove in the direction of the arabs and said go get em proudman shaster went with that horrible look on his face and his machete held ready for cutting off a head general ino heaved a sigh sometimes when shaster had his head madness he forgot to distinguish friend from foe hell be the death of me yet the general muttered he listened to battle sounds and of a lot of arabs too but the shooting stopped suddenly we have been tricked shouted the head of this squad of desert riders you mean youve bit off more than you can swallow general ino called cautiously the arab cursed everything and everybody including his own father for raising such a stupid son none of us started that fight he yelled it was some one else velly solly no can believe snorted ino we did not throw the grenade declared the arab we have no grenades general ino rose from behind his rock like a bird weve been tricked he squawled there was a wind up the canyon but it took several minutes to blow the smoke cloud away in the meantime general ino and the others could do nothing but dash around and emit swear words the dispersing sepia showed two arabs lying headless on the sand general ino eased over alongside proudman shaster any of these allies of ours question mark know about that cleaver you carry under your coat no said shaster his mania had subsided better not tell em advised the general you think whatever he thought the general changed his mind when he counted the burnoosed arabs and discovered three were missing the bodies were not behind any nearby rocks deceivers he accused it became obvious that peydehehghan had also vanished thieves shrieked general ino three of you stole peydehehghan it was a rare occasion when general ino the debonair master mind who liked to play with simple phrases of foreign languages shrieked it looked for a moment as if the fight was ready to break out again but the burnoosed brown villains kept shaking their heads and swearing by the beard even the whole head of allah that there had been no plot of their knowledge then they all pitched in and hunted peydehehghan and the three missing bedouins they found tracks looking these over they decided the three children of the desert had made off with the mummy man they tried to follow the tracks they managed all of a hundred yards before they sat down on the sand baffled and tried to outmatch profanity general ino head in hands murmured never in my life was i through a fight in which i really knew less about what happened proudman shaster had been standing to one side wearing the attitude of a man in deep thought the general had presumed shaster was thinking about what would happen to him if the arabs learned he was the man who had cut off the heads of their two fellows the pair had been the only casualties in the fight the fact that the fight had all been a mistake might not make the bedoins see it right but shaster now came over a horrible suspicion has occurred to me he whispered in a horrified voice could that all have been the work of doc savage general ino nearly fell over flat on the sand he gurgled you think only a guess those smoke bombs the grenades these arabs seem genuinely puzzled general ino was a man too startled to speak came a rattling of hoofbeats down the canyon then many voices raised in song one chorus was sung in english and the next by the arabs bronzey marched to arabia oh aye oh bronzey marched to arabia poor bronze y the arabs filled in with about the same thing in their own language then the whites arabia all ahell oh aye oh off a rock he fell poor bronzey general ino did everything but have a fit in front of them this is a fine time to make up doggerel he shrieked then they told him doc savage was dead they had seen the bronze mans body where it had fallen down the cliff they had shot many bullets into it and red blood had run general ino looked much more cheerful proudman shaster said it was really wonderful now we can catch your three friends and peydehehghan general ino told the bedouins they set out to do that but first the arabs got off their horses got down with their foreheads on the sand and asked allah to be with them at least this once general ino decided they were really in earnest about it chapter crooked two the three missing arabs lay side by side in the shade under a rock shelf not one of the three could move his legs or his left arm each could move his right arm almost as well as usual none of them could move their throat muscles nor would their vocal cords function so they could not make a sound doc savage carefully put away the tiny hypo needle which he had used to inject the local anaesthetic which had paralyzed the certain parts of the prisoners he had used the local in concentrated form and it would be a day at least before the prisoners could do any moving around or yelling it would have been simpler to have made them entirely unconscious and left them hidden here for this spot was one that the closest search was not likely to find but there were the jackals and other roving desert beasts which would eat a helpless man doc had left each prisoner his knife they could defend themselves with the blades the three bedouins stared at the bronze giant goggleeyed they had been amazed since the bronze giant had seized them and whisked them away along with peydehehghan during the fight which they realized with astonishment doc had started at times this amazing man who looked so like solid metal had carried all three of them and the mummy man simultaneously and that without apparent great effort and at a pace that not many unburdened men could match doc savage spoke in the ancient tongue of peydehehghan we had best take ourselves from this spot he said he did not manage the dead language too well but it was far better than anything peydehehghan had been hearing pay day as monk had dubbed him showed even yellow teeth in a tight smile he was not an unhandsome rascal tell me he requested abruptly are you a mortal doc had to puzzle over the words briefly before be got them i am he admitted pay day said something too rapidly to be understood but it was evidently something to the effect that he had seen some miracles which had led him to doubt the bronze giants earthly qualities tell me pay day requested more slowly why have you seized me you know the loeation of a treasure doc said pay day had been the prize pirate pharaoh of his day this was something he understood it is my treasure he reminded but you are my captive dcc countered you cannot escape and you might have some unpleasant things done to you pay day ran his eyes over some of docs remarkable muscles it may be he admitted reluctantly it is also true that i did not trust those other men from whom you took me doc said children do not trust strangers and it is only fools who grow up pay day smiled again a bit more freely you wish to become my partner since when have bee hunters taken to sharing the honey with the bees doc countered pay day understood this kind of talk a wolf with two eyes may watch another wolf but not forty wolves be said exactly and two men can watch each other pay day had something else on his mind those men who had me prisoner feared you greatly they said you were a very great devil a matter of opinion doc suggested we could share halves offered pay day there is enough for many more for two doc shrugged said let us go pay day grinned evidently he had taken general inos statement that doc was a very great devil literally and was willing to consider a great devil as a partner doc savage and pay day moved cautiously that they might not be seen pay day said they have five of your men who are going to lose their heads doc countered does a fly help other flies which have gotten into the web of the spider pay day approved of that he cackled once a queer sound of mirth which would have moved a listener to reflect that laughs must have changed a lot in the last few thousand years they tortured me pay day said after a bit it is not a wise man who permits his right hand to be cut off when the golden shekel is in his left i gave them a general idea of where the tomb lies dcc savage stopped he let pay day see a critical and somewhat contemptuous frown on his features jackals always howl loudly in a trap he snapped pay day evidently felt he had to resent that he did it by glaring they imitated two hostile dogs for a while but it is a wise jackal who howls as if he were dying then bites when he has the chance the bronze man conceded finally that satisfied pay days dignity it appeared wisdom can recognize wisdom these men must be delayed doc said they are many doc nodded then said meaningly but many a man has drunk bad water and thought it tasted good pay day quit beating around the bush poison the friend of the worms which feed on the bodies of men doc said you have poison he is a fool who does not travel prepared pay day gobbled out his usual laugh i will show you where our enemies are encamped he said that was what doc had been angling for he wanted to rescue his five aids if possible had he come out with that pay day would probably have mentioned too many cooks spoiling a soup or the equivalent of his day and refused but guile and a little talk had led him on doc had not exactly lied they worked rapidly through the mountains monk lay on his back and complained this is what i call being a great help to doc he was tied so were the other four most securely ham snarled you hairy gossoon it was you who bought that basket of dates dont mention dates to me monk yelled dates ham said dates dates dates dates a sun helmet and a face came into the tent it was the kind of a face that would have frightened its owners mother to death bullets snarled the face bullets bullets a load of em if you dont quit talking all the time the magpies raised em bigfisted renny offered sourly bullets for you too said the face and withdrew whos that guy monk wanted to know in a whisper a renegade white was running with the arabs long tom advised i heard enough to know it was he who did the dickering that got the arabs lined up with general ino names sandy gaunt johnny supplied because they rather suspected the man sandy meant what he had said about the bullets they all fell silent it was very hot the tent seemed like white flame over them their captors had neglected to put a fly over the tent which would have helped with the heat hours passed their eyes filled with salty perspiration and when they turned over the hot sand stifled them too certain small crawling things had come out of the sand taken sample bites then gone back to bring millions of their brothers for two cents monk groaned id start yelling and let that guy sandy shoot me they robbed me ham snapped or id pay your bill finally there came a great deal of noise of horses and men and camels arriving there was some shouting in arabic general ino and all the rest of them are back johnny decided now maybe well get some relief johnny had not used a long word for hours and it was not exactly relief they were going to be offered general ino whipped the tent flap open take them out he directed strip them remove all their clothing hey monk yelled whats the idea of that so you can run faster general ino told him in that case youd better be shucking your duds monk glowered general ino laughed braggadocio is the resort of cowards not of brave men ham told monk i always told you robed bedoums entered the tent and disrobed the captives simply and effectively by ripping off the garments with their knives they were not too careful and inflicted small cuts outside swarthy men on camels and horses were lined tip rifles were slung over backs and pistols were holstered but each man held a knife or sword whatever cutting weapon he carried bigfisted renny peered about and was not encouraged by the expressions he saw holy cow he boomed just whats the idea you are going to be turned loose said general ino turned loose and given a chance to outrun the horses murmured the general havent you ever heard the old game of hound and hare the good arabian desert warriors version rennys long face became set you mean theyre going to ride us down and use those knives and swords a most accurate guess renny yelled nothing doing suit yourself youll probably change your mind after the first sword slash and run they usually do my sheetclad friends here tell me the prisoners were carried a short distance from the camp they were still tied wrist and ankle but now knives severed their wrists their ankles were left tied while the horses and camels were lined up apparently this had to be done just so long tom his face perceptibly paler than usual muttered these fellows cant be human theyve got the shape only monk agreed dryly ham suggested which is more than you can say it was almost grisly this wisecracking between the two the exchanging of insults but it had become a habit and those who knew them often swore they would rise out of their coffins just before they were buried to have a final word about how little each thought of the other an arab came running with hams pet chemistry the animal is to be given his chance with you advised general ino he has bitten every one who came near him ham grated the world has something to be proud of in you lads everything seemed to be about ready general ino drew his pistol and explained to make everything right ill fire a starting gun he raised his gun on a rocky peak two hundred yards away a man screamed he was a tall man with a swarthy face and even at that distance he was so distinctive that he could not be mistaken it was peyehehghan general inos gun did not explode on that occasion but the generals lungs did get him he howled quick in his excitement be used english which not many of the bedoums understood they hardly needed to understand for they were already riding madly for the exotic mummy man on the rocky spire the charge seemed to scare peydehehghan he whirled and vanished quick roared general ino you can trail him all the horses and all the camels were in the pursuit the men who were afoot charged also here general ino called some in arabic help me they did and tied the prisoners again then everybody rushed off after the mummy man within three minutes not a man was left around the tents peydehehghan was the prize the key to the treasure vaults of a looting pharaoh they all wanted him doc savage appeared in the camp he seemed to rise from the sand obviously he had crept close ahead of time and be had his knife ready for the ropes binding the prisoners run he directed cutting the cord that bound the prisoners but our clothes monk grated and them scuts may have left some extra guns run doc said they ran heads down sand so hot on their feet that they had to grimace all the time but they got out of the camp and into the black rock canyons and spires without a shot or a shout to show they bad been observed from now on i believe in miracles bigfisted renny rumbled softly itll be a miracle if this sand dont cook my feet ham complained you cant expect to be manly goin round cased up in them clothes like you wear monk assured him but they did not talk much for this was literally a time when they might easily talk themselves to death doc savage seemed to have picked out the course for their flight it soon led onto solid rock where they would leave no footprints the bronze man tore off parts of his clothing and gave the fragments to them to use in wiping off the sweat so the leakage would not leave betraying wet blotches on the sand every one but doc was startled when peydehehghan appeared unexpectedly before them good old pay day monk chortled you sure saved our skins pay day was not wearing the expression of a man who had done a good deed he looked mad he cackled at doc savage waving his arms doc rattled back pay day broke in they barked at each other ill be superamalgamated gasped johnny who was archaeologist and linguist enough to understand much of the ancient tongue peydehehghan is enraged because doc rescued us huh monk blinked peydehehghan says doc gave him to understand that the men were to be decoyed out of the camp so doc could poison their drinking water elaborated johnny but doc rescued us pay day i mean peydehehghan says doc doublecrossed him monk closed one eye and looked balefully at pay day with the other orb you mean this somethingoutofasarcophagus wants us dead a meticulous avouchment said johnny who was relieved enough to slide back toward big words im gonna kick his slats in monk declared monk delayed his rib damaging to watch doc and pay day argue heatedly the word exchange was furious first time i ever saw doc bandy a lot of words with anybody long tom grunted this peydehehghan is some thousands of years old johnny reminded with dignity he should be treated with consideration monk worked the toes of his kicking foot ive got the consideration treatment right down here but the argument ended with a shrug of resignation from pay day doc savage said he finally said everything was all right providing you fellows did not get any of his share of the tombs contents but he will bear watching from now on as a matter of fact he already bore watching he is as much a rascal perhaps as general ino and the others they got under way it being desirable to put as much ground between their enemies and themselves as possible as they plodded renny asked doc savage how did pay day get away from the arabs and ino so slick we fixed that up in advance doc explained pay day made a plain trail of a man running through the sand before he ever showed himself then after general inos crowd saw him he simply ducked away walked over stone and joined us general ino and the others saw the false trail of course and presumed it was a fresh one renny reminded theyre bound to discover their mistake it will soon be dark doc pointed out chapter tomb trap it got more than dark it got as black as it had the night before and there were the same clouds the same gobbling of thunder and snapping of lightning bolts it rarely rains two nights in a row in this region confided gaunt johnny who as a geologist knew a bit about the worlds surface this however is the rainy season so thats it monk snorted the rainy season say last night we were standing on a hill right on the top and the water got neck deep before it could run off peydehehghan was having a bit of difficulty with his direction he knew nothing about a compass they gave up trying to explain it to him neither did the aerial photographs which doc had taken mean anything to him johnny went over the photographs with great interest he seemed disappointed he began from my prolegomenon it is indubitable that there is no manifestation of any photographical listen groaned monk theres one guy here i cant understand pay day why not let im have the field to himself johnny looked pained said what i started to say was that i can see no sign of any tomb in these pictures that this whole bloody affair might have been over nothing was not a cheerful thought none of them commented peydehehghan finally got disgusted over his own inability to tell where he wanted to go he put on a demonstration throwing his hat down leaping upon it and generally acting up an angry child breaks his toys doc suggested dryly in the mummy mans tongue and a lake which has no outlet soon becomes stagnant countered the onetime pharaoh in his day he must have been something of a repartee artist five minutes later peydehehghan peered at a tall oddly shaped rock ridge pointed and made pleased clucking noises sounds like hed laid an egg monk said whats eatin him he says that is the ridge of the galloping lions doc translated a landmark he recognizes monk squinted at the contours of the ridge yeah it has got a distinctive shape but as for galloping lions it could be almost anything running walking or riding a bicycle said ham you talk too much peydeheghan headed for the ridge and they had to trot to keep up the mummy man found a narrow canyon and trotted into it light was immediately shut off by half making fast walking dangerous ouch renny complained falling over a rock we will chance a flashlight beam now and then doc decided brief dribbles of light showed the sides of the canyon like corridor walls it was not a black color but reddish and it was perforated everywhere with perfectly square holes about large enough for a man to walk through bigfisted renny stopped holy cow he rumbled for a minute i thought we were in a street and them holes were windows in the walls of buildings doc went over and splashed light into an opening they alt saw a room in the solid rock about the size of a railway box car along the walls were rock shelves about seven feet long three other stone rooms which they looked into were exactly the same bony johnny peered upward and said the canyon walls overhang so as to keep off tbe rain and sun that explains why these things are so well preserved because this rock is not very hard if you can keep on using little words you might tell me what weve been lookin at monk told him barracks johnny replied no doubt excavated for the slaves who built the tomb monk scratched the bristles atop his head and said if they went to that trouble buildin this tomb must have taken some time maybe a year johnny tried his ancient egyptian on peydehehghan he got an answer it took slaves one and one third anghs in number about nine years to construct the tomb johnny explained translating whats an angh about ten thousand whew thirteen thousand slaves nine years peydehehghan was anxious to go on and had walked off from them they ran ahead and caught him from time to time as he walked along the mummy man looked at them he seemed to have something on his mind but he kept it to himself ten i mean thirteen thousand slaves for nine years monk ruminated as he waddled along in the rear listen does anybody want to bet me pay days treasury or whatever he called his private loot pile is empty i wish johnny said caustically that you would stop calling this man pay day he was a pharaoh a great ruler in his day a man worthy of respect call him by his name peydehehghan all right monk said want to bet why what makes you think the wealth is gone with thirteen thousand slaves and there mustve been some guards knowing where this place was monk said i bet somebody came back and cleaned it out johnny thought that over and began to look worried johnny rarely got excited over money or treasure being like most genuine scholars but this was more than a treasure it might be one of the archaeological finds of the century i think i shall ask peydehehghan about that he said and did he came back looking as if he had just found a tarantula in his vest pocket he walked along without offering a word of explanation about what he had learned well monk prompted cat got your tongue peyehehghan said all of the slaves were executed when their work was done so that the location would remain a secret johnny said reluctantly jehoshaphat exclaimed monk were hobnobbing with one of the champion murderers of history peydehehghan stopped abruptly he has reached the mouth of the tomb doc called the mummy man had stopped beside a block of stone nearly fifty feet wide and about the same in height or so it looked when they threw their flashlight beams upward monk walked around the block its as square as hams head he said sarcastically he poked the stone thoughtfully with his finger nails then he felt around with his feet found a small rock and tapped the stone cube the rock was so hard it rang almost like steel sounds like monks brain overworking itself ham said bitingly what kind of rock is this monk asked paying no attention to the dapper lawyer johnny said a kind used in a number of ancient tombs it was brought from great distances some archaeologists believe the particular rock had a religious significance while others claim it was merely used because of its hardness probably searching for some sign of a door doc passed the flashlight beam along the stone cube the light passed over monk who like the others did not have a stitch of clothes ham burst out laughing youre sure a vision monk before monk thought up a reply peydehehghan spoke the mummy man sounded determined doc listened intently he says the tomb has not been touched doc savage translated for the others and he wants to know just where we stand on the dividing why everything will be sold to museums of course johnny said proceeds of sale to the museums will go to charity just as we usually do doc said quietly it will hardly do to tell him that let me bust im one monk suggested ill knock the argument out of im peydehehghan spoke again his tone told the listeners that he had a proposition he says doc translated that half is his and half mine and if the rest of you get any split it will be out of my share humor him ham suggested after we get our hands on the stuff we can let him keep as little as we want typical lawyer honesty in that suggestion monk jeered peydehehghan solved the dilemma by giving up he waved his arms shrugged turned and shoved against the side of the big stone block a secret door monk exploded they crowded around the mummy man when he signaled that they should help him shove they did so nothing as far as they could see happened there was no secret door but peydehehghan seemed satisfied he walked away from the block purposefully i dont savvy this monk complained the mummy man covered fully a hundred yards then climbed a sloping path and entered one of the stone barracks rooms he began stamping upon the floor of this a big slab of stone tilted up a few inches they grasped the panel of rock finished lifting it and revealed a shaftway just about as steep as a man could walk down without sliding doc could use his flashlight in here without danger of being seen peydehehghan grinned in the glow and said something he says the big block is just a blind although shoving on a certain part of it very hard works a long series of levers that unlock this slab johnny explained peydehehghan walked into the aperture doc and the others followed stringing out in single file the passage had a width of four feet twice that height it sloped enough to keep them from wanting to walk fast the mummy man stopped and gave a rock wedge a shove this caused a rumble and the rock slab behind them closed i was wonderin about that monk said if general ino came and found that open he could walk right in the tunnel sloped downward interminably at the same angle it had no branches and there was a monotonous sameness about the walls when it finally turned sharply they were all relieved the first of the carvings appeared in the tunnel it was cut into the wail was no more than a foot high and depicted a boy and an animal the animal resembled a sheep more than anything else the next carving was bigger the boy looked older and there were more sheep the art work was excellent for its period in the next the boy was a young man and he had donkeys and sheep let me have the flashlight bony johnny exclaimed eagerly i would like to study those a moment they are remarkable samples doc gave him the flashlight it was extremely dark in the passage the carvings grew in size and had the proportions of life the young man in them had put on arms in the next one he had a soldier or two behind him the numbers of the soldiers increased and became a legion the boy now a man did not have sheep any more he had cities pyramids tombs ships soldiers and women johnny asked peydehehghan something got an answer and translated it these carvings depict the rise of peydehehghan from a herdsmans son he explained the sculptored likeness of peydehehghan got more huge his great muscled arms encircled the passage conipletely then he grew so huge in stone that there was room for nothing but his head finally the passage ran up against the face alone and went through the huge mouth it was an effective depiction of a fellow who had ideas about gobbling the world human nature aint changed much monk muttered they had to bend over to get through the mouth johnny with the flashlight was treading peydehehghans heels as excited as a brood hen in a hawk raid the others followed and were in almost complete darkness there were hundreds of statutes of men and women kneeling and facing a door at the other end of the great room the figures were life size well done and made a creepy spectacle peydehehghan said something he says they are the nobles of his empire praying for him in the beyond johnny translated they are praying that when he becomes king of heaven he will not be too rough on the gods whom he took the job away from monk snorted wasnt he an optimist though peydehehghan walked across the room johnny kept at his beels lighting the way with the flashlight the mummy man was almost in the door when he whirled suddenly and pointed at the side of the room johnny looked in that direction peydehehghan kicked him in the stomach chapter thb sly mummy man peydehehghan leaped backward through the door instantly when his weight hit sliding rock rasped and thumped the mummy man cackled his shrill laughter it had a grisly quality he felt carefully and assured himself that the door was closed by a huge panel of stone the mummy man knew his surroundings he had no trouble without light he worked to the left crowded into a narrow shaft that had footholds cut into the rock he climbed a niche at the top held a number of weapons he seized these and tested them time had made the spears useless the heads came off the shafts when he tried them but a huge sword all of bronze satisfied him he carried it and crept along a passage until he found a rock in the floor which was fitted with handholds and held down by clever stone wedges he loosened the wedges grasped the handholds and lifted the stone he called to doc savage in his native tongue i tried to knock your follower away from the trapdoor before he accidentally tripped it the mummy man lied if you will come under this hole it may be that i can lower my arm and you can jump and grab it then peydehehghan got his bronze sword ready for the man of bronze then docs voice it was low and held a ventriloquial quality so that it was impossible to tell where the bronze man was spoke keep away from the hole doc said it is probably another trick monk shouted doc the way we came in is closed doc did not answer peydehehghan remained with the sword poised until his optimism gave out then he replaced the stone slab made sure the wedges were fast and crawled on and examined the other door the centuries had not interfered with the efficiency of that end of the trap it could be opened from this side but not from within and it was as thick as peydehehghan was tall the mummy man sat down to rest and to think he was not the man he had once been and the night had been brisk finally he arose and left the underground tunnels it was raining outside thunder and lightning made the black mountains as noisy as a battlefield considering the amount of water that was falling remarkably little was running along the floor of the canyon the mummy man waded in and it came barely to his ankles he chuckled to himself and once he glanced upward at the mountain over the tomb tunnels in a cunous way he went on the rain would wipe out tracks that might show that the mummy man had brought doc savage and his aids here the onetime pharaoh headed for general inos camp proudman shaster the barrister had been with general ino a long time and he had learned that when the general was calm when he should reasonably be tearing his hair it was a good time for keeping an eye open the general seemed to work backward he was maddest when he looked the calmest and he was calm now the arabs did not know their new chief they came in sheepishly reported no trace of doc savages men or peydehehghan and went off smiling when the general did not explode general ino looked at proudman shaster and said really i am so mad i could poison everybody here including myself shaster knotted his skinny hands together and looked miserable he did not look as if anything would ever be really wonderful again the storm gobbled and whooped in the distance every one was soaked and it was chilly general ino sat back and hummed he might have been happy he hummed a verse about a happy maiden in the tulips and repeated it in half a dozen languages finally be hummed it in the ancient fgyptian which peydebellghan spoke general ino had gone to trouble to learn the language and although he had not mastered it he had been able to make the mummy man understand and to comprehend what the former pharaoh said the general had a mind which could concentrate and learn almost anything in a short time when peydehehghan walked out of the desert night a burnoosed member of the arabian allies it was the white man named sandy yelled and nearly shot the mummy man peydehehghan gave them all a big happy smile then did some lying he told them that it was doc savage in a disguise who had stood on the hill and yelled not himself he said that he had been carried off unwillingly by doc savage general ino showed that he was shocked to learn doc savage was alive the mummy man finished by saying he had escaped and come back to them and that if they would protect him from doc savage he would show them the tomb everybody then set off for the tomb in great good humor upon reaching the canyon of the barracks caves peydehehghan walked to the big block of stone as he had done with doc savage it was almost dawn the mummy man pressed against the stone key after which they went to the barracks chamber and all filed into the sloping stone passage they did not have any flashlights and it was very dark give me some of the little sticks which when rubbed become hot and burn requested peydehehghan general ino willingly passed over a small box of matches the mummy man tried them out come he said in his tongue he took them to the room of the kneeling stone statues he was well ahead and halfway across the room when he stopped the others there is a trap here for thieves he said i shall go ahead and stop it from operating you others remain here for a moment he was almost at the other end of the room when general ino decided ill go with you general ino was too late peydehehghan gave a leap reached a narrow door the others had not seen lunged through it jerked out stone wedges and a rock slab closed the opening noisily then the mummy man raced down a passage and got the exit the stone mouth shut also a few minutes later he was at a small opening which gave into the room where the prisoners were general ino and the rest were doing so much shouting that the mummy man had to squawi several times before they stopped and listened to him then somebody shot at the spot from which peydebeb ghans voice came the bullet missed the mummy man showed no concern but that was ignorance not bravery he did not yet understand what a gun was or how a bullet could kill listen to me he requested we are listening general ino told him having much trouble with the ancient words it is a foolish fox who thinks he alone is sly said peydehehghan general ino snarled are you goin to gloat or say something say something the pirate pharaoh said and proceeded to do so he told them that doc savage and his aids were imprisoned in the next room and that he was going to operate a device that would open the door between the rooms they could fight it out general ino yelled frantic orders his men still had their weapons guns were cocked in the darkness when they heard the grinding of the stone slab opening they all charged forward only four got through the narrow hole at once general ino and shaster were prudently not among the four the four fired a volley of shots and nearly deafened themselves there was no answer no sound to show that they had hit any one or that any one was going to attack them they began prowling in search of the enemy doing it as quietly as possible peydehehghan heard the silence and knew something was wrong he scuttled to the hole in the ceiling of the room in which he had trapped doc savages party it was too dark to see much and his ears told him disgustingly little he got out his matches tore off a sleeve of his burnoose and set it afire when it blazed he dropped it through the hole then glanced down cautiously doc savage and his aids were not in the trap directly behind peydehehghan monks small boylike voice said gleefully brothers have i been waiting for this moment then monk got hold of the mummy mans throat peydehehghan had lived in an age when a fight was a fight and they did not stand off and shoot bullets at each other he reached up got monks bynomeanssmall ears and did his best to pull them off monk squawled and hit the mummy man over a kidney peydehehghan bit off a mouthful of monks left arm they fell to hitting each other so fast that they both lost count ham johnny and renny grabbed monk and hauled him off while doc savage held the mummy man ham yelled angrily monk was only to grab him monk snarled i hadda defend myself peyehehghan tried numerous roughandtumble tricks trying to escape from doc and had no luck he gave up he panted noisily in the darkness until he had regained his breath general inos crowd had heard the melee and the words they howled like wolves and shot through the ceiling hole general ino swore in several languages thats sure music bigfisted renny rumbled listening to the exasperated profanity peydehehghan growled curiously you must indeed be men of magic that you can pass through stone walls johnny understood that and asked the others shall we tell him that doc was suspicious when we came in here and after he gave me the flashlight he dropped way back so that he was not even in the room when we were trapped long tom snapped sure tell him itll puncture some of his conceit tell him how doc used ventriloquism to make him think he was in the room when as a matter of fact doc was right beside pay day tell him doc got us out and that we all were right on his trail and watching him when he went to get general inos mob and trapped them too my suggestion is that if he thinks we are magicians let him go on thinking it doc put in quietly they stood there not sure what they would do next monk examining his bitten arm grumbled i hope that exmummy aint poison he fanged you ham asked anxiously monk said i guess ill live i was worried about pay day ham said general ino and his men stopped swearing and shooting the general began whispering but they could not hear what he was saying theyre hatchin something renny decided peydehehghan squirmed doc had not turned him loose again we will see how this fellow bluffs doc said the bronze man changed his grip to the mummy mans throat he squeezed enough to give the fellow an idea of what dying by that method would be like we have no further use for you he told peydehebghan no wise man burdens himself with ashes of the firewood he has already burned the mummy man gobbled air into his lungs he was rascal enough himself to think doc meant it wait he exclaimed in his strange hardtounderstand tongue it is very hard to get into the tomb it will take you much time i will show you in exchange for my life doc waited long enough for it to seem he was considering the offer very well he agreed they made a compact group around the mummy man as he moved forward renny carried docs flashlight the parts of the tomb which they had already seen had not been especially impressive and they had suspected all along that this was an outer passage containing a few traps to discourage vandals the mummy man came to an arched opening cut in the solid stone the aperture was surrounded by chiseled hieroglyphics whew said johnny after he had puzzled over the characters whats it say long tom wanted to know a curse on any one who enters johnny explained it promises a number of horrible forms of death to all who defy the curse but it need not alarm you these tombs usually have such curses carved upon them monk mumbled thoughtfully yeah but i always think of that tutankhamen tomb they opened years ago didnt just about everybody concerned with that die in some strange way or another coincidence purely johnny assured him peydehehghan did not help monks peace of mind when he paused to stare dramatically at the hieroglyphics then get down and touch his forehead to the rock before them at the end of a short corridor beyond the opening was a wall of masonry blocks sealed with mortar the mummy man told doc savage we will have to remove those stones doc went to work on the joints his knife had a blade of more than ordinary temper and it loosened the mortar fifteen minutes saw the first block out and the rest were easy peydehehghan spoke in a worried voice he says the stones should not have been that easy to remove doc translated he thinks they have been tampered with monk exploded something like that they were prepared for the confusion into which they walked great jars were in fragments on the stone floor mummy cases had been torn open the ornaments probably gold and jewels pried off mummies had been unwrapped kicked to pieces precious metal inlays had been pried out of the walls it had all been done thousands of years ago just another tomb johnny groaned already rifled a vast rumbling noise throbbed against their ears chapter the fight in the tomb the rumble came abruptly at first like a thunderclap and its echoes throbbed and thumped as thunder does another daggone rain monk said hollowly doc rapped quick hack the way we came monk began but what that was explosive not thunder doc said sharply general ino and his men must be blowing their way out they raced for the noise the disappointment of finding the tomb empty after so much trouble instead of being a letdown had enraged them made them ripe for a fight monk paused to grab peydehehghan youre comm along monk gritted and if you think you aint just make a pass at me the mummy man was meek spirit seemed to have gone out of him there was another explosion louder because they were closer an instant later the smell of burned powder was in their nostrils doc in the lead heard or saw something for he blocked their way crowded them back around a corner an instant later guns smashed and lead raked at the stone were in swell shape for a fight renny complained they were still naked weaponless doc pressed them back until they were behind the stone slab of a door existence of which could be detected only on close examination wait here he directed he produced from a pocket of a carrier vest which he wore under his clothing several small glass balls in a metal case he gave these to long tom anaesthetic grenades the bronze man explained six of them all we have use them only as you have to long tom exploded but you doc did not explain he glided through the door and closed it behind him the bronze mans aids listened and almost immediately there was a burst of shots excited yells monk snarled i aint gonna stay here while doc takes all the chances he lunged for the door but renny and long tom both got in his way renny let his flashlight go out dont be a sucker renny advised doc knows what hes doin yes ham put in try for once to have some sense renny had not turned his flashlight on again the device had to be wound every few minutes for a spring operated the tiny generator that served instead of a battery long tom grunted suddenly explosively in the darkness there were scuffling sounds hold your breath long tom yelled pay day broke anaesthetic grenades his warning was too late for the others had leaped forward and were already in the anaesthetic gas they could not tell the stuff was odorless and colorless it did not even burn their lungs the feeling of irresistible drowsiness went warmly over them and chased away any desire to fight any interest in what was happening or might happen the last of the five and peydehehghan were asleep before a minute had passed on the other side of the stone door general inos voice said loudly theyre in here i heard them yell help me find how this door opens it was not a bard door to open and the anaesthetic gas would not affect them when they got in the stuff became ineffective after mingling with the air less than a minute general ino warned watch out for that doc savage and repeated the admonition in arabic doc savage was having some difficulty but not inside the labyrinthian passages of the tomb he was outdoors the sky had an unnatural clarity if one did not know the desert and stars were like a million sparks storm clouds walled the west like a skulking monster that rumbled and snorted lurid flame the bronze man was trying to climb the sides of the canyon he had his silken cord unwrapped to its longest and was flipping the collapsible grapple upward each time it failed to catch and came clinking back he changed his position gliding along the wall of stone tried again no luck he stepped back the wall was much too sheer it looked as if every handhold had been carefully chiseled away nature had never made a wall that smooth after his survey doc picked another spot on the third attempt the grapple held but pulled loose when he was almost a score of feet up he landed with catlike ease from a fall that would have crippled many men he tried twice more then the rope held and he climbed only a ledge but it was over halfway up he threw the grapple and it came back with heartbreaking regularity then it caught he climbed and stood on the flat top of a tableland all solid rock but it was not level it sloped from all sides toward the middle almost a cup the bronze man seemed to know what he was doing he ran down the sloping stone careful of his footing and reached a black patch that was almost circular and nearly ten feet across it was a hole starglow did not penetrate far into it for it went straight down no loose stones were about doc dug out a coin a half dollar he waited until the thunder was quiet in the west then dropped the half the sound which came up out of the hole was such a noise as can be made by putting a finger in the mouth and pulling it out again hard the bronze man seemed satisfied as if he had proven something important he glided hack to the cliffs face and let himself down to the canyon floor with the grapple he headed for the mouth of the tomb the bronze man was always cautious it was one of the reasons he had lived now he did something that might have seemed unnecessary he stopped outside the entrance of the barracks chamber from which access to the tomb was had didnt you see him he called harshly in arabic wallah exploded a voice inside in arabic did he pass there were guards at the entrance doc had sounded like one of them and they had been deceived there is another way out doc growled in arabic he escaped by that route and may come this way i am coming in to help you watch he walked boldly into the rock chamber there were two of the guards it was dark enough that they did not recognize him in time doc struck ones jaw and the fellow trotted back against the wall stood there a moment then fell on his face the other grabbed for his rifle trigger doc got his hands brought an elbow up under the mans ear then swung at his temple the bedouin was quick he dodged the second blow backpedaled got a knife out he had confidence in his knife he leaped the knife blade bad been blued or painted so that it did not gleam in the moonlight which was reflected into the place the fellow did not slash or swing he held the blade ready for a sudden dart the most difficult blow to stop or dodge the undertheear blow had paralyzed the mans throat muscles trying to yell he made only croakings but he would yell before long doc threw his shoulders down his feet forward his feet hit the others ankles he upset doc grabbed the mans legs but released them instantly so that the slash the fellow made with his knife missed the swing carried the weapon arm around to the mans side doc leaning forward made his fist reach the fellows jaw doc got into the arabs burnoose it was not a good fit he carried the other bedouins white garment and both their weapons and found the stone trapdoor open the passage and the rooms of the tomb were too quiet he did not hear voices until he reached the chamber where they had found evidence of vandalism the rifled tomb itself general ino was saying we had them once and didnt do it thats one mistake we wont make twice oui rnonsieurs shaster asked harshly how proudman shaster sounded as if he were in the grip of his beheading fever can you cut off a head with that the general questioned quietly i can make a really wonderful try when doc looked into the chamber proudman shaster was leaning over ham with a machete the same weapon with which he had beheaded the arabs in the fight which had all been a mistake doc had an easy shot with one of the rifles he had just captured shaster all his teeth showing his eyes popping set himself for a blow and was motionless an instant the flame from the rifle muzzle seemed to leap almost to shasters knife hand the shot crashed thundered died out and left only shasters scream of agony two of the bedoins were furnishing light and odor with torches they had improvised out of their flowing garments their surprised leaps caused showers of sparks to fall shaster went to the floor with his mangled hand he bellowed like a branded animal one long bawl after another the white renegade of the bedouins sandy kept his head better than the others his pistol came out of its holster spouting lead doc did not shoot at him he got the men with the torches firing at their hands one torch went out several of the men were shooting by now doc spun yelled out in his natural voice so they would have no doubt about who he was and ran he traveled fast for death was at his heelsand he had a certain spot he wanted to reach in a great hurry he dropped his rifle he made it crawled through the opening which was carved to resemble a great human mouth howling shooting the foes were no more than a score of feet behind doc leaped his fingers caught the elaborate carving of the headdress and he hauled himself up he had room enough to cling there just above the opening but by little more than stretching their hands up the men could touch him as they came through the first of the arabs charged through three of them shoulder to shoulder doc had dropped his rifle but he still held a revolver he had taken from one of the doorguarding bedoums it was a cheap gun he cocked it and tossed it far down the corridor in the direction he would have taken had he continued his flight the gun hit jarred off exploded that was because it was cheap but there was a touch of luck too the bullet came back and shot two arabs through the legs they squawled returned the fire imagining it had come from their quarry they were not cowards they charged wrecklessly the men flowed under doc with giddy speed general ino and proudman shaster were last doc let them get away then dropped down and ran to his five aids and peydehehghan chapter water the effects of the anaesthetic gas did not usually wear off in less than half an hour and nowhere near that time had elapsed doc however carried it occupied the tiniest space a hypodermic needle containing several shots of a drug which once it was in the system neutralized the stupefying effects of the anaesthetic and would revive a victim in a few minutes he used that now monk with the physique of the gorilla he resembled was the first to turn over and get up he took a swing at ham seeing him near then fell upon the lawyer and began pounding him monk had awakened with what is sometimes called an anaesthetic drunk doc grabbed him shook him and monk came out of it well ive been wantin to lambaste ham anyway he mumbled peydehehghan was the last to recover he got up shakily looking bewildered ill bet this modern world is turning out to be quite a thing for him long tom said dryly i wonder how he likes it running feet approached along the passages enough of them that their sound was a dull roar found they were tricked doc said we had better move this place aint extensive enough for much fightin monk complained doc scooped up the rifle which he had dropped picked up another lying near by renny got proudman shasters machete one of the torchcarrying arabs had also dropped a weapon and johnny appropriated that they scattered seeking an exit holy cow renny boomed there aint any way out but there was peydehehghan showed it to them he shoved on the wall and a stone slab fell into another passage on the opposite side the slab was not hinged it fell heavily made much noise and broke in several pieces so they could not replace it they scrambled over the fragments several shots banged and the bullets narrowly missed ham who was the last through they must have kicked me when unconscious ham gasped i hurt all over monk heard that rushed back and helped ham this was so unexpected that ham nearly fell down ham had no way of knowing it was contriteness which was moving the homely chemist ham had been senseless when monk anaesthetic drunk had pummeled him but monk knew that was what had almost disabled ham they made time until peydehehghan suddenly whipped away from them and ran back toward general inos men fool renny bellowed hell get killed the mummy man was squawling something in his tongue and when renny tried to pursue him doc stopped the bigfisted chemist listen doc rapped peydehehghan repeated what he was yelling johnny translated he says for us to go on he will lead them off and lose them on another route general inos mob had stopped shooting but they were still coming peydehehghan howled something else he says to crawl into a niche a short distance down this passage johnny exploded quiet doc warned that was so that general inos men would not hear them they were close their hard breathing was audible like many snakes hissing then peydehehghan yelled out shrilly angrily it was plain that he was attracting general inos men he succeeded and they turned their charge in that direction doc and his men were left to themselves monk breathed softly ive cussed that mummy guy and ive wanted to wring his neck but from now on he can have what ive got hes risking his life to save ours doc said do not be too sure of that we had better move huh quick explanations can wait they crept forward quietly heading for the exit alert for some signs of straggling foes but the enemy seemed to have kept together they were all on the trail of the mummy man even proudman shaster and the torch bearers with their shattered hands creeping along each of docs men unexpectedly found the bronze giant beside them he pressed something into their hands something round and hard and about the size of a garden pea put that in your mouth he told each one have it ready to break with your teeth i dont get this monk complained pay day told us to stay in that niche but you doc ham interrupted youre going to talk us all into a grave with that curiosity of yours pipe down they were in the chamber of the kneeling stone statues when the great gurgling noise first reached their ears run doc rapped they ran but they were not across the room when the water hit them it seemed to pour through doors through openings in the ceiling great falls of it a yard across break those pellets doc shouted keep them in your mouths and hold your breath the water came down with niagara violence the flood of it washed them off their feet pummeled them about smashed them against the statues washed the statues over it roared and boiled and time after time they fought to the top until there was no top for the water had filled the room completely through it all they kept their mouths closed and did not breathe they knew now why doc had told them to do that the pellets held a chemical not oxygen some chemical mixture which supplied for a few minutes the effect which oxygen supplied upon the human system after a time they found the bronze man seeking them out assembling them one at a time at the door and when they were all there guiding them forward swimming until at last they reached the exit in the barracks room it was no trouble to get out water was boiling up through the hole for the tomb was completely flooded they were washed out and onto the floor of the canyon bruised ill and almost suffocated for the chemical pellets were losing their effect doc got them away from the water and they all lay there for a time the top of the cliff is hollowed out to catch rainwater doc explained at last the water runs into a reservoir under the rock evidently and it can be made to flood the tomb when a trap is set off it must have been one of peydehehghans traps for robbers who came to rifle his tomb or more properly his treasure storehouse monk muttered then peydehehghan drowned himself to get the rest of us you should know peydehehghan better than that by now doc said dryly you mean he got away probably they found no signs to show that peydehehghan had gotten away they searched but these black rock mountains did not hold a trail there was stone everywhere so hard that it would take no mark from hobnails much less bare human feet they did find the pets habeas and chemistry roaming next they tried to get into the tomb the water had filled it and docs chemical pellets were not effective enough to permit them to explore it after they had tried several times long tom said if doc hadnt guessed what pay day was up to and gotten us part of the way out wed never have made it they were very tired they slept the rest of the night after a fashion next morning doc announced we will start a shaft to drain the tomb monk never backward suggested doubtfully i can get along without seeing the inside of that place again we will drain it doc said theydrained it and the labor took three weeks they used metal parts of their planes motors for tool material and there was plenty of food from the arab camp they sent the shaft in from the canyon floor and the water ran out for almost three hours then they went in with torches general ino proudman shaster sandy the rest had died they found the bodies they did not find peydehehghans body but they found something that peydehehghan from what they had seen of him would almost have given his life to keep them from finding doc located it after six hours of sounding with a hammer from the plane it was not a door but a stretch of the stone which rang hollow they spent two hours breaking through doc stood beside the opening and motioned johnny the archaeologist want to be first think its safe johnny asked doubtfully it may be worth the chance doc said johnny stepped through or partway through and used one of the flashlights which they had found in the plane he stood there for an unexpectedly long time then he drew hack his face was distinctly white his eyes brighter than any of the others ever remembered having seen them it was worth it he said hoarsely they all went in when they got out again they had to sit in the shade of the canyon wall for some time before they felt like discussing what they had found then they spoke about it in whispers without knowing why for they were men who had seen fabulous wealth before the treasure of peydehehghan johnny said slowly and using small words supposed to be one of the great lost hoards of history and not exaggerated a darn bit said renny for once not rumbling monk who occasionally took an interest in jewels muttered ive been tryin to figure up what the stuff in that first vase or bowl the one next to where we broke in is worth listen i counted a hundred and eleven diamonds and not one of em less than five carats or im dizzy he sighed aw nuts im dizzy anyway the first true thing you ever said ham remarked unkindly i wonder long tom pondered aloud how much was taken by the thieves from that outer tomb the one that was vandalized nothing probably doc said there were probably never any vandals long tom exploded i dont get you peydehehghan doc explained was a smooth article it is my guess that he rigged up that outer tomb to make it look as if it had been sacked then concealed the entrance to the inner treasure trove thoroughly any one finding the outer tomb which was easy to find but not too easy would have thought the place had already been ransacked of all valuables it was a trick if we find him well ask him about that long tom suggested they next heard of peydehehghan in a queer way it was after they were in cairo shipping the relics from the tomb converting the wealth into funds for hospitals and the great charity organization of which doc was a director they did not hear of peydehehghan directly but they did hear of a tall strangelooking man dark of skin with a flowing white beard and hair who had come in out of the desert unable to speak a word of any language the best interpreters knew the strange mans picture had been in the newspapers and doc got copies of the journals it had been peydehehghan the strange mans picture had been in the papers because of the way he had died he had been walking along the street when he had heard a radio loudspeaker which stood in front of a music store instantly he had dashed into the street as if fleeing from the loudspeaker and a car had run over him and killed him the speaker on the radio at the time had been the wellknown american doc savage announcing the discovery of a treasure tomb in the nubian desert the end
