night without end by alistair maclean contents monday midnight monday am am monday am am monday am pm monday pm pm monday pm tuesday am tuesday am tuesday midnight wednesday am pm wednesdaypm thursday pm thursday pm friday pm friday pm saturday pm saturday pm pm chapter one monday midnight it was jackstraw who heard it first it was always jackstraw whose hearing was an even match for his phenomenal eyesight who heard things first tired of having my exposed hands alternately frozen i had dropped my book zipped my sleepingbag up to the chin and was drowsily watching him carving figurines from a length of inferior narwhal tusk when his hands suddenly fell still and he sat quite motionless then unhurriedly as always he dropped the piece of bone into the coffeepan that simmered gently by the side of our oilburner stove curio collectors paid fancy prices for what they imagined to be the dark ivory of fossilised elephant tusks rose and put his ear to the ventilation shaft his eyes remote in the unseeing gaze of a man lost in listening a couple of seconds were enough aeroplane he announced casually aeroplane i propped myself up on an elbow and stared at him jackstraw youve been hitting the methylated spirits again indeed no dr mason the blue eyes so incongruously at variance with the swarthy face and the broad eskimo cheekbones crinkled into a smile coffee was jackstraws strongest tipple and we both knew it i can hear it plainly now you must come and listen no thanks it had taken me fifteen minutes to thaw out the frozen condensation in my sleepingbag and i was just beginning to feel warm for the first time heaven only knew that the presence of a plane in the heart of that desolate ice plateau was singular enough in the four months since our igy station had been set up this was the first time we had had any contact however indirectly with the world and the civilisation that lay so unimaginably beyond our horizons but it wasnt going to help either the plane or myself if i got my feet frozen again i lay back and stared up through our two plate glass skylights but as always they were completely opaque covered with a thick coating of rime and dusting of snow i looked away from the skylights across to where joss our young cockney radioman was stirring uneasily in his sleep then back to jackstraw still hear it getting louder all the time dr mason louder and closer i wondered vaguely vaguely and a trifle irritably for this was our world a tightlyknit compact little world and visitors werent welcome what plane it could be a met plane from thule possibly possibly but unlikely thule was all of six hundred miles away and our own weather reports went there three times a day or perhaps a strategic air command bomber testing out the dewline the americans distant early warning radar system or even some civilian proving flight on a new transpolar route or maybe some base plane from down by godthaab dr mason jackstraws voice was quick urgent its in trouble i think its circling us lower and closer all the time a big plane im sure many motors damn i said feelingly i reached out for the silk gloves that always hung at night above my head pulled them on unzipped my sleepingbag swore under my breath as the freezing air struck at my shivering skin and grabbed for my clothes half an hour only since i had put them off but already they were stiff awkward to handle and abominably cold it was a rare day indeed when the temperature inside the cabin rose above freezing point but i had them on long underwear woollen shirt breeches silklined woollen parka two pairs of socks and my felt cabin shoes in thirty seconds flat in latitude north feet up on the greenland icecap selfpreservation makes for a remarkable turn of speed i crossed the cabin to where no more than a nose showed through a tiny gap in a sleepingbag wake up joss i shook him until he reached out a hand and pushed the hood off his dark tousled head wake up boy it looks as if we might need you what whats the trouble he rubbed the sleep from his eyes and stared up at the chronometer above his head midnight ive been asleep only half an hour i know sorry but get a move on i recrossed the cabin passed by the big rca transmitter and stove and halted in front of the instrument table the register showed the wind ene velocity knots near enough miles per hour on a night like this with the icecrystals and drift lifting off the icecap clogging and slowing up the anemometer cups the true speed was probably half as much again and the pen of the alcohol thermograph was running evenly along the red circle of degrees below zero degrees of frost i thought of the evil combination of these two factors of wind and cold and felt my skin crawl already jackstraw was silently climbing into his furs i did the same caribou trousers and parka with reindeer fur trimmed hood all beautifully tailored by jackstraws wife sealskin boots woollen mittens and reindeer gloves i could hear the plane quite clearly now and so too i could see did joss the deep even throb of its motors was plain even above the frantic rattling of the anemometer cups its its an aeroplane you could see that he was still trying to convince himself what did you think it was one of your precious london doubledeckers i slipped snowmask and goggles round my neck and picked up a torch from the shelf beside the stove it was kept there to keep the dry batteries from freezing been circling for the past two or three minutes jackstraw thinks its in trouble and i agree joss listened engines sound ok to me and to me but engine failure is only one of a dozen possible reasons but why circle here how the devil should i know probably because he can see our lights the only lights at a guess in square miles and if he has to put down which god forbid he stands his only chance of survival if he puts down near some human habitation heaven help them joss said soberly he added something else but i didnt wait to hear i wanted to get up top as quickly as possible to leave our cabin we had to use a trapdoor not an ordinary door our cabin a prefabricated sectioned structure that had been hauled up from the coast on tractor sleds during the month of july was deepsunk in a great oblong hole that had been gouged out from the surface of the icecap so that only the top few inches of its flat roof projected above ground level the trapdoor hinged at both ends so that it could open either upwards or downwards was reached by a short steep flight of steps i climbed the first two of these took down the wooden mallet that hung there permanently by the wall and pounded round the already bruised and splintered edges of the trap to loosen the ice that held it locked fast this was an almost invariable routine whenever the trap had previously been opened for any length of time at all the layer of warm air that always lay under the roof seeped slowly out melting the surrounding snow which promptly turned to ice when the trap was closed again tonight the ice cracked easily i got my shoulder under the trap levered upwards against the accumulated drift of snow above and scrambled out i was prepared for what awaited me up top the gasping panicstricken feeling of suffocation as the warm air was sucked from my lungs by that deadly numbing cold but even so i wasnt sufficiently prepared the wind speed was far higher than i had feared bent double and coughing violently breathing shallowly to avoid frosting my lungs i turned my back to the wind breathed into my reindeer gloves slipped on my snowmask and goggles and straightened jackstraw was already standing by my side the wind on the icecap never howled or shrieked it moaned instead a lowpitched unutterably eerie ululation a requiem for the damned if ever there was one the agony of some soul lost in torment that same moan had driven men mad before now less than two months previously i had had to send our tractor mechanic a completely broken youngster who had lost all contact with the last shadow of reality back to our uplavnik base the wind had done that to him tonight its desolate threnody boomed and faded boomed and faded in the lower registers of sound with an intensity which i had seldom heard while its fingers plucked at the tightly strung guy ropes of the radio antenna and instrument shelters to provide its own whistling obbligato of unearthly music but i was in no mood then to listen to its music and indeed that sepulchral wailing was not the dominant sound on the icecap that night the throbbing roar of big aero engines surging and receding as the wind gusted and fell away like surf on some distant shore was very close now the sound lay to windward of us at that moment and we turned to face it but we were blind although the sky was overcast there was no snow that night at any time heavy snowfalls strangely enough are all but unknown on the greenland icecap but the air was full of millions of driving needlepointed ice spicules that swept towards us out of the impenetrable darkness to the east clogging up our goggles in a matter of seconds and stinging the narrow exposed area of my face between mask and goggles like a thousand infuriated hornets a sharp exquisite pain a pain that vanished almost in the moment of arrival as the countless subzero spicules dug deep with their anaesthetising needles and drove out all sensation from the skin but i knew this ominous absence of feeling all too well once again i turned my back to the wind kneaded the deadened flesh with mittened hands till the blood came throbbing back then pulled my snowmask higher still the plane was flying in an anticlockwise direction following it seemed the path of an irregular oval for the sound of its motors faded slightly as it curved round to north and west but within thirty seconds it was approaching again in a swelling thunder of sound to the southwest to the leeward of us that was and i could tell from jackstraws explosive ejaculation of sound muffled behind his mask that he had seen it at the same moment as myself it was less than half a mile distant no more than five hundred feet above the icecap and during the five seconds it remained inside my line of vision i felt my mouth go dry and my heart begin to thud heavily in my chest no sac bomber this nor a thule met plane both with crews highly trained in the grim craft of arctic survival that long row of brightly illuminated cabin windows could belong to only one thing a transatlantic or transpolar airliner you saw it dr mason jackstraws snowmask was close to my ear i saw it it was all i could think to say but what i was seeing then was not the plane now again vanished into the flying ice and drift but the inside of the plane with the passengers god how many passengers fifty seventy sitting in the cosy security of their pressurised cabin with an airconditioned temperature of f then the crash the tearing jagged screeching that set the teeth on edge as the thin metal shell ripped along its length and the tidal wave of that dreadful cold degrees below cabin temperature swept in and engulfed the survivors the dazed the injured the unconscious and the dying as they sat or lay crumpled in the wreckage of the seats clad only in thin suits and dresses the plane had completed a full circuit and was coming round again if anything it was even closer this time at least a hundred feet lower and it seemed to have lost some speed it might have been doing perhaps miles an hour i was no expert in these things but for that size of plane so close to the ground it seemed a dangerously low speed i wondered just how effective the pilots windscreen wipers would be against these flying ice spicules and then i forgot all about that forgot all about everything except the desperate urgent need for speed just before the plane had turned round to the east again and so out of the line of our blinded vision it had seemed to dip and at the same instant two powerful lights stabbed out into the darkness the one lancing straight ahead a narrow powerful beam glittering and gleaming with millions of sparkling diamond points of flame as the icecrystals in the air flashed across its path the other a broader fan of light pointing downwards and only slightly ahead its oval outline flitting across the frozen snow like some flickering will o the wisp i grabbed jackstraws arm and put my head close to his hes going to land hes looking for a place to put down get the dogs harness them up we had a tractor but heaven only knew how long it would have taken to start it on a night like this til give you a hand as soon as i can he nodded turned and was lost to sight in a moment i turned too cursed as my face collided with the slatted sides of the instrument shelter then jumped for the hatch sliding down to the floor of the cabin on back and arms without bothering to use the steps joss already completely clad in his furs but with the hood of his parka hanging over his shoulders was just emerging from the food and fuel tunnel which led off from the other end of the cabin his arms loaded with equipment grab all the warm clothing you can find joss i told him quickly i was trying to think as quickly and coherently as i was talking to figure out everything that we might require but it wasnt easy that intense cold numbed the mind almost as much as it did the body sleepingbags blankets spare coats shirts it doesnt matter whose they are shove them into a couple of gunny sacks you think theyre going to land sir curiosity anticipation horror each struggled for supremacy in the thin dark intelligent face you really think so i think theyre going to try what have you got there fire bombs a couple of pyrenes he dumped them by the stove hope theyre not solid good boy and a couple of the tractor extinguishers the nuswifts g think a great help these little things are going to be i thought if several thousand gallons of petrol decide to go up in flames fire axes crowbars canes the homing spool for heavens sake dont forget the hojning spool and the searchlight battery be sure and wrap that up well bandages no need seventy degrees of frost will freeze blood and seal a wound quicker than any bandage but bring the morphia kit any water in these two buckets full but more ice than water put them on the stove and dont forget to turn out the stove and both the lights before you leave incongruously enough we who could survive in the arctic only by virtue of fire feared it above all else pile the rest of the stuff up by the instrument shelter i found jackstraw working only by the feeble light of his torch outside the leanto driftwalled shelter that we had built for the dogs from empty packing cases and an old tractor tarpaulin he appeared to be fighting a losing battle in the centre of a milling pack of snarling yelping dogs but the appearance was illusion only already he had four of the dogs off the tethering cable and the sledge tracelines snapped into their harness hows it coming i shouted easy i could almost see the crinkling grin behind the snowmask i caught most of them asleep and balto is a great help hes in a very bad temper at being woken up balto was jackstraws lead dog a huge pound halfwolf halfsiberian direct descendant of and named for the famous dog that had trekked with amundsen and who later in the terrible winter of his sledgedriver blind behind him had led his team through driving blizzards and far subzero cold to bring the lifegiving antitoxin into the diphtheriastricken town of nome alaska jackstraws balto was another such powerful intelligent fiercely loyal to his master although not above baring his wolfs fangs as he made a token pass at him from time to time and above all like all good lead dogs a ruthless disciplinarian with his teammates he was exercising that disciplinary authority now snarling pushing and nonetoogently nipping the recalcitrant and the slowcoaches quelling insubordination in its earliest infancy til leave you to it then ill get the searchlight i made off towards the mound of snow that loomed high to the westward of the cabin broke step and listened there was no sound to be heard nothing but the lowpitched moan of the wind on the icecap the eternal rattling of the anemometer cups i turned back to jackstraw my face bent against the knifing wind the plane have you heard the plane jackstraw i cant hear a thing jackstraw straightened pulled off his parka hood and stood still hands cupped to his ears then he shook his head briefly and replaced the hood my god i looked at him maybe theyve crashed already again the shake of the head why not i demanded on a night like this you wouldnt hear a thing if they crashed half a mile downwind id have felt it dr mason i nodded slowly said nothing he was right of course the frozen surface of this frozen land transmitted vibration like a tuningfork last july seventy miles inland we had distinctly felt the vibration of the icecap as an iceberg had broken off from a glacier in a hanging valley and toppled into the fjord below maybe the pilot had lost his bearings maybe he was flying in everwidening circles trying to pick up our lights again but at least there was hope yet i hurried across to where the tractor sheeted in tarpaulin lay close in to the high snow wall that had been cut down the middle of the drift it took me a couple of minutes to clear away the accumulated snow at one end and wriggle in under the tarpaulin there was no question of trying to lift it its impregnated oils had frozen solid and it would have cracked and torn under any pressure the searchlight fixed to a couple of bolts on the tractor bonnet was held down by two quickrelease butterfly nuts in these latitudes quickrelease was a misnomer the nuts invariably froze after even the briefest exposure the accepted practice was to remove ones gloves and close mittened hands round the nuts until body heat warmed and expanded them enough to permit unscrewing but there was no time for that tonight i tapped the bolts with a spanner from the tool box and the steel pins made brittle by the intense cold sheared as if made from the cheapest cast iron i crawled out at the foot of the tarpaulin searchlight clutched under one arm and as soon as i straightened i heard it again the roar of aero engines closing rapidly they sounded very near very low but i wasted no time trying to locate the plane head lowered against the wind and the needlesharp lances of the flying ice i felt rather than saw my way back to the cabin hatch and was brought up short by jackstraws steadying hand he and joss were busy loading equipment aboard the sledge and lashing it down and as i stooped to help them something above my head fizzled and spluttered into a blinding whitere that threw everything into a harsh black and white relief of frozen snow and impenetrable shadow joss remembering what i had completely forgotten that dousing our cabin lights would have robbed the pilot of his beacon had ignited a magnesium flare in the slats of the instrument shelter we all turned as the plane came into our vision again to the south and it was at once apparent why we had lost all sight and sound of it the pilot must have made a figure of eight turn out in the darkness had reversed his approach circle and was flying from east to wesfc less than two hundred feet up undercarriage still retracted it passed within a couple of hundred yards of us like some monstrous bird both headlights were now dipped the twin beams a glitter of kaleidoscopic light in the icefilled darkness of the sky the twin oval pools of light interlocking now and very bright racing neck and neck across the snow and then these pools increasing as rapidly in size as they diminished in strength slipped away to the left as the plane banked sharply to the right and came curving round clockwise to the north i knew now what the pilot was intending and my hands clenched helplessly inside mittens and gloves but there was nothing i could do about this the antenna i shouted follow out the line of the antenna i stooped and gave the sledge its initial shove as jackstraw shouted at balto joss was by my side head close to mine whats happening why are we hes coming down this time im sure of it to the north the north not even the snowmask could hide the horror in his voice hell kill himself hell kill all of them the hummocks i know the land to the northeast was broken and uneven the ice raised up by some quirk of nature into a series of tiny hillocks ten twenty feet high tiny but the only ones within a hundred miles but hes going to do it all the same a belly landing with the wheels up thats why he reversed his circle he wants to land upwind to give himself the minimum stalling ground speed he could land to the south into the wind joss sounded almost desperate its a billiard table there he could but he wont i had to shout the words to make myself heard above the wind hes nobodys fool he knows if he lands to windward of us even a hundred yards to windward the chances of finding our lights our cabin in this weather just dont exist hes got to land upwind hes just got to there was a long silence as we staggered forward head and shoulders bent almost to waist ievel against the wind and icefilled drift then joss moved close again maybe hell see the hummocks in time maybe he can hell never see them i said flatly flying into this stuff he cant possibly see a hundred yards in front of him the radio antenna rimecoated now to almost fifty times its normal size sagging deeply and swaying pendulumlike in the wind between each pair of fourteenfoot poles that supported it stretched away almost feet to the north we were following the line of this groping our way blindly from pole to pole and almost at the end of the line when the roar of the aircraft engines for the last few seconds no more than a subdued murmur in the night as the wind carried the sound from us suddenly swelled and increased to a deafening crescendo as i shouted a warning to the others and flung myself flat on the ground the huge dark shape of the airliner swept directly over us even as i fell i would have sworn at the time that i could have reached out and touched it with my hand but it must have cleared us by at least ten feet the antenna poles we later discovered were undamaged like a fool i immediately leapt to my feet to try to get a bearing on the vanishing plane and was literally blown head over heels by the tremendous slipstream from the four great propellers slid helplessly across the frozen crust of the snow and fetched up on my back almost twenty feet from where i had been standing cursing bruised and not a little dazed i got to my feet again started off in the direction where i could hear the dogs barking and howling in a paroxysm of fear and excitement then stopped abruptly and stood quite still the engines had died all four of them had died in an instant and that could mean only one thing the airliner was about to touch down even with the realisation a jarring vibration of a power and intensity far beyond anything i had expected reached my feet through the frozen crust of the icecap no ordinary touchdown that i knew not even for a belly landing the pilot must have overestimated his height and set his ship down with force enough to crumple the fuselage to wreck the plane on the spot but he hadnt i was prone to the frozen snow again ear pressed hard against it and i could half hear half feel a kind of hissing tremor which could only have come from the fuselage no doubt already splintered and ripped sliding over the ice gouging a furrowed path through it how long this sound continued i couldnt be sure six seconds perhaps eight and then all at once came another earth tremor severer by far than the first and i heard clearly even above the gale the sudden sharp sound of the crash the grinding tearing scream of metal being twisted and tortured out of shape and then abruptly silence a silence deep and still and ominous and the sound of the wind in the darkness was no sound at all shakily i rose to my feet it was then i realised for the first time that i had lost my snowmask it must have ripped off as i had rolled along the ground i brought out my torch from under my parka it was always kept there as even a dry battery could freeze and give no light at all if the temperature fell low enough and probed around in the darkness but there was no sign of it the wind could have carried it a hundred yards away by this time a bad business indeed but there was no help for it i didnt like to think what my face would be like by the time i arrived back at the cabin joss and jackstraw were still trying to quieten the dogs when i rejoined them you all right sir joss asked he took a step closer good lord youve lost your mask i know it doesnt matter it did matter for already i could feel the burning sensation in my throat and lungs every time i breathed did you get a bearing on that plane roughly due east i should say jackstraw a little north of east i think he stretched out his hand pointing straight into the eye of the wind well go east somebody had to make the decision somebody had to be wrong and it might as well be me well go east joss how long is that spool four hundred yards more or less so four hundred yards then due north that plane is bound to have left tracks in the snow with luck well cut across them lets hope to heaven it did touch down less than four hundred yards from here i took the end of the line from the spool went to the nearest antenna pole broke off the fourfootlong flaglike frost feathers weird growths of the crystal aggregates of rime that streamed out almost horizontally to leeward and made fast the end of the line round the pole i really made it fast our lives depended on that line and without it we could never find our way back to the antenna and so eventually to the cabin through the pitchdark confusion of that galeridden arctic night there was no possibility of retracing steps through the snow in that intense cold the rimecrusted snow was compacted into a frozen neve that was but one degree removed from ice of an ironhard consistency that would show nothing less than the crimp marks of a fiveton tractor we started off at once with the wind almost in our faces but slightly to the left i was in the lead jackstraw came behind with the dogs and joss brought up the rear unreeling the line from the homing spool against the pressure of the return winding spring without my mask that blinding suffocating drift was a nightmare a cruel refinement of contrasting torture where the burning in my throat contrasted with the pain of my freezing face for dominance in my mind i was coughing constantly in the superchilled air no matter how i tried to cover mouth and nose with a gloved hand no matter how shallowly i breathed to avoid frosting my lungs the devil of it was shallow breathing was impossible we were running now running as fast as the iceglazed slipperiness of the surface and our bulky furs would allow for to unprotected people exposed to these temperatures to that murderous driftfilled gale life or death was simply a factor of speed of the duration of exposure maybe the plane had ripped open or broken in half catapulting the survivors out on to the icecap if there were any survivors for them either immediate death as the heart failed in the near impossible task of adjusting the body to an instantaneous change of over f or death by exposure within five minutes or maybe they were all trapped inside slowly freezing how to get at them how to transport them all back to the cabin but only the first few to be taken could have any hope and even if we did get them all back how to feed them for our own supplies were already dangerously low and where in heavens name were we going to put them all jackstraws shout checked me so suddenly that i stumbled and all but fell i turned back and joss came running up the end of the line i asked he nodded flashed a torch in my face your nose and cheek both gone they look bad gloves off i kneaded my face vigorously with my mittened hands until i felt the blood pounding painfully back then took the old jersey which jackstraw dug out from a gunny sack and wrapped it round my face it wasnt much but it was better than nothing we struck off to the north with the wind on our right cheeks had no option but to gamble on the hope that the wind had neither backed nor veered our torches probing the ground in front of us stopping every fifteen or twenty feet to drive a pointed bamboo marker into the frozen ground we had covered fifty yards without sighting anything and i was just beginning to become convinced that we must still be well to the west of the planes touchdown point and wondering what in the world we should do next when we almost literally stumbled into an eighteen inch deep ten foot wide depression in the snowcrust of the icecap this was it no question about that by a one in a hundred chance we had hit on the very spot where the plane had touched down or crashed down if the size of the depression in that frozen snow were anything to go by to the left the west the ground was virginal unmarked ten feet to that side and we should have missed it altogether to the east the deep depression shelved rapidly upwards its smooth convexity now marred by two large gouge marks one in the centre and one to the right of the track as if a pair of gigantic ploughs had furrowed through the ground part of the under fuselage must have been ripped open by the impact it would have been a wonder had it not been some way farther to the east and well to the right of the main track two other grooves parallel and of a shallow bowl shape had been torn in the snow the gouge marks plainly of the stillracing propellers the plane must have tilted over on its right wing just after the moment of landing to see all this took no longer than to sweep a torch through a swift semicircle i shouted to joss to take another bundle of canes and prop up the homing spool line that led back to the antenna if this werent done it would drift over and be lost to sight in ten minutes and then rejoin us then i turned and ran after jackstraw who had already urged his team forwards and eastwards along the track of the crashed plane the wind was worse than ever the drift an almost solid wall that reduced our speed to a lurching stumble and forced us to lean far into it to maintain our balance two hundred yards three hundred and then almost a quarter of a mile from where it had touched down we found the airliner simply by walking straight into it it had slewed almost degrees as it had come to a halt and was lying square across its own path still resting on even keel in the feeble light of my torch the airliner even although its fuselage rested on the ground seemed immensely high and to stretch away for a vast distance on either side but for all its great size there was something peculiarly pathetic and forlorn about it but this of course was purely subjective the knowledge in my own mind that this crippled giant would never leave here again i could hear no movement see no movement high above my head a faint blue light seemed to glow behind some of the cabin windows but apart from that there was no sign of life at all chapter two monday am am my greatest fear had already proved groundless there was no sign of fire anywhere no flickering red to see no hidden crackling to hear it was still possible that some small tongue of flame was creeping along inside the fuselage or wings looking for the petrol or oil that would help it blaze into destructive life and with that wind to fan the flames destruction would have been complete but it hardly seemed worth worrying about and it was unlikely that any pilot coolheaded enough to turn off the ignition would have forgotten to shut down the petrol lines already jackstraw had plugged our searchlight into the dry battery and handed me the lamp i pressed the switch and it worked a narrow but powerful beam good for six hundred yards in normal conditions i swung the beam to my right then brought it slowly forward whatever colours the plane may have had originally it was impossible to distinguish any of them now the entire fuselage was already shrouded in a sheet of thin rimed ice dazzling to the eye reflecting the light with the intensity almost of a chromed mirror the tail unit was intact so too was the fuselage for half its length then crumpled and torn underneath directly opposite the spot where we stood the left wing was tilted upwards at an angle of about five degrees above the normal the plane wasnt on such an even keel as i had first thought from where i stood this wing blocked off my view of the front but just above and beyond it i saw something that made me temporarily forget the urgency of my concern for those inside and stand there stockstill the beam trained unwaveringly on that spot even under the coating of ice the big bold lettering boac was clearly visible boac what on earth was a boac airliner doing in this part of the world the sas and klm i knew operated transarctic flights from copenhagen and amsterdam to winnipeg los angeles and vancouver via sondre stromfjord about an hour and a half s flying time away to the southwest on the west coast of greenland just on the arctic circle and i was pretty sure that pan american and trans world operated reciprocal services on the same route it was just barely possible that freak weather conditions had forced one of these planes far enough off course to account for its presence here but if i was right about the boac it just wasnt possible ive found the door dr mason jackstraw had taken my arm jerking me out of my reverie and was pointing to a big oval door with its lowest point just at our eyelevel we will try these perhaps i heard the metallic clang as he lifted a couple of crowbars off the sledge and nodded we could only try i set the searchlight on the snow adjusted it on its gimbals so as to illuminate the door took one of the crowbars and thrust it beneath the foot of the oval the flattened end sliding easily between door and fuselage jackstraw did the same we heaved together but nothing happened again we heaved and again our feet coming clear of the ground but the door remained immovable to localise pressure we concentrated on one bar and this time we felt something giving but it was the lever not the door with a pistolshot crack the coldweakened crowbar snapped six inches from the end and we both landed on our backs even the urgency of the moment my almost complete lack of knowledge about planes was no excuse i cursed my stupidity in wasting valuable time trying to force open a massive door locked on the inside by heavy clips designed to withstand an internal pressure of many thousands of pounds grabbed searchlight and battery ducked round under the towering tail assembly into the full force of the wind and flying drift and moved forward till i came to the right wing its tip was buried deep under the frozen snow the airscrew blades bent back at right angles to their normal line i thought perhaps i might try to scramble up the wing towards the fuselage and smash in one of the cabin windows but after a couple of seconds wild slithering on the icesheeted wing in that gusting gale wind i gave up the idea to maintain a foothold was quite impossible besides it was doubtful whether i could have smashed in a window anyway like the door the windows were designed to withstand great pressures stumbling slipping we ran round the buried tip of the wing and clear in sight now was the ice hummock that had brought the big airliner to its sudden halt about fifteen feet high and twenty wide at the base it lay in the right angle formed by the front of the fuselage and the leading edge of the wing but it wasnt the root of the wing that had absorbed the initial impact a glance at the nose of the aircraft was enough to show that the plane must have crashed into the icemound just to right of centre of the control cabin the windscreens were smashed the fuselage ripped open and crushed back for six or seven feet what had happened to the pilot sitting on that side at the moment of the telescopic impact just didnt bear thinking about but at least we had found our way in i set the searchlight so that its beam illuminated the wrecked control cabin gauged the distance to the lower sill of the windscreen it must have been fully nine feet and jumped my gloved hands hooked on firmly but slipped almost at once on the icerimed surface i grabbed for a purchase grip on one of the windscreen pillars felt my fingers striking against solid glass on both sides the windscreen hadnt been as completely shattered as i had imagined and was on the point of losing my hold altogether when jackstraw moved forward swiftly and took my weight with my knees on his shoulders and a fire axe in my hand it took me no more than two minutes to smash away the glass that clung to the pillars and the upper and lower edges i hadnt realised that aircraft glass toughened perspex could be so tough nor when it came to clambering through into the control cabin in my bulky furs that windscreens could be so narrow i landed on top of a dead man even in the darkness i knew he was dead i fumbled under my parka brought out the torch switched it on for a couple of seconds then put it out it was the copilot the man who had taken the full impact of the crash he was pinned crushed between his seat and the twisted fractured wreckage of what had been control columns levers and dashboard instruments not since i had once been called out to the scene of a headon collision between a racing motorcyclist and a heavy truck had i seen such dreadful injuries on any man whatever any of the survivors the shocked and injured survivors in the plane must see it mustnt be this it was ghastly beyond description i turned and leaned out the windscreen jackstraw was directly below cupped gloved hands shielding his eyes against the flying ice spicules as he stared upwards bring a blanket i shouted better bring a full gunny sack and the morphia kit then come up yourself he was back in twenty seconds i caught both sack and morphia box placed them on the twisted cabin floor behind me then reached out a hand to help jackstraw but it wasnt necessary athleticism wasnt the forte of the short arid stocky greenlanders but jackstraw was the fittest and most agile man i had ever met he sprang caught the lower sill of the left windscreen in his left hand the central pillar in the other and swung legs and body through the centre screen as if he had been doing this sort of thing all his life i gave him my torch to hold rummaged in the gunny sack and dragged out a blanket i spread it over the dead copilot tucking the corners down among twisted and broken ends of metal so that it shouldnt blow free in the icy wind that swirled and gusted through the wrecked control cabin waste of a good blanket i suppose i muttered but well it isnt pretty it isnt pretty jackstraw agreed his voice was quite steady devoid of all inflection how about this one i looked across at the lefthand side of the cabin it was almost completely undamaged and the chief pilot still strapped in his seat and slumped against his sidescreens seemed quite unmarked i stripped fur glove mitten and silk glove off my right hand reached out and touched the forehead we had been out of doors now for over fifteen minutes in that ferocious cold and i would have sworn that my hand was about as cold as the human flesh could get but i was wrong i pulled the gloves back on and turned away without touching him further i wasnt carrying out any autopsies that night a few feet farther back we found the radio operator in his compartment he was halfsitting halflying against the forard bulkhead of his shack where he must have been catapulted by the crash his right hand was still clutched firmly round the handgrip of the front panel of his radio set it must have been ripped clear off the transmitter which didnt look as if it would ever transmit anything again on the bulkhead behind his head blood gleamed dully in the torchlight i bent over the unconscious man could see that he was still breathing removed my gloves once more and gently slid my fingers behind his head just as gently i withdrew them how the hell i thought part hopelessly part savagely am i to carry out a head operation on a person with a telescoped occiput the state he was in i wouldnt have given a fig for his chance in the finest operating theatre in london at the very least he would be blind for life the sight centre must have been completely destroyed i reached for his pulse racing faint erratic to a degree the thought came to me a thought compounded as much of cowardice as of regret that in all likelihood the possibility of my having to operate on him was remote very remote if he were to survive the inevitably rough handling that would be needed to get him out of that aircraft and then the journey back to the cabin through that iceladen subzero gale it would be a miracle indeed it seemed unlikely that he would ever wake again but he might he just conceivably might so i broached the morphia kit then we eased his head and neck into a more comfortable position covered him with a blanket and left him immediately behind the radio compartment was a long narrow room which extended across twothirds of the width of the plane a quick glance at the two chairs and collapsible bunk was enough to show that this must be the crews rest room and someone had been resting there at the moment of the crash that crumpled shirtsleeved figure on the floor must have been taken completely unawares before he had the slightest knowledge of what was happening and he would never know now we found the stewardess in the pantry lying on her left side on the floor the outspread black hair fallen forward over her face she was moaning softly to herself but it wasnt the moan of one in pain her pulse was steady enough but fast jackstraw stooped down beside me shall we lift her dr mason no i shook my head shes coming to i think and she can tell us far quicker than we can find out whether theres anything broken another blanket and well let her be almost certainly someone much more in need of our attention the door leading into the main passenger compartment was locked at least it appeared to be but i was pretty certain it would never be locked under normal circumstances perhaps it had been warped by the impact of landing it was no time for half measures together we took a step back then flung all the weight of our shoulders against it it gave suddenly three or four inches and at the same time we heard a sharp exclamation of pain from the other side careful i warned but jackstraw had already eased his weight i raised my voice get back from that door will you we want to come in we heard a meaningless mutter from the other side followed by a low groan and the slipping shuffle of someone trying to haul himself to his feet then the door opened and we passed quickly inside the blast of hot air struck me in the face like an almost physical biow i gasped fought off a passing moment of weakness when my legs threatened to give under me then recovered sufficiently to bang the door shut behind me with the motors dead and the arctic chill striking through the thin steel of the fuselage this warmth no matter how efficient the cabin insulation wouldnt last long but while it did it might be the saving of all those who still lived a thought struck me and ignoring the man who stood swaying before me one hand clutching a seat grip for support the other rubbing at a bloodmasked forehead i turned to jackstraw carry the stewardess in here well take a chance and its not all that much of a chance either theres a damned sight more hope for her in here with a broken leg than out there with only a bump on the head throw her blanket over the wireless operator but whatever you do dont touch him jackstraw nodded and went out closing the door quickly behind him i turned to the man who still stood shakily in the aisle still dazedly rubbing his hand a big brown square hand matted on the back with black hair across a bleeding forehead he looked at me for a moment then stared down uncomprehendingly at the blood dripping on to the bright red tie and blue shirt that contrasted so oddly with the light grey gaberdine suit he closed his eyes tightly then shook his head to clear it sorry to ask the inevitable question the voice was quiet deep well under control but what happened you crashed i said shortly what do you remember nothing well that is just a bump then a loud screeching tearing noise then you hit the door i gestured at the bloodstains behind me sit down for a moment youll be all right id lost interest in him and was staring down the length of the cabin id expected to see most of the seats wrenched off their bases but instead they were all there exactly as they should have been three wide to the left of me two to the right the seats in the front half facing aft those to the rear facing forward more than that i had expected to see people injured broken and moaning people flung all over the seats and aisles but the big passenger compartment seemed almost empty and there wasnt a sound to be heard but it wasnt empty not quite apart from the man by my side there were i found nine others altogether two men lay in the front part of the aisle one a big broadshouldered man with curly dark hair was propped up on an elbow staring around him with a puzzled frown on his face near him lying on his side was a smaller much older man but all i could see of him were a few wisps of black hair plastered across a bald head a glenurquhart plaid jacket that seemed a couple of sizes too big for him and the loudest check tie it had ever been my misfortune to see it seemed obvious that they had been sitting together in the lefthand seat adjacent to them and had been flung out when the plane crashed into the icemound and slewed violently to one side in the seat beyond that also on the left a man sat by himself my first reaction was surprise that he too hadnt been hurled into the aisle but then i saw that he was awake and fully conscious he was sitting rigidly in his seat pressed in hard against the window legs braced on the floor holding on with both hands to the table fixed to the seat in front tautened tendons ridged the backs of his thin white hands and his knuckles gleamed in the torchlight i lifted the beam higher saw that he was wearing a closefitting clerical collar relax reverend i said soothingly terra firma once more and this is as far as you are going he said nothing just stared at me through rimless glasses so i left him he seemed unhurt four people sat in the righthand side of the front part of the plane each one in a window seat two women two men one of the women was fairly elderly but so heavily madeup and with her hair so expensively dyed and marcelled that i couldnt have guessed her age within ten years her face somehow seemed vaguely familiar she was awake and looking slowly about her her eyes empty of understanding so too was the woman in the next seat an even more expensivelooking creature with a mink coat flung capewise over her shoulders to show a simple green jersey dress that i suspected cost a small fortune she was about twentyfive i guessed and with her blonde hair grey eyes and perfect features would have been one of the most beautiful women i had ever seen if it werent for the overfull and rather sulky mouth maybe i thought uncharitably she remembered to do something about that mouth when she was fully awake but right then she wasnt fully awake none of them was they all behaved as if they were being dragged up from the depths of an exhausting sleep still more asleep than awake were the other two men in the front one a big burly highcoloured man of about fiftyfive with the gleaming thick white hair and moustache of the caricature of a dixie colonel the other was a thin elderly man his face heavily lined unmistakably jewish not bad going so far i thought with relief eight people and only one cut forehead among the lot of them the perfect argument if ever there was one for having all seats in a plane face towards the rear no question but that they all owed if not their lives at least their immunity to injury to the fact that their highbacked seats had almost completely cushioned and absorbed the shock of impact the two passengers in the rear end of the cabin were the perfect argument for not having the seat face forward the first i came to a brownhaired young girl of about eighteen or nineteen wearing a belted raincoat was lying on the floor between two seats she was stirring and as i put my hands under her arms to help her up she screamed in sudden pain i changed my grip and lifted her gently on to the seat my shoulder her voice was low and husky it is very sore im not surprised id eased back the blouse at the neck and closed it again your clavicle the collarbone is gone just sit there and hold your left arm in your right hand yes so ill strap you up later you wont feel a thing i promise you she smiled at me halftimidly halfgratefully and said nothing i left her went to the very rear seat in the plane stooped to examine the man there then straightened in almost the same instant the weirdly unnatural angle of the head on the shoulders made any examination superfluous i turned and walked forward everybody was awake now sitting upright or struggling dazedly to their feet their halfformed questions as dazed as the expressions on their faces i ignored them for a moment looked questioningly at jackstraw as he came through the forward door closely followed by joss she wont come jackstraw jerked his thumb over his shoulder shes awake but she wont leave the wireless operator shes all right her back hurts i think she wouldnt say i made no answer and moved across to the main door the one wed failed to open from the outside i supposed it no business of mine if the stewardess chose to devote her attention to a member of the crew instead of to the passengers who were her charges but it was damned queer all the same almost as queer as the fact that though the inevitability of the crash must have been known for at least fifteen minutes before the actual event not one of the ten passengers in the cabin had been wearing a seatbelt and the stewardess wireless operator and the crew member in the rest room appeared to have been caught completely unprepared the circular door handle refused to budge i called jackstraw but even the extra weight made not the slightest impression on it obviously it was immovably jammed there must have been a slight telescoping effect along the entire length of the fuselage as the plane had crashed into the icemound if the door i had noticed behind the control cabin was as badly warped as this one and being nearer the point of impact it almost inevitably would be then theyd all have to leave via the windscreens of the control cabin i thought of the wireless operator with his dreadful head wound and wondered bleakly whether even trying to move him out could be more than a futile gesture anyway a figure barred my way as i turned from the door it was the whitehaired whitemoustached dixie colonel his face was dark red his eyes light blue choleric and protuberant it only required someone to get this man good and mad and he would be no more than a debit entry in the account book of some life assurance company and he seemed good and mad now whats happened what in the devil is all this he had a voice like a dixie colonel too the masondixon line lay far to the north of wherever he had been born weve landed why what are we doing here whats the noise outside and and who in the name of heaven are you a big business tycoon i thought wryly with money enough and power enough to indulge an obviously overgenerous capacity for righteous indignation if i was going to meet any trouble it wasnt hard to guess the direction it was going to come from but right then there was some excuse for his attitude i wondered how i would have felt if i had gone to sleep in a transatlantic airliner and woken up to find myself landed in the freezing middle of nowhere with three furclad people complete with snowgoggles and snowmasks waddling about the aisle of the plane youve crashlanded i said briefly i dont know why how the hell should i the noise outside is an iceblizzard rattling against the fuselage as for us we are scientists managing an international geophysical year station half a mile from here we saw and heard you just before you crashed i made to push past him but he barred my way just a minute if you dont mind the voice was more authoritative than ever and there was a surprising amount of muscle in that arm across my chest i think we have a right to know later i knocked his arm away and jackstraw completed the job by pushing him down into his seat dont make a damned nuisance of yourself theres a critically injured man who has to have attention and at once well take him to safety and then come back for you keep the door shut i was addressing all of them now but the whitehaired mans wrathful spluttering attracted my attention again and if you dont shut up and cooperate you can stay here if it werent for us youd be dead stiff as a board in a couple of hours maybe you will be yet i moved up the aisle followed by jackstraw the young man who had been lying on the floor pulled himself on to a seat and he grinned at me as i passed how to win friends and influence people he had a slow cultured drawl i fear you have offended our worthy friend i fear i have i smiled passed by then turned these wide shoulders and large capable hands could be more than useful to us how are you feeling recoverin rapidly you are indeed you didnt look so good a minute ago just takin a long count he said easily can i help thats why i asked i nodded glad to oblige he heaved himself to his feet towering inches above me the little man in the loud tie and the glenurquhart jacket gave an anguished sound like the yelp of an injured puppy careful johnny careful the voice the rich nasal and rather grating twang was pure bowery we got our responsibilities boy big commitments we might strain a ligament relax solly the big man patted him soothingly on his bald head just takin a little walk to clear my head not till you put this parka and pants on first id no time to bother about the eccentricities of little men in loud jackets and louder ties youll need them cold doesnt bother me friend this cold will outside that door its degrees below the temperature of this cabin i heard a murmur of astonishment from some of the passengers and the large young man suddenly thoughtful took the clothes from jackstraw i didnt wait until he had put them on but went out with joss the stewardess was bent low over the injured wireless operator i pulled her gently to her feet she offered no resistance just looked wordlessly at me the deep brown eyes huge in a face deadwhite and strained with shock she was shivering violently her hands were like ice you want to die of cold miss this was no time for soft and sympathetic words and i knew these girls were trained how to behave in emergencies havent you got a hat coat boots anything like that yes her voice was dull almost devoid of life she was standing alone by the door now and i could hear the violent ratatat of her elbow as it shook uncontrollably and knocked against the door til go and get them joss scrambled out through the windscreen to get the collapsible stretcher while we were waiting i went to the exit door behind the flight deck and tried to open it swinging at it with the back of my fire axe but it was locked solid we had the stretcher up and were lashing the wireless operator inside as carefully as we could in these cramped conditions when the stewardess reappeared she was wearing her uniform heavy coat now and high boots i tossed her a pair of caribou trousers better but not enough put these on she hesitated and i added roughly we wont look i must go and see the passengers theyre all right bit late in thinking about it arent you i know im sorry i couldnt leave him she looked down at the young man at her feet do you i mean she broke off then it came out with a rush is he going to die probably i said and she flinched away as if i had struck her across the face i hadnt meant to be brutal just clinical well do what we can for him its not much im afraid finally we had him securely lashed to the stretcher his head cushioned against the shock as best we could when i got to my feet the stewardess was just pulling her coat down over the caribou pants were taking him back to our cabin i said we have a sledge below theres room for another you could protect his head want to come the passengers she began uncertainly theyll be all right i went back inside the main cabin closing the door behind me and handed my torch to the man with the cut brow the two feeble night or emergency lights that burned inside were poor enough for illumination worse still for morale were taking the wireless operator and stewardess with us i explained back in twenty minutes and if you want to live just keep this door tight shut what an extraordinarily brusque young man the elderly lady murmured her voice was lowpitched resonant with an extraordinary carrying power only from necessity madam i said dryly would you really prefer longwinded and flowery speeches the while you were freezing to death well do you know i really dont think i would she answered mockseriously and i could hear her chuckling there was no other word for it as i closed the door behind me working in the cramped confines of that wrecked control cabin in almost pitch darkness and with that iceladen bitter gale whistling through the shattered windscreens we had the devils own time of it trying to get the injured wireless operator down to that waiting sledge below without the help of the big young stranger i dont think we would ever have managed it but manage it we eventually did he and i lowered and slid the stretcher down to jackstraw and joss who took and strapped it on the sledge then we eased the stewardess down i thought i heard her cry out as she hung supported only by a hand round either wrist and remembered that jackstraw had said something about her back being injured but there was no time for such things now i jumped down and a couple of seconds later the big young man joined me i hadnt intended that he should come but there was no harm in it he had to go sometime and there was no question of his having to ride on the sledge the wind had eased a little perhaps but the cold was crueller than ever even the dogs cowered miserably in the lee of the plane now and again one of them stretched out a neck in protest and gave its long mournful wolf call a sound eerie beyond description but their misery was all to the good as jackstraw said they were mad to run and with the wind and icedrift behind them run they did at first i led the way with the torch but balto the big lead dog brushed me aside and raced on into the darkness i had sense enough to let him have his head he followed the twisting route of the planes snowfurrow the bamboos homing spool and antenna line as swiftly and unerringly as if it had been broad daylight and the polished steel runners of the sledge fairly hissed across the snow the frozen ground was smooth and flat as river ice no ambulance could have carried the wireless operator as comfortably as our sledge did that night it took us no more than five minutes to reach the cabin and in three more minutes we were on our way again they were a busy three minutes jackstraw lit the oil stove oil lamp and colman pressure lamp while joss and i put the injured man on a collapsible cot before the stove worked him into my sleepingbag slid in half a dozen heat pads waterproof pads containing a chemical which gave off heat when water was added placed a rolled up blanket under his neck to keep the back of his head off the cot and zipped the sleepingbag shut i had surgical instruments enough to do what had to be done but it had to wait not so much because we had others still to rescue urgent enough though that was but the man lying at our feet so still so ashenfaced was suffering so severely from shock and exposure that to touch him would have been to kill him i was astonished that he had managed to survive even this long i told the stewardess to make some coffee gave her the necessary instructions and then we left her and the big young man together the girl heating a pan over a pile of meta tablets the young man staring incredulously into a mirror as he kneaded a frostbitten cheek and chin with one hand and with another held a cold compress to a frozen ear we took with us the warm clothes we had lent them some rolls of bandages and left ten minutes later we were back inside the plane despite its insulation the temperature inside the main cabin had already dropped at least thirty degrees and almost everyone was shivering with the cold one or two beating their arms to keep themselves warm even the dixie colonel was looking very subdued the elderly lady fur coat tightly wrapped around her looked at her watch and smiled twenty minutes exactly you are very prompt young man we try to be of service i dumped the pile of clothes i was carrying on a seat nodded at them and the contents of a gunny sack joss and jackstraw were emptying share these out between you and be as quick as you can i want you to get out at once my two friends here will take you back perhaps one of you will be kind enough to remain behind i looked to where the young girl still sat alone in her back seat still holding her left forearm in her hand til need some help to fix this young lady up fix her up it was the expensive young woman in the expensive furs speaking for the first time her voice was expensive as the rest of her and made me want to reach for a hairbrush why what on earth is the mattef with her her collarbone is broken i said shortly collarbone broken the elderly lady was on her feet her face a nice mixture of concern and indignation and shes been sitting there alone all this time why didnt you tell us you silly man i forgot i replied mildly besides what good would it have done i looked down at the girl in the mink coat goodness only knew that i didnt particularly want her but the injured girl had struck me as being almost painfully shy and i was sure shed prefer to have one of her own sex around would you like to give me a hand she stared at me a cold surprised stare that would have been normal enough had i made some outrageous or improper request but before she could answer the elderly lady broke in again til stay behind id love to help well i began doubtfully but she interrupted immediately well yourself whats the matter think im too old hey no no of course not i protested a fluent liar but a gallant one she grinned come on were wasting this valuable time youre always so concerned about we brought the girl into the first of the rear seats where there was plenty of space between that and the first of the rearward facing front seats and had just worked her coat off when joss called me were off now sir back in twenty minutes as the door closed behind the last of them and i broke open a roll of bandage the old lady looked quizzically at me know what youre doing young man more or less im a doctor doctor hey she looked at me with open suspicion and what with my bulky oilstreaked and smelly furs not to mention the fact that i hadnt shaved for three days i suppose there was justification enough for it you sure sure im sure i said irritably what do you expect me to do whip my medical degree out from under this parka or just wear round my neck a brass plate giving my consulting hours well get along young man she chuckled she patted my arm then turned to the young girl whats your name my dear helene we could hardly catch it the voice was so low her embarrassment was positively painful helene a lovely name and indeed the way she said it made it sound so youre not british are you or american im from germany madam dont call me madam you know you speak english beautifully germany hey bavaria for a guess yes the rather plain face was transfigured in a smile and i mentally saluted the old lady for the ease with which she was distracting the young girls thoughts from the pain munich perhaps you know it like the back of my hand she said complacently and not just the hofbrauhaus either youre still very young arent you im seventeen seventeen a nostalgic sigh ah my dear i remember when i was seventeen a different world there was no transatlantic airliner in those days i can tell you in fact i murmured the wright brothers were hardly airborne the face had been more than familiar to me and i was annoyed that i should have taken so long in placing it i suppose it was because her normal setting was so utterly different from this bleak and frozen world being insulting young man she queried but there was no offence in her face i cant imagine anyone ever insulting you the world was at your feet even in the edwardian days miss legarde you know me then she seemed genuinely pleased it would be difficult to find anyone who doesnt know the name of marie legarde i nodded at the young girl see helene knows it too and it was clear from the awestruck expression on the young german girls face that the name meant as much to her as to me twenty years queen of the musichall thirty years queen of the musical comedy stage beloved wherever she was known less for her genius than for the innate kindliness and goodness which she tried to conceal from the world with a waspish tongue for the halfdozen orphanages she maintained in britain and europe marie legarde was one of the few truly international names in the world of entertainment yes yes i see you know my name marie legarde smiled at me but how did you know me from your photograph naturally i saw it in life the other week miss legarde marie to my friends i dont know you i protested i paid a small fortune to have that photograph retouched and made briefly presentable she answered obliquely it was a splendid photograph inasmuch as it bore precious little resemblance to the face that i carry about with me anyone who recognises me from that is my friend for life besides she smiled i bear nothing but the most amicable feelings towards people who save my life i said nothing just concentrated on finishing the job of strapping up helenes arm and shoulders as quickly as possible she was blue with cold and shivering uncontrollably but she hadnt uttered a murmur throughout and smiled gratefully at me when i was finished marie legarde regarded my handiwork approvingly i really do believe you have picked up some smattering of your trade along the way doctor ah mason peter mason peter to my friends peter it shall be come on helene into your clothes as fast as you like fifteen minutes later we were back in the cabin jackstraw went to unharness the dogs and secure them to the tethering cable while joss and i helped the two women down the icecoated steps from the trapdoor but i had no sooner reached the foot of the steps than i had forgotten all about marie legarde and helene and was staring unbelievingly at the tableau before me i was just vaguely aware of joss by my shoulder and anger and dismay on his face slowly giving way to a kind of reluctant horror for what we saw though it concerned us all concerned him most of all the injured wireless operator still lay where we had left him all the others were there too grouped in a rough semicircle round him and round a cleared space to the left of the stove by their feet in the centre of this space upside down and with one corner completely stove in on the wooden floor lay the big metal rca radio transmitter and receiver our sole source of contact with our only means of summoning help from the outer world i knew next to nothing about radios but it was chillingly obvious to me as it was i could see to the semicircle of fascinated onlookers that the rca was smashed beyond recovery chapter three monday am am half a minute passed in complete silence half a minute before i could trust myself to speak even bring myself to speak when at last i did my voice was unnaturally low in die unnatural hush that was broken only by the interminable clacking of the anemometer cups above splendid really splendid the perfect end to the perfect day i looked round them slowly one by one then gestured at the smashed transmitter what bloody idiot was responsible for this this stroke of genius how dare you sir the whitehaired man whom i had mentally labelled as the dixie colonel took a step forward face flushed with anger mind your tongue were not children to be shut up i said quietly enough but there must have been something in my voice rather less than reassuring for he fell silent though his fists still remained clenched i looked at them all again well im afraid im afraid i did it the stewardess faltered her brown eyes were as unnaturally large her face as white and strained as when i had first seen her its all my fault you the one person here who should know just how vital radio really is i dont believe it you must im afraid the quiet controlled voice belonged to the man with the cut brow no one else was anywhere near it at the time what happened to you i could see he was nursing a bruised and bleeding hand i dived for it when i saw it toppling he smiled wryly i should have saved myself the trouble that damned things heavy its all that thanks for trying anyway ill fix your hand up later i turned to the stewardess again and not even that pale and exhausted face the contrition in the eyes could quieten my anger and to be honest my fear i suppose it just came to pieces in your hand ive told you im sorry i iwas just kneeling beside jimmy here who jimmy waterman the second officer i second officer i interrupted thats the radio operator i take it no jimmy is a pilot weve three pilots we dont carry a radio operator you dont i broke off my surprised question asked another instead whos the man in the crew rest room navigator we dont carry a navigator either harry williamson is was the flight engineer no wireless operator no navigator there had been changes indeed since id flown the atlantic some years previously in a stratocruiser i gave it up returned to my original question and nodded at the smashed rca well how did it happen i brushed the table as i rose and well it just fell her voice trailed off uncertainly it just fell i echoed incredulously one hundred and fifty pounds of transmitter and you flicked it off the table just like that i didnt knock it off the legs collapsed its got no legs to collapse i said shortly hinges well hinges then i looked at joss who had been responsible for the erection of the table as well as the radio is it possible no his voice was flat definite again the silence in the cabin the hush the tension that grew from the merely uncomfortable to the all but unbearable but i was beginning to see that there was nothing to be gained now by further questioning much to be lost the radio was wrecked finish i turned away without a word hung up my caribou furs on nails on the walls took off goggles and gloves and turned to the man with the cut brow lets have a look at your head and your hand its a pretty nasty gash on your forehead forget the radio for the moment joss lets have coffee first lotsof it i turned to jackstraw who had just come down the steps from the hatch and was staring at the smashed radio i know jackstraw i know ill explain later not that i know anything about it bring seme empty cases for seats out of the food tunnel will you and a bottle of brandy we all need it id just started to wash the cut forehead a nasty gash as i had said but surprisingly little signs of bruising when the big amiable young man who had helped us lower the second officer from the wrecked plane came to us i looked across up at him and saw that i could be wrong about the amiability his face wasnt exactly hostile but his eyes had the cool measuring look of one who knew from experience that he could cope with most of the situations pleasant and unpleasant that he was ever likely to come up against look he began without preamble i dont know who you are or what your name is but im sure we are all most grateful to you for what you have done for us its more than probable that we owe our lives to you we acknowledge that also we know youre a field scientist and we realise that your equipment is of paramount importance to you agreed agreed i dabbed iodine fairly liberally on the injured mans head he was tough all right he didnt even wince and looked at the speaker not at all a man to ignore i thought behind the strong intelligent face lay a hardness a tenacity of purpose that hadnt been acquired along with the cultured relaxed voice at the ivy league college i was pretty certain he had attended youd something else to say yes we think correction i think that you were unnecessarily rough on our air hostess you can see the state the poor kids in ok so your radios bust so youre hoppin mad about it but theres no need for all this song and dance his voice was calm conversational all the time radios arent irreplaceable this one will be replaced i promise you youll have a new one inside a week ten days at the most kind i said dryly i finished tying the head bandage and straightened up the offer is appreciated but theres one thing you havent taken into account you may be dead inside that ten days you may all be dead in ten days we may all he broke off and stared at me his expression perceptibly hardening what are you talking about what im talking about is that without this radio you dismiss so lightly your chances our chances of survival arent all that good in fact theyre not good at all i dont give a tuppenny damn about the radio as such i eyed him curiously and a preposterous thought struck me at least it was preposterous for all of a couple of seconds before the truth hit me have you have any of you any idea just where you are right here at the present moment sure we have the young man lifted his shoulders fractionally just cant say how far to the nearest drugstore or pub i told them the stewardess interrupted they were asking me just before you came in i thought captain johnson had overshot the landing field at reykjavik in a snowstorm this is langjokull isnt it she saw the expression on my face and went on hastily or hofsjokull i mean we were flying more or less northeast from gander and these are the only two snowfields or glaciers or whatever you call them in iceland in that direction from iceland i suppose there is a bit of the ham actor in all of us and i really couldnt pass it up did you say iceland she nodded dumbly everybody was looking at her and when she didnt answer they all transferred their gazes to me as at the touch of a switch iceland i repeated my dear girl at the present moment youre at an altitude of feet right slam bang in the middle of the greenland icecap the effect was all that anybody could ever have wished for i doubt whether even marie legarde had ever had a better reaction from an audience stunned is an inadequate word to describe their mental state immediately after this announcement paralysis was nearer it especially where the power of speech was concerned and when the power of thought and speech did return it expressed itself as i might have expected in the most violent disbelief everybody seemed to start talking at once but it was the stewardess who took my attention by coming forward and catching me by the lapels i noticed the glitter of a diamond ring on her hand and remember having some vague idea that this was against airline regulations what kind of joke is this it cant be it cant be greenland it just cant be she saw by the expression on my face that i wasnt joking and her grip tightened even more i had just time to be conscious of two conflicting thoughts that wide with fear and dismay though they might be she had the most extraordinarily beautiful brown eyes and secondly that the boac were slipping in their selection of stewardesses whose calmness in emergency was supposed to match the trimness of their appearance then she rushed on wildly how how can it be we were on a ganderreykjavik flight greenland we dont go anywhere near it and theres the automatic pilot and radio beams and and radio base checks every halfhour oh its impossible its impossible why do you tell us this she was shaking now whether from nervous strain or cold i had no idea the big young man with the ivy league accent put an arm awkwardly round her shoulder and i saw her wince something indeed seemed to be hurting her but again it could wait joss i called he looked up from the stove where he was pouring coffee into mugs tell our friends where we are latitude north longitude east joss said unemotionally his voice cut clearly through the hubbub of incredulous conversation three hundred miles from the nearest human habitation four hundred miles north of the arctic circle near enough miles from reykjavik from cape farewell the southernmost point of greenland and just a little further distant from the north pole and if anyone doesnt believe us sir i suggest they just take a walk in any direction and theyll find out whos right josss calm matteroffact statement was worth half an hour of argument and explanation in a moment conviction was complete and there were more problems than ever to be answered i held up my hand in mock protest and protection against the waves of questions that surged against me from every side all in good time please although i dont really know anything more than yourselves with the exception perhaps of one thing but first coffee and brandy all round brandy the expensive young woman had been the first id noticed to appropriate one of the empty wooden cases that jackstraw had brought in in lieu of seats and now she looked up under the curve of exquisitely modelled eyebrows are you sure thats wise the tone of her voice left little room for doubt as to her opinion of course i forced myself to be civil bickering could reach intolerable proportions in a rigidly closed mutually interdependent group such as we were likely to be for some time to come why ever not opens the pores dear man she said sweetly i thought everyone knew that how dangerous it is when youre exposed to cold afterwards or had you forgotten our cases our night things in the plane somebody has to get these dont talk such utter rubbish my shortlived attempt at civility perished miserably nobodys leaving here tonight you sleep in your clothes this isnt the dorchester if the blizzard dies down we may try to get your things tomorrow morning but if youre all that desperate youre welcome to get them yourself want to try it was boorish of me but that was the effect she had i turned away to see the minister or priest hold up his hand against the offered brandy go on take it i said impatiently i dont really think i should the voice was highpitched but the enunciation clear and precise and i found it vaguely irritating that it should so perfectly match his appearance be so exactly what i should have expected he laughed a nervous deprecating laugh my parishioners you know i was tired worried and felt like telling him what he could do with his parishioners but it wasnt his fault theres precedent in plenty in your bible reverend you know that better than i itll do you good really oh well if you think so he took the glass gingerly as if beelzebub himself were on the offering end but i noticed that there was nothing so hesitant about his method and speed of disposal of the contents his subsequent expression could properly be described as beatific i caught marie legardes eye and smiled at the twinkle i caught there the reverend wasnt the only one who found the coffee and brandy welcome with the exception of the stewardess who sipped at her drink in a distraught fashion the others had also emptied their glasses and i decided that the broaching of another marteus was justified in the respite from the talk i bent over the injured man on the floor his pulse was slower steadier and his breathing not quite so shallow i slipped in a few more heat pads and zipped up the sleepingbag is he is he any better do you think the stewardess was so close to me that i brushed against her as i straightened he he seems a bit better doesnt he he is a bit i think but nothing like over the shock from the wound and the exposure though i looked at her speculatively and suddenly felt almost sorry for her almost but not quite i didnt at all like the direction my thoughts were leading me youve flown together quite a bit havent you yes she didnt offer anything more his head do you think later let me have a quick look at that back of yours look at what your back i said patiently your shoulders they seem to give you some pain ill rig a screen no no im all right she moved away from me dont be silly my dear i wondered what trick of voice production made marie legardes voice so clear and carrying he is a doctor you know no i shrugged and reached for my brandy glass bearers of bad news were ever unpopular i supposed her reaction was the modern equivalent of the classical despots unsheathing his dagger probably only bruises anyhow i told myself and turned to look at the company an oddlooking bunch to say the least but then any group of people dressed in lounge suits and dresses trilby hats and nylon stockings would have looked odd against the strange and uncompromising background of that cabin where every suggestion of anything that even remotely suggested gracious living had been crushed and ruthlessly made subservient to the allexclusive purpose of survival here there were no armchairs no chairs even no carpets wallpaper bookshelves beds curtains or even windows for the curtains it was a bleak utilitarian box of a room eighteen feet by fourteen the floor was made of unvarnished yellow pine the walls were made of spaced sheets of bonded ply with kapok insulation between the lower part of the walls was covered with greenpainted asbestos the upper part and entire roof sheeted with glittering aluminium to reflect the maximum possible heat and light a thin everpresent film of ice climbed at least halfway up all four walls reaching almost to the ceiling in the four corners the parts of the room most remote from the stove and therefore the coldest on very cold nights such as this the ice reached e ceiling and started to creep across it to the layers of opaque ice that permanently framed the undersides of our rimed and opaque skylights the two exits from the cabin were let into the fourteenfoot sides one led to the trap the other to the snow and ice tunnel where we kept our food petrol oil batteries radio generators explosives for seismological and glacial investigations and a hundred and one other items halfway along a secondary tunnel led off at right angles a tunnel which steadily increased in length as we cut out the blocks of snow which were melted to give us our water supply at the far end of the main tunnel lay our primitive toilet system one eighteenfoot wall and half of the wall that gave access to the trapdoor were lined with twin rows of bunks eight in all the other eighteenfoot wall was given over entirely to our stove workbench radio table and housings for the meteorological instruments the remaining wall by the tunnel was piled with tins and cases of food now mostly empties that had been brought in from the runnel to begin the lengthy process of defrosting slowly i surveyed all this then as slowly surveyed the company the incongruity of the contrast reached the point where one all but disbelieved the evidence of ones own eyes but they were there all right and i was stuck with them everyone had stopped talking now and was looking at me waiting for me to speak sitting in a tight semicircle round the stove they were huddled together and shivering in the freezing cold the only sounds in the room were the clacking of the anemometer cups clearly audible down the ventilation pipe the faint moaning of the wind on the icecap and the hissing of our pressure colman lamp i sighed to myself and put down my empty glass well it looks as if you are going to be our guests for some little time so wed better introduce ourselves us first i nodded to where joss and jackstraw were working on the shattered rca which they had lifted back on the table on the left joseph london of the city of london our radio operator unemployed joss muttered on the right nils nielsen take a good look at him ladies and gentlemen at this very moment the guardian angels of your respective insurance companies are probably putting up a prayer f r his continued wellbeing if you all live to come home again toe chances are that you will owe it to him i was to remember my own words later he probably knows more than any man living about survival on the greenland icecap i thought you called him jackstraw marie legarde murmured my eskimo name jackstraw had turned and smiled at her his parka hood off for the first time i could see her polite astonishment as she looked at the fair hair the blue eyes and it was as if jackstraw read her thoughts two of my grandparents were danish most of us greenlanders have as much danish blood as eskimo in us nowadays i was surprised to hear him talk like this and it was a tribute to marie legardes personality his pride in his eskimo background was equalled only by his touchiness on the subject well well how interesting the expensive young lady was sitting back on her box hands clasped round an expensivelynyloned knee her expression reflecting accurately the wellbred condescension of her tone my very first eskimo dont be afraid lady jackstraws smile was wider than ever and i felt more than vaguely uneasy his almost invariable eskimo cheerfulness and good nature concealed an explosive temper which hed probably inherited from some far distant viking forebear it doesnt rub off the silence that followed could hardly be described as companionable and i rushed in quickly my own name is mason peter mason and im in charge of this igy station you all know roughly what were doing stuck out here on the plateau meteorology glaciology the study of the earths magnetism the borealis airglow ionosphere cosmic rays magnetic storms and a dozen other things which i suppose are equally uninteresting to you i waved my arm we dont as you can see normally live here alone five others are away to the north on a field expedition theyre due back in about three weeks after which we all pack up and abandon this place before the winter sets in and the icepack freezes on the coast before the winter sets in the little man in the glenurquhart jacket stared at me you mean to tell me it gets colder than this it certainly does an explorer called alfred wegener wintered not fifty miles from here in and the temperature dropped by degrees below zero degrees of frost and that may have been a warm winter for all we know i gave some time to allow this cheering item of information to sink in then continued well thats us miss legarde marie legarde needs no introduction from anyone a slight murmur of surprise and turning of heads showed that i wasnt altogether right but thats all i know im afraid corazzini the man with the cut brow offered the white bandage just staining with blood was in striking contrast to the receding dark hair nick corazzini bound for bonnie scotland as the travel posters put it holiday no luck he grinned taking over the new global tractor company outside glasgow know it ive heard of it tractors eh mr corazzini you may be worth your weight in gold to us yet we have a brokendown elderly tractor outside that can usually only be started by repeated oaths and assaults by a fourpound hammer well he seemed taken aback of course i can try i dont suppose youve actually laid a finger on a tractor for many years marie legarde interrupted shrewdly isnt that it mr corazzini afraid it is he admitted ruefully but in a situation like this id gladly lay my hands on another one youll have your chance i promised him i looked at the man beside him smallwood the minister announced he rubbed his thin white hands constantly to drive the cold away the reverend joseph smallwood im the vermont delegate to the international general assembly of the unitarian and free united churches in london you may have heard of it our biggest conference in many years sorry i shook my head but dont let that disturb you our paper boy misses out occasionally and you sir solly levin of new york city the little man in the check jacket added unnecessarily he reached up and laid a proprietary arm along the broad shoulders of the young man beside him and this is my boy johnny your boy your son i fancied i could see a slight resemblance perish the thought the young man drawled my name is johnny zagero solly is my manager sorry to introduce a discordant note into company such as this his eyes swept over us dwelt significantly longer on the expensive young lady by his side but im in the way of being a common or garden pugilist that means boxer solly would you listen to him solly levin implored he stretched his clenched fists heavenwards would you just listen to him pologisin johnny zagero future heavyweight champion apologisin for being a boxer the white hope for the world thats all rated number three challenger to the champ a household name in all ask dr mason if hes ever heard of me zagero suggested that means nothing i smiled you dont look like a boxer to me mr zagero or sound like one i didnt know it was included in the curriculum at yale or was it harvard princeton he grinned and whats so funny about that look at tunney and his shakespeare roland la starza was a college boy when he fought for the world title why not me exactly solly levin tried to thunder the word but he hadnt the voice for it why not and when weve carved up this british champ of yours a doddery old character rated number two challenger by one of the biggest injustices ever perpetrated in the long and glorious history of boxin when weve massacred this ancient hasbeen i say all right solly zagero interrupted desist theres not a press man within a thousand miles save the golden words for later just keepin in practice boy words are ten a penny ive got thousands to spare tousands solly tousands youre slippin now shut up solly shut up and i turned to the girl beside zagero well miss mrs mrs dansbygregg you may have heard of me no i wrinkled my brow im afraid i havent id heard of her all right and i knew now that id seen her name and picture a score of times among those of other wealthy unemployed and unemployable built up by the tongueinthecheek gossip columnists of the great national dailies into an ersatz london society whose frenetic frequently moronic and utterly unimportant activities were a source of endless interest to millions mrs dansbygregg i seemed to recall had been particularly active in the field of charitable activities although perhaps not so in die production of the balance sheets she smiled sweetly at me well perhaps its not so surprising after all you are a bit distant from the centre of things arent you she looked across to where the youngster with the broken collarbone was sitting and this is fleming fleming this time the wrinkling of my brow was genuine you mean helene fleming my personal maid your personal maid i said slowly i could feel the incredulous anger stirring inside me your own maid and you didnt even bother to volunteer to stay while i fixed her shoulder up miss legarde did it first she said coolly why should i quite right mrs dansbygregg why should you johnny zagero said approvingly he looked at her long and consideringly you might have got your hands dirty for the first time the carefully cultivated facade cracked the smile stiffened mechanically and her colour deepened mrs dansbygregg made no reply maybe she had none to make people like johnny zagero never got close enough even to the fringes of her moneysheltered world for her to know how to deal with them well that leaves just the two of you i said hastily the large dixie colonel with the florid face and white hair was sitting next to the thin wispyhaired little jew they made an incongruous pair theodore mahler the little jew said quietly i waited but he added nothing a communicative character brewster the other announced he made a significant pause senator hoffman brewster glad to help in any way i can dr mason thank you senator at least i know who you are indeed thanks to his magnificent flair for selfpublicity half the western world knew who this outspoken bitterly but fairly anticommunist near isolationist senator from the southwest was on a european tour you might say that he had the politicians gift for investing even the most insignificant words with a statesmanlike consideration as chairman of one of our appropriation committees i well lets call it a factfinding tour wife and secretaries gone ahead by humble passenger steamer i take it zagero said mildly he shook his head that was a fearful stink your congressional investigation boys raised recently about the expenses of us senators abroad that was quite unnecessary young man brewster said coldly and insulting i believe it was zagero apologised not really intended as such sorry senator he meant it what a bunch i thought despairingly what a crowd to be stuck with in the middle of the greenland iceplateau a business executive a musical comedy star a minister of religion a boxer with an uninhibited if cultured tongue his zany manager a london society playgirl and her young german maid a senator a taciturn jew and a nearhysterical hostess or one apparently so and a gravely injured pilot who might live or die but willynilly i was stuck with them stuck with the responsibility of doing my damnedest to get these people to safety and the prospect appalled me how on earth was i even to start to go about it go about it with people with no arctic clothing to ward off the razoredged winds and inhuman cold people lacking in all knowledge and experience of arctic travel even lacking with two or three exceptions the endurance and sheer muscular strength to cope with the savagery of the greenland icecap i couldnt even begin to guess but whatever else they were lacking in at that moment it wasnt volubility the lifegiving warmth of the brandy had had the unfortunate side effect of loosening their tongues unfortunate that is from my point of view they had a hundred and one questions to ask and they seemed to think that i should have the answer to all of them more accurately they had only half a dozen questions to ask with a hundred and one variations of these how was it possible for a pilot to veer so many hundreds of miles off course could the compasses have gone wrong could the pilot have had a brainstorm but then surely both copilot and second pilot would have known something was wrong could the radio have been damaged it had been a bitterly cold afternoon even when they had left gander was it possible that some of the naps and controls had iced up forcing them off course but if this were the case why hadnt someone come to warn them of the possibility of the crash i answered all of their questions as best i could but these answers were all to the same effect that i didnt really know anything more about it than they did but you said some time ago that you did perhaps know one thing more than we did it was corazzini who put the question and he was looking at me shrewdly what was that dr mason what ah yes i remember now i hadnt forgotten but the way things were shaping up in my mind id had second thoughts about mentioning it and had time to think up a plausible alternative i need hardly tell you that its nothing that i actually know mr corazzini how could i wasnt in the plane just a reasonably informed guess in the absence of all other solutions its based on the scientific observations made here and in other igy stations in greenland some of them over the past eighteen months for over a year now we have been experiencing a period of intense sunspot activity thats one of the main interests of the igy year the most intense of this century as you may know sunspots or rather the emission of solar particles from these sunspots are directly responsible for the formation of the aurora borealis and magnetic storms both of these being related to disturbances in the ionosphere these disturbances can and actually almost invariably do interfere with radio transmission and reception and when severe enough can completely disrupt all normal radio communications and they can also produce temporary alterations of the earths magnetism which knock magnetic compasses completely out of kilter all of which was true enough as far as it went it would of course require extreme conditions to produce these effects but we have been experiencing these lately and im pretty sure that thats what happened with your plane where astral navigation by the stars that is is impossible as it was on a night like this you are dependent on radio and compasses as your two main navigational aids if these are knocked out what have you left a fresh hubbub of talk arose at this and though it was quite obvious that most of them had only a vague idea what i was talking about i could see that this idea was finding a fair degree of ready acceptance satisfying them and fitting the facts as they knew them i saw joss gazing at me with an expressionless face looked him in the eye for a couple of seconds then turned away as a radio operator joss knew even better than i that though there was still some sunspot activity it had reached its maximum in the previous year and as an exaircraft radio operator he knew that airliners flew on gyrocompasses which neither sunspots nor magnetic storms could ever affect in the slightest well have something to eat now i cut through the buzz of conversation any volunteers to give jackstraw a hand certainly marie legarde as i might have guessed was first on her feet im by way of being what you might call a mean cook lead me to it mr nielsen thanks joss you might give me a hand to rig a screen i nodded at the injured pilot well see what we can do for this boy here the stewardess unbidden moved forward to help me also i was on the point of objecting knew that this wasnt going to be nice but i didnt want trouble with her not yet i shrugged my shoulders and let her stay half an hour later i had done all i could it indeed hadnt been nice but both the patient and the stewardess had stood it far better than i had expected i was fixing and binding on a stiff leather helmet to protect the back of his head and joss was strapping him down inside the sleepingbag to the stretcher so that he couldnt toss around and hurt himself when the stewardess touched my arm what what do you think now dr mason its hard to be sure im not a specialist in brain or head injuries and even a specialist would hesitate to say the damage may have penetrated deeper than we think there may be haemorrhaging its often delayed in these cases but if theres no haemorrhaging she persisted if the damage is no worse than what you think what you see fiftyfifty i wouldnt have said so a couple of hours ago but he seems to have quite astonishing powers of resistance and recuperation better than an even chance i would say if he had the warmth the food the skilled nursing he would have in a first class hospital as it is well lets leave it at that shall we yes she murmured thank you i looked at her looked at the washedout face the faint blue circles forming under her eyes and almost felt touched with pity almost she was exhausted and shivering with cold bed i said youre dying for sleep and warmth miss im so sorry i forgot to ask your name ross margaret ross scots irish southern irish i wont hold it against you i smiled there was no answering smile from her tell me miss ross why was the plane so empty we had an x flight an extra or duplicate charter for an overflow of passengers out from london yesterday day before yesterday it is now i suppose we just stayed the night in idlewild and had to return after wed slept the office phoned up people who had booked out on the evening plane giving the chance of an earlier flight ten of them accepted i see by the way isnt it a bit unusual to have only one stewardess aboard on a transatlantic flight i mean i know theres usually two or three a steward and two stewardesses or two stewards and a stewardess but not for ten people of course hardly worth stewarding you might say still i went on smoothly it at least gives you time for the odd forty winks on these long nightflights that wasnt fair i hadnt been as clever as i thought and her white cheeks were stained with red thats never happened to me before never sorry miss ross it wasnt really meant as a dig it doesnt matter anyhow it does so matter her extraordinary brown eyes were bright with unshed tears if i hadnt been asleep i would have known what was going to happen i could have warned the passengers i could have moved colonel harrison to a front seat facing the rear colonel harrison i interrupted sharply yes the man in the back seat the dead man but he hadnt a uniform on when i dont care that was his name on the passenger list if id known he wouldnt be dead now and miss fleming wouldnt have had her collarbone broken so thats what has been worrying her i thought that accounts for her strange distraught behaviour and then a moment later i realised that it didnt account for it all she had been behaving like that before ever she had known what had happened to any of the passengers my slowly forming suspicions came back with renewed force the lady would bear watching youve nothing to reproach yourself with miss ross the captain must have been flying blind in the storm and were more than feet up here probably hed no knowledge of what was going to happen until the actual moment of crashing in my minds eye i saw again the doomed airliner landing lights on circling our cabin for at least ten minutes but if miss ross had any such thing in her minds eye it was impossible for me to detect it she had no idea at all or she was an extraordinarily good actress probably she murmured dully i dont know we had a hot and satisfying meal of soup corned meat potatoes and vegetables everything out of cans but passable enough for all that it was the last satisfying meal that our guests or ourselves for that matter were likely to have for some considerable time to come but i felt the moment unpropitious for breaking that sort of news time enough for that tomorrow or later in the day rather for it was now already after three oclock in the morning i suggested that the four women sleep in the top bunks not from any delicacy of sentiment but because it was at least twentyfive degrees wanner there than it was at ground level and the proportional difference would increase as the night wore on after the stove had been put out there were some halfhearted protests when they learnt that i intended to shut down the fire but i didnt even bother arguing with them like all people who have lived for any length of time in the arctic i had an almost pathological dread of fire margaret ross the stewardess refused the offer of a bunk and said she would sleep by the injured pilot lest he should wake and want anything during the night i had intended doing that myself but i saw her mind was set on it and though i felt unaccountably uneasy about the idea i raised no objection that left five empty bunks among six men jackstraw joss and i could sleep reasonably enough in our furs inevitably there was some magnanimous argument over the allocation of these bunks but corazzini settled the argument by producing a coin and beginning to toss for it he himself lost in the end but accepted defeat and the prospect of a cold uncomfortable night on the floor with amiable grace when they were all settled down i picked up a torch and our weather log book glanced at joss and made for the trap zagero turned in his bunk to look at me what gives dr mason especially at this hour of night what gives weather reports mr zagero thats why were here remember and im already three hours late with these even tonight even tonight continuity is the most important thing in weather observation sooner you than me he shivered if its only half as cold outside as it is in here he turned his back and joss rose to bis feet hed correctly interpreted my look and i knew he was consumed with curiosity til come with you sir better have a last look at the dogs we didnt bother looking at either the dogs or the weather instruments we went straight towards the tractor and huddled under the tarpaulin for what miserable shelter it could afford true the wind had eased but it was colder than ever the long winter night was beginning to close down on the icecap it stinks joss said flatly the whole setup stinks to high heaven i agreed but its finding out where the smell comes from that the trouble lies this fairy tale of yours about magnetic storms and compasses and radios he went on what was the idea id previously said i knew something they didnt i did but when it came to the bit i knew id be better to keep it to myself you know how this damnable cold slows up your mind should have realised it sooner realised what that i should keep it to myself keep what for heavens sake sorry joss not trying to build up suspense the reason none of them knew anything about the crash until after it had happened is that they were all doped as far as i could see all of them or nearly all were under the influence of some sleeping drug or narcotic in the darkness i could almost feel him staring at me after a long time he said softly you wouldnt say this unless you were sure of it i am sure of it their reactions their dazed fumbling back to reality and above all the pupils of their eyes unmistakable some kind of sleeping tablet mixtures of the fastacting kind what is known to the trade i believe as mickey finns but joss broke off he was still trying to orientate his mind to this new line of thought but they would be bound to know of it to be aware that they had been doped when they came to in normal circumstances yes but they came to in what was to say the least most abnormal circumstances im not saying that they didnt experience any symptoms of weakness dizziness and lassitude they must have done and what more natural than that they should ascribe any such unusual physical or mental symptoms to the effects of the crash and what more natural too than that they should conceal these symptoms as best they could and refrain from mentioning them they would be ashamed to admit or discuss weaknesses its a very human trait to show to your neighbours the very best face you can put on in times of emergency or danger joss didnt reply at once the implications of all this as id found out for myself took no little time for digestion so i let him take his time and waited listening to the lost and mournful wailing of the wind the rustling hiss of millions of ice spicules scudding across the frozen snow of the icecap and my own thoughts were in keeping with the bleak misery of the night its not possible joss muttered at length i could hear his teeth chattering with the cold you cant have some maniac rushing around an aircraft cabin with a hypo needle or dropping fizzballs into their gin and tonics you think they were all doped just about but how could anyone a moment joss i interrupted what happened to the rca what the sudden switch caught him momentarily offbalance what happened you mean how did it go for a burton ive no idea at all sir all i know is that these hinges couldnt have been knocked into the wall accidentally not with radio and equipment weighing about pounds sitting on top of them someone shoved them in deliberately and the only person anywhere near it at the time was the stewardess margaret ross everyone agreed on that yes but why in the name of heaven should anyone want to do a crazy thing like that i dont know i said wearily theres a hundred things i dont know but i do know she did it and whos in the best position to spike the drinks of aircraft passengers good god i could hear the sharp hissing intake of breath of course drinks or maybe the sweets they hand out at takeoff no i shook my head definitely in the darkness barley sugar is too weak a coveringup agent to disguise the taste of a drug coffee more likely it must have been her joss said slowly it must have been but but she acted as dazed and abnormal as any of the others more so if anything maybe shed reason to i said grimly come on lets get back or well freeze to death tell jackstraw when you get him by himself inside the cabin i propped the hatch open a couple of inches with fourteen people inside extra ventilation was essential then i glanced at the thermograph it showed below zero eighty degrees of frost i lay down on the floor pulled my parka hood tight to keep my ears from freezing and was asleep in a minute chapter four monday am pm for the first time in four months i had forgotten to set the alarmclock before i went to sleep and it was late when i awoke cold and stiff and sore all over from the uneven hardness of the wooden floor it was still dark as midnight two or three weeks had passed since the rim of the sun had shown above the horizon for the last time that year and all the light we had each day was two or three hours dim twilight round noon but a glance at the luminous face of my watch showed me that it was ninethirty i pulled the torch out from my parka located the oillamp and lit it the light was dim scarcely reaching the far corners of the cabin but sufficient to show the mummylike figures lying huddled on the bunks and sprawled grotesquely across the floor their frozen breath clouding before their faces and above their heads then condensing on the cabin walls the walls themselves were sheeted with ice which had extended far out across the roof in places reaching the skylights a condition largely brought about by the cold heavy air that had flooded down the opened hatchway during the night the outside temperature registered on the drum at below zero not everyone was asleep most of them i suspected had slept but little the numbing cold had seen to that but they were as warm in their bunks as they would be anywhere else and nobody showed any inclination to move things would be better when the cabin heated up a little i had trouble starting the stove even though it was gravity fed from a tank above and to one side of it the fuel oil had thickened up in the cold but when it did catch it went with a roar i turned both burners up to maximum put on the water bucket that had lain on the floor all night and was now nearly a solid mass of ice pulled on snowmask and goggles and clambered up the hatchway to have a look at the weather the wind had died away almost completely id known that from the slow and dispirited clacking of the anemometer cups and the icedrift which at times could reach up several hundred feet into the sky was no more than gentle puffs of dust stirring lazily and spectrally through the feeble beam of my torch across the glittering surface of the icecap the wind such as it was still held out to the east the cold too was still intense but more bearable than it had been on the previous night in terms of the effect of cold on human beings in the arctic absolute temperature is far from being the deciding factor wind is just as important every extra mile per hour is equivalent to a one degree drop in temperature and humidity far more so where the relative humidity is high even a few degrees below zero can become intolerable but today the wind was light and the air dry perhaps it was a good omen after that morning i never believed in omens again when i got below jackstraw was on his feet presiding over the coffeepot he smiled at me and his face was as fresh and rested as if hed had nine hours on a feather bed behind him but then jackstraw never showed fatigue or distress under any circumstances his tolerance to sleeplessness and the most exhausting toil was phenomenal he was the only one on his feet but far from the only one awake of those in the bunks only senator brewster was still asleep the others were facing into the centre of the room a few propped up on their elbows all of them were shivering and shivering violently their faces blue and white and pinched with the cold some were looking at jackstraw wrinkling their noses in anticipation of the coffee the pungent smell of which already filled the cabin others were staring in fascination at the sight of the ice on the roof melting as the temperature rose melting dripping down to the floor in a dozen different places and there beginning to form tiny stalagmites of ice building up perceptibly before their eyes the temperature on the cabin floor must have been almost forty degrees lower than that at the roof good morning dr mason marie legarde tried to smile at me but it was a pathetic effort and she looked ten years older than she had on the previous night she was one of the few with a sleepingbag but even so she must have passed a miserable six hours and there is nothing so exhausting to the human body as uncontrollable nightlong shivering a vicious circle in which the more one shivers the tireder one becomes and the tireder the less resistance to cold and hence the more shivering for the first time i knew that marie legarde was an old woman good morning i smiled how did you enjoy your first night in your new home first night even in the sleepingbag her movements of clasping her arms together and huddling her head down between her shoulders were unmistakable i hope to heaven that its the last night you run a very chilly establishment here dr mason im sorry next time well keep watches and have the stove on all night i pointed to the water splashing down to the floor the place is heating up already youll feel better when you have some hot coffee inside you til never feel better again she declared vigorously but the twinkle was back in her eye she turned to the young german girl in the next bunk and how do you feel this morning my dear better thank you miss legarde she seemed absurdly grateful that anyone should even bother to ask i dont feel a thing now means nothing miss legarde assured her cheerfully neither do i its just that were both frozen stiff and how did you survive the night mrs dansbygregg as you say i survived mrs dansbygregg smiled thinly as dr mason observed last night this is not the ritz that coffee smells delicious bring me a cup over fleming will you i picked up one of the cups jackstraw had poured out and took it across to the young german girl who was struggling to unzip her sleepingbag with her one good arm her embarrassment and discomfort were obvious but i knew id no option the time to stop this nonsense was before ever it had a chance to start you stay where you are young lady and drink this she took the cup reluctantly and i turned away youve surely forgotten mrs dansbygregg that helene has a broken collarbone the expression on her face made it quite obvious that she hadnt forgotten but she was no fool the gossip columnists would murder her for this if they got hold of it in her circle an outward if meaningless conformity to the accepted mores and virtues of the day was a sine qua non the knife between the ribs was permitted but only to the accompaniment of the wellbred smile im so sorry she said sweetly id quite forgotten of course her eyes were cold and hard and i knew i had an enemy that didnt worry me but i found the very triviality of the whole thing irritating beyond measure when there were so many other and vastly more important things to talk about but less than thirty seconds later we had forgotten all about it even i am sure mrs dansbygregg herself i was just handing marie legarde a cup when someone screamed it wasnt really loud i suppose but in that confined space it had a peculiarly piercing and startling quality marie legardes arm jerked violently and the scalding contents of the coffeecup were emptied over my bare hand i hardly noticed the pain it was margaret ross the young stewardess who had screamed and she was now kneeling half in and half out of her sleepingbag one rigidly spreadfingered hand stretched out at arms length before her the other clasped over her mouth as she stared down at the figure lying near her on the floor i pushed her to one side and sank on to my own knees in that bitter cold it was impossible to be any way sure but i felt reasonably certain that the young pilot had been dead for several hours i knelt there for a long time just looking down at him and when i finally rose to my feet i did so like an old man a defeated old man and i felt as cold almost as the dead man lying there everyone was wide awake now everyone staring at me the eyes of nearly all of them reflecting the superstitious horror which the presence of sudden and unexpected death brings to those who are unaccustomed to it it was johnny zagero who broke the silence hes dead isnt he dr mason his low voice sounded a little husky that head injury his voice trailed off cerebral haemorrhage i said quietly as far as i can tell i lied to him there was no shadow of doubt in my mind as to the cause of death murder the young boy had been ruthlessly coldbloodedly murdered lying there unconscious gravely injured and with his hands strapped helplessly to his sides he had been smothered as easily as surely as one might smother a very little child we buried him out on the icecap not fifty yards from the place where he had died bringing his stiffened body out of the hatch was a grisly job but we managed it and laid him on the snow while we sawed out a shallow grave for him in the light of one of our torches it was impossible to dig it out that frozen ringing surface turned shovel blades as would a bar of iron even at eighteen inches the impacted ntvt of snow and ice defied the serrated spearpoints of our special snow saws but it was deep enough and within a few hours the eternal icedrift would have smoothed its blanket across the grave and we would never be able to find it again the reverend joseph smallwood murmured some sort of burial service over the grave but his teeth chattered so violently in the cold and his voice was so low and indistinct and hurried that i could hardly catch a word of it i thought wryly that heavenly forgiveness for this indecent haste was unlikely to be withheld by all odds it must have been by far the coldest funeral service that mr smallwood had ever conducted back in the cabin breakfast was a sketchy and silent affair even in the steadily rising warmth the melancholy gloom was an almost palpable blanket under the dripping ceiling hardly anybody said anything hardly anybody ate anything margaret ross ate nothing and when she finally set down her coffeecup the contents had scarcely been touched youre overdoing it my dear i thought viciously youre carrying the griefstricken act just a little too far a little longer and even the others will start wondering and they have no suspicions at all you damned inhuman little murderess for i had no suspicions either only certainty there was no doubt in my mind at all but that she had smothered the young pilot she was only slightly built but then it would have required only slight strength lashed to the cot as he had been he wouldnt even have been able to drum his heels as he had died i could feel my flesh crawl at the very thought she had killed him just as she had broken the radio and doped the passengers he had been killed obviously to keep him from talking about what i couldnt even begin to guess any more than i could guess the reason for the destruction of the radio except that she clearly did not want the news of the crash broadcast to the outer world but why in the world destroy the radio in the first place surely she must have known how essential it was for survival but then after all how was she even to have guessed that she might well have thought that we had big fast tractors that could have whipped them down to the coast in a matter of a couple of days for that matter she might have thought she was a great deal nearer the coast than we really were it was impossible surely that she had genuinely imagined that we were in iceland or was it my thoughts were spinning now in an unbreakable circle i knew i was getting nowhere couldnt possibly get anywhere without some fresh information as it was i was only confusing myself the more with the passing of every moment i gave it up then promising myself that from now on i would watch her every possible minute of the day i looked at her again covertly and she was staring vacantly at one of the glowing embers of the stove planning her next move no doubt planning it as cleverly as the last asking me last night about the pilots chances of survival doubtless to decide whether he would have to be killed or could safely be left to die had been clever enough but insisting on sleeping next to the man she had meant to kill had been nothing short of brilliant on that account alone no one would ever suspect her even if the fact that it had been murder became known and it wouldnt i intended keeping that to myself or did she suspect i suspected heaven only knew all i knew was that she must be playing for tremendous stakes or that she was mad it was just after eleven oclock joss and jackstraw were in a corner by themselves stripping down the smashed transmitter while the rest were grouped in a large semicircle round the stove they looked wan and sickly and were sitting very still indeed they looked unwell because the first greyness of the noon twilight was stealing through our rimed skylights and it did unflattering things to any complexion and they sat so still because i had just explained to them in detail exactly what their situation was and they didnt like it one little bit neither did i lets get this quite straight dr mason corazzini leant forward his lean brown face intent and serious he was worried all right but he wasnt scared corazzini didnt look as if he would scare easily i had the idea that he would be a pretty good man to have around the others left here three weeks ago in a big modern snocat and arent expected back for another three weeks youve overstayed your welcome on the icecap you say and things have been cut a trifle too fine you had already started rationing yourselves to make your food spin out until they returned with thirteen of us here we have food for less than five days therefore we may be a fortnight without food before they return he smiled but there was no humour in it my arithmetic is correct dr mason it is unfortunately how long would the tractor you have take to get to the coast theres no guarantee that it ever would i told you its falling to pieces ill show you later maybe a week given the right conditions any bad weather would stop it in its tracks you doctors are all the same zagero drawled always spreadin sweet cheerfulness and light why dont we wait for the other machine to get back indeed senator brewster said heavily and how do you propose to live in the meanwhile mr zagero people can live for longer than fourteen days without food senator zagero said cheerfully think what it would do for that figure of yours tush senator you surprise me too gloomy by half not in this case i said flatly the senator is right sure you can live a long time without food in normal conditions you might even do it here if you had proper day clothes and night coverings you havent and how many of you have stopped shivering since you came here cold burns up your energy and depletes your reserves at a fantastic pace do you want me to list all the arctic and antarctic explorers and himalayan climbers who have died within fortyeight hours of their food running out and dont kid yourselves about the lifegiving warmth of this cabin the floor temperature is about zero now and thats as hot as its likely to get you said there was a radio on your old tractor corazzini said abruptly what range does it have couldnt you possibly reach your friends or your uplavnik base with that i nodded in josss direction theres the man to ask i heard joss said without enthusiasm do you think id be trying to salvage this wreckage mr corazzini if there was any chance its an eightwatt transmitter with handcranked generator and battery receiver it came out of the ark and was never meant for anything more than walkietalkie use but what is its range corazzini persisted impossible to say joss shrugged you know how it is with transmission and reception one day you can hardly pick up the bbc a hundred miles away another you can pick up a taxicab at twice the distance if you have the right receiver all depends on conditions this one hundred miles maybe hundred fifty in perfect conditions in the present conditions youd be better with a megaphone ill have a go with it this afternoon perhaps might as well waste my time that way as any other joss turned away and it was obvious that as far as he was concerned the subject was closed perhaps your friends will move within transmission range corazzini suggested after all you said theyre not much more than a couple of hundred miles away and i said theyll be staying there theyve set up their equipment and instruments and they wont move until they have to theyre too short of petrol for that they can refuel here of course thats no worry i jerked a thumb towards the tunnel theres eight hundred gallons out there i see corazzini looked thoughtful for a moment then went on please dont think im being annoyingly persistent i just want to eliminate possibilities i believe you have or have had a radio schedule with your friends wont they worry if they fail to hear from you hillcrest thats the scientist in charge never worries about anything and unfortunately their own radio a big longrange job is giving trouble they said a couple of days ago that the generator brushes were beginning to give out and the nearest spares are here if they cant raise us theyll probably blame themselves anyway they know were safe as houses here why on earth should they worry so what do we do solly levin asked querulously starve to death or start hikin succinctly and admirably put senator brewster boomed in a nutshell one might say i propose we set up a small committee to investigate the possibilities this isnt washington senator i said mildly besides we already have a committee mr london mr nielsen and myself indeed it seemed to be the senators favourite word and long years of practice had matched it perfectly to the lift of his eyebrows you will remember perhaps that we have rather a personal stake in this also im unlikely to forget it i said dryly look senator if you were adrift in a hurricane and were picked up by a ship would you presume to advise the captain and his officers of the course they should adopt to survive the hurricane thats not the point senator brewster puffed out his cheeks this is not a ship shut up it was corazzini who spoke his voice quiet and hard and i could suddenly understand why he had reached the top in his own particularly tough and competitive business or mason is absolutely right this is their own backyard and our lives should be left in the hands of experts i take it you have already reached a decision dr mason i reached it last night joss mr london stays here to contact the others when they return he will be left enough food for three weeks we take the remainder and we leave tomorrow why not today because the tractor is at present unfit for winter travel especially travel with ten passengers its still got the canvas hood on it that it had when we hauled stuff up from the coast we have the prefabricated wooden sides and top that we need to arcticise it plus the bunks and portable stove but it will take several hours we start on that now soon but first your luggage well go out to the plane now and bring that back thank goodness for that mrs dansbygregg said stiffly i was beginning to think id never see my stuff again oh you will i said briefly just what do you mean by that she asked suspiciously i mean that youll all put on as many clothes as youre able to stagger about in i said then you have a small attachecase for your valuables if you have any the rest of the stuff well have to abandon this is no cooks tour well have no room on the tractor but but i have clothes worth hundreds of pounds she protested angrily hundreds thousands would be nearer it i have a balenciaga alone that cost over five hundred pounds not to mention how much do you reckon your own life is worth zagero said shortly he grinned or maybe we should abandon you and save the balenciaga better still wear it on top of everything you know how the welldressed woman leaves the icecap excruciatingly funny she stared at him icily frequently fracture myself zagero agreed can i give you a hand with the stuff doc you stay here johnny zagero solly levin jumped up in agitation one little slip on that ice calm yourself calm yourself zagero patted his shoulder merely goin in a supervisory capacity solly how about it doc thanks you want to come mr corazzini i could see he was already struggling into a parka id be glad to cant sit here all day these cuts on your head and hands arent sealed yet theyll sting like the devil when you get out into this cold got to get used to it havent i lead the way the airliner crouching in the snow like some great wounded bird was faintly visible in the twilight now seven or eight hundred yards away to the northeast port wingtip facing us lying at exactly right angles to our line of sight there was no saying how often we might have to go out there the quasi daylight would be gone in another hour or so and it seemed pointless to follow in darkness the zigzag route we had been compelled to make the previous night so with help from zagero and corazzini i staked out a route with bamboo markers about five yards apart straight out to the plane some of the bamboos i fetched from the tunnel but most of them were transplanted from the positions where they had been stuck the previous night inside the plane itself it was as cold as the tomb and as dark as the tomb one side of the plane was already thickly sheeted in drift ice and all the windows were completely blanked off made opaque by rime frost in the light of a couple of torches we ourselves moved around like spectres our heads enveloped in the clouds of our frozen breath clouds that remained hanging almost stationary above our heads in the silence we could faintly hear the crackling of our breath in the superchilled air followed by the curious wheezing noise that men make in very low temperatures when they were trying not to breathe too deeply god this is a ghastly place zagero said he shivered whether or not from cold it was impossible to say and flashed his torch at the dead man sitting in the back seat are we are we going to leave them there doc leave them i dumped a couple of attachecases on to the pile we were making in the front seat what on earth do you mean i dont know i thought well we buried the second officer this morning andbury them the icecap will bury them soon enough in six months time this plane will have drifted over and be vanished for ever but i agree lets get out of here give anyone the creeps as i made my way to the front i saw corazzini a doleful look on his face shaking an ebonite and metal portable radio and listening to the rattling that came from inside another casualty i inquired afraid so he twiddled some dials without result battery and mains model a goner doc valves i expect still ill tote it along cost me two hundred dollars two days ago two hundred i whistled you should have bought two maybe joss can give you some valves hes got dozens of spares no good corazzini shook his head latest transistor model thats why it was so damn expensive take it with you i advised itll only cost you another two hundred to get it repaired in glasgow listen theres jackstraw now we could hear the barking of dogs and we lost no time in lowering the odds and ends down to jackstraw who loaded them on the sledge in the forward hold we found about twentyfive suitcases of various sizes we had to make two trips to bring all the stuff back and on the second trip the rising wind was in our faces already lifting the drift off the icecap the climate on the greenland plateau is one of the most unstable in the world and the wind which had all but stopped for a few hours had now veered suddenly to the south i didnt know what it presaged but i suspected it wasnt anything good we were all chilled to the bone by the time the luggage had been lowered down into the cabin and corazzini looked at me his eyes sober and speculative he was shaking with cold and his nose and one of his cheeks were white with frostbite and when he pulled off one of his gloves the hand too was limp and white and dead is this what its like to be exposed to this stuff for half an hour dr mason im afraid it is and were to be out in this for maybe seven days and seven nights good god man well never make it and the women old miss legarde and brewster and mahler theyre no chickens either he broke off wincing and i was beginning to suspect that it would take a great deal to make this man wince as the circulation returned under the influence of vigorous rubbing its nothing short of suicide its a gamble i corrected staying here and starving to death is suicide you put the alternative so nicely he smiled a smile that never touched the cold and determined eyes but i guess youre right at that lunch that day was a bowl of soup and crackers poor fare at any time shockingly insufficient to stay and warm men who would have to work for the next few hours in these bitter subzero temperatures above but there was no help for it if it would take us a week to reach the coast and in all optimism i couldnt count on less rationing would have to start now in a matter of a couple of hours the thermometer reading had risen with astonishing speed these dramatic temperature variations were commonplace on the icecap and it was beginning to snow when we emerged from the hatch and moved across to where the tractor lay the rise in temperature flattered only to deceive the south wind brought with it not only snow but a rapidly climbing humidity and the air was almost unbearably chill we ripped off the covering tarpaulin it cracked and tore but i was no longer concerned with preserving it and our guests saw for the first time the vehicle upon which all their lives were to depend slowly i played my torch over it the dark shroud of the arctic night had already fallen across the icecap and i heard the quick indrawn hiss of breath beside me drove it out when the museum attendant wasnt looking i suppose corazzini kept his voice carefully expressionless or did you just find it here left over from the last iceage it is a bit old i admitted prewar but all we can afford the british government isnt quite so lavish with its igy expenditure as the russians and your people know it its the prototype the ancestor of the modern arctic tractor never seen it before what is it french a citroen underpowered narrowtracked as you can see and far too short for its weight lethal in crevasse country plods along fairly well on the frozen icecap but youd be better with a bicycle when theres any depth at all of newfallen snow but its all we have corazzini said no more as the managing director of a factory producing some of the finest tractors in the world i suppose his heart was too full to say any more but his disappointment made no difference to his drive his sheer unflagging determination for the next few hours he worked like a demon so too did zagero less than five minutes after we had started work we had to stop again to rig up a canvas screen lashed to aluminium poles brought up from the runnel round three sides of the tractor work had been impossible in that snow and knifelike wind that lanced through even the bulkiest layers of clothing and most of them were now wearing so many that they could move only with difficulty as if they were tissue paper behind this screen we placed a portable oil stove the very illusion of warmth was better than nothing two storm lanterns and the blowtorches without which we could have made no progress at all even with this shelter practically everyone had to go below from time to time to rub and pound life back into his freezing body only jackstraw and i in our caribou furs could stay up almost indefinitely joss was below all the afternoon after spending a couple of hours trying to raise our field party on the tractors emergency radio he gave up and went doggedly back to work on the rca our first job the removal of the hoped canvas hood gave us some measure of the difficulty of the task that lay before us the hood was secured by only seven bolts and nuts but these had been in position for over four months now were frozen solid and took over an hour to remove each set had to be thawed out separately by blowtorch before the heavy wrenches could get the nuts to turn then came the assembly of the wooden body this was in fifteen prefabricated pieces three each for the floor sides roof and front the back was only a canvas screen each set of three pieces had to be brought out singly through the narrow hatchway before assembly and it was the devils own job in that numbing cold and flickering semidarkness to locate and line up the boltholes in the wood with the matching holes in the connecting iron crosspieces it took us well over an hour to assemble and fit the floor section alone and it was beginning to look as if we would be here until midnight when corazzini had the idea and a brilliant one it seemed at the time of assembling the various sections in the comparative warmth and brightness of the cabin sliding the complicated piece out vertically into the food and fuel tunnel sawing a long narrow slit through the snow roof which was no more than a foot thick in the middle and hauling the sections up from below after this we made rapid progress by five oclock the entire body shell was completed and with the end in sight less than a couple of hours away everyone worked more furiously than ever most of them were unskilled hamhanded and completely unused to any physical work at all far less work of this cruel exacting nature but my opinion of them was rising all the time corazzini and zagero especially were tireless and theodore mahler the silent little jew whose entire conversational range so far had been limited to yes no please and thank you was indefatigable completely selfless and uncomplaining driving his slight body to lengths of which i would never have believed it capable even the senator the rev smallwood and solly levin did what they could as best they could trying their best to hide their misery and their pain by this time everyone even jackstraw and myself was shaking almost uncontrollably with the cold so that our hands and elbows rattattatted like machineguns against the wooden sides of the tractor and our hands themselves through constant contact with metal were in a shocking state puffed and bleeding and blistered the mittens continuously filled with lumps and slivers of ice that never melted we had just installed the four collapsible bunks and were fitting the stovepipe through its circular hole in the roof when someone called me i jumped down and all but knocked over marie legarde you shouldnt be out here i scolded its far too cold for you miss legarde dont be silly peter i could never bring myself to call her marie though she had asked me to several times i have to get used to it dont i would you come below for a moment or two ptease why im busy but not indispensable she retorted i want you to have a look at margaret margaret oh the stewardess what does she want nothing its i who want it why are you so hostile towards her she asked curiously its not like you at least i dont think it is shes a fine girl what does the fine girl want what in the worlds got into you why oh forget it im not going to fight with you her back hurts shes in considerable pain come and see it please i offered to see it last night if she wants me now why doesnt she come and ask me because shes scared of you thats why she said angrily she stamped a foot in the frozen snow will you go or not i went below i stripped off my gloves emptied the ice out of them and washed my blistered bleeding hands in disinfectant i saw marie legardes eyes widen at the sight of my hands but she said nothing maybe she knew i wasnt in the mood for condolences i rigged up a screen in the corner of the room remote from the table where the women had been gathering and dividing out the remaining food supplies and had a look at margaret rosss back it was a mess all right a great ugly blue and purpling bruise from the spine to the left shoulder in the centre just below the shoulder blade was a deep jagged cut which looked as if it had been caused by a heavy blow from some triangular piece of sharp metal whatever had caused it had passed clean through her tunic and blouse why didnt you show me this yesterday i asked coldly i didnt want to bother you she faltered didnt want to bother me i thought grimly didnt want to give yourself away you mean in my minds eye i had a picture of the pantry where we had found her and i was almost certain now that i could get the proof that i needed almost but not quite id have to go to check is it very bad she twisted round and i could see there were tears in the brown eyes from the pain of the disinfectant i was rubbing on none too gently bad enough i said shortly how did you get this ive no idea she said helplessly i just dont know dr mason perhaps we can find out find out why what does it matter she shook her head wearily i dont understand i really dont what have i done dr mason it was magnificent i had to admit i could have hit her but it was magnificent nothing miss ross just nothing at all by the time i had pulled on my parka gloves goggles and mask she was fully dressed staring at me as i climbed up the steps and out through the hatch the snow was falling quite heavily now gusting in swirling ghostly flumes through the pale beam of my torch it seemed to vanish as it hit the ground freezing as it touched or scudding smokelike over the frozen surface with a thin rustling sound but the wind was at my back the bamboo markers stretched out in a dead straight line ahead never less than two of them in the beam of my torch and i had reached the crashed plane in five or six minutes i jumped for the windscreen hooked my fingers over the sill hauled myself up with some difficulty and wriggled my way into the control cabin a moment later i was in the stewardesss pantry flashing my torch around on the after bulkhead was a big refrigerator with a small hinged table in front of it and at the far end under the window a hinged box covered over what might have been a heating unit or sink or both i didnt bother investigating i wasnt interested what i was interested in was the forard bulkhead and i examined it carefully it was given up entirely to the small closed doors of little metal lockers let in flush to the wall food containers probably and there wasnt a single metal projection in the entire wall nothing that could possibly account for the wound in the stewardesss back and if she had been here at the moment of impact that was the wall she must have been flung against the inference was inescapable she must have been elsewhere at the time of the crash i remembered now with chagrin that i hadnt even bothered to see whether or not she was conscious when wed first found her lying on the floor across the passage in the radio compartment i found what i was looking for almost immediately id a pretty good idea where to look the thin sheet metal at the top lefthand corner of the radio cabinet was bent almost half an inch out of true and it didnt require any microscope to locate or forensic expert to guess at the significance of the small dark stain and the fibres of navy blue cloth clinging to the corner of the smashed set i looked inside the set itself and now that i had time to spare it more than a fleeting glance it was abundantly clear to me that the wrenching away of the faceplate didnt even begin to account for the damage that had been done to the set it had been systematically and thoroughly wrecked if ever there was a time when my thoughts should have been racing it was then but the plain truth is that they werent it was abominably cold inside the chilled metal of that dead plane and my mind was sluggish but even so i knew that this time i couldnt be wrong about what had happened i could see now why the second officer had sent out no distress messages i could see now why he had almost certainly been sending out his regular on route on time checks to base poor devil he hadnt had much option not with the stewardess sitting there with a gun on him it must have been a gun it was no consolation at all that the crash had caught her unprepared a gun gradually ever so gradually in infuriating slowmotion process thoughts were beginning to click into place in my numbed mind whoever had landed that plane landed it so skilfully into the blinding maelstrom of last nights blizzard it hadnt been a dead man i straightened walked forward into the control cabin and shone my torch on the dead captain of the plane as id noticed when id first seen him he appeared to be completely unmarked and i dont know whether it was some unconscious process of logical reasoning or some strange instinct that made me right away lift up the crackling icestiffened tunic j acket enough to see the black powderringed bullet hole in the middle of the spine i had been expecting it i had been uncannily certain that i would find such a hole and find it just there but my mouth was suddenly dry dry as if i had drunk nothing for days and my heart was thudding heavily in my chest i lowered the jacket pulled it down into position turned away and walked slowly towards the rear of the plane the man the stewardess had called colonel harrison was still sitting as i had left him propped up stiffly in a comer as stiffly as he would remain there for heaven only knew how many frozen centuries to come the jacket was fastened by a central button i undid it saw nothing except a curious thin leather strap running across the chest undid a shirt button another and there it was the same deadly little hole the same powderringed evidence of pointblank firing staining the whiteness of the singlet but in this case the powder marks were concentrated on the upper part of the ring showing that the pistol had beendirected in a slightly downward angle on a hunch but still like a man in a dream i eased him forward and there less like a bullet hole in the jacket than an inconsequential rip one might easily overlook was the point of exit matched by an equally tiny tear in the padding of the upholstered seat behind at the time that carried no special significance for me heaven knows that i was in no mental frame of mind at the moment anyway to figure anything out i was like an automaton the movements of which were controlled by something outside me i felt nothing at the time not even horror at the hideous thought that the mans neck might well have been coldbloodedly broken after death to conceal its true cause the leather strap across the mans chest led to a feltcovered holster under the arm i took out the little dark snubnosed automatic pressed the release switch and shook the magazine out from the base of the grip it was an eight shot clip full i replaced it and shoved the gun into the inside pocket of my parka there were two inside breast pockets in the jacket the lefthand one held another clip of ammunition in a thin leather case this too i pocketed the righthand pocket held only passport and wallet the picture on the passport matched the face and it was made out in the name of lieutcolonel robert harrison the wallet contained little of interest a couple of letters with an oxford postmark obviously from his wife british and american currency notes and a long cutting that had been torn from the top half of a page of the new york herald tribune with a midseptember datemark just over two months previously for a brief moment i studied this in the light of my torch there was a small indistinct picture of a railway smash of some kind showing carriages on a bridge that ended abruptly over a stretch of water with boats beneath and i realised that it was some kind of followup story on the shocking train disaster of about that time when a loaded commuters train at elizabeth new jersey had plunged out over an opened span of the bridge into the waters of newark bay i was in no mood for reading it then but i had the obscure unreasonable idea that it might be in some way important i folded it carefully lifted up my parka and thrust the paper into my inside pocket along with the gun and the spare ammo clip it was just at that moment that i heard the sharp metallic sound coming from the front of the dark and deserted plane chapter five monday pm pm for maybe five seconds maybe ten i sat there without moving as rigid and motionless as the dead man by my side bent right arm frozen in the act of folding the newspaper cutting into my parka pocket looking back on it i can only think that my brain had been half numbed from too long exposure to the cold that the shock of the discovery of the savagely murdered men had upset me more than i would admit even to myself and that the morguelike atmosphere of that chill metal tomb had affected my normally unimaginative mind to a degree quite unprecedented in my experience or maybe it was a combination of all three that triggered open the floodgates to the atavistic racial superstitions that lurk deep in the minds of all of us the nameless dreads that can in a moment destroy the tissue veneer of our civilisation as if it had never been and send the adrenalin pumping crazily into the bloodstream however it was i had only one thought in mind at that moment no thought rather but an unreasoning bloodfreezing certainty that one of the dead pilots or the flight engineer had somehow risen from his seat and was walking back towards me even yet i can remember the frenzy of my wild frantic hope that it wasnt the copilot the man who had been sitting in the righthand pilots seat when the telescoping nose of the airliner had folded back on him mangling him out of all human recognition heaven only knows how long i might have sat there petrified in this superstitious horror had the sound from the control cabin not repeated itself but again i heard it the same metallic scraping sound as someone moved around in the darkness among the tangled wreckage of the flight deck and as the touch of an electric switch can turn a room from pitch darkness to the brightness of daylight so this second sound served to recall me in an instant from the thrall of superstition and panic to the world of reality and reason and i dropped swiftly to my knees behind the high padded back of the seat in front of me for what little shelter it offered my heart was still pounding the hairs still stiff on the back of my neck but i was a going concern again my mind beginning to race under the impetus invariably provided by the need for selfpreservation and that selfpreservation entered very acutely into it i did not for a moment doubt a person who had killed three times to achieve her ends had no doubt at all as to the identity of the person in the control cabin only the stewardess had seen me leave for the plane and protect her secret wouldnt hesitate to kill a fourth and she knew her secret was no longer a secret not while i lived i had stupidly made my suspicions plain to her and not only was she ready to kill but she had the means to kill of the fact that she carried a gun and was murderously ready to use it id had grisly evidence in the past few minutes nor need she hesitate to use it apart from the fact that falling snow had a peculiarly blanketing effect on all sound the south wind would carry the crack of a pistolshot away from the cabin then something snapped inside my mind and i was all of a sudden fighting mad perhaps it was the thought of the four dead men five including the copilot perhaps it was the inevitable reaction from my panicstricken fear of a moment ago and perhaps too it had no little to do with the realisation that i too had a gun i brought it out from my pocket transferred the torch to my left hand jumped up pressed the torch button and started running down the aisle it was proof enough of my utter inexperience in this murderous game of hideandseek that it was not until i was almost at the door at the forward end of the cabin that i remembered how easy it would have been for anyone to crouch down behind the backs of one of the rearward facing front seats and shoot me at pointblank range as i passed but there was no one there and as i plunged through the door i caught a fleeting glimpse of a dark muffled figure no more than a featureless silhouette in the none too powerful beam of my torch wriggling out through the smashed windscreen of the control cabin i brought up my automatic the thought that i could be indicted on a murder charge for killing a fleeing person no matter how criminal a person never entered my mind and squeezed the trigger nothing happened i squeezed the trigger again and before i remembered the existence of such a thing as a safetycatch the windscreen was no more than an empty frame for the thickening snow that swirled greyly in the darkness beyond and i plainly heard the thud of feet hitting the ground cursing my stupidity and again oblivious of the perfect target i was presenting i leaned far out of the window again i was lucky again i had another brief sight of the figure this time scurrying round the tip of the left wing before vanishing into the snow and the dark three seconds later i was on the ground myself i landed awkwardly but picked myself up at once and skirted round the wing pounding after the fleeing figure with all the speed i could muster in the hampering bulkiness of my furs she was running straight back to the cabin following the line of bamboo sticks and i could both hear the thudding of feet in the frozen snow and see the wildly erratic swinging of a torch the beam one moment pooling whitely on the ground beside the flying feet the next reaching ahead to light up the bamboo line she was moving swiftly much more so than i would have thought her capable of doing but nevertheless i was steadily overhauling her when suddenly the torch beam ahead curved away in a new direction as the runner angled off into the darkness about fortyfive degrees to the left i turned after her still following both my sight of the torch and sound of the feet thirty yards forty fifty then i stopped and stood very still indeed the torch ahead had gone out and i could hear nothing at all for the second time that night i cursed my unthinking folly what i should have done of course was to carry straight on back to the cabin and await the moment she turned up there as she inevitably must no person could hope to survive for any great length of time without shelter of some kind in the deadly cold of that arctic night but it wasnt too late yet the wind had been blowing almost directly in my face as i had been running all i had to do was walk back keeping it on my left cheek and i would be bound to hit the line of bamboos at right angles and the chances of my passing unwittingly between two of them with the light of my torch to help me did not exist i turned took one step then two then halted in my tracks why had i been lured out here away from the bamboo line not so that she could thereby escape me she couldnt do it that way as long as we both lived we were both utterly dependent on the cabin and would have to meet there sooner or later as long as we both lived god what a fool i was what a veriest amateur at this game the only way she could escape me really and permanently escape me was if i no longer lived i could be shot down here and no one would ever know and as she had stopped running before i had and been first to switch out her torch she must have a much better idea of my position than i of hers and these two rash incautious steps i had taken had given her a new and even more accurate bearing on my position perhaps she was only feet away now lining her gun up for the kill i switched on my torch and whirled round in a complete circle nobody there nothing to be seen at all only the frozen feathers of the snow brushing my cheeks in the blackness of the night the low moaning lament of the soughing south wind and the faint rustle of ice spicules brushing their blind way across the ironhard surface of the icecap swiftly softly i moved half a dozen long steps to my left my torch was out now and id been crazy ever to switch it on in the first place nothing could have been better calculated to betray my position the light of a torch seen head on can be seen at twenty times the farthest distance that its beam will reach i prayed that a flurry of snow had hidden it where would the attack come from downwind so that i could see nothing in that blinding snow or upwind so that i could hear nothing downwind i decided on the icecap one could move as silently as on a tarmacadam road the better to hear i pulled the parka hood off my head the better to see i slipped up my goggles and stared out unwinkingly under my visored hands five minutes passed and nothing happened if that is the freezing of my ears and forehead could be called nothing still no sound still no sight of anything the strain the nerveracking expectancy could not be borne for much longer slowly with infinite care i moved off in a circle of about twenty yards diameter but i saw nothing heard nothing and so well adjusted now were my eyes to the darkness so well attuned my ears to the icecaps mournful symphony of sound that i would have sworn that had there been anyone there to be seen or heard i would have seen or heard them it was as if i were alone on the icecap and then the appalling truth struck me i was alone i was alone i realised in a belated and chilling flash of understanding because shooting me would have been a stupid way of disposing of both myself and my dangerous knowledge the discovery of a bulletriddled body on the icecap during the brief hours of daylight would have provoked a hundred questions and suspicions much more desirable from the killers point of view would be my dead body without a trace of violence even the most experienced man can get lost in a snowstorm on the icecap and i was lost i knew i was lost i was convinced of it even before i got the wind on my left and walked back to the line of bamboo poles the bamboos were no longer there i made a wide circle but still found nothing for at least twenty yards back in the direction of the plane and probably all the way towards the cabin the poles had been removed that slender series of markers which alone meant all the difference between safety and being irrecoverably lost on the icecap were no longer there i was lost really and truly lost for once that night i didnt panic it wasnt just that i knew that panic would be the end of me i was consumed by a cold fury that i should have been so ignominiously tricked so callously left to die but i wasnt going to die i couldnt even begin to guess what the tremendously high stakes must be in the murderous game that this incredibly ruthless wickedlydeceptive gentlefaced stewardess was playing but i swore to myself that i wasnt going to be one of the pawns that were going to be brushed off the table i stood still and took stock the snow was increasing now thickening by the minute building up into a blizzard with visibility cut down to a few feet the yearly precipitation of the icecap was no more than seven or eight inches and it was just my evil luck that it should fall so heavily that night the wind was southerly or had been but in that fickle greenland climate there was no knowing what minute it might back or veer my torch was failing continual use plus the cold had left it with a pale yellowish beam that reached not much more than a few yards but that was the limit of visibility anyway even downwind the plane i calculated was not much more than a hundred yards away the cabin six hundred my chances of stumbling upon the latter flush as it almost was with the surface of the icecap were no better than one in a hundred but my chances of finding the plane or what came to the same thing the great quartermile trench that it had gouged out in the frozen snow when it had crashlanded were far better than even it was impossible that it could have already been filled in with drift i turned until i had the wind over my left shoulder and started walking i reached the deep furrow in the snow inside a minute id switched off my torch to conserve the battery but my stumble and heavy fall as i went over the edge was intimation enough turned right and reached the plane in thirty seconds i suppose i might possibly have lasted out the night inside the wrecked fuselage but such was my singleness of purpose at the moment that the thought never occurred to me i walked round the wing picked up the first of the bamboos in the dim beam of my torch and started to follow them there were only five altogether after that nothing every one of the others had been removed these five i knew pointed straight towards the cabin and all i had to do was to keep shifting the last of the five to the front lining it up straight with the others in the light of my torch and it would be bound to bring out to the cabin or so i thought for perhaps ten seconds but it was a task that really required two people to achieve anything like accuracy what with that the feebleness of my rapidly dying torch and the hopeless visibility i couldnt be accurate within two or three degrees at the least that seemed a trifle but when i stopped and worked it out i discovered that over the distance even one degree out would have put me almost forty feet off course on a night like that i could pass by the cabin ten feet away and never see it there were less laborious means of committing suicide i picked up the five sticks returned to the plane and walked along the furrowed trench till i came to the depression where the plane had touched down the foot line of the antenna i knew was roughly four hundred yards away just a little bit south of west slightly to my left that was as i stood with my back to the plane i didnt hesitate i strode out into the darkness counting my steps concentrating on keeping the wind a little more than on my left cheek but not quite full face after four hundred long paces i stopped and pulled out my torch it was quite dead the dull red glow from the filament didnt even register on my glove six inches away and the darkness was as absolute as it would ever become on the icecap i was a blind man moving in a blind world and all i had left to me was the sense of touch for the first time fear came to me and i all but gave way to an almost overpowering instinct to run but there was no place to run to i pulled the drawstring from my hood and with numbed and clumsy hands lashed together two of the bamboos to give me a stick seven feet in length a third bamboo i thrust into the snow then lay down flat the sole of my boot touching it while i described a complete circle flailing out with my long stick into the darkness nothing at the full stretch of my body and the stick i stuck the last two bamboos into the snow one upwind the other downwind from the central bamboo and described horizontal flailing circles round both of these again nothing i gathered up the bamboos walked ten paces more and repeated the performance i had the same luck again and again and again five minutes and seventy paces after i had stopped for the first time i knew i had completely missed the antenna line and was utterly lost the wind must have backed or veered and i had wandered far off my course and then came the chilling realisation that if that were so i had no idea now where the plane lay and could never regain it even had i known the direction where it lay i doubted whether i could have made my way back anyway not because i was tired but because my only means of gauging direction was the wind in my face and my face was so completely numbed that i could no longer feel anything i could hear the wind but i couldnt feel it ten more paces i told myself ten more and then i must turn back turn back where a mocking voice seemed to ask me but i ignored it and stumbled on with leadenfooted steps doggedly counting and on the seventh step i walked straight into one of the big antenna poles staggered with the shock all but fell recovered grabbed the pole and hugged it as if i would never let go i knew at that moment what it must be like to be condemned to death and then live again it was the most wonderful feeling i had ever experienced and then the relief and the exultation gradually faded and anger returned to take its place a cold vicious allconsuming anger of which i would never have believed myself capable with my stick stretched up and running along the rimed antenna cable to guide me i ran all the way back to the cabin i was vaguely surprised to see shadows still moving in the lamplit screen that surrounded the tractor it was almost impossible for me to realise that i had been gone no more than thirty minutes but i passed by opened the hatch and dropped down into the cabin joss was still in the far corner working on the big radio and the four women were huddled close round the stove the stewardess i noticed wore a parka one she had borrowed from joss and was rubbing her hands above the flame cold miss ross i inquired solicitously at least i had meant it to sound that way but even to myself my voice sounded hoarse and strained and why shouldnt she be dr mason marie legarde snapped dr mason i noted shes just spent the last fifteen minutes or so with the men on the tractor doing what i was giving them coffee for the first time the stewardess showed some spirit whats so wrong in that nothing i said shortly takes you a damned long time to pour a cup of coffee i thought savagely most kind im sure massaging my frozen face i walked away into the food tunnel nodding to joss he joined me immediately somebody just tried to murder me out there i said without preamble murder you joss stared at me for a long moment then his eyes narrowed til believe anything in this lot meaning i was looking for some of the radio spares a moment ago a few of them seem to be missing but thats not the point the spares as you know are next to the explosives someones been tampering with them the explosives i had a momentary vision of some maniac placing a stick of gelignite under the tractor whats missing nothing thats what so damned funny i checked all the explosives are there but theyre scattered everywhere all mixed up with fuses and detonators whos been in here this afternoon he shrugged who hasnt it was true enough everyone had been coming and going there all afternoon and evening the men for a hundred and one pieces of equipment for the tractor body the women for food and stores and of course our primitive toilet lay at the farthest end of the tunnel what happened to you sir joss asked quietly i told him and watched his face tighten till the mouth was a thin white line in the dark face joss knew what it meant to be lost on the icecap the murderous coldblooded shedevil he said softly well have to nail her sir well have to or god only knows whos next on her list but but wont we have to have proof or confession or something we cant just im going to get both i said the bitter anger still dominated my mind to the exclusion of all else right now i walked out of the tunnel and across the cabin to where the stewardess was sitting weve overlooked something miss ross i said abruptly the food in your galley on the plane it might make all the difference between life and death how much is there in the galley not very much im afraid only odds and ends for snacks if anyone was hungry it was a night flight dr mason and they had already had their evening meal followed by a very special brand of coffee i thought grimly doesnt matter how little it is i said it might be invaluable id like you to come and show me where it is cant it wait the protest came from marie legarde cant you see that the poor girl is chilled to death cant you see that i am too i snapped it was a measure of the mood i was in when i could bring myself to speak like that to marie legarde coming miss ross she came i was taking no chances this time so i carried with me the big searchlight with its portable battery and another torch and gave the stewardess an armful of bamboos when we had reached the top of the hatchway steps she waited for me to lead the way but i told her to walk in front i wanted to watch her hands the snow was easing now the wind dropping and visibility just a little improved we walked the length of the antenna line angled off a little way north of east setting down an occasional bamboo and were at the plane within ten minutes of leaving the cabin right i said you first miss ross up you go up she turned towards me and though the big searchlight lying on the ground was no help in letting me see the expression of her face the puzzled tone of her voice was exactly right how same way as you did before i said harshly my anger was almost out of control now i couldnt have restrained myself any longer jump for it the same way she stopped in midsentence and stared at me what do you mean her voice was only a whisper jump for it i said implacably she turned away slowly and jumped her fingers didnt come within six inches of the sill she tried again got no nearer and on her third attempt i boosted her so that her hands hooked over the sill she hung there for a moment then pulled herself up a few inches cried out and fell heavily to the ground slowly dazedly she picked herself up and looked at me a splendid performance i cant do it she said huskily you can see i cant what are you trying to do to me whats wrong i didnt answer and she rushed on i im not staying here im going back to the cabin later i caught her arm roughly as she made to move away stand there where i can watch you i jumped up wriggled inside the control cabin reached down and pulled her up after me none too gently and without a word i led her straight into the galley the mickey finn dispensary i observed an ideal quiet spot it is too she had her mask off now and i held up my hand to forestall her as she opened her mouth to speak dope miss ross but of course you wouldnt know what im talking about she stared at me unblinkingly made no answer you were sitting here when the plane crashed i went on possibly on this little stool here right she nodded again without speaking and of course were flung against this front bulkhead here tell me miss ross wheres the metal projection that tore this hole in your back she stared at the lockers then looked slowly back to me is is that why youve brought me here where is it i demanded i dont know she shook her head from side to side and took a backward step what does it matter and and dope what is the matter please i took her arm without a word and led her through to the radio cabin i trained the torch beam on to the top of the radio cabinet blood miss ross and some navy blue fibres the blood from the cut on your back the fibres from your tunic heres where you were sitting or standing when the plane crashed pity it caught you off balance but at least you managed to retain your hold on your gun she was gazing at me now with sick eyes and her face was a mask carved from white papiermache missed your cue miss ross your next line of dialogue was what gun ill tell you the one you had lined up on the second officer pity you hadnt killed him then isnt it but you made a good job of it later smothering makes such a much less messy job doesnt it smothering she had to try three times before she got the word out on cue on time i approved smothering when you murdered the second officer in the cabin last night youre mad she whispered her lips startlingly red against the ashen face were parted and the brown eyes enormous with fear and sick despair youre mad she repeated unsteadily crazy as a loon i agreed again i caught her arm pulled her out on to the flight deck and trained my flashlight on the captains back you wouldnt of course know anything about this either i leaned forward jerked up the jacket to expose the bullet hole in the back then stumbled and all but fell as she gave a long sigh and crumpled against me instinctively i caught her lowered her to the floor cursed myself for having fallen for the fainting routine even for a second and ruthlessly stabbed a stiff couple of fingers into the solar plexus just below the breastbone there was no reaction just no reaction at all the faint had been as genuine as ever a faint can be and she was completely unconscious the next few minutes while i sat beside her on the front seat of the plane waiting for her to recover consciousness were some of the worst i have ever gone through selfreproach is a hopeless word to describe the way i swore at myself for my folly my utter stupidity and unforgivable blindness above all for the brutality the calculated cruelty with which id treated this poor crumpled young girl by my side especially the cruelty in the past few minutes perhaps there had been excuse enough for my earlier suspicions but there was none for my latest actions if i hadnt been so consumed by anger so utterly sure of myself so that the possibility of doubt never had a chance to enter my mind if my mind hadnt been concentrated to the exclusion of all else on the exposure of her guilt i should have known at least that it couldnt have been she who had jumped down from the control cabin half an hour ago when i had rushed up the aisle for the simple but sufficient reason that she had been incapable of getting up there in the first place quite apart from her injury i should have been doctor enough to know that the arms and shoulders i had seen while attending to her back that evening werent built for the acrobatic performance necessary to swing oneself up and through the smashed windscreen that had been no act she had put on when she had fallen back into the snow i could see that clearly now but i should have seen it then i still hadnt got beyond the stage of calling myself by every name i could think of when she stirred sighed and straightened in the crook of the arm with which i was supporting her her eyes opened slowly focused themselves on me and i could feel the pressure on my forearm as she shrank away its all right miss ross i urged her please dont be afraid im not mad really im not just the biggest blundering halfwitted idiot youre ever likely to meet in all the rest of your days im sorry im most terribly sorry for all ive said for all ive done do you think you can ever forgive me i dont think she heard a word i said maybe the tone of my voice gave her some reassurance but it was impossible to tell she shuddered violently and twisted her head to look in the direction of the flight deck murder the word was so low that i could hardly catch it suddenly her voice became highpitched unsteady hes been murdered who who killed him now take it easy miss ross my heavens i thought of all the fatuous advice i dont know all i know is that you had nothing to do with it no she shook her head tiredly i dont believe it i cant believe it captain johnson why should anyone he hadnt an enemy in the world dr mason maybe colonel harrison hadnt an enemy either i nodded towards the rear of the plane but they got him too she stared down the plane her eyes wide with horror her lips moving as if to speak but no sound came they got him tooi repeated just as they got the captain just as they got the second officer and the flight engineer they she whispered they whoever it was i only know it wasnt you no she whispered again she shuddered even more uncontrollably than before and i tightened my arm round her im frightened dr mason im frightened theres nothing id started off to say there was nothing to be frightened of before i realised the idiocy of the words with a ruthless and unknown murderer among us there was everything in the world to be frightened of i was scared myself but admitting that to this youngster wasnt likely to help her morale any so i started talking telling her of all the things we had found out of the suspicions we had and of what had happened to me and when i finished she looked at me and said but why was i taken into the wireless cabin i must have been mustnt i you must have been i agreed why probably so that someone could turn a gun on you and threaten to kill you if the second officer jimmy waterman you called him wasnt it didnt play ball why else why else she echoed she gazed at me the wide brown eyes never leaving mine and then i could see the slow fear touching them again and she whispered and who else how do you mean who else cant you see if someone had a gun on jimmy waterman someone else must have had one on the pilots you can see yourself that no one could cover both places at the same time but captain johnson must have been doing exactly as he was told just as jimmy was it was so glaringly obvious that a child could have seen it it was so glaringly obvious that id missed it altogether of course there must have been two of them how else would it have been possible to force the entire crew to do as they were ordered good heavens this was twice as bad ten times as bad as it had been previously nine men and women back there in the cabin and two of them killers ruthless merciless killers who would surely kill again at the drop of a hat as the needs of the moment demanded and i couldnt even begin to guess the identity of either of them youre right of course miss ross i forced myself to speak calmly matteroffactly it was blind of me i should have known i remembered how the bullet had passed clear through the man in the back seat i did know but i couldnt add one and one colonel harrison and captain johnson were killed by different guns the one by a heavy carrying weapon like a colt or a luger the other by a less powerful a lighter weapon like something a woman might have used i broke off abruptly a womans gun why not a woman using it why not even this girl by my side it could have been her accomplice that had followed me out to the plane earlier in the evening and it would fit in beautifully with the facts no it wouldnt faints couldnt be faked but perhaps a womans gun i might have spoken my thoughts aloud so perfectly had she understood perhaps even me or should i say perhaps still me her voice was unnaturally calm goodness only knows i cant blame you if i were you id suspect everyone too she pulled the glove and mitten off her left hand took the gleaming ring off her third finger and passed it across to me i examined it blankly in the light of my torch then bent forward as i caught sight of the tiny inscription on the inside of the gold band j wm r sept i looked up at her and she nodded her face numb and stricken jimmy and i got engaged two months ago this was my last flight as a stewardess we were being married at christmas she snatched the ring from me thrust it back on her finger with a shaking hand and when she turned to me again the tears were brimming over in her eyes now do you trust me she sobbed now do you trust me for the first time in almost twentyfour hours i acted sensibly closed my mouth tightly and kept it that way i didnt even bother reviewing her strange behaviour after the crash and in the cabin i knew instinctively that this accounted for everything i just sat there silently watching her staring straight ahead her fists clenched and tears rolling down her cheeks and when she suddenly crumpled and buried her face in her hands and i reached out and pulled her towards me she made no resistance just turned crushed her face into the caribou fur of my parka and cried as if her heart was breaking and i suppose it was i suppose too that the moment when a man hears that a girls fiance has died only that day is the last moment that that man should ever begin to fall in love with her but im afraid thats just how it was the emotions are no respecters of the niceties the proprieties and decencies of this life and just then i was clearly aware that mine were stirred as they hadnt been since that dreadful day four years ago when my wife a bride of only three months had been killed in a car smash and i had given up medicine returned to my first great love geology completed the bsc course that had been interrupted by the outbreak of world war two and taken to wandering wherever work new surroundings and an opportunity to forget the past had presented themselves why when i gazed down at that small dark head pressed so deeply into the fur of my coat i should have felt my heart turn over i didnt know for all her wonderful brown eyes she had no pretensions to beauty and i knew nothing whatsoever about her perhaps it was just a natural reaction from my earlier antipathy perhaps it was pity for her loss for what i had so cruelly done to her for having so exposed her to danger whoever knew that i knew too much would soon know that she knew it also or perhaps it was just because she was so defenceless and vulnerable so ridiculously small and lost in josss big parka and then i caught myself trying to work out the reasons and i gave it up i hadnt been married long but long enough to know that the heart has its own reasons which even the acutest mind couldnt begin to suspect by and by the sobbing subsided and she straightened hiding from me what must have been a very badly tearstained face im sorry she murmured and thank you very much my crying shoulder i patted it with my right hand for my friends the other ones for my patients for that too but i didnt mean that just for not saying how sorry you were for me or patting me or saying now now or anything like that i couldnt have stood it she finished wiping her face with the palm of her mitten looked up at me with brown eyes still swimming in tears and i felt my heart turn over again where do we go from here dr mason back to the cabin i didnt mean that i know what am i to say im completely at a loss a hundred questions and never an answer to one of them and i dont even know all the questions yet she murmured its only five minutes since i even knew that it wasnt an accident she shook her head incredulously who ever heard of a civilian airliner being forced down at pistol point i did on the radio just over a month ago in cuba some of fidel castros rebels forced a viscount to crash land only they picked an even worse spot than this think there were only one or two survivors maybe thats where our friends back in the cabin got the idea from i shouldnt be surprised she wasnt even listening her mind was already off on another track why why did they kill colonel harrison i shrugged maybe he had a high resistance to mickey finns maybe he saw too much or knew too much or both but but now they know youve seen too much and know too much i wished she wouldnt look at me when she was talking these eyes would have made even the rev smallwood forget himself in the middle of his most thundering denunciations not that i could imagine mr smallwood going in for thundering denunciations very much a disquieting thought i admitted and one that has occurred to me several times during the past halfhour about five hundred times i would say oh stop it youre probably as scared as i am she shivered lets get out of here please its its ghastly its horrible what what was that her voice finished on a sharp high note what was what i tried to speak calmly but that didnt stop me from glancing around nervously maybe she was right maybe i was as scared as she was a noise outside her voice was a whisper and her fingers were digging deep into the fur of my parka like someone tapping the wing or the fuselage nonsense my voice was rough but i was on razoredge youre beginning to i stopped in midsentence this time i could have sworn i had heard something and it was plain that margaret ross had too she twisted her head over her shoulder looking in the direction of the noise then slowly turned back to me her face tense her eyes wide and staring i pushed her hands away reached for gun and torch jumped up and started running in the control cabin i checked abruptly god what a fool id been to leave that searchlight burning and lined up on the windscreens blinding me with its glare making me a perfect target for anyone crouching outside with a gun in hand but the hesitation was momentary only it was then or never i could be trapped in there all night or until the searchlight battery died i dived head first through the windscreen caught a pillar at the very last moment and was lying flat on the ground below in less time than i would have believed possible i waited five seconds just listening but all i could hear was the moan of the wind the hiss of the ice spicules rustling along over the frozen snow id never before heard that hissing so plainly but then id never before lain with my uncovered ear on the icecap itself and the thudding of my heart and then i was on my feet the probing torch cutting a bright swathe in the darkness before me as i ran round the plane slipping and stumbling in my haste twice i made the circuit the second time in the opposite direction but there was no one there at all i stopped before the control cabin and called softly to margaret ross she appeared at the window and i said its all right theres no one here weve both been imagining things come on down i reached up my hands caught her and lowered her to the ground why did you leave me up there why did you leave me up there the words came rushing out tumbling frantically one over the other the anger drowned in the terror it was it was horrible the dead man why did you leave me im sorry there was a time and a place for comment on feminine injustice unreasonableness and downright illogicality but this wasnt it in the way of grief and heartbreak shock and illtreatment she had already had far more than she could stand im sorry i repeated i shouldnt have done it i just didnt stop to think she was trembling violently so i put my arms round her and held her tightly until she had calmed down took the searchlight and battery in one hand and her hand in my other and we walked back to the cabin together chapter six monday pm tuesday am jackstraw and the others had just completed the assembly of the tractor body when we arrived back at the cabin and some of the men were already going below i didnt bother to check the tractor when jackstraw made anything he made a perfect job of it i knew he must have missed me in the past hour but i knew too that he wasnt the man to question me while the others were around i waited till the last of these had gone below then took him by the arm and walked out into the darkness far enough to talk in complete privacy but not so far as to lose sight of the yellow glow from our skylights twice lost in the one night was twice too many he heard me out in silence and at the end he said what are we going to do dr mason depends spoken to joss recently fifteen minutes ago in the tunnel how about the radio im afraid not dr mason hes missing some condensers and spare valves hes looked for them everywhere says theyve been stolen maybe theyll turn up i didnt believe it myself two of the valves already have crushed little bits of glass lying in the bottom of the snow tunnel our little friends think of everything swore softly that settles it jackstraw we cant wait any longer well leave as soon as possible but first a nights sleep that we must have uplavnik that was our expedition base near the mouth of the stromsund glacier do you think we will ever get there he wasnt thinking just as i wasnt about the rigours and dangers of arctic winter travel daunting enough though these were when they had to be faced with a superannuated tractor like the citroen but of the company we would be keeping en route if any fact was ever so glaringly obvious that it didnt need mention it was that the killers whoever they were could only escape justice or at least the mass arrest and interrogation of all the passengers by ensuring that they were the only ones to emerge alive from the icecap i wouldnt like to bet on it i said dryly but id bet even less on our chances if we stay here death by starvation is kind of final yes indeed he paused for a moment then switched to a fresh line of thought you say they tried to kill you tonight is that not surprising i would have thought that you and i would have been very safe for a few days at least i knew what he meant apart from jackstraw and myself there probably wasnt a handful of people in all greenland who could start that damned citroen far less drive it only jackstraw could handle the dogs and it was long odds indeed against any of the passengers knowing anything at all about astral or magnetic compass navigation the latter very tricky indeed in these high latitudes these special skills should have been guarantee enough of our immediate survival true enough i agreed but i suspect they havent given any thought to these things simply because they havent realised the importance of them well make it our business to point out that importance very plainly then were both insured meantime well have one last effort to clear this business up before we get started its not going to make us very popular but we cant help that i explained what i had in mind and he nodded thoughtful agreement after he had gone below i waited a couple of minutes and then followed him all nine of the passengers were sitting in the cabin now eight rather watching marie legarde presiding over a soup pan and i took a long long look at all of them it was the first time i had ever examined a group of my fellowmen with the object of trying to decide which among them were murderers and found it a strange and unsettling experience in the first place every one of them looked to me like a potential or actual murderer or murderess but even with that thought came the realisation that this was purely because i associated murder with abnormality and in these wildly unlikely surroundings clad in the layered bulkiness of these wildly unlikely clothes every one of them seemed far removed from normality but on a second and closer look when one ignored the irrelevancies of surroundings and clothes there remained only a group of shivering feetstamping miserable and very ordinary people indeed or were they so ordinary zagero for instance was he ordinary he had the build the strength and no doubt also the speed and temperament for a topranking heavyweight but he was the most unlikely looking boxer i had ever seen it wasnt just that he was obviously a welleducated and cultured man there had been such boxers before it was chiefly because his face was absolutely unmarked without even that almost invariable thickening of skin above the eyes moreover i had never heard of him although that admittedly didnt go for much as a doctor i took a poor view of homo sapiens wreaking gratuitous physical and mental injury on homo sapiens and took little interest in the sport or take his manager solly levin or for that matter the rev joseph small wood solly wasnt a new york boxing manager he was a caricature of all i had ever heard or read about these runyonesque characters and he was just too good to be true so also was the rev small wood who was so exactly the meek mild slightly nervous slightly anaemic man of god that preachers are so frequently represented to be and almost invariably never are that his movements reactions comments and opinions were predictable to the nth degree but against that i had to set the fact that the killers were clever calculating men who would have carefully avoided assuming the guise of any character so patently cut from cardboard on the other hand they might have been astute enough to do just that there was a question mark too about corazzini america specialised in producing shrewd intelligent tough business leaders and executives and corazzini was undoubtedly one such but the toughness of the average business man was purely mental corazzini had physical toughness as well a ruthlessness i felt he wouldnt hesitate to apply to matters lying far outside the immediate sphere of business and then i realised wryly that i was prepared to suspect corazzini for reasons diametrically opposed to those for which i was prepared to suspect levin and the rev smallwood corazzini didnt fit into any pattern any prefabricated mental image of the american business man of the two remaining men theodore mahler the little jew and senator brewster i would have taken the former any time as the more likely suspect but when i asked myself why i could adduce no more damaging reasons than that he was thin dark rather embittered looking and had told us absolutely nothing about himself and if that werent prejudice on my part i couldnt guess what was as for senator brewster he was surely above suspicion and then the startling thought struck me that if one wished to be above suspicion surely there were no better means of achieving that than by assuming the identity of someone who was above suspicion how did i know he was senator brewster a couple of forged papers a white moustache and white hair on top of a naturally florid complexion and anyone could have been senator brewster true it would be an impersonation impossible to sustain indefinitely but the whole point was that any such impersonation didnt have to be sustained indefinitely i was getting nowhere and i knew it i was more confused more uncertain and infinitely more suspicious than ever i was even suspicious of the women the young german girl helene munich was her home town near enough central europe and the skulduggery that went on in the neighbourhood of the iron curtain for anything to be possible but on the other hand the idea of a seventeenyearold master criminal we certainly werent dealing with apprentices was ridiculously farfetched and the fact that she had fractured her collarbone almost sure proof that the crash had been unexpected was a strong point in her favour mrs dansbygregg she belonged to a world i knew little about except for what slight information i had gleaned from my psychiatric brethren who found rich fishing in the troubled waters of what passed for the younger london society but instability and neuroses not to mention the more than occasional financial embarrassment were not criminal in themselves and in particular that world lacked what people like zagero and corazzini had in full measure the physical and mental toughness required for a job like this but particularising from the general could be every bit as dangerous and misleading as generalising from the particular of mrs dansbygregg as a person i knew nothing that left only marie legarde she was the touchstone the one rock i could cling to in this sea of uncertainty and if i were wrong about her so too had been a million others there are some things that cannot be because they are unthinkable and this was one of them it was as simple as that marie legarde was above suspicion i became gradually aware of the muted clack of the anemometer cups turning sluggishly in the dying wind above and that the hiss of the colman lamp had become abnormally loud a total silence had fallen over the cabin and everyone was staring at me with mingled puzzlement and curiosity so much for my impassive features my casual negligent ease so clearly had i betrayed the fact that something was far wrong that not one of the nine had missed it but to be the centre of attraction at the moment suited me well enough jackstraw had just made his entry unobserved a winchester repeater cradled under his arm his finger ready through the trigger guard sorry i apologised rude to stare i know however now its your turn i nodded in jackstraws direction every expedition carries a gun or two for coast use against prowling bears and wolves and to get seal meat for the dogs i never thought that it would come in so handy right in the middle of the icecap and against far more dangerous game than we ever find on the coast mr nielsen is a remarkably accurate shot dont try anything just clasp your hands above your heads all of you as if controlled by a master switch all the eyes had now swivelled back to me id had time to spare to pull out the automatic a mm buttloading beretta that id taken off colonel harrison and this time i didnt forget to slide off the safetycatch the click was abnormally loud in the frozen silence of the room but the silence didnt last long what damnable outrage is this senator brewster shouted out the words his face purpling in rage he leapt to his feet started to move forwards towards me then stopped as if he had run into a brick wall the crash of jackstraws winchester was a deafening eardrum shattering thunderclap of sound in that confined space and when the last reverberations of the rifleshot had faded and the smoke cleared away senator brewster was staring down whitely at the splintered hole in the floor boards almost literally beneath his feet jackstraw must have miscalculated the senators rate of movement for the bullet had sliced through the edge of the sole of brewsters boot however it was the effect couldnt have been bettered the senator reached back blindly for the support of the bunk behind him and lowered himself shakily to his seat so terrified that he even forgot to clasp his hands above his head but i didnt care about that there would be no more trouble from the senator ok so you mean business now were convinced it was zagero who drawled out the words but his hands were tightly enough clasped above his head we know you wouldnt do this for nothin doc what gives this gives i said tightly two of you people are murderers or a murderer and murderess both have guns i want those guns succinctly put dear boy marie legarde said slowly very concise have you gone crazy unclasp your hands miss legarde youre not included in this little lot no im not crazy im as sane as you are and if you want evidence of my sanity youll find it out on the plane there or buried out on the icecap the captain of the plane with a bullet through his spine the passenger in the rear with a bullet through his heart and the second officer smothered to death yes smothered not cerebral haemorrhage as i said he was murdered in his sleep believe me miss legarde or would it take a personal tour of the plane to convince you she didnt speak at once nobody spoke everyone was too stunned too busy fighting incredulity and trying to assimilate the meaning of the shocking news id given them everyone that is except two but though i scanned eight faces with an intensity with which i had never before examined people i saw nothing not the slightest offbeat gesture the tiniest guilty reaction as for what id secretly hoped for a guilty interchange of glances well the idea now seemed hopelessly laughably improbable whoever the killers were they were in perfect control of themselves i felt despair touch me a sure knowledge of defeat i must believe you marie legarde spoke as slowly as before but her voice was unsteady and her face drained of colour she looked at margaret ross you knew of this my dear half an hour ago miss legarde dr mason thought i had done it good god how how utterly ghastly how horrible two of us murderers from her position by the stove marie legarde glanced round the eight seated people then looked quickly away suppose suppose you tell us everything dr mason i told them everything on the way back from the plane with miss ross i had debated this with myself the question of secrecy or not the no secrecy decision had won hands down keeping quiet wouldnt fool the killers they knew i knew no secrecy would mean each and every one of the passengers inn watching the others like hawks making my task of constant vigilance all that much easier the killers chance of making mischief all that more difficult you will stand up one at a time i said when id finished mr london will search you for your guns and please dont forget know im dealing with desperate men im prepared to act accordingly when your turn comes stand very still indeed and make no suspicious move not the slightest im not very good with a pistol and i shall have to aim at the middle of your bodies to make certain i believe you would at that corazzini said thoughtfully it doesnt matter what you believe i said coldly just dont be the one to find out joss started on zagero he searched him thoroughly could see the anger on zageros face but his eyes didnt leave my gun and found nothing he moved on to solly levin might i ask why im being excused marie legarde asked suddenly you i said shortly my eyes didnt move from solly marie legarde dont be so damned silly the choice of words and tone of voice leave a lot to be desired her voice was soft and warm though still shaky but ive never had a greater compliment all the same i insist on being searched i dont want to be the one under a cloud if the guns dont turn up and the guns didnt turn up joss finished searching the men margaret ross the women mrs dansbygregg under icy protest and neither found anything joss looked at me his face empty of all expression get their luggage i said harshly the small cases theyre taking with them well try these youre wasting your time dr mason nick corazzini said quietly to any characters smart enough to guess that you were going to frisk them the next move would stick out a mile a child could guess it you might find those guns you talk about hidden on the tractor or the sledges or buried under a couple of inches of snow ready to be picked up whenever required but you wont find them in our grips a thousand to one in dollars that you dont maybe youre right i said slowly on the other hand if i were one of the killers and did have a gun in my case well thats exactly the way id talk too as you said to miss legarde just now dont be so damned silly he jumped to his feet walked over to a corner of the cabin under the watchful eyes of jackstraw and myself picked up a handful of small cases and dumped them on the floor before me his own nearest me where are you going to start theres mine thats the reverends robe case this he picked it up and looked at the initials this is the senators briefcase i dont know whose the last is mine mrs dansbygregg said coldly corazzini grinned ah the balenciaga well doc who he broke off straightened slowly and gazed up through the skylight what what the devil is happening up there dont try to pull any fast stuff corazzini i said quickly jackstraws gun the hell with jackstraws gun he snapped impatiently have a look for yourself i motioned him out of the way and had a look two seconds later i had thrust my automatic into josss hand and was on my way up top the airliner was a blazing torch in the darkness of the night even at that distance of half a mile and against the light wind i could clearly hear the fierce roaring and crackling of the flames not flames rather but one great solid column of fire that seemed to spring from the wings and centre of the fuselage and reach up clear and smokeless and sparkless two hundred feet into the night sky brushing its bloodred stain across the snow for hundreds of yards around transforming the rest of the still icesheathed fuselage into a vast effulgent diamond a million constantly shifting points of refracted white and red and blue and green that glittered and gleamed with an eyedazzling scintillating brilliance that no jewels on earth could have matched it was a fantastically beautiful spectacle but id had time to watch it for barely ten seconds when the dazzling coloured irradiation turned into a blaze of white the central flame leapt up to twice almost three times its original height and two or three seconds later the roar of the exploding petrol tanks came at me across the frozen stillness of the icecap almost at once the flames seemed to collapse in upon themselves and the perimeter of the bloodred circle of snow shrank almost to vanishing point but i waited to see no more i dropped down into the cabin pulling the hatch shut behind me and looked at jackstraw any chance at all of accounting for the presence of our various friends here during the past halfhour im afraid not dr mason everyone was on the move all the time finishing off the tractor body or bringing up the stores and petrol drums and lashing them on the sledge he glanced up through the skylight the plane wasnt it was is right i glanced at the stewardess my apologies miss ross you did hear somebody out there you mean you mean it wasnt an accident zagero asked theres a fair chance that you know damned well that it wasnt i thought aloud i said it was no accident so there goes your evidence eh corazzini asked the pilot and colonel harrison i mean no the nose and tail of the plane are still intact i dont know what the reason could be but im sure theres a damned good one and you can put these bags away mr corazzini were not as you say playing with children or amateurs there was silence while corazzini returned the bags then joss looked at me quizzically well that explains one thing at least the messedup explosives i remembered with chagrin how i had listened to the abnormally loud hissing out by the plane but had ignored it someone who had known very clearly what he was doing had led a fuse into petrol lines or tanks or carburettors it certainly does whats all this about explosives and fuses senator brewster demanded it was the first word he had spoken since jackstraw had scared the wits out of him and even yet the colour wasnt all back in his face somebody stole the fuses to set fire to the plane for all i know it may have been you i held up my hand to still his outraged spluttering and went on wearily it may equally well have been one of the other seven of you i dont know all i know is that the person or persons responsible for the murders were responsible for the theft of the fuses and for the smashing of the radio valves and for the theft of the condensers and for the theft of the sugar joss put in though heaven only knows why they should want to steal that sugar i exclaimed and then the question died in my throat i happened to be looking straight at the little jew theodore mahler and the nervous start he gave the quick flicker of his eyes in josss direction was unmistakable i knew i couldnt have imagined it but i looked away quickly before he could see my face our last bag joss explained maybe thirty pounds its gone i found what little was left of it just a handful lying on the floor of the tunnel mixed up with the smashed valves i shook my head and said nothing the reason for this last theft i couldnt even begin to imagine supper that night was a sketchy affair soup coffee and a couple of biscuits each as the only solids the soup was thin the biscuits no more than a bite and the coffee for me at any rate all but undrinkable without sugar and the meal was as silent as it was miserable conversation being limited to what was absolutely necessary time and again i would see someone turn to his neighbour and make to say something then his lips would clamp tightly shut the expression drain out of his face as he turned away without a word with almost everyone thinking that his or her neighbour might be a murderer or what was almost as bad that his or her neighbour might be thinking that he was a murderer the meal was by all odds the most awkward and uncomfortable that id ever had or that is the first part of it was but by and by i came to the conclusion that id a great deal more to worry about than the niceties of social intercourse after the meal i rose pulled on parka and gloves picked up the searchlight told jackstraw and joss to come with me and headed for the trapdoor zageros voice stopped me where you goin doc thats no concern of yours well mrs dansbygregg shouldnt you shouldnt you take the rifle with you dont worry i smiled thinly with everyone watching everyone else like hawks that rifles as safe as houses but but someone could jump for it she said nervously they could get you when youre coming down the hatch mr nielsen and i are the last two persons theyd ever shoot without us they couldnt get a mile from here the most likely candidates for the next bullet are some of yourselves youre absolutely inessential and as far as the killers are concerned represent nothing more than a waste of priceless rations with this comforting thought i left them each person trying to watch all the others at one and the same time while doing his level best to give the appearance of watching no one the wind was so slight now that the anemometer cups had stopped turning the dying embers of the burntout plane were a dull smouldering glow to the northeast the snow had gone completely and the first faint stars were beginning to show through the thinning cloud above it was typically greenland this swift change in the weather and so too was the temperature inversion that would surely follow in the morning or before morning twelve hours from now it was going to be very cold indeed with searchlight and torches we examined every inch of the tractor and sledges above and below and if there had been a pin there i would have sworn that we couldnt have missed it far less anything so large as a couple of guns we found nothing i straightened and turned to look at the glow that was lightening the sky to the east and even as i stood there with joss and jackstraw by my side the moon preternaturally large and rather more than half full heaved itself above the distant horizon and flooded the icecap with its pale and ghostly light laying down between itself and our feet a barstraight path of glittering silver grey we watched in silence for a full minute then jackstraw stirred even before he spoke i knew what was in his mind uplavnik he murmured tomorrow we set off for uplavnik but first you said a good nights sleep i know i said a travellers moon a travellers moon he echoed he was right of course travel in the arctic in winter was regulated not by daylight but my moonlight and tonight we had that moon and we had a clear sky a dying wind and no snow at all i turned to joss youll be all right alone i have no worries he said soberly look sir cant i come too stay here and stay healthy i advised thanks joss but you know someone must remain behind ill call you up on the usual schedules you might get a kick out of the rca yet miracles still happen not this time they wont he turned away abruptly and went below jackstraw moved across to the tractor we didnt say another word to each other we didnt have to and i followed joss down to the cabin no one had moved an inch as far as i could see but they all looked up as i came in all right i said abruptly get your stuff together and pile on every last stitch of clothes you can were leaving now we left in fact just over an hour later the citroen had been lying unused for the better pan of a fortnight and we had the devils own job getting it to start but start it eventually did with a roar and a thunderous clatter that had everybody jumping in startlement then looking at it in dismay i knew the thoughts in their minds that theyd have to live with this cacophony this bedlam of sound assaulting their shrinking eardrums for no one knew how many days to come but i wasted little sympathy on them at least they would have the protection of the wooden body while i would be sitting practically on top of the engine we said our goodbyes to joss he shook hands with jackstraw and myself with margaret ross and marie legarde and pointedly with no one else we left him standing there by the hatchway a lonely figure outlined against the pale light of the steadily climbing moon and headed west by south for uplavnik three hundred long and frozen miles away i wondered as i knew joss was wondering whether we would ever see each other again i wondered too what right i had in exposing jackstraw to the dangers which must lie ahead he was sitting beside me as i drove but as i looked at him covertly in the moonlight at that strong lean face that but for the rather broad cheekbones might have been that of any scandinavian searover i knew i was wasting my time wondering although nominally under my command he had only been lent me as other greenlanders had been lent as an act of courtesy by the danish government to several igy stations as a scientific officer he had a geology degree from the university of copenhagen and had forgotten more about the icecap than i would ever know and in times of emergency especially where his own pride and he had plenty of that was concerned would be extremely liable to do what he thought best regardless of what i thought or said i knew he wouldnt have remained behind even if i had ordered him to and if i were honest with myself i was only too damned glad to have him along as a friend as an ally and as insurance policy against the disaster that can so easily overtake the careless or the inexperienced on the icecap but even so even though i quieted my conscience as best i could it was difficult to push from my mind the picture of his dark vivacious young schoolteacher wife and little daughter the red and white brick house in which id lived for two weeks as a guest in the summer what jackstraw thought was impossible to say he sat immobile as if carved from stone only his eyes alive constantly moving constantly shifting as he probed for sudden dips in the icecap for differences in the structure of the snow for anything that might spell trouble it was purely automatic purely instinctive the crevasse country lay as yet two hundred and fifty miles away where the icecap started to slope sharply to the sea and jackstraw himself maintained that balto his big lead dog had a surer instinct for crevasses than any human alive the temperature was dropping down into the minus thirties but it was a perfect night for arctic travel a moonlit windless night under a still and starry sky visibility was phenomenal the icecap was smooth and flat the engine ran sweetly with never a falter had it not been for the cold the incessant roar and bodynumbing vibration of the big engine i think i would almost have enjoyed it with the wide tractor body blocking off the view behind it was impossible for me to see what was happening there but every ten minutes or so jackstraw would jump off and stand by the side of the trail behind the tractor body and its shivering occupants because of the tractor fuel tank beneath and the spare fuel drums astern the stove was never lit while we were in motion came the sledge with all our stores gallons of fuel provisions bedding and sleepingbags tents ropes axes shovels trail flags cooking utensils seal meat for the dogs four wooden bridging battens canvas sheets blowlamps lantern medical equipment radiosonde balloons magnesium flares and a score of minor items i had hesitated over including the radio sondes especially the relatively heavy hydrogen cylinders for these but they were ready crated with tents ropes axes and shovels and this was the deciding factor had saved lives on at least one occasion when a trail party lost on the plateau with defective compasses had saved themselves by releasing several balloons in the brief daylight hours thereby enabling base to see them and send accurate radio bearings behind the heavy transport sled was towed the empty dogsled with the dogs on loose traces running astern of it all except balto who always ran free coursing tirelessly backwards and forwards all night long one moment far ahead of us the next ranging out to one side the next dropping astern like some destroyer circling a straggling convoy by night when the last of the dogs had passed by him jackstraw would run forward to overtake the tractor and jump in alongside me once more he was as tireless as immune to fatigue as balto himself the first twenty miles were easy on the way up from the coast over four months previously we had planted big marker flags at intervals of half a mile on a night such as this with the moonlight flooding the icecap these trail flags a bright luminous orange in colour and mounted on aluminium poles stuck in snow beacons were visible at a great distance with never less than two and sometimes three in sight at the same time the long glistening frost feathers stretching out from the poles sometimes twice the length of the flags themselves we counted twentyeight of these flags altogether about a dozen were missing then after a sudden dip in the land completely lost them whether they had blown away or just drifted under it was impossible to say well there it is jackstraw i said resignedly this is where one of us starts getting cold really cold weve been cold before dr mason me first he slid the magnetic compass off its brackets started to unreel a cable from a spool under the dashboard then jumped out still unwinding the cable while i followed to help despite the fact that the magnetic north pole is nowhere near the north pole at that time it was almost a thousand miles south of it and lay more to the west than north of us a magnetic compass when proper variation allowances are made is still useful in high latitudes but because of the counteracting magnetic effects of a large mass of metal it was quite useless when mounted on the tractor itself our plan therefore was that someone should he with the compass on the dogsled fifty feet behind the tractor and by means of a switch which operated red and green lights in the tractor dashboard guide the driver to left or right it wasnt our original idea it wasnt even a recent idea it had been used in the antarctic a quarter century previously but as far as i knew had not been improved upon yet with jackstraw established on the sledge i walked back to the tractor and pushed aside the canvas screen at the back of the wooden body what with the faces of the passengers drawn and pinched and weirdly pale in the light of the tiny overhead bulb the constant shivering the chattering of teeth and the frozen breath drifting upwards to condense and freeze on the wooden roof it was a picture of utter and abject misery but i was in no mood to be moved at that moment sorry for the delay i said just off again now but i want one of you for a lookout both zagero and corazzini volunteered almost in the same breath but i shook my head you two get what sleep or rest you can im liable to need you very much later on perhaps you mr mahler he looked pale and ill but he nodded silently and zagero said in a quiet voice corazzini and myself too high up on the list of suspects huh i wouldnt put either of you at the very foot i said shortly i waited till mahler had climbed down then dropped the canvas and walked round to the drivers seat theodore mahler strangely enough proved only too anxious to talk and keep on talking it was so completely out of keeping with the idea i had formed of his character that i was more than surprised loneliness perhaps i thought or trying to forget the situation or trying to divert my thoughts and suspicions how wrong i was on all three counts i wasnt to find out until later well mr mahler it looks as if the itinerary of your european trip is going to be upset a bit i had almost to shout to make my words heard above the roar of the tractor not europe dr mason i could hear the machinegunlike chatter of his teeth israel you live there never been there in my life there was a pause and when his voice came again it was all but drowned in the sound of the engine i thought i caught the words my home you youre going to start a new life there mr mahler tm sixtynine tomorrow he answered obliquely a new life lets say rather that im going to end an old one and youre going to live there make your home there after sixtynine years in another country millions of us jews have done just that in the past ten years not that ive lived in america all my life and then he told me his story a story of refugee oppression that id heard a hundred times with a hundred variations he was a russian jew he said one of the millions of the largest jewry in the world that had been frozen for over a century in the notorious pale of settlement and in had been forced to flee with his father leaving mother and two brothers behind to escape the ruthless massacres carried out by the black hundreds at the behest of the last of the romanoff tzars who was seeking scapegoats for his crushing defeat by the japanese his mother he learned later had just disappeared while his two brothers had survived only to die in agony long years afterwards one in the rising in the bialystok ghetto the other in the treblinka gas chambers he himself had found work in the clothing industry in new york studied in night school worked for an oil company married and with the death of his wife that spring had set about fulfilling the agelong ambition of his race the return to their holy land it was a touching story pathetic and deeply moving and i didnt believe a word of it every twenty minutes i changed position with jackstraw and so the long hours of the night dragged by as the cold deepened and the stars and the moon wheeled across the black vault of the sky and then came moonset the blackness of the arctic night rushed across the icecap i slowed the citroen gratefully to a stop and the silence breathless and hushed and infinitely sweet came flooding in to take the place of the nightlong clamour of the deafening roar of the big engine the metallic clanking of the treads over our black sugarless coffee and biscuits i told our passengers that this would be only a brief threehour halt that they should try to get what sleep they could most of them myself included were already redeyed and drooping from exhaustion three hours no more not often did greenland offer travel weather like this and the chance was not to be missed beside me as i drank my coffee was theodore mahler he was for some reason restless ill at ease jerky and nervous and his eyes and attention both wandered so much that it was easy enough for me to find out what i wanted when my cup was empty i whispered in mahlers ear that there was a little matter that i wished to discuss privately with him he looked at me in surprise hesitated then nodded in agreement rising to follow me as i moved out into the darkness a hundred yards away i stopped switched on my torch so that he blinked in its beam and slid my beretta forward until its barrel was clearly visible sharply outlined in the harsh white glare i heard the catch of the breath saw the eyes widening in fear and horror save the act for the judge mahler i said bleakly im not interested in it all i want is your gun chapter seven tuesday am tuesday midnight my gun mahler had slowly lifted his arms until his hands were at shoulder level and his voice wasnt quite steady i i dont understand dr mason i have no gun naturally i jerked the barrel of the beretta to lend emphasis to my words turn round what are you going to do youre making a turn round he turned i took a couple of steps forward ground the muzzle of the automatic none too gently into the small of his back and started to search him with my free hand he was wearing two overcoats a jacket several sweaters and scarves twopairs of trousers and layer upon layer of underclothes searching him was easier said than done it took me a full minute to convince myself that he wasnt carrying a weapon of any kind i stepped back and he came slowly round to face me i hope youre quite satisfied now dr mason we see what we find in your case as for the rest im satisfied enough i have all the proof i want i dipped the torch beam to illuminate the handful of sugar id taken from the pocket of his inner overcoat there had been well over a pound in either pocket you might care to explain where you got this from mr mahler i dont have to tell you that do i his voice was very low i stole it dr mason you did indeed a remarkably smalltime activity for a person who operates on the scale you do it was just your bad luck mahler that i happened to be looking directly at you when the theft of the sugar was mentioned back in the cabin it was just your bad luck that when we had our coffee just now it was dark enough for me to have a swig from your cup without your knowledge it was so stiff with sugar that i couldnt even drink the damn stuff curious isnt it mahler that such a tiny thing as giving way to a momentary impulse of greed should ruin everything but i believe its always the way the big slipup never brings the big criminal to book because he never makes any if youd left that sugar alone when you were smashing up the valves id never have known incidentally what did you do with the rest of the sugar in your grip or just thrown away youre making a very grave mistake dr mason mahlers voice was steady now and if it held any trace of worry or guilt i couldnt detect it but i was now far beyond the naive stage of expecting to detect anything of the sort i didnt touch those valves and apart from the few handfuls i took the sugar bag was quite intact when i left it of course of course i waved the beretta back to the tractor my friend and lets have a look at this case of yours no dont be crazy i snapped i have a gun mahler believe me i wont hesitate to use it i believe you i think you would be quite ruthless if the need arose oh i dont doubt youre tough doctor as well as being headstrong impulsive and not very subtle but because i rather respect your efficient and selfless handling of an awkward and ugly situation for which you were in no way responsible i dont want to see you make a complete fool of yourself in public he lifted his right hand towards the lapel of his coat let me show you something i jerked the beretta forward but the gesture was quite needless as he pushed his hand under his topcoats mahlers gestures were smooth and unhurried just as smooth and unhurried when he brought his hand out again and passed over to me a leathercovered card i stepped back a few feet flipped open the card and glanced down at it that one glance was enough or should have been enough id seen these cards scores of times before but i stared down at this one as if id never seen one in my life this was a completely new factor it knocked all my preconceived notions on the head and i needed time time for reorient a tion for understanding for quelling the professional fear that came hard on the heels of that understanding then slowly i folded the card pulled down my snowmask stepped close to mahler and pulled his down also in the harsh glare of the torch his face was blue and white with the cold and i could see the jutting of the jaw muscles as he clamped his teeth together to keep them from chattering uncontrollably breathe out i said he did as i asked and there was no mistaking it none at all the sweet acetone breath of the advanced and untreated diabetic cant possibly be confused with anything else wordlessly i handed him back the card and thrust the automatic into my parka pocket at last i said quietly how long have you had this mr mahler thirty years a pretty advanced condition when it came to discussing a mans illness with him i had little time for the professional reticence of many of my colleagues besides the average elderly diabetic had survived to that age simply because he was intelligent about the dietary and medical treatment of his trouble and usually knew all about it my doctor would agree with you i caught the smile on his face as he pushed his mask up and there wasnt much humour in it so would i twice daily injections twice he nodded before breakfast and in the evening but dont you carry a hypo and normally he interrupted but not this time the gander doctor gave me a jab and as i can usually carry on a few hours overdue without ul effects i thought id wait until we got to london he tapped his breast pocket this cards good anywhere except on the greenland icecap i said bitterly but then i dont suppose you anticipated a stopover here what diet were you on high protein high starch hence the sugar i looked down at the white crystals still clenched in my left mitten no he shrugged but i know sugar used to be used for the treatment of coma i thought maybe if i stuffed enough into myself well anyway you know now why i turned criminal yes i know now my apologies for the gunwaving act mr mahler but you must admit i had every justification why in the hell didnt you tell me before now i am supposed to be a doctor you know i would have had to tell you sooner or later i suppose but right now youd plenty of troubles of your own without worrying about mine also and i didnt think there would be much chance of your carrying insulin among your medical stores we dont we dont have to everybody gets a thorough medical before going on an igy station and diabetes hardly develops overnight you take it all very calmly i must say mr mahler come on lets get back to the tractor we reached there inside a minute i pulled back the canvas screen and a thick white opaque cloud formed almost immediately as the relatively warm air inside met the far subzero arctic air outside i waved my hand to dispel it and peered inside they were all still drinking coffee it was the one thing we had in plenty it seemed difficult to realise that wed been gone only a few minutes hurry up and finish off i said abruptly were on our way within five minutes jackstraw would you start the engine please before she chills right down on our way the protest almost inevitably came from mrs dansbygregg my dear man weve hardly stopped and you promised us three hours sleep only a few minutes ago that was a few minutes ago that was before i found out about mr mahler here quickly i told them all i thought they needed to know it sounds brutal to say it in mr mahlers presence i went on but the facts themselves are brutal whoever crashed that plane and to a lesser extent stole the sugar put mr mahlers life in the greatest danger only two things normally could save mr mahler a properly balanced highcalorie diet as a short term measure insulin as a long term one we have neither all we can give mr mahler is the chance to get one or other of these things with all speed humanly possible between now and the coast that tractor engine is going to stop only if it packs in completely if we run into an impassable blizzard or if the last of the drivers collapses over the wheel are there any objections it was a stupid unnecessary gratuitously truculent question to ask but thats just the way i felt at that moment i suppose really that i was inviting protest so that i could have some victim for working off the accumulated rage inside me the anger that could find its proper outlet only against those responsible for this fresh infliction of suffering the anger at the near certainty that no matter what effort we made to save mahler it would be completely nullified when the time came as it inevitably must come that the killers showed their hand for one wild moment i considered the idea of tying them all up lashing them inside the tractor body so that they couldnt move and had the conditions been right i believe i would have done just that but the conditions couldnt have been more hopeless a bound person wouldnt have lasted a couple of hours in that bitter cold there were no objections for the most part i suppose they were too cold too tired too hungry and too thirsty for with the rapid evaporation of moisture from the warm relatively humid body thirst was always a problem in dry intensely cold air to raise any objections to people unaccustomed to the arctic it must have seemed that they had reached the nadir of their sufferings that things could get no worse than they were i hoped as much time as possible would elapse before they found out how wrong they were there were no objections but there were two suggestions both came from nick corazzini look doc about this diet mr mahler must have maybe we cant balance it but we can at least make sure that he gets a fair number of calories not that i know how you count the damn things why dont we double his rations no even that wouldnt keep a decent sparrow alive what say each of the rest of us docks a quarter of his rations and hands them over that way mr mahler would have about four times his normal no no mahler protested thank you mr corazzini but i cannot permit an excellent idea i interrupted i was thinking along the same lines myself good corazzini grinned carried unanimously i also suggest wed get along farther and faster if say mr zagero and i were to spell you two on the tractor he held up a hand as if to forestall protest either of us may be the man you want in fact we might be the two men you want if it is two men but if im one of the killers and i know nothing about the arctic navigation the maintenance of this damned citroen and wouldnt as much as recognise a crevasse if i fell down one its as plain as the nose on your face that im not going to make a break for it until im within shouting distance of the coast agreed agreed i said even as i spoke there came a coughing clattering roar as jackstraw coaxed the stillwarm citroen back into life and i looked up at corazzini all right i went on come on down you can have your first driving lesson now we left at halfpast seven that morning in driving conditions that were just about perfect not the slightest breath of air stirred across the icecap and the deep blueblack vault of the sky was unmarred by even the tiniest wisp of cloud the stars were strangely remote pale and shimmering and unreal through the gossamer gauze of the glittering ice needles that filled the sky and sifted soundlessly down on the frozen snow but even so visibility was all that could have been desired the powerful headlights of the citroen striking a million sparkling diamond points of light off the ice spicules reached a clear three hundred yards ahead into the darkness leaving the ground to either side of the twin interlocking beams shrouded in impenetrable darkness the cold was intense and deepening by the hour but the citroen seemed to thrive on it that morning luck was with us almost right away within fifteen minutes of starting off balto ranging free as always appeared out of the darkness to the southwest and ran alongside the dogsledge barking to attract jackstraws attention jackstraw gave us the signal to stop a rapid flickering of the red and green lights on the tractor dashboard and in two or three minutes appeared out of the darkness grinning to tell us that balto had picked up a standing trail flag that was good news in itself in that it meant that our navigation the previous night had been all that could have been wished for and that we were almost exactly on course even more important however was the fact that if this flag was the first of a series we could dispense with the navigator on the dogsledge and that jackstraw and i could have some sleep if sleep were possible in that miserably cold and lurching tractor body and indeed that flag proved to the first of an almost unbroken series that was to guide us all the length of that interminable day so that from eight oclock onwards jackstraw zagero corazzini and i took it in turns to drive with the senator the reverend smallwood or solly levin up front as lookout theirs was probably the coldest certainly the most unwelcome job of all but all three bore up uncomplainingly even to the extent of thawing out in silent agony at the end of their hour on duty shortly after eight oclock i left an obviously competent corazzini to his own devices dropped back to the shelter of the tractor body and asked the senator to go up front i then set about breaking the strictest rule of all where these old tractors were concerned that no fire should ever be lit inside when they were in motion but even the most stringent rules are to be observed only until such time as the need for breaking them is paramount and now both the need and the time were here my concern was not for the warmth and comfort of the passengers or even for the cooking of the food we had little enough of that heaven knew though a constant supply of warm water would come in useful for dealing with the inevitable cases of frostbite but purely and simply for the life of theodore mahler even following corazzinis suggestion we couldnt give him enough food and what we could didnt and wouldnt even begin to resemble a balanced diet his best chance of survival and that was slender enough lay in conserving his body reserves and his energy as far as lay within our power to achieve that work or exercise of even the lightest kind was out he had to remain as immobile as possible which was why i had him climb into a sleepingbag and lie down on one of the bunks wrapped in a pair of heavy blankets as soon as i entered but without work or exercise he would have no means to combat that numbing cold except by a constant shivering which would deplete his reserves just as quickly as the most violent exercise would so he had to have heat heat from the stove heat from the warm fluids which i told margaret ross that he was to have at least every two hours mahler protested strongly against all these arrangements being made on his behalf but at the same time he was sensible enough to realise that his only chance of survival depended on doing what i said but i believe that the main factor which finally made him yield was not so much my medical explanations as the pressure of public opinion that all the passengers should suddenly and so vehemently be concerned with theodore mahlers welfare seemed on the face of it inexplicable but only on the face of it it did not require a great deal of thought or probing beneath the surface to discover that the true motivating factor was not selflessness though there may have been some of that too but selfishness mahler represented not so much a sufferer as a most welcome diversion from their own thoughts and suspicions from the tension from the neverending constraint that had laid its chilling hand over the entire company for the past twelve hours this constraint apart from its awkwardness and sheer unpleasantness had the further effect of splitting up the passengers into tiny groups communal speech had ceased entirely except where necessity and the barest demands of common politeness made it inevitable marie legarde and margaret ross each of whom knew that the other was not under suspicion kept very much to themselves and talked only between themselves so too did zagero and solly levin and also though this would have seemed ridiculously improbable only twentyfour hours ago mrs dansbygregg and her maid helene improbable then but inevitable now whether guilty or not both knew exactly where the other stood and of all the passengers each could only fully trust the other they could of course as could all the others trust marie legarde and margaret ross but the fact that they knew that marie legarde and margaret ross couldnt trust them was enough to prohibit any attempts to establish an easier relationship as for corazzini the rev small wood the senator and mahler they kept very much to themselves in the circumstances then it was inevitable that they should welcome the introduction of an absolutely innocuous subject of interest and conversation something that would ease however slightly the coldness and discomfort of the social atmosphere something that would divert their unwelcome and suspicious thoughts into some more tolerable channel theodore mahler promised to be the best looked after patient i had ever had i had just got the oil stove going to my satisfaction when zagero called to me from his seat by the rear canvas screen theres somethin funny goin on outside doc come and have a look i had a look far off to the right the northwest that was and high above the horizon a great diffuse formless volume of luminosity spreading over almost a quarter of the dark dome of the sky was beginning to pulse and fade pulse and fade strengthening deepening climbing with the passing of every moment at first it was no more than a lightening in the sky but already it was beginning to take form and faint colours beginning to establish themselves in definite patterns the aurora mr zagero i said the northern lights first time youve seen it he nodded yeah amazin spectacle aint it this this is nothing its just starting up its going to be a curtain you get all sorts rays bands coronas arcs and what have you but this is a curtain best of the lot get this sort of thing often doc every day for days on end when the weather is like this you know cold and clear and still believe it or not you can even get so used to it that you wont bother looking i dont believe it its amazin he repeated just amazin tired of it you say hope we see it every day he grinned you dont have to look doc for your own sake youd better hope for something else i said grimly meanin meaning that radio reception is hopeless when the aurora is on radio reception he crinkled his brows what we gotta lose with the radio set in the cabin smashed and your friends in the trail party gettin further away every minute you couldnt raise either of them anyway no but we can raise our uplavnik base when we get a bit nearer the coast i said and the next moment i could have bitten my tongue off i had never even thought of the matter until then but as soon as the words were out i realised that i should have kept this piece of knowledge to myself the chances of uplavnik listening in at the right time and on the right frequency were remote enough but it was always a chance we could have sent out a warning summoned help long before the killers would have thought of making a break for it but now if zagero were one of the killers he would make good and certain that the set would be smashed long before we got within radio range of the uplavnik base i cursed myself for a blundering idiot and stole a quick glance at zagero in the light streaming out from the gap in the curtain and in the fainter light of the aurora his every feature was plain but i could tell nothing from his expression he was playing it casual all right but not too stupidly casual the slow nod the pursing of the lips the thoughtful lifting of the eyebrows could not have been improved upon not even the best professional actor could have improved on it and hard on the heels of that came the second thought that there were a couple of extraordinarily fine actors among us but then if he hadnt reacted at all or had reacted too violently i would have been doubly suspicious or would i if zagero were one of the guilty men wouldnt he have known that too much or too little reaction would have been the very thing to excite suspicion and taken due precaution against registering either i gave it up and turned away but in my mind there was growing a vague but steadily strengthening suspicion against johnny zagero and on the basis of the success and validity of my previous suspicions i thought bitterly that just about guaranteed zageros innocence i turned and touched margaret ross on the shoulder id like to have a few words with you miss ross if you dont mind the cold outside she looked at me in surprise hesitated for a moment then nodded i jumped down reached up a hand to steady her then helped her aboard the big sled as it passed by a few seconds later for a short time we just sat there side by side on a petrol drum watching the aurora while i wondered how to begin i stared almost unseeingly at the tremendous sweep of the developing aurora the great folded fluted curtain of yellowgreen with redtipped feet that seemed almost to brush the surface of the icecap a translucent transparent drapery for even at its brightest the stars still shone faintly through that waved and shimmered and pulsed and glowed a pastel poem in insubstantiality like the ethereal backdrop to some unimaginably beautiful fairyland margaret ross sat there gazing at it like one lost in a trance but she might have been looking at it with the same uncaring eyes as myself lost not in wonder but in the memory of the man we had left behind in the icecap and when she turned at the sound of my voice and i saw the glow of the aurora reflected in the sad depths of the wide brown eyes i knew i was right well miss ross what do you think of the latest development mr mahler shed slipped up her snowmask in her case just a gauze and cottonwool pad with a central breathing aperture and i had to lean forward to catch her soft voice what can one say about anything soso dreadful what chance does the poor man have dr mason ive honestly no idea there are far too many unpredictable factors involved did you know that after id crossed you off id lined him up as number one on my list of suspects no but yes im afraid i fear im no sleuth miss ross i may be long on the empirical trial and error method and it at least has had the negative advantage of reducing the number of suspects by two but im pretty short on the deductive i told her what had happened between mahler and myself during the brief stop we had made and now youre as badly off as ever she said when i had finished i suppose all we can do now is to sit and wait to see what happens wait for the axe to fall you mean i said grimly not quite i havent much hope from it but i thought i might try the deductive reasoning act for a change but before we can deduce we have to have some facts we can deduce from and were very short on facts thats why i asked you out here to see if you could help me til do anything i can you know that she lifted her head as the aurora swelled and flamed to the incandescent climax of its performance and shivered violently as its unearthly beautiful colourings struck a million sparks of coloured light red and green and yellow and gold off the ice spicules in the sky i dont know why that makes me feel colder than ever but i think ive already told you everything i know everything i can remember dr mason tm sure you have but you may have missed some things just because you couldnt see they mattered anyway now as i see it we have three big questions looking for an answer how come the crash in the first place how was the coffee spiked how was the radio broken if we can turn up anything that can throw a light on even one of these we may be a long way towards finding out what we want to know ten freezing minutes later we were still a long way from finding out anything id taken margaret ross step by step from the customs hall where shed met her passengers to the plane where she had settled them down flown with them to gander watched them go through the same process again flown them out of gander watched her as shed served their evening meal and still id learnt nothing turned up nothing suspicious offbeat or abnormal that could even begin to account for the crash then slowly just as she was describing the serving of the meal her voice trailed away into silence and she turned and stared at me whats the matter miss ross of course she said softly of course what a fool i am now i see what do you see i demanded the coffee how it was tampered with id just served colonel harrison he was in the rear seat so he was the last to be served when he wrinkled his nose and asked if i could smell something burning i couldnt but i made some sort of joke about something burning on the galley hotplate and id just got back there when i heard the colonel calling and when i looked round he had the door of the starboard washroom open and smoke was coming out not much just a little i called the captain and he hurried aft to see what it was but it was nothing serious just a few papers burning somebody had been careless with a cigarette i suppose and everybody rose out of their seats and crowded to have a look i asked grimly yes captain johnson ordered them all back to their seats they were upsetting the trim of the plane and you didnt think this worth mentioning to me i said heavily no importance at all im sorry it it did seem unimportant unrelated to anything that was hours before the crash so it doesnt matter who could have gone into the galley then anybody in the front seats i suppose yes they all seemed to crowd down past the middle they who were they i dont know what why do you ask because by knowing who was there we might find out who wasnt im sorry she repeated helplessly i was a little upset for a moment then captain johnson was in front of me shooing everybody back to their seats and i couldnt see all right i changed my approach this was the mens washroom i take it yes the powder room is on the port side can you remember who went in there say any time up to an hour beforehand an hour but the cigarette end do you believe now that the fire was caused deliberately i asked of course she stared at me wideeyed right and were dealing obviously with hardened professional criminals the whole success of their plan depended on causing this excitement do you for a moment believe that they were going to let the whole thing hinge on the mere offchance of a smouldering buttend setting some papers alight especially setting them alight at the correct moment but how easy you can get a little plastic tube with a central composition shield dividing it into two compartments in one compartment you have a free acid in the other a different acid enclosed in a glass tube all you have to do is to crush the tube break the glass drop the tube in your chosen spot walk away and after a predetermined time the acid that was in the glass eats through the shield meets the other acid and starts a fire its been used hundreds of times especially in wartime sabotage if youre an arsonist looking for a castiron alibi and want to be five miles away when the fire starts its the perfect answer there way a funny smell she began slowly you bet there was can you remember who went there its no good she shook her head i was in the galley most of the time getting the meal ready who were in the front two seats those nearest the galley miss legarde and mr corazzini and im afraid thats not much help we know marie legarde cant have had anything to do with it and mr corazzini is the one person im sure didnt leave his seat before dinner he had a gin soon after takeoff then switched off his reading light draped a newspaper over his head and went to sleep are you sure quite sure i always peek through the cabin door from time to time and he was always there that seems to cut him out i said thoughtfully and reduce the number of suspects though i suppose he could still have got an accomplice to plant the acid tube then suddenly i had what was for me an inspiration tell me miss ross did anyone ask you earlier in the evening when dinner would be she looked at me for a long moment before answering and even in the fading light of the aurora i could see the understanding coming into her eyes mrs dansbygregg did im sure she would anyone else yes i remember now her voice was suddenly very quiet colonel harrison but he doesnt count any more and mr zagero zagero in my excitement i bent forward until my face was almost touching hers are you sure im sure i remember when he asked me i said are you feeling peckish sir and he grinned and said my dear air hostess i always feel peckish well well this is most interesting do you think mr zagero im at the stage where im afraid to think anything ive been wrong too often but its a straw in the wind all right a straw about the size of a haystack was he anywhere near you when the radio fell behind you for instance when you rose and brushed against the radio table no he was by the hatch im sure of that could he he couldnt joss and i worked it out somebody had pushed one of the table hinges right home and the other until it was at the critical point of balance then as you stood up he pushed the other in from a distance there was a longhandled brush lying there but it had no significance for us at the time when you heard the crash you whirled round didnt you she nodded without speaking and what did you see mr corazzini we know he dived for it i said impatiently but in the background against the wall there was someone her voice was barely more than a whisper but no no it couldnt have been hed been sitting dozing on the floor and he got the fright of his life when for heavens sake i cut in harshly who was it solly levin the brief twilight of noon came and went the cold steadily deepened and by late in the evening it seemed that we had been on board that lurching roaring tractor all our lives twice only we stopped in the course of that interminable day for refuelling at pm and pm i chose these times because i had arranged with joss that i would try to contact him every fourth hour but though we set up the apparatus outside while jackstraw was refuelling and corazzini sat astride the bicycle seat and cranked the generator handle while i tapped out our call sign for almost ten unbroken minutes no shadow of an answer came through i had expected none even if by some miracle joss had managed to fix the set the ionosphere turbulence that had caused the aurora would have almost certainly killed any chance of making contact but id promised joss and i had to keep faith by the time i made the second try everyone even jackstraw and myself was shaking and shivering in the bitter cold normally we wouldnt have felt it much in very cold weather we wore two complete sets of furs the inner one with the fur inside the outer with the fur outside but wed given our extra pairs away to corazzini and zagero furs were essential in that icebox of a tractor cabin and suffered just as much as the others occasionally someone would jump down from the tractor and run alongside to try to get warm but so exhausted were most from sleeplessness hunger cold and eternally bracing themselves against the lurching of the tractor that they were staggering from exhaustion within minutes and had to come aboard again and when they did come aboard the sweat from their exertions in such heavy clothes turned icecold on their bodies putting them in worse case than ever until finally i had to stop it it grieved me to do what had to be done what i saw must be done but there was no help for it the weariness the cold and the sleeplessness could be borne no longer when i finally gave the order to stop it was ten minutes after midnight and we had been driving continuously except for brief fuel and radio halts for twentyseven hours chapter eight wednesday am pm despite our exhaustion despite our almost overwhelming need for sleep i dont think anyone slept that night even for a moment for to have slept would have been to freeze to death i had never known such cold even with twelve of us jampacked inside a tiny wooden box built to hold five sleeping people at the most even with the oil fire roaring up the chimney all night long and wanned by a couple of cups of piping hot coffee apiece we all of us suffered agonies during these dark hours the chattering of teeth the st vitus dance of tremorridden limbs knocking against the thin uninsulated wooden walls the constant rubbing as someone sought to restore life to a frozen face or arm or foot these were the sounds that never ceased how the elderly marie legarde or the sick mahler survived that night was indeed a matter for wonder but survive they did for when i looked at my luminous watch saw that it was almost four oclock and decided that enough was enough both of them were wide awake when i switched on the little overhead light weak enough normally that light was now no more than a feeble yellow glow an ominous sign it meant that even the tractor batteries were beginning to freeze up but enough to see the crowded circle of faces white and blue and yellowing with frostbite the smokelike exhalations that clouded in the air before them with every breath they took the film of slick ice that already covered the walls and all of the roof except for a few inches round the stove pipe exit as a spectacle of suffering of sheer unrelieved misery i dont think i have ever seen its equal insomnia eh doc it was corazzini speaking his teeth chattering between the words or just forgotten to plug in your electric blanket just an early riser mr corazzini i glanced round the haggard and painfilled faces anybody here slept at all i was answered by mute headshakes from everybody anybody likely to sleep again the headshakes that settles it i struggled to my feet its only am but if were going to freeze to death we might as well freeze on the move not only that but another few hours in this temperature and that tractor engine will never start again what do you think jackstraw til get the blowtorches he said by way of answer and pushed his way out through the canvas screen almost at once i heard him begin to cough violently in the deadly cold of the air outside and in the intervals between the coughing we could clearly hear the dry rustling crackling of his breath as the moisture condensed froze and drifted away in the all but imperceptible breeze corazzini and i followed choking and gasping in turn as that glacial cold seared through throat and lungs adjusting masks and goggles until not a millimetre of flesh was left exposed abreast the driving cabin i drew out my torch and glanced at the alcohol thermometer ordinary mercury froze solid at then looked again in disbelief the red spirit inside the glass had sunk down to within an inch of the bulb and stood on the line of exactly one hundred degrees of frost still well below wegeners further short still of the incredible that the russians had recorded at the vostok in antarctica but nevertheless the lowest by almost fifteen degrees that i had ever experienced and that it should happen now now two hundred miles from the nearest human habitation with jackstraw and myself stuck with two murderers a possibly dying man seven other passengers rapidly weakening from exposure exhaustion and lack of food and a superannuated tractor that was due to pack up at any moment at all over an hour later i had cause to revise the last part of that estimate it seemed that the tractor had already packed up i had had my first intimation of trouble to come when i had switched on the ignition and pressed the horn the faint mournful beep could hardly have been heard twenty yards away the batteries were so gummed up by the cold that they couldnt even have turned over a hot engine far less one in which the crankcase transmission and differential were all but locked solid in lubricating oil that had lost all power to lubricate anything and had been turned into a super viscous liquid with the consistency and intractability of some heavy animal glue even with two of us bringing all our weight to bear on the starting handle it was impossible to turn even one cylinder over the top we made to light the paraffin blowtorches but they too were frozen solid paraffin freezes at just over and even at it still flows like heavy gearcase oil we had to thaw them out with a petrol blowtorch then place all five of them on wooden boxes and behind canvas aprons to retain the heat two to thaw out the crankcase two for the gearbox and transmission and the last for the differential after an hour or so when the engine had begun to turn fairly easily and we had brought out the heavy battery which had been thawing out by the stove we tried again but it gave no sign of life at all none of us not even corazzini whose global tractors were all dieselpowered was an expert in engine maintenance and this was when we came very close to despair but despair was the one emotion we couldnt afford and we knew it we kept the blowtorches burning returned the battery to the stove removed and cleaned the plugs eased the frozen brushes in the generator stripped and removed the petrol lines thawed them and sucked out the frozen condensation by mouth scraped away the ice from the carburettor intake and returned everything in place we had to remove our gloves for most of this delicate work the flesh stuck to metal and pulled off like the skin of an orange when we removed our hands even the backs of our fingers became burnt and blistered from casual knocks on metal blood oozed out from under our fingernails only to coagulate in the freezing air and our lips where they had touched the copper petrol feeds were swollen and puffed and blistered it was brutal killing work and in addition to the work our arms and legs and faces were almost constantly frozen despite frequent visits to the stove to thaw ourselves out it was murderous but it was worth it at sixfifteen two and a quarter hours after we had begun the big engine coughed and spluttered into life missed coughed again caught and settled down into a steady even roar i felt my split lips cracking into a painful grin under my mask thumped jackstraw and corazzini for the moment quite forgetting that the latter might be one of the killers on the back turned and went in for breakfast or what passed for breakfast it was little enough heaven knew coffee crackers and the contents of a couple of corned beef tins shared among the twelve of us the lions share going to theodore mahler that left us with only four more tins of beef four cans of vegetables about ten pounds of dried fruit a little frozen fish a small tin of biscuits three packets of cereal and it was the only thing apart from coffee of which we had an adequate supply over twenty tins of nestles unsweetened milk we had of course seal meat for the dogs jackstraw thawed some out for them over the stove while we had breakfast and the fried meat of young seal is palatable to a degree but the dogs had first claim on that it was more important to preserve their strength than our own should the engine of the citroen break down completely our last hope lay with the dogs breakfast over and the dogs fed we started off just before moonset corazzini driving with the long trailing plume of our exhaust vapour milkwhite but thick as smoke in that bitter air stretching out far behind us barstraight almost as far as the eye could see in the waning light of the moon i had arranged that the drivers should change over every fifteen minutes as long a period as any person could stand in that unheated and largely unprotected cabin i had heard of a case in the antarctic where a driver had sat so long in an exposed tractor that his numbed and frozen fingers had locked so immovably that the steeringwheel had had to be unbolted and brought inside still clutched in the drivers grasp before the hands could be thawed sufficiently to release the wheel i didnt want anything of that kind happening to us as soon as we were under way i had a look at mahler and his appearance certainly did nothing to inspire any great confidence in his chances even although he was fully dressed lying in an eiderdown sleepingbag that was zipped all the way to his chin and covered in blankets his pinched face was a mottled bluewhite and he was shaking continuously with the cold a handkerchief between his teeth to prevent their chattering i reached for his wrist the pulse was very fast though it seemed strong enough but i couldnt be sure so much skin had been sloughed or burnt off in the past two or three hours that id lost all sensitivity in my fingertips i gave him what i hoped was an encouraging smile well how do you feel mr mahler no worse than anyone else im sure dr mason that could still be bad enough hungry hungry he exclaimed thanks to the generosity of these good people here i couldnt eat another crumb it was typical of what i had come to expect of this gentle jew in the past few hours despite the relatively generous amount of food hed had for his breakfast hed wolfed it all down like a famished man he was hungry all right his body lacking the insulin to break down the mounting sugar in his blood was crying out for nourishment yet unable to find it no matter what his food intake was thirsty he nodded perhaps he thought he was on safe ground there but it was another and invariable symptom of the developing acuteness of his trouble i was pretty certain too that he had already begun to weaken and i knew it wouldnt be long before he began to lose weight rapidly indeed he already looked thinner the cheekbones were more prominent than even thirtysix hours ago but then that was true of all the others also especially marie legarde for all her uncomplaining courage her determined cheerfulness she now looked more than old she looked sick and very tired but there was nothing i could do for her your feet i asked mahler how are they i dont think theyre there any longer he smiled let me see them i asked sharply he protested but i overruled him one look at that deadwhite icecold flesh was enough miss ross i said from now on you are mr mahlers personal gunga din we have a couple of rubber bags in the sled i want you to keep these alternately filled just as soon as you can get water heated unfortunately it takes a long time to melt that damned snow theyre for mr mahlers feet again mahler protested objecting to what he called this babying but i ignored him i didnt want to tell him not yet that frostbite in the feet of an untreated diabetic could mean only one thing gangrene and amputation at the least slowly i looked round the occupants of the tractor cabin and i think that had i known for certain who the person responsible for all this was i would have killed him without compunction just then corazzini came in after only fifteen minutes at the wheel of the tractor he had just yielded to jackstraw he was in a pretty bad way the bluishwhite bloodless face was mottled with yellow frostbite blisters his lips were cracked the fingernails were beginning to discolour and his hands were in a shocking mess true jackstraw zagero and i were little better but corazzini was the only one who had driven in that intense cold he was shaking like a man with malarial fever and from the way he stumbled up the steps i could see that his legs were gone i helped him to a vacant seat by the stove feel anything below the knees i asked quickly not a damned thing he tried to smile but the effort was too painful the blood started to well again from the open cuts on his lips its pretty vicious out there doc better rub the old feet with some snow huh he stooped and rumbled uselessly at laces with his numbed and bleeding fingers but before he could move margaret ross was on her knees easing off his boots with gentle fingers looking down at that slight figure lost beneath the bulky layers of clothing i wondered for the hundredth time how i could ever have been crazy enough to believe about her all the things i had done in your own idiom mr corazzini i said snow is strictly for the birds just an old wives tale as far as these temperatures are concerned youd be better rubbing your skin off with emerypaper at below snow had the hard crystalline structure of sandstone and when rubbed granulated into a gritty white powdery sand i nodded to one of the snowbuckets on the stove when the temperature there reaches stick your feet in it wait till the skin turns red it wont be pleasant but itll work if there are any blisters ill puncture and sterilise them tomorrow he stared at me is that sort of thing going to go on all the time doc im afraid so and it did go on for all the time or for the next ten hours at least during which time the temperature dropped down to the low seventies halted and began its slow ever so slow upward swing again ten hours while the snowbuckets were never off the stove ten hours while mrs dansbygregg her maid helene and later on solly levin held blowtorches against the sides of the buckets to hurry up the melting and heating process ten hours while we drivers suffered the regularly recurring pounding agony of circulation returning to our frozen limbs ten hours during which we began to build up an almost pathological dread of the moment when we must again plunge our feet into hot water ten hours during which mahler grew steadily weaker and marie legarde falling silent for the first time slipped down and lay huddled in a corner eyelids closed like one already dead ten hours ten interminable indescribable hours of suffering borrowed from purgatory but long before these ten hours were up something happened to change the picture completely at noon we halted the tractor while the women were heating up soup and using a blowtorch to thaw out two cans of fruit jackstraw and i rigged up the radio transmitter strung out an antenna and started triggering out our gfk callsign normally on these handcranked eightwatt jobs a morse key was used for transmission while reception was by a pair of earphones but thanks to a skilful improvisation by joss who knew how hopelessly awkward morse was for everyone in the party except himself the set had been rigged so that the key was used only for the callup sign after the link was made a hand microphone could be used for transmission and simply by throwing the receiving switch into the antenna lead the microphone was transformed into a small but sufficiently effective loudspeaker calling up joss was only a gesture id made a promise and was keeping it that was all but by this time i estimated we were miles distant from him near enough the limit of our small set i didnt know what effect the intense cold would have on radio transmission but i suspected it wouldnt be anything good there had been no aurora that morning but the ionosphere disturbance might still be lingering on and of course joss himself had declared that his rca was entirely beyond repair ten minutes passed ten minutes during which jackstraw industriously cranked the handle and i sent out the callsign gfk three times repeated a flick of the receiver switch ten seconds listening then the switch pulled back and the callsign made again at the end of the ten minutes i sent out the last call pushed over the receiving switch listened briefly then stood up resignedly gesturing to jackstraw to stop cranking it was then almost in the very last instant that the mike in my hand crackled into life gfx calling gfk gfx calling gfk we are receiving you faint but clear repeat we are receiving you over i fumbled and nearly dropped the mike in my excitement gfk calling gfx gfk calling gfx i almost shouted the words saw jackstraw pointing to the switch which was still in the receiving position cursed my stupidity threw it over called out the signs again and then quite forgetting the procedure and etiquette of radio communication rushed on the words tumbling over one another dr mason here dr mason here receiving you loud and clear is that you joss i threw the switch yes sir glad to hear from you static lent a flat impersonality to the crackling words robbed them of meaning how are you what weather how far out going strong i replied cold intense minus approximately miles out joss this is a miracle how on earth did you fix it i didnt he said unemotionally there was a pause and then his voice came again captain hillcrest is waiting to speak to you sir captain hillcrest what on earth is captain hillcrest i broke off abruptly not through astonishment great though that was that hillcrest whom i had believed to be almost miles to the north of our igy cabin should have suddenly turned up there but because the warning glance from jackstraw had found an echoing answer in the back of my own mind hold on i said quickly will call you back in two or three minutes we had set up the transmitter just to the rear of the tractor cabin and i knew that every word said on both sides could be heard by those inside it was just then that the curtains parted and corazzini and zagero peered out but i ignored them i never cared less about the hurt i was offering to anybodys feelings just picked up the radio and generator while jackstraw unstrung the antenna and walked away from the tractor two hundred yards away i stopped those in the tractor could still see us the brief light of noonday was flooding over the icecap but they could no longer hear us we rigged the radio again and i tried to tap out the callsign but it was hopeless wed been out too long in that dreadful cold and my hand was beating an uncontrollable tattoo on the key fortunately they knew or guessed at the other end what was happening for hillcrests voice calm confident infinitely reassuring came through as soon as i pressed the receiving switch surprise surprise the mike crackled mechanically ok dr mason from what joss has said and the recent delay guess youre a good way from the tractor at seventy below you wont want to stay there too long suggest i do all the talking ill keep it brief receiving me loud and clear what on earth are you sorry carry on thanks we heard monday afternoon on both british and american broadcasts of the overdue airliner tuesday morning yesterday that is we heard from the uplavnik base they say this hasnt been announced officially but the us and british governments are convinced that the plane has not been lost at sea but that it has landed somewhere in greenland or baffin island dont ask me why theyre convinced ive no idea anyway theyve mounted the biggest airsea rescue search since the war merchant vessels of several nationalities have been diverted american british french and canadian fishing trawlers are moving in to the greenland coast the west coast mainly the easts already blocked with ice a dozen us air force search bombers are already operating from thule and sondre stromfjord us coastguard cutters are on the job a flotilla of canadian destroyers have been rerouted from midatlantic and are steaming at full speed for the southern entrance of the davis strait although it will take them at least thirtysix more hours to get there and a british aircraftcarrier accompanied by a couple of destroyers has already rounded cape farewell we dont know yet how far north she can get the ice is solid on the baffin side but its open at least to disko on the greenland coast maybe as far as svartenhuk all igy stations in greenland have been ordered to join in the search thats why we came back nonstop to the cabin to pick up more petrol i could contain myself no longer threw over the receiving switch what on earths all the mad flap about youd think the president of the united states and half the royal family were aboard that plane why no more information from uplavnik i waited and then hillcrests voice crackled again radio transmission impossible during preceding twentyfour hours will raise them now tell them weve found the missing plane and that youre on your way to the coast any fresh developments with you none correction one of the passengers mahler turns out to be an advanced diabetic hes in a bad way radio uplavnik to get insulin godthaab will have it wilco the microphone crackled back a long pause during which i could faintly hear the murmur of conversation then hillcrest came on again suggest you return to meet us we have plenty of petrol plenty of food with eight of us on guard instead of two nothing could happen were already forty miles out glanced at jackstraw caught the sudden wrinkling of the eyes which i knew to be the telltale sign of a quick grin of astonished delight which so accurately reflected my own feelings so not more than eighty miles behind you we could meet up in five or six hours i felt elation wash through me like a releasing wave this was wonderful this was more than anything i had ever dared hope for all our troubles were at an end and then the momentary emotion of relief and triumph ebbed the cold dismaying processes of reason moved in inexorably to take their place and it didnt require the slow definite shake of jackstraws head to tell me that the end of our troubles was as far away as ever no go i radioed back quite fatal the minute we turned back the killers would be bound to show their hand and even if we dont turn they know now that weve been in contact with you and will be more desperate than ever we must go on please follow at your best speed i paused for a moment then continued emphasise to uplavnik essential for our lives to know why crashed plane so important tell them to find out the passenger list how genuine it is this is absolutely imperative captain hillcrest refuse to accept no for an answer we must know we talked for another minute but wed really said all there was to be said besides even during the brief periods that id pushed down my snowmask to speak the cold had struck so cruelly at my cut and bleeding lips that i could now raise scarcely more than a mumble so after arranging an pm rendezvous and making a timecheck i signed off back in the tractor cabin curiosity had reached fever pitch but at least three minutes elapsed three excruciatingly uncomfortable minutes while jackstraw and i waited for the blood to come surging back through our frozen veins before anyone ventured to speak the inevitable question came from the senator a now very much chastened senator who had lost much of his choler and all of his colour with the heavy jowls hanging more loosely than ever showing unhealthily pale through the grey grizzle of beard the very fact that he spoke showed i suppose that he didnt regard himself as being heavily under suspicion he was right enough in that made contact with your friends dr mason eh the field party i mean his voice was hesitant unsure yes i nodded joss mr london got the set working after almost thirty hours nonstop work he raised captain hillcrest hes in charge of the field party and managed to establish a relay contact between us id never heard of the phrase relay contact in my life but it sounded scientific enough hes packing up immediately and coming after us is that good the senator asked hopefully i mean how long only a gesture im afraid i interrupted hes at least miles away his tractors not a great deal faster than ours it was in fact almost three times as fast five or six days at the least brewster nodded heavily and said no more he looked disappointed but he looked as if he believed me i wondered which of them didnt believe me which of them knew i was lying because they knew that they had so thoroughly destroyed all the spare condensers and valves that it would have been quite impossible for joss to repair the rca the long bitter day a day filled by nothing except that dreadful cold an endless suffering and the nervedestroying thunderous roar and vibration of that big engine crawled by like a dying man about twothirty in the afternoon as the last glow of the noonlight faded and the stars began to stand clear in the cold and brittle sky the temperature reached its nadir a frightening degrees below zero then it was that strange things happened flashlights brought from under a parka died out inside a minute rubber became hard as wood and cracked and fractured like wood breath was an opaque white cloud that shrouded the heads of every person who ventured outside the tractor body the icecap froze to such an unprecedented degree of hardness that the tractor treads spun and slipped on flat surfaces the crimp marks no more than halfseen hairlines on the ground the dogs who could with impunity stand up to howling blizzards that would kill any man whined and wailed in their utter misery in that appalling cold and now and again like some faroff intimation of doom and the end of the world a dull rumbling sound would come echoing across the icecap and the ground shake beneath the treads of the tractor as some great areas of snow and ice contracted still farther under the iron hand of that glacial cold it was then inevitably that the tractor started to give trouble it was only a matter for wonder that it hadnt broken down long before that what i feared above all was the shearing of some moving metal part made brittle by that intense cold that would have been the end of us a valvestem a camrod any one part of the delicate timing mechanism even so small a thing as a crankshaft pin it needed just one of these to go and we would be gone also we were spared these lethal mishaps but what we had was almost as bad carburettor ice was a constant problem the steering box froze up and had to be thawed out by blowtorches generator brushes stuck and broke but fortunately we carried spares enough of these but the biggest trouble was the radiator despite the fact that we had it heavily lagged the cold penetrated the lagging as if it were tissue paper and the subsequent metal contraction produced distortion soon it began to leak and by three oclock in the afternoon we were losing water at dismaying speed i doled out some of our precious reserves of heat pads for mahlers feet with the instructions that the water from the snowbuckets on the stove was to be kept solely for the radiator but even with blowtorches assisting the heat of a stove the melting of superchilled snow is a discouragingly slow process soon we were reduced to pouring halfmelted slush down the radiator cap and finally to cramming snow itself down in order to keep going at all all this was bad enough but the frightening thing was that for every pint of radiator liquid lost and every pint of snowwater used to replace it the antifreeze became that much more diluted and though we carried a small reserve drum of ethylene glycol its weight diminished perceptibly with every halt we made we had hours before that dispensed with a lookout and the burden of all this work fell on jackstraw zagero corazzini and myself of the four of us jackstraw was the only one who escaped what i knew would be permanent injury or disfigurement in the shape of scars and destroyed tissue zagero might never before have borne any of the scars of his trade but he was going to have what looked peculiarly like one now we had been too late in getting a coldwater compress to his right ear and these destroyed tissues would need plastic surgery two of corazzinis toes had also been left too long without treatment and i knew that he too would finish up in a surgical ward and because i was the one most in contact with the engine my fingertips were a painful bleeding mess the nails already blackening and beginning to rot away nor were things a great deal better with those inside the tractor cabin the first physiological effects of the cold were beginning to assert themselves and assert themselves strongly the almost overpowering desire for sleep the uncaring indifference to all that went on around them later would come the sleeplessness the anaemia the digestive troubles the nervousness that could lead to insanity if the cold continued long enough these conditions would inevitably succeed the picture of huddled lifeless misery that presented itself to me whenever i sought the shelter of the cabin and the agony of returning circulation after my spell at the wheel many times i saw the picture that afternoon and always the picture was the same the senator sat slumped in a corner a dead man but for the fits of violent shuddering that overtook him at regularly recurring intervals mahler appeared to sleep mrs dansbygregg and helene lay huddled in one anothers arms an incredible sight i thought but then next only to death itself the arctic was the great leveller an unparalleled agent in stripping away the pretensions and shoddy veneers of everyday living i was no great believer in the sudden conversions of human nature and was pretty certain that with mrs dansbygregg the return to civilisation would coincide with the return to her normal self and that this moment of common humanity shared by herself and her maid would be no more than a fading and unwelcome memory but for all my dislike of mrs dansbygregg i was beginning to develop more than a sneaking admiration for her the carefully cherished snobbery the maddeningly easy and condescending assumption of an inevitable social superiority were irritating enough heaven knew but behind that unlovable facade seemed to lie a deepburied streak of that selflessness which is the hallmark of the genuine aristocrat although she complained constantly about the tiny irritations she was silent on matters that caused her genuine suffering she was developing a certain brusque helpfulness as if she was halfashamed of it and showed a care for her maid which though probably no more than that feudal kindness that reaches its best in adversity nevertheless verged almost on tenderness and i had seen her take a mirror from her handbag inspect the ravages frostbite had wreaked on her lovely face then return the mirror to her bag with a gesture of indifference mrs dansbygregg in short was becoming for me an object lesson against the dangers of an overready classification of people into types marie legarde the lovable indomitable marie legarde was a sick old woman weakening by the hour her attempts at cheerfulness in her fully wakeful moments she was asleep most of the time were strained and almost desperate the effort was too much there was nothing i could do for her like an old watch her time was running out the mainspring of her life running down a day or two of this would surely kill her solly levin had taken over the blowtorches which played constantly against the sides of the snowbuckets wrapped and huddled in clothes until only one eye was visible he nevertheless achieved the near impossible of looking a picture of abject misery but the way my thoughts had been running all day i had no sympathy to waste on mr levin margaret ross dozed by the side of the stove but i turned my eyes away quickly even to look at that thin white face was a physical hurt the marvel of them all was mr smallwood yet another instance i thought wryly of how wrong i could get instead of being one of the first to go under he showed every sign of being the last three hours ago when i had been in the cabin he had brought up his bag from the tractor sled and as hed opened it id caught a glimpse of a black gown and the red and purple divinity hood hed brought out a bible donned a pair of rimless steel spectacles and for several hours now had been reading as best he could in the dim overhead light he seemed composed relaxed yet alert fit to carry on for a long time to come as doctor and scientist i didnt go in much for theological speculation but i could only suppose that mr smallwood was in some way sustained by something that was denied the rest of us i could only envy him during the course of the evening two blows fell the first of these was not in any way figurative i still have the scar on my forehead to prove it we stopped just before eight oclock that evening partly in order to keep our radio schedule with hillcrest partly because i wanted to make a long halt to give hillcrest all the more opportunity to overtake us on the pretext that the citroens engine was overheating badly in the temperature that had been rising steadily since the early afternoon but despite the fact that it was now almost twentyfive degrees warmer than in midafternoon it was still bitterly cold our hunger and physical exhaustion saw to it that we still suffered almost as much as ever dark and very still far away to the southwest we could see the jagged sawtooth line of the vindeby nunataks that hundredmile long ridge of hills that we would have to cross the next day the forbidding peaks a gleaming crystalline white in the light of the moon that had not yet topped our eastern horizon i was driving when we stopped i switched off the motor walked round to the back of the tractor and told those inside that we were making a halt i asked margaret ross to heat some food on the stove soup dried fruit one of our four remaining tins of corned beef asked jackstraw to rig up the antenna for the radio then went back to the tractor stooped and turned the radiator drainage cap catching the liquid hi a can hie antifreeze in the water had been thinned down so much in the course of the day that i was pretty certain that in those temperatures it wouldnt take half an hour for the radiator water to freeze up and split open the cylinder jacket i suppose it was because of the gurgling of the water into the can that i didnt hear the sound behind me until the last moment and even so i had no particular reason just then to be suspicious of anything i halfstraightened and turned round to see who was there but i was too late the consciousness of a vague blur hi the darkness and the blinding white flash of light and pain as something solid smashed into my forehead just above the goggles on my right eye came in one and the same instant i was out completely unconscious long before i crumpled down on to the frozen surface of the icecap death could easily have supervened then it would have been easy ever so easy for me to drift from unconsciousness into that numbed sleep from which almost eighty degrees of frost in the ground i would never have awaked but awake i did slowly painfully reluctantly at the insistence of urgently shaking hands dr mason dr mason dimly i realised that it was jackstraw speaking that he had my head and shoulders supported in the crook of his arm his voice was low but with a peculiarly carrying quality wake up dr mason ah good good easy does it now dr mason groggily jackstraws strong arm helping i levered myself up into an upright sitting position a brilliant flame of pain lanced like a scalpel through my head i felt everything blurring once more consciously almost violently shook off the shadows that were creeping in on me again then looked dazedly up at jackstraw i couldnt see very well i thought for one frightening moment that the vision centre had been damaged when the back of my head had struck against the ironhard icecap the ache there was almost as severe as the one in my forehead but i soon discovered that it was only the blood seeping from the cut on my forehead that had frozen and gummed together the lids of my right eye no idea who did it dr mason jackstraw wasnt the man to ask stupid questions like what happened no idea at all i struggled to my feet have you hopeless i could sense rather than see the shrug in the darkness as soon as you stopped three or four of them came out i dont know where they went was out to the south rigging up the antenna the radio jackstraw i was beginning to think again wheres the radio no worry dr mason i have it with me jackstraw said grimly its here any idea whyt none yes i have i thrust my hand into the inside pocket of my parka then looked at jackstraw in disbelief my gun its still there nothing else missing no spare ammo clip there wait a moment i said slowly i hunted around in my parka pocket but with no success a paper took a newspaper cutting from colonel harrisons pocket its gone a cutting what was in it dr mason youre talking to one of the worlds prize idiots jackstraw i shook my head in selfreproach winced as the pain struck again ive never even read the damn thing if you had jackstraw murmured philosophically youd probably know why it was taken from you but but what was the point in it i asked blankly for all they know i might have read it a dozen times i think they know you havent even read it once jackstraw said slowly if you had theyd have known it by the fact that you would have said or done something they would have expected you to say or do but because you havent well they know theyre still safe they must have been desperate to take a chance like this it is a great pity i do not think dr mason that you will ever see that paper again five minutes later i had washed and bandaged the cut on my forehead id savagely told an inquiring zagero that id walked into a lamppost and refused to answer all other questions and set off with jackstraw in the strengthening light of the newlyrisen moon we were late for our rendezvous but when i switched the receiver into the antenna i heard josss callup sign come through straight away i acknowledged then asked without preamble what news from uplavnik two things dr mason hillcrest had taken the microphone over from joss and even through the distortion of the speaker his voice sounded strange with the flat controlled unemotionalism of one speaking through a suppressed anger uplavnik has been in touch with hms triton the carrier coming up the davis strait triton is in constant communication with the british admiralty and the government or so i gather the answers to your questions are these firstly the passenger list from boac in america is not yet through but it is known from newspaper reports that the following three people were aboard marie legarde the musical comedy star senator hoffman brewster of the united states and a mrs phyllis dansbygregg who appears to be a very prominent london socialite i wasnt greatly excited over this item of news marie legarde had never been a suspect mrs dansbygregg and by implication helene fleming had never had more than a faint question mark against their names and i had already come to the conclusion that it was long odds against the man who was or purported to be senator brewster being one of the killers the second thing is this the admiralty cannot or will not say why the plane has been forced down but i gather there must have been a most vital reason uplavnik suggests on what basis i cannot say perhaps it is officially inspired that some person aboard the plane must have been in possession of something of the utmost importance so important that complete secrecy was vital dont ask me what it was a microfilm a formula something perhaps only committed to memory it sounds fanciful but thats all we can guess at it does seem likely that colonel harrison was in possession of it i looked at jackstraw and he at me the man who had so recently knocked me out had been desperate all right i knew then what i had subconsciously known all along that i was dealing blindfolded against a man or men far cleverer than myself they knew that joss couldnt possibly have hoped to repair the rca they knew therefore that i must have been talking direct to hillcrest they knew because i had told them that the eightwatt radio we had with us had a range of not more than miles under normal conditions so that the chances were high that hillcrest was actually speaking from the igy cabin or a point even nearer i had also told them that hillcrest and his four companions wouldnt be returning from their field trip for another two or three weeks so that this premature return could only be accounted for by some unforeseen and extraordinary event it wasnt hard to guess what that event must have been that i should ask hillcrest to find out the reason for the crash followed inevitably but what was not inevitable what pointed most clearly of all to the shrewdness of the killers was their guess that whoever knew the reason for the crash would be most reluctant to go into specific detail and they had robbed me of the only clue that might have helped me discover what that detail was and so also i felt sure the identity of the killers but the time was far past now for crying over spilt milk i pressed the switch to transmit thank you but please radio uplavnik again emphasise desperate urgency of finding out crash reasons how far behind do you estimate you are now we have made only twenty miles since noon cold extreme bad radiator trouble over we have made only eight miles since noon it seems i threw the switch over eight miles i demanded harshly did i hear you say eight miles you heard hillcrests voice was savage remember the missing sugar well its turned up your fine friends dumped the whole bloody lot into the petrol were completely immobilised chapter nine wednesday pm thursday pm we were on our way again just after nine oclock that night it had been my original intention by dreaming up a variety of excuses and even if necessary by sabotaging the engine to stay there for several hours or at least what i reckoned to be the longest possible time before the killers became restive suspected that i was deliberately stalling and took over or tried to take over for it had been my further intention that after an hour or two jackstraw should produce his rifle it was strapped to his shoulders night and day and i my automatic and hold them all at the point of the gun until hillcrest came up if all had gone well he should have been with us by midnight our troubles would have been over but it had not gone well our troubles were as bad as ever the snocat was bogged down and with mahler now seriously ill and marie legarde frighteningly weak and exhausted i couldnt remain any longer had i been made of tougher stuff or even had i not been a doctor i might have brought myself to recognise that both marie legarde and theodore mahler were expendable pawns in a game where the stakes i was now certain were far greater than just the lives of one or two people i might have held everybody or the major suspects at least at gunpoint until such time twentyfour hours if need be as hillcrest did come up but i could not bring myself to regard our sick passengers as expendable pawns a weakness no doubt but one that i was almost proud to share with jackstraw who felt exactly as i did that hillcrest would come up eventually i felt pretty sure the dumping of the sugar in the petrol i bit my lips in chagrin whenever i remembered that it had been i who had told them all that hillcrest was running short of fuel had been a brilliant move but nothing more now than i had come to expect of men who thought of everything made every possible provision against future eventualities still even though furiously angry at the delay hillcrest had thought he could cope with the situation the big cabin of the snocat was equipped with a regular workshop with tools fit to deal with just about every mechanical breakdown and already his drivermechanic didnt envy him his murderous task even though he was reportedly working behind heated canvas aprons had stripped down the engine and was cleaning pistons cylinder walls and valves of the unburnt carbon deposits that had finally ground the big tractor to a halt a couple of others had rigged up a makeshift distillation unit a petrol drum almost full with a thin metal tube packed in ice leading from its top to an empty drum petrol hillcrest had explained had a lower boiling point than sugar and when the drum was heated the evaporating gas which would cool in the icepacked tube should emerge as pure petrol such at least was the theory although hillcrest didnt seem absolutely sure of himself he had asked if we had any suggestion whether we could help him in any way at all but i had said we couldnt i was tragically unforgivably wrong i could have helped for i knew something that no one else did but at the moment i completely forgot it and because i forgot nothing could now avert the tragedy that was to come or save the lives of those who were about to die my thoughts were black and bitter as the tractor roared and lurched and clattered its way southwest by west under the deepening darkness of a sky that was slowly beginning to fill with cloud a dark depression filled me and a cold rage and there was room in my mind for both i had a strange fey sense of impending disaster and though i was doctor enough to know that it was almost certainly a psychologically induced reaction to the cold exhaustion sleeplessness and hunger and a physical reaction to the blow on the head nevertheless i could not shake it off and i was angry because i was helpless i was helpless to do anything to protect any of the innocent people with me the people who had entrusted themselves to my care the sick mahler and marie legarde the quiet young german girl the gravefaced margaret ross above all i had to admit to myself margaret ross i was helpless because i knew the murderers might strike at any time for all i knew they might believe that hillcrest had already told me all i needed to know ana that i was just waiting my chance to catch them completely off guard on the other hand they too were almost certainly just biding their time not knowing how much i knew but just taking a calculated gamble letting things ride as long as the tractor kept moving kept heading in the right direction but prepared to strike once and for all when the time came and above all i was helpless because i still had no definite idea as to who the killers were for the hundredth time i went over everything i could remember everything that had happened everything that had been said trying to dredge up from the depths of memory one single fact one isolated word that would point the finger in one unmistakable direction but i found nothing of the ten passengers jackstraw and i had with us six of them i felt certain were almost beyond suspicion margaret ross and marie legarde were completely beyond it the only things that could be said against mrs dansbygregg and helene was that i hadnt absolute proof of their innocence but i was certain that such proof was quite unnecessary united states senators as recent bribery and corruption cases had lamentably shown had as many human failings especially cupidity as the next man but even so the idea of a senator getting mixed up with murder and criminal activities on this massive scale was too preposterous to bear further examination as for mahler i was quite aware that being a diabetic didnt bar a man from criminal pursuits and he could have been one of the guilty men just possibly he had thought they would forceland near some easily available insulin supplies but that was just a little too farfetched and even if it werent i wasnt seriously interested in mahler i was concerned with killers who might kill again at any moment and he most certainly wasnt included in that category mahler was a dying man that left only zagero solly levin corazzini and the rev smallwood and the rev smallwood was too good notto be true the bible was hardly ever out of his hands these days there were certain lengths to which any impostor might reasonably be expected to go to convince us of his identity but lengths such as these passed the bounds of the superfluous into the realms of the ridiculous i had reason to suspect corazzini as a tractor specialist he knew precious little about tractors although i had to be fair and admit that citroen and global tractors were a quarter of a century different in time and a world different in design but he had been the only person i had found on his feet when i had opened the door of the passenger cabin in the plane it was he who back in the igy cabin had questioned me so closely about hillcrests movements it was he i had learnt who had helped jackstraw and zagero bring up the petrol from the tunnel and so had the opportunity to spike the stuff left behind finally i believed he could be utterly ruthless but there was one great point in his favour that stillbandaged hand token of his desperate attempt to save the falling radio i had far greater reason to suspect zagero and by implication of friendship solly levin zagero had inquired of margaret ross when dinner was a damning point solly levin had been nearest the radio and in the right position for doing the damage when it had been destroyed another damning point zagero had been one of those working with the petrol and most damning of all zagero bore no more resemblance to a boxer than levin did to any boxing manager who had ever lived outside the pages of damon runyon and as a further negative mark against zagero i had margaret rosss word that corazzini had never left his seat in the plane that didnt of course necessarily exclude corazzini he could well have had an accomplice but who could that accomplice be it was not until then that the chilling frightening thought struck me that because two guns had been used in the plane i had assumed all along that there were only two criminals there wasnt a shadow of evidence to suggest why there should not be more than two why not three why not corazzini zagero and levin all in the conspiracy together i thought over the implications of this for some minutes and at the end i felt more helpless than ever more weirdly certain of ultimate tragedy to come forcibly almost i had to remind myself that all three were not necessarily working together but it was a possibility that had to be faced about three oclock in the morning still following the flag trail that stretched out interminably before us in the long rake of the headlights we felt the tractor slow down and jackstraw who was driving at the time change gear as we entered on the first gentle slope of the long foothills that led to the winding pass that cut the vindeby nunataks almost exactly in half we could have gone round the nunataks but that would have wasted an entire day perhaps two and with the tenmile route through the hills clearly marked it was pointless to make a detour two hours later as the incline perceptibly steepened the tractor treads began to slip and spin on the frozen snow but by offloading almost all the petrol and gear we carried on the tractor sled and stowing it inside the tractor cabin we managed to build up enough weight to gain a purchase on the surface even so progress was slow and difficult we could only make ground by following a zigzag pattern and it took us well over an hour to cover the last mile before the entrance to the pass here we halted soon after seven oclock in the morning the pass was lined on one side by a deep crevasse in the ice that ran its entire length and although not particularly treacherous the trail was difficult and dangerous enough to make me determined to wait for the two or three brief hours light at the middle of the day while breakfast was being prepared i looked at mahler and marie legarde the steady rise in temperature it was now less than sot had done nothing to help either of them marie legarde looked as if she hadnt eaten in weeks her face pockmarked with sores and frostbite blisters was appallingly thin and wasted and the once sparkling eyes lacklustre pouched and filled and rimmed with blood she hadnt spoken a word in ten hours just sat there in her increasingly rare moments of waking shivering and staring ahead with sightless eyes theodore mahler looked in better case than she but i knew when his defences went down they would do so in a matter of hours despite all that we or rather margaret ross had done for him the insidious talons of frostbite had already sunk deep into his feet he had developed a very heavy cold rare indeed in the arctic the seeds of it must have been sown before he had left new york and he had neither the energy nor reserves to fight either that or the boils that were beginning to plague him his breathing was difficult the sweet ethereal odour of acetone very strong he seemed wide awake and rational enough superficially a much better going concern than marie legarde but i knew that the collapse the preliminary to the true diabetic coma might come at any time at eight oclock jackstraw and i moved out on to the hillside and again made contact with hillcrest my heart sank when i heard the grim news that theyd hardly progressed a couple of miles in the previous twelve hours in that bitter cold it seemed and where they were temperatures were all of thirty degrees lower than they were with us heating up an eight gallon drum of petrol even using stoves blowlamps and every means at their disposal to the point of boiling was a heartbreakingly slow job and the snocat gobbled up in a minute all the pure fuel they could distil in thirty times that beyond that there was no news uplavnik which they had contacted less than an hour previously had still nothing fresh to report without a word jackstraw and i packed up the equipment and made our way back to the cabin of the tractor jackstraws almost invariable eskimo cheerfulness was at the lowest ebb i had ever seen he seldom spoke now and even more rarely smiled as for me i felt our last hope was gone we started up the tractor again at eleven oclock and headed straight into the pass myself at the wheel i was the only person left in either the driving compartment or the cabin behind mahler and marie legarde vanished under a great mound of clothing rode on the dogsled while the others walked the tractor was wide the trail narrow and sometimes sloping outwards and downwards and with a sideslip into the gaping crevasse that bordered our path nobody inside the cabin would have had any chance of escape the first part was easy the trail sometimes not more than eight or nine feet broad more often than not opened out into a shelf wide enough almost to be called the flat floor of a valley and we made rapid progress at noon id warned hillcrest that we would be traversing the vindeby nunataks then and would have to miss our regular radio schedule we were more than halfway through and had just entered the narrowest and most forbidding defile in the entire crossing when corazzini came running up alongside the tractor and waved me down to a stop i suppose he must have been shouting but id heard nothing above the steady roar of the engine and of course id seen nothing because they had all been behind me and the width of the tractor cabin made my driving mirror useless trouble doc he said swiftly just as the engine died someones gone over the edge come on quick who i jumped out of the seat forgetting all about the gun i habitually carried in the door compartment as an insurance against surprise attack when i was driving how did it happen the german girl we were running side by side round a corner in the track towards the little knot of people forty yards back clustering round a spot on the edge of the crevasse slipped fell i dunno your friends gone over after her gone after her i knew that crevasse was virtually bottomless good god i pushed brewster and levin to one side peered gingerly over the edge into the bluegreen depths below then drew in my breath sharply to the right as i looked the gleaming walls of the crevasse their top ten feet glittering with a beaded crystalline substance like icing sugar and here not more than seven or eight feet apart stretched down into the illimitable darkness curving away from one another to form an immense cavern the size of which i couldnt even begin to guess at to the left more directly below at a depth of perhaps twenty feet the two walls were joined by a snow and ice bridge maybe fifteen feet long one of the many that dotted the crevasse through its entire length jackstraw was standing on this pressed closely into one edge holding an obviously dazed helene in the crook of his right arm it wasnt hard to work out jackstraws presence there normally he was far too careful a man to venture near a crevasse without a rope and certainly far too experienced to trust himself to the treachery of a snowbridge but when helene had stumbled over the edge she must have fallen heavily almost certainly in an effort to protect her broken collarbone and when she had risen to her feet had been so dazed that jackstraw to prevent her staggering over the edge of the snowbridge to her death had taken the nearsuicidal gamble of jumping after her to stop her even in that moment i wondered if i would have had the courage to do the same myself i didnt think so are you all right i shouted i think my left arm is broken jackstraw said conversationally would you please hurry dr mason this bridge is rotten and i can feel it going his arm broken and the bridge going and indeed i could see chunks of ice and snow falling off from the underside of the arch on which he was standing the matteroffact lack of emotion of his voice was more compelling than the most urgent cry could possibly have been but for the moment i was in the grip of a blind panic that inhibited all feeling all thought except the purely destructive ropes but jackstraw couldnt tie a rope round himself not with an arm gone the girl couldnt help herself either both of them were helpless somebody would have to go down to them and go at once even as i stared into the crevasse held in this strange motionless thrall a large chunk of niv broke off from the side of the bridge and plummeted slowly down into the depths to vanish from sight perhaps two hundred feet below long before we heard it strike the floor of the crevasse i jumped up and raced towards the tractor sled how to belay the man who was lowered with only eight or nine feet between the edge of the crevasse and the cliff behind not more than three men could get behind a rope and with perhaps two men dangling at the end of it what possible purchase could those three find on that icehard snow to support them far less pull them up they would be pulled over the edge themselves spikes drive a spike into the ground and anchor a rope to that but heaven only knew how long it would take to drive a spike into the icy surface with no guarantee at the end that the ice wouldnt crack and refuse to hold and all the time that snowbridge crumbling under the feet of the two people who were depending on me to save their lives the tractor i thought desperately perhaps the tractor that would take any weight but by the time wed disconnected the tractor sled pushed it over the edge and slowly backed the tractor along that narrow and treacherous path it would have been far too late i literally stumbled upon the answer the four big wooden bridging battens sticking out from the end of the tractor sled god i must have been crazy not to think of them straight away i grabbed a coil of nylon rope hauled out one of the battens zagero was already beside me pulling at another and ran back to the spot as fast as i could that threeinch thick elevenfoot long batten must have weighed over a hundred pounds but such is the supernormal strength given us in moments of desperate need that i brought it sweeping over and had it in position astride the crevasse directly above jackstraw and helene as quickly and surely as if i had been handling a halfinch plank seconds later zagero had laid the second batten alongside mine i stripped off fur gloves and mittens tied a double bowline in the end of the nylon rope slipped my legs through the two loops made a quick halfhitch round my waist shouted for another rope to be brought moved out and tied my own rope to the middle of the planks allowing for about twenty feet of slack and lowered myself down hand over hand until i was standing beside jackstraw and helene i could feel the snowbridge shake under my feet even as i touched it but id no time to think about that it would have been fatal if i had even begun to think about it another rope came snaking down over the edge and in seconds i had it tied round helenes waist so tightly that i could hear her gasp with the pain of it but this was no time for taking chances and whoever held the other end of the rope up above was moving even as quickly as i was for the rope tightened just as i finished tying the knot i learned later that helene owed her life to mahlers quick thinking the dogsledge carrying marie legarde and himself had stopped directly opposite the spot where helene had gone over and he had shouted to brewster and margaret ross to sit on it and thread the rope through the slats on the sledge top it had been a chance but one that came off even on that slippery surface their combined weights were more than enough to hold the slightly built helene it was then that i made my mistake my second mistake of that afternoon though i did not realise that at the time to help those above i stooped to boost her up and as i straightened abruptly the suddenly increased pressure proved too much for the already crumbling bridge i heard the ominous rumble felt the snow begin to give under my feet released my hold on helene she was already well clear anyway grabbed jackstraw by the arm and jumped for the other side of the bridge a second before the spot where we had been standing vanished with a whroom and went cascading down into the gloomy depths of the crevasse at the full extent of my rope i hit the ice on the far side of the crevasse wrapped both arms tightly round jackstraw i heard his muffled expression of pain and remembered his injury for the first time and wondered how long i could hold him when that side of the bridge went too as go it must its support on the far side no longer existing but miraculously for the moment it held both of us were pressed hard in against the ice motionless hardly daring to breathe when i heard a sudden cry of pain from above it came from helene she must have caught her injured shoulder as she was being pulled over the edge of the crevasse but what caught my eye was not helene but corazzini he was standing very close to the edge and he had my gun in his hand i have never known such chagrin such profound despair such bitterness of spirit or to be utterly frank such depths of fear the one thing i had guarded against all the time the one thing i had dreaded above all other things that jackstraw and i should ever find ourselves at the same time completely at the mercy of the killers had come to pass but even in my fear there was savagery savagery towards the man who had engineered this so beautifully savagery towards myself for having been so easily and utterly fooled even a child could see how it had been done the series of snowbridges had given corazzini the idea a little nudge to helene fleming at the right place it was as plain as a pikestaff that it had been no accident and it was a foregone conclusion that either jackstraw or myself would have to go down to fix a rope round the youngster who with her broken collarbone would be unable to do it herself i suppose the possibility that she might have crashed straight through the snowbridge must have occurred to corazzini but a man with a record of killings like he had wouldnt be worried unduly on that score annoyance at the failure of his plan would probably have been his only reaction and when one of us had gone down and the other was supervising the rescue from above well another little nudge would have solved all corazzinis problems as it was i had played into his hands more completely than he could ever have hoped mouth dry sweat breaking out in the palms of my clenched fists and my heart going like a triphammer in my chest i was wondering desperately how he was going to administer the coup de grace when i saw the rev smallwood approaching him arms outstretched and saying something i couldnt catch it was a brave gesture of the little ministers but a forlorn and hopeless one i could see corazzini change his gun to his left hand strike mr smallwood a heavy backhanded blow across the face and the sound of a body falling on the ice above was unmistakable and then corazzini was waving the others back at the point of the gun and was advancing towards the wooden battens that straddled the crevasse and i knew with a dull certainty how he intended to dispose of us why waste two bullets when all he had to do was to kick the edges of these battens over the side whether these battens weighing two hundred pounds between them struck us or smashed away the last remaining buttress of the snowbridge was quite immaterial the point was that i was inescapably attached to them by the nylon rope round my waist and when they plummeted down i would go with them tearing away the bridge and carrying jackstraw with me to our deaths in the unthinkable depths below despairingly i considered the idea of snatching at the rifle still strapped to jackstraws back but dismissed it even with the thought it would take me seconds to get it off there was only one thing for it and it wasnt going to do me any good at all with a jump i could be halfway up the rope in a second the increased weight would make the battens difficult to kick over and while corazzini was either pushing these or pumping bullets into me as i swarmed up the rope somebody zagero say could get him from the rear that way there might at least be a faint chance for jackstraw i swung my arms behind me bent my knees then remained frozen in that ridiculous position as a rope came uncoiling down from above and struck me across the shoulder i glanced up and saw corazzini smiling down at me you two characters fixin on stayin down there all day come on up it would be useless to try to describe the maelstrom of thoughts and emotions that whirled through my mind in the ninety seconds that elapsed before jackstraw and i stood once more in incredulous safety on the trail above they ranged from hope to bafflement to wild relief to the conviction that corazzini was playing a catandmouse game with us and no one thought was in my mind for more than seconds at a time even when i was safe i still didnt know what to think the overwhelming relief and gladness and reaction blotted out everything i was trembling violently and although corazzini must have noticed it he affected not to he stepped forward and handed me the beretta butt first youre a mite careless about where you stow your armoury doc ive known for a long time where you kept this but i guess it may have been fairly useful these last few minutes but but why because ive got a damned good job and a chair behind a vicepresidents desk waiting for me in glasgow he snapped id appreciate the chance to sit in that chair some day without another word he turned away i knew what he meant all right i knew we owed him our lives corazzini was as convinced as i that someone had engineered the whole thing it didnt require any thought at all to guess who that someone was my first thought was for jackstraw jackstraw with a broken arm was going to make things very difficult for me it might well make things quite impossible but when id worked his parka off it required only one glance at the unnatural twist of the left arm to see that though jackstraw had had every excuse for thinking his arm gone it was in fact an elbow dislocation he made no murmur and his face remained quite expressionless as i manipulated the bone back into the socket but the wide white grin that cracked his face immediately afterwards was proof enough of his feelings i walked over to where helene fleming sat on the sledge still shaking from the shock mrs dansbygregg and margaret ross doing their best to soothe her the uncharitable thought struck me that it was probably the first time that mrs dansbygregg had ever tried to soothe anyone but i was almost ashamed of the thought as soon as it had occurred to me that was a close call young lady i said to helene but alls well any more bones broken eh i tried to speak jocularly but it didnt sound very convincing no dr mason she gave a long shuddering sigh i dont know how to thank you and mr nielsen dont try i advised who pushed you what she stared at me you heard helene who did it yes i was pushed she murmured reluctantly but it was an accident i know it was who i persisted it was me solly levin put in he was twisting his hands nervously like the lady said doc it was an accident i guess i kinda stumbled someone tapped my heels and who tapped your heels for cryin out loud id made no attempt to hide the cold disbelief in my voice what would i want to do a thing like that for suppose you tell me i said and turned away leaving him to stare after me zagero stepped in my way but i brushed roughly past him and went up towards the tractor on the sled behind i saw the rev smallwood sitting nursing a bleeding mouth corazzini was apologising to him im sorry reverend im really and truly sorry i didnt for a moment think you were one of them but i couldnt afford to take any chances back there i hope you understand mr smallwood mr smallwood did and was suitably christian and forgiving but i didnt wait to hear the end of it i wanted to get through the vindeby nunataks and get through with as little loss of time as possible preferably before it became dark there was something that i knew now that i had to do and as soon as possible but i didnt want to do it while we were all teetering on the edge of that damned crevasse we were through without further incident and at the head of that long almost imperceptible slope that fell away for thousands of feet towards the icebare rocks of the greenland coast before the last of the noon twilight had faded from the sky i halted the tractor spoke briefly to jackstraw told margaret ross to start thawing out some corned beef for our belated midday meal and had just seen mahler now semiconscious and marie legarde once again safely ensconced in the tractor cabin when margaret ross came up to me her brown eyes troubled the tins dr mason the corned beef i cant find them whats that the bully they cant be far away margaret it was the first time id called her that but my thoughts had been fixed exclusively on something else and it wasnt until i saw the slight smile touching her lips if she was displeased she was hiding it quite well that i realised what i had said i didnt care it was worth it it was the first time i had ever seen her smile and it transformed her rather plain face but i told my heart that there was a time and a place for somersaults and this wasnt it come on lets have a look we looked and we found nothing the tins were gone all right this was the excuse the opportunity i had been waiting for jackstraw was by my side looking at me quizzically as we bent over the sled and i nodded behind him i murmured i moved back to where the others were grouped round the rear of the tractor cabin and took up a position where i could watch them all but especially zagero and levin well i said you heard our last tins of beef have gone they didnt just vanish somebody stole them that somebody had better tell me for im going to find out anyway there was an utter silence that was broken only occasionally by the stirring of the dogs on the tethering cable no one said anything no one as much as looked at his neighbour the silence stretched on and on then as one man they all swung round startled at the heavy metallic click from behind them jackstraw had just cocked the bolt of his rifle and i could see the slow stiffening of zageros back and arms as he realised that the barrel was lined up on his own head its no coincidence zagero i said grimly i had my own automatic in my hand by the time he turned round that rifles pointed just where its meant to bring your bag here he stared at me then called me an unprintable name bring it here i repeated i pointed the beretta at his head believe me zagero id as soon kill you as let you live he believed me he brought the bag flung it at my feet open it i said curtly its locked unlock it he looked at me without expression then searched through his pockets at last he stopped and said i cant find the keys id expected nothing else jackstraw i changed my mind one gun was not enough to cover a killer like zagero i glanced round the company made my choice mr small wood perhaps you no thank you mr smallwood said hastily he was still holding a handkerchief to his puffed mouth he smiled wryly ive never realised so clearly before now how essentially a man of peace i am dr mason perhaps mr corazzini i glanced at corazzini and he shrugged indifferently i understood his lack of eagerness he must have known that id had him high up among my list of suspects until very recently indeed and a certain delicacy of sentiment might well prevent him from being too forthcoming too soon but this was no time for delicacy i nodded and he made for zagero he missed nothing but he found nothing after two minutes he stepped back looked at me and then thoughtfully at solly levin again i nodded and again he began to search in ten seconds he brought out a bunch of keys and held them up its a frameup levin yelped its a plant corazzini tnusta palmed em and put em there i never had no keys shut up i ordered contemptuously yours zagero he nodded tightly said nothing ok corazzini i said lets see what we can find the second key opened the soft leather case corazzini dug under the clothes on top and brought out the three corned beef tins thank you i said our friends iron rations for his takeoff miss ross our lunch tell me zagero can you think of any reason why i shouldnt kill you now youve made nothin but mistakes ever since i met you zagero said slowly but brother this is the biggest you ever made do you think i would be such a damn fool as to incriminate myself that way do you think i would be so everlastingly obvious i think thats exactly the way you expected me to think i said wearily but im learning im learning one more job corazzini if you would tie their feet what are you going to do zagero asked tightly dont worry the executioner will collect his fee from now on you and levin ride with your feet tied in the front of the tractor sled and with a gun on you all the time what is it miss legarde are you sure peter it was the first time she had spoken for hours and i could see that even that tiny effort tired her he doesnt look like a murderer the tone of her voice accurately reflected the expressions of consternation and shocked disbelief on half a dozen faces zagero had spared no effort to make himself popular with everyone does anybody here i demanded the best murderers never do i then explained to her and the others all i knew and had suspected about everything it shook them especially the facts of the spiking of the petrol and of hillcrest having been at one time only a few hours behind us and by the time i was finished i could see that there was as little doubt in their minds about zageros guilt as there was in mine two hours later well down the slope from the vindeby nunataks i stopped and set up the radio gear i reckoned that we were now less than a hundred miles from the coast and for half an hour tried to raise our base at uplavnik we had no success but i had hardly expected any the radio shack at the base was manned only by one operator he couldnt be expected to be on watch all the time and obviously his callup bell wasnt set for the frequency i was using at four oclock exactly i got through to hillcrest this time i hadnt bothered to move the radio out of hearing range was actually leaning against the tractor cabin as i spoke and every word said both by hillcrest and myself could be clearly heard but it didnt matter any more the first thing i did of course was to tell him that we had got our men even as i spoke my own voice sounded curiously flat and lifeless i should i suppose have been exultant and happy but the truth was that i had suffered too much both physically and psychologically in the past few days exhaustion lay over me like a smothering blanket the reaction from the strain of those days was beginning to set in the awareness was clearly with me that we werent out of the wood by a long way yet the lives of marie legarde and mahler were now the uppermost thoughts in my mind and to be perfectly honest i also felt curiously deflated because i had developed a considerable liking for zagero and the revelation of his true character had been more of a shock to me than i would have been prepared to admit to anyone hillcrests reactions i must admit were all that could have been wished for but when i asked him about his progress the enthusiasm vanished from his voice they were still bogged down it seemed and progress had been negligible there was no word yet of passenger lists or of what the plane had carried that had been so important the triton the aircraftcarrier had insulin aboard and would fly it up to uplavnik a landing barge was moving into uplavnik through an ice lead and was expected to arrive tomorrow and unload the tractor it was carrying which would move straight out to meet us two skiplanes and two search bombers had been looking for us but failed to locate us wed probably been traversing the vindeby nunataks at the time his voice went on and on but i hadnt heard anything hed said in the past minute or so i had just remembered something i should have remembered a long time ago wait a minute i called ive just thought of something i climbed inside the tractor cabin and shook mahler fortunately he was only asleep from the look of him an hour or two ago id have said the collapse was due any minute mr mahler i said quickly you said you worked for an oil company thats right he looked at me in surprise socony mobil oil co in new jersey as what there were a hundred things he could have been that were of no use to me research chemist why i sighed in relief and explained when id finished telling him of hillcrests solution to his troubles distilling the petrol i asked him what he thought of it its as good a way as any of committing suicide he said grimly what does he want to do send himself into orbit it only requires one weak spot in the can hes trying to heat besides the evaporation range of petrol is so wide anything from degrees centigrade to twice the temperature of boiling water that it may take him all day to get enough to fill a cigarette lighter that seems to be more or less the trouble i agreed is there nothing he can do only one thing he can do wash it what size drums does your petrol come in ten gallon tell him to pour out a couple of gallons and replace with water stir well let it stand for ten minutes and then syphon off the top seven gallons itll be as near pure petrol as makes no difference as easy as that i said incredulously i thought of hillcrests taking half an hour to distil a cupful are you sure mr mahler it should work he assured me even the strain of a minutes speaking had been too much for him his voice was already no more than a husky whisper sugar is insoluble in petrol it just dissolves in the small amounts of water present in petrol small enough to be held in suspension but if youve plenty of water itll sink to the bottom carrying the sugar with it if id the nobel science prize id give it to you right now mr mahler i rose to my feet if youve any more suggestions to make for heavens sake let me know ive one to make now he smiled but he was almost gasping for breath its going to take your friend a pretty long time to melt the snow to get all the water he needs to wash the petrol he nodded towards the tractor sled visible through the gap in the canvas screen were obviously carrying far too much fuel why dont you drop some off for captain hillcrestwhy in fact didnt you drop some off last night when you first heard of this i stared at him for a long long moment then turned heavily for the door til tell you why mr mahler i said slowly its because im the biggest damned prize idiot in this world thats why and i went out to tell hillcrest just how idiotic i was chapter ten thursday pm friday pm jackstraw corazzini and i took turns at driving the citroen all through that evening and the following night the engine was beginning to run rough the exhaust was developing a peculiar note and it was becoming increasingly difficult to engage second gear but i couldnt stop i darent stop speed was life now mahler had gone into collapse shortly after nine oclock that evening and from the collapse had gradually moved into the true diabetic coma i had done all i could all anyone could but heaven only knew it was little enough he needed bed heat fluids stimulants sugar by mouth or injection both suitable stimulants and the heat were completely lacking the lurching narrow hard wooden bunk was poor substitute for any bed despite his great thirst he had found it increasingly difficult to keep down the melted snow water and i had no means of giving an intravenous injection for the others in the cabin it was distressing to watch him distressing to listen to the dyspnoea the harsh laboured breathing of coma unless we could get the insulin in time i knew no power on earth could prevent death from supervening in from one to three days in these unfavourable conditions a day would be much more likely marie legarde too was weakening with dangerous speed it was with increasing difficulty that she could force down even the smallest mouthfuls of food and spent most of her time in restless troubled sleep having seen her on the stage and marvelled at her magnificent vitality it now seemed strange to me that she should go under so easily but her vitality had really been a manifestation of a nervous energy she had little of the physical resources necessary to cope with a situation like this and i had frequently to remind myself that she was an elderly woman not that any such reminder was needed when one saw her face it was haggard and lined and old but worried though i was about my patients jackstraw was even more deeply concerned with the weather the temperature had been steadily rising for many hours now the moaning ululation of the icecap wind which had been absent for over two days was increasing in intensity with every hour that passed and the skies above were dark and heavy with black drifting clouds of snow and when just after midnight the windspeed passed fifteen miles an hour the wind began to pick up the drift off the icecap i knew what jackstraw was afraid of though i myself had never experienced it i had heard of the katabatic winds of greenland the equivalent of the feared alaskan wllliwaws when great masses of air in the heart of the plateau were cooled as they had been in the past fortyeight hours by extremely low temperatures they were set in motion by a gradient wind and cascaded there was no other word for it downwards from the edge of the plateau through suitable drainage channels set in motion through their own sheer weight of cold air these gravity or drainage winds slowly wanned by the friction and compression of their descent could reach a hurricane force of destructive violence in which nothing could live and all the signs all the conditions for a gravity storm were there the recent extreme cold the rising wind the rising temperature the outward flowing direction of the wind the dark starobscuring clouds scudding by overhead there could be no mistaking it jackstraw declared i had never known him to be wrong about greenland weather i didnt believe him to be wrong now and when jackstraw became nervous it was time for even the most optimistic to start worrying and i was worried all right we drove the tractor to its limit and on the slight downward slope we had changed direction by this time and were heading due southwest for uplavnik we were making very good time indeed but by four oclock in the morning when we were i reckoned not more than sixty miles from uplavnik we ran into the sastrugi and were forced to slow down the sastrugi regular undulations in the frozen snow were the devil on tractors especially elderly machines like the citroen caused by raking winds symmetrical as the waves in an eighteenthcentury sailing print hard on the crest and soft in the trough they made progress possible only by slowing down to a disheartening crawl even so the citroen and the sledges behind rolled and pitched like ships in a heavy seaway the headlights one moment reaching up into the lowering darkness of the sky the next dipping to illuminate the barred white and shadowed black of the sastrugi immediately ahead sometimes it gave way to deceptively clear patches deceptively for snow had obviously fallen here recently or been carried down from the plateau and we were reduced to low gear to make any headway at all on it shortly before eight oclock in the morning jackstraw brought the citroen to a halt and as the roar of the big engine died the deep moaning of the wind a wind carrying with it a rising wall of ice and snow swept in to take its place jackstraw had drawn up broadside on to the wind and the slope of the hill and i jumped down to rig up a canvas shelter extending out from the cabin it was nothing elaborate just a triangular sheet of proofed canvas attached to the top of the cabin and the cleat of a caterpillar track on its vertical side with its apex stretched out to a spike hammered into the surface of the icecap there was no room for us all within the cabin at mealtimes i wanted some protection when we kept our am radio schedule with hillcrest and in particular it was time that zagero and levin had some relief from their sufferings they had ridden all night on the tractor sled under the guard of either jackstraw or myself and though the temperature was now only a few degrees below zero and though they were sheltering under a mound of clothing nevertheless they must have spent a miserable night breakfast such as it was was waiting and ready to be eaten as soon as the tractor had stopped but i had little appetite for it it seemed to me i had forgotten what sleep was like i had had none for almost three days i was living now in a permanent state of physical and mental exhaustion and it was becoming almost impossible to concentrate to think of the hundred and one things that had to be thought of all the time more than once i caught myself nodding and dozing off over my cup of coffee and it was only with a conscious effort of will that i forced myself to my feet to keep the radio schedule i was going to call both hillcrest and our base hillcrest had given me the frequency the previous evening i decided to call hillcrest first we got through without any difficulty although hillcrest said they could hear me only very faintly i suspected some fault on the generator side for our receiver was powered by a hundredhour battery and we could hear hillcrests voice clearly all the men except mahler were gathered round me during the transmission they seemed to find a peculiar reassurance in another voice however distant and disembodied that voice and even zagero and levin were only seven or eight feet away sitting in front of the tractor sled with their feet still bound i was on a canvas chair with my back to the canvas screen and corazzini and brewster were sitting on the tailboard the canvas curtains drawn behind them to keep the heat in the cabin the rev smallwood was behind me turning the generator handle and jackstraw a few feet away watchful as ever the cocked rifle ready in his hand receiving you loud and clear i said to hillcrest my hands were cupped round the microphone and i was holding it close to my mouth to cut out as much as possible of the background noise of the wind what progress i threw the receiver switch into the antenna and hillcrests voice came again great he sounded enthusiastic excited my congratulations to your learned friend works like a charm and were going like a bomb we are approaching the vindeby nunataks and expect to be through by this afternoon this was wonderful news with any luck he would be up with us late in the evening of that day and we would have the moral support of his company and the even more important technical resources of everything his big modern snocat could offer and jackstraw and i could get some desperately needed sleep i became aware that hillcrest was continuing his voice still charged with the same suppressed excitement the admiralty or the government or whoever it is have loosened up at last brother youre sitting on dynamite and you dont know it youve got it right there with you and you could exchange it tomorrow for a million pounds in the right place no wonder the government were so cagy no wonder they knew something fishy was going on and mounted the biggest search ever the carrier tritons going to collect it personally i threw the receiving switch for heavens sake i shouted in exasperation an exasperation i was dimly aware shared by all the others who were leaning forward to hear hillcrests voice what are you talking about what was the plane carrying over sorry its a guidedmissile mechanism of such advanced design and so topsecret that its details i gather are known only to a handful of scientists in all the united states its the only one of its kind and was being sent to britain for study under the recent agreement to share knowledge on atomic weapons and guided missiles hillcrests voice was calm now measured and sober there was a pause then he went on slowly impressively i understand the governments concerned are prepared to go any lengths any lengths to secure the recovery of this mechanism and prevent its falling into wrong hands there was another longer pause hillcrest clearly was giving me an opportunity to say something but i just didnt know what to say the magnitude of the entire thing took my breath away temporarily inhibited all thought and speech hillcrests voice was coming through again to help you identify this mechanism dr mason its camouflaged made up to look like an ebonite and metal portable radio of fairly large size with a braided leather carrying strap find that portable dr mason and youll i never heard the end of that sentence i was still sitting there dazedly wondering why the words portable radio should have triggered off such a clangorous bell in my mind can only plead my extreme physical and mental exhaustion when zagero catapulted himself off his seat on the sled knocking jackstraw staggering took one tremendous hop with his bound feet just opposite where i was sitting and hurled himself bodily towards corazzini who his face twisted in a vicious and unrecognisable mask had pushed himself off the tractor tailboard with one hand and with the other was fumbling desperately to bring something out from under his coat he saw he couldnt make it in time threw himself to one side but zagero bound though he was was like a cat on his feet and i knew that instant that instant that was too late that zagero was indeed the worldclass boxer that he claimed to be if the astonishing speed of his reflexes were not proof enough that blurring right arm of his carried with it lethal conviction corazzini was a very big man six feet two and at least two hundred pounds and he was swathed in many layers of heavy clothing but when that fist caught him with such frightening power just under the heart he staggered back against the tailboard and slid slowly to the ground unseeing eyes turned up to the first driving flakes of the newly fallen snow i had never seen a blow delivered with such power nor do i ever want to see it again for perhaps five seconds no one moved no one spoke men were held in thrall the soughing wailing moan of the wind on the icecap sounded weirdly unnaturally loud i was the first to break the silence i was still sitting on my canvas stool corazzini i said corazzini my voice was barely more than a whisper but zagero heard me sure its corazzini he said levelly it always was he stooped thrust his hand under the unconscious mans coat and brought out his gun youd better keep this doc not only do i not trust our little playmate here with toys like these but the state prosecutor or district attorney or whatever you call the guy in england will find that the riflin on this barrel matches the riflin marks on some very interestin bullets he tossed the gun across and automatically i caught it it was a pistol not an automatic and it had a strangelooking cylinder screwed on to the front of the barrel a silencer i supposed i had never seen one before nor had i ever seen that type of gun before i didnt like the look of it at all and i guessed it might be wise to have a gun in my hand when corazzini came round jackstraw i could see already had his rifle lined up on the unconscious man i placed the pistol on the ground beside me and pulled out the beretta you were ready for him i was still trying to put things in order in my own mind you were waiting for the break how do i have to draw a diagram doc there was no insolence in his voice only weariness i knew it wasnt me i knew it wasnt solly so it had to be corazzini yes i see it had to be corazzini the words were automatic meaningless my thoughts were in a state of utter confusion as confused no doubt as those of corazzini who was now pushing himself groggily into a sitting position but for the past fifteen seconds another bell had been ringing far back in my mind not so loud as the first but even more desperately insistent and all at once i had it and began to rise to my feet but there were two of them two of them corazzini had an accomplice that was as far as i got when some metal object smashed across my wrist with brutal force sending my beretta flying and something small and hard ground viciously into the back of my neck dont move dr mason the voice flat controlled but alive with a vibrant power that i had never heard before was almost unrecognisable as the rev joseph smallwoods nobody is to move nielsen drop that rifle now just one suspicious move and dr mason gets his head blown off i stood stockstill the man behind that voice meant every word he said i didnt need any convincing of that the cold certainty in his voice only reinforced the knowledge i already had that the sanctity of human life was a factor which could never enter into this mans considerations all right corazzini smallwood was speaking again his voice empty of all concern for and interest in his accomplice his only anxiety if one could by any stretch of imagination call it that lay in his desire for corazzinis effectively continued cooperation all right corazzini said softly he was standing now and that both mind and reactions were back to normal was evident from the dexterity with which he caught the gun smallwood threw back to him never thought any man could move so fast with his feet tied but he wont catch me again everybody out eh everybody out smallwood nodded no question he was the leader of the two ridiculously improbable though that would have seemed only two minutes ago but it didnt seem improbable any longer it seemed inevitable jump down all of you corazzini ordered gun in one hand he held back a flap of canvas screen with the other hurry it up mahler cant jump down i protested he cant move hes in coma he shut up corazzini interrupted all right zagero inside and get him out you cant move him i shouted furiously youll kill him if my last word was choked off in a grunt of pain as smallwoods gun barrel caught me viciously across the side of the head i fell to my hands and knees in the snow and remained there for several seconds head down and shaking it from side to side as i tried to overcome the dizziness and the pain corazzini said shut up you must learn to listen smallwoods voice was chillingly devoid of all emphasis and inflection he stood waiting quietly until the last of the passengers had descended or been carried from the tractor cabin then waved us all into a straight line facing towards corazzini and himself both of them had their backs to the canvas screen while we were placed just far enough clear of the shelter to be blinded by the increasingly heavy snowfall that swirled down into our eyes but not so far off as not to be clearly seen by them whatever these two did i was beginning to discover betrayed that economy of movement and unquestioning sureness of the complete professionals who had long ago worked out the answers to and counters against any of a vast range and permutation of situations they were ever likely to encounter smallwood beckoned me you havent finished your radio call dr mason finish it your friend hillcrest must be wondering at the delay the gun in his hand came forward a fraction of an inch just enough for the movement to be perceptible tor your own sake do nothing to arouse his suspicions dont be clever keep it brief i kept it brief i excused the interruption of transmission on the grounds that mahler had taken a sudden turn for the worse as indeed i thought bitterly he had said that id guard the missile mechanism with my life and apologised for cutting the call short but said it was essential to get mahler to uplavnik with all speed finish it off smallwood said softly in my ear i nodded thats the lot then captain hillcrest will make the noon schedule this is mayday signing off mayday mayday i switched off and turned indifferently away i had taken only one step when smallwood caught my shoulder and whirled me round for such an apparently slight man he was phenomenally strong i gasped as his pistol barrel dug into my stomach mayday dr mason he asked silkily what is mayday our callsign of course i said irritably your callsign is gfk our callup is gfk our signingoff is mayday youre lying i wondered how i could ever have thought this face meek and nervous and colourless the mouth was a thin hard line the upper eyelids barstraight and hooded above the unwinking eyes flat marbled eyes of a faded lightblue a killers eyes youre lying he repeated im not lying i said angrily count five and die his eyes never left mine the pressure of the gun increased one two three ill tell you what it is the cry came from margaret ross mayday is the international air distress signal the sos i had to tell him dr mason i had to her voice was a shaking sob he was going to kill you i was indeed smallwood agreed if he felt either anger or apprehension no trace of either appeared in the calm conversational voice i should do it now youve lost us four hours head start but courage happens to be one of the few virtues i admire you are an extremely brave man dr mason your courage is a fair match for your ah lack of perspicacity shall we say youll never get off the icecap small wood i said steadily scores of ships and planes are searching for you thousands of men theyll get you and theyll hang you for these five dead men we shall see he gave a wintry smile and now that he had removed his rimless glasses i could see that the mans smile left his eyes untouched left them flat and empty and lifeless like the stained glass in a church and no sun behind it all right corazzini the box dr mason bring one of the maps from the drivers seat in a moment perhaps you would care to explain explanations are for children the voice was level curt devoid of all inflection im in a hurry dr mason bring the map i brought it and when i returned corazzini was sitting on the front of the tractor sled with a case before him but it wasnt the leathercovered portable radio it was smallwoods robe case corazzini snapped open the catches pulled out bible robes and divinity hood tossed them to one side then carefully brought out a metal box which looked exactly like a taperecorder indeed when he shone his torch on it i could clearly see the word grundig but it soon became apparent that it was like no taperecorder that i had ever seen the twin spools he ripped off the top of the machine and sent spinning away into the darkness and the snow the tape unwinding in a long convoluted streamer by this time i would have taken long odds that anyone suspicious enough to investigate would have found that tape perfectly genuine probably i thought bitterly bachs organ music in keeping with smallwoods late ecclesiastical nature still in silence we watched corazzini undo and fling away the false top of the recorder but not before i had time to notice the padded spring clips on its underside the perfect hiding place for a couple of automatics revealed now were controls and calibrated dials that bore no resemblance to those of a taperecorder corazzini straightened and erected a hinged telescopic aerial clamped a set of headphones to his ears made two switches and started to turn a dial at the same time watching a green magic eye similar to those found in taperecorders and many modern radios faintly but unmistakably i could hear a steady whine coming from the earphones a whine which altered in pitch and intensity as corazzini turned the dial when it reached its maximum strength he turned his attention to a builtin alcohol compass about three inches in diameter a few moments later he doffed the earphones and turned round apparently satisfied very strong very clear he announced to small wood but theres too heavy a deviation factor from all the metal in the tractor and sledge back in two minutes your torch dr mason he walked away for about fifty yards taking the machine with him it was with intense chagrin that i realised that it was perfectly in keeping with all that had gone before that corazzini had probably forgotten more about navigation than i was ever likely to know he returned soon consulted a small chart correcting for variation no doubt then grinned at small wood its them all right perfect signal bearing good if smallwood felt relieved or gratified at the news no shadow of his feeling touched the thin immobile face their quiet certainty their forethought their foolproof organisation was dismaying frightening now that i could see what manner of men they were it was unthinkable that they should have set themselves down in a vast featureless country such as this without some means of orientating themselves what we had just seen in operation could only be a battery operated radio direction finder and even to me inexperienced though i was in such matters it was obvious that corazzini must have been taking a bearing on some continuous directional lineup signals transmitted by a vessel or vessels offshore trawlers probably or some other inconspicuous type of fishing vessel i would have been less than human had i not wanted to shake this absolute confidence youve miscalculated the hornets nest youve stirred up the davis strait the coast of greenland is alive with ships and planes the scout planes of the carrier triton will pick up every boat thats larger than a skiff the trawlers will never get away with it they wont get five miles they dont have to implicit in corazzinis words was confirmation of the accuracy of my guess about trawlers there are such things as submarines in fact there is one not far from here you still wont be quiet smallwood said coldly he turned to corazzini two hundred and sixtyeight eh due west more or less distance corazzini shrugged said nothing smallwood beckoned to me well soon find it that map dr mason indicate our position accurately you can go to hell i said briefly i expected nothing else however im not blind and your clumsy attempts at concealment have done little to hide the growing attachment between yourself and the young lady here i glanced quickly at margaret saw the faint colour beginning to stain the pale cheek and looked as quickly away i am prepared to shoot miss ross i never doubted him i knew hed do it in an instant i gave him our position he asked for another map asked jackstraw to mark our position on the second and compared the two they coincide he nodded fortunately for you he studied the map briefly then looked at corazzini the kangalak fjord undoubtedly at the foot of the kangalak glacier approximately the kangalak fjord i interrupted my voice was bitter why the hell didnt you land there in the first place and save us all this the plane captain deserved to die smallwood said obliquely his smile was wintry i had instructed him to put down on the coast just north of the fjord where our ah friends had reconnoitred a section of the icecap three miles long and absolutely flat that is the equal of the finest runway in europe or america and it wasnt until i saw the altimeter reading just before the crash that i realised he had deceived me he made an impatient gesture and turned to corazzini we waste time approximately sixty miles you would say corazzini examined the map yes about that so come then on our way leaving us here to starve and die of cold i suppose i said bitterly what becomes of you no longer concerns me smallwood said indifferently already in a matter of minutes it had become almost impossible to think of him to remember him as the meek retiring minister we had known it is possible however that you might be foolish enough to take advantage of the cover of snow and darkness to run after us waylay and try to overcome us you might even succeed even though unarmed we must immobilise you temporarily or permanently zagero said softly only fools kill wantonly and unnecessarily fortunately for you it is not necessary for my plans that you die corazzini bring some rope from the sled theres plenty of cord there tie their feet only with their numbed hands it will take them an hour to undo their bonds we will be well on our way by then he moved his gun gently from side to side sit in the snow all of you there was nothing for it but to do as we were told we sat down and watched corazzini bring a hank of cord from the sled he looked at smallwood and smallwood nodded at me dr mason first corazzini gave his gun to smallwood they missed nothing that pair not even the remote possibility that one of us might try to snatch corazzinis gun and advanced on me he knelt and had taken a couple of turns round my ankles when the truth struck me with the suddenness the shocking impact of a physical blow i sent corazzini staggering with a violent shove and leapt to my feet no my voice was hoarse savage by god youre not going to tie me up smallwood sit down mason his voice was hard whiplike and the light from the tractor cabin was enough for me to see the rocklike pistol barrel centred between my eyes i ignored it completely jackstraw i shouted zagero levin brewster on your feet if you want to live hes only got one gun if he starts firing at any of us the rest go for him and get him he cant possibly get us all margaret helene mrs dansbygreggfirst shot thats fired run off into the darkness and stay there have you gone crackers doc the words came from an astonished zagero but for all that something namelessly urgent and compelling in my voice had got him to his feet and he was bent forward crouched like a great cat ready to launch himself at smallwood want to get us all killed thats just what i dont want i could feel my spine the back of my neck cold with a cold that was not of the arctic and my legs were trembling going to tie us up and leave us here is he hell why do you think he told us of the trawler its position the submarine and all the rest of it ill tell you why because he knew it was safe because hed made up his mind that none of us would ever live to tell of these things i was rattling the words out with machinegun rapidity desperate with the need to convince the others of what i was saying before it was too late and my eyes never left the gun in smallwoods hand but no buts i interrupted harshly smallwood knows that hillcrest will be coming through here this afternoon if were still here and alive first thing wed tell him would be smallwoods course speed approximate position and destination within an hour the kangalak glacier would be sealed within an hour bombers from the triton would have blasted him off the face of the glacier tie us up sure and then he and corazzini would shoot us at their leisure while we flopped around like birds with broken wings conviction was immediate and complete i couldnt see the faces of the others but the fractional lowering of smallwoods gun was enough to tell me i underestimated you dr mason he admitted softly his voice was devoid of all trace of anger but you almost died there whats five minutes more or less i asked and smallwood nodded absently he was already working out an alternative solution you you inhuman monster senator brewsters voice was shaking with fear or anger or both you were going to tie us up and butcher us like like words failed him for a moment then he whispered you must be mad smallwood stark raving mad hes not in the slightest zagero said quietly not mad just bad but its kind of hard to tell the difference at times figured out our next jolly little scheme smallwood yes as dr mason says we cant possibly dispose of all of you inside a couple of seconds which is all the time it would take for one probably more of you to reach the cover of the snow and darkness he nodded towards the tractor sled lifted his high collar against the snow and biting wind i think you had better ride a little way with us and ride with them we did for the thirty longest miles i have ever driven for nine hours that had no end a relatively short distance but this eternity of time to cover it partly because of the sastrugi partly because of the increasingly long stretches of soft snow but mainly because of the weather which was deteriorating rapidly the wind had now risen to something better than thirty miles an hour it carried with it a blinding wall of flying icefilled drift and even though it was directly behind us it made things troublesome for the driver for all the others except smallwood it made the conditions intolerable had the temperature been what it was only twentyfour hours previously none of us i am sure would have survived that trip i would have thought that with either smallwood or corazzini driving and the other navigating from the dogsled we would have had a chance slender though it might be to overpower them or at least make good our escape but smallwood never offered even a shadow of a chance of either corazzini drove all the time with the radio direction finder headphones clamped to his ears so that compass navigation became an inaccurate superfluity smallwood sat alone in the back of the tractor cabin his gun unwaveringly trained on the rest of us who were crammed aboard the big tractor sled ten feet to the rear of him when the snow eventually became too heavy he stopped the tractor detached the portable searchlight and mounted it facing aft in the rear of the tractor cabin this had the double advantage of illuminating us so that he could clearly see us even through the drift and making certain that none of us tried to drop off the sled and of blinding us so that we were quite unable to see what he was doing even to see whether he was watching us at all it was frustrating maddening and for good measure and to prevent any desperate attempt at escape in the occasionally blinding flurries of snow he brought margaret and helene up into the cabin and bound their hands they were the surety for our good conduct that left eight of us on the tractor sled theodore mahler and marie legarde stretched out in the middle three of us sitting on each side almost immediately after we had moved off and pulled a pair of tarpaulins over ourselves for what meagre shelter they could afford jackstraw leaned across and tapped me on the shoulder with something held in his hand i reached up and took it from him corazzinis wallet he said softly for all the chance of his being overheard by either smallwood or corazzini above the roar of the engine and the voice of the gale he could have shouted out the words fell from his pocket when zagero knocked him down he didnt see it go but i did sat on top of it while smallwood told us to squat in the snow i stripped off my gloves opened the wallet and examined its contents in the light of the torch jackstraw had also passed across a torch with the beam carefully hooded and screened to prevent the slightest chink of light escaping from under the tarpaulin at this time smallwood had not yet switched on the searchlight the wallet provided us with that last proof of the thoroughness the meticulous care with which these two men had provided themselves with false but utterly convincing identities i knew that whatever corazzinis name was it wasnt the one he had given himself but had i not known the nc stamped on the handtooled morocco the visiting cards with the inscribed nicholas corazzini above the name and address of the indiana head office of the global tractor company and the leatherbacked fold of american express cheques each one already signed n r corazzini in its top lefthand corner would have carried complete conviction and too late the wallet also presented us obliquely but beyond all doubt with the reason for many things ranging from the purpose of the crashlanding of the plane to the explanation of why i had been knocked on the head the night before last inside the billfold compartment was the newspaper cutting which i had first found on the dead body of colonel harrison i read it aloud slowly with infinite chagrin the account was brief that it concerned that dreadful disaster in elizabeth new jersey where a commuters train had plunged through an opened span of the bridge into the waters of newark bay drowning dozens of the passengers aboard i already knew from the quick glance i had had at the cutting in the plane but as i had also gathered in the plane this was a followup story and the reporter wasted little time on the appalling details his interest lay in another direction entirely it was reliably reported he said that the train had been carrying an army courier that he was one of the forty who had died and that he had been carrying a supersecret guided missile mechanism that was all the cutting said but it was enough and more than enough it didnt say whether the mechanism had been lost or not it most certainly never even suggested that there was any connection between the presence of the mechanism aboard the train and the reasons for the crash it didnt have to the cheekbyjowl contiguity of the two items made the readers own horrifying conclusions inevitable from the silence that stretched out after i had read out the last words i knew that the others were lost in the same staggering speculations as myself it was jackstraw who finally broke this silence his voice abnormally matteroffact well we know now why you were knocked on the head knocked on the head zagero took him up what do you night before last i interrupted when i told you id walked into a lamppost i told them all about the finding of the cutting and its subsequent loss would it have made all that difference even if you had read it zagero asked i mean of course it would my voice was harsh savage almost but the savagery was directed against myself my own stupidity the fact of finding a cutting about a fatal crash which occurred in strange unexplained circumstances on the person of a man who had just died in a fatal crash in equally strange and unexplained circumstances would have made even me suspicious when i heard from hillcrest that something highly secret was being carried aboard the plane the parallel would have been even more glaringly obvious especially as the cutting was found on the man an army officer who was almost certainly the courier the carrier of this secret anything larger than a matchbox in the luggage the passengers were carrying id have ripped open and examined radio and taperecorder included smallwood knew it he didnt know what was in the cutting but he or corazzini knew it was a cutting and they were taking no chances at all you werent to know this levin said soothingly its not your fault of course its my fault i said wearily all my fault i dont even know how to start apologising you first zagero i suppose you and solly levin for tying you forget it zagero was curt but friendly were just as bad all of us all the facts that mattered were as available to us as they were to you and we made no better use of them less if anything in the tiny glow from the torch i could see him shaking his head lordy lordy but aint it easy to understand everything when its too late easy enough to understand now why we crashed in the middle of nowhere the plane captain must have been in on it he must have known that the mechanism was aboard and thought it important enough to put the passengers lives second and crashland in the middle of the iceplateau where smallwood could never reach the coast not knowing that i was there waiting to oblige smallwood i said bitterly i shook my head in turn its obvious now all too obvious how corazzini damaged his hand in the shack not by saving or trying to save the radio but by accelerating its fall after hed pushed the hinges in how and why he lost the toss and had to sleep on the floor to give him a chance to smother the second officer what you might call a good loser zagero said grimly then he gave a short laugh remember when we buried the second officer i wonder what smallwoods burial service would have sounded like if wed really been close enough to hear i missed that i nodded i missed the suggestion you made inside the plane that we should bury the murdered men if you had been guilty youd never have dared make that suggestion for then the way these men died would almost certainly have been discovered you missed it zagero said feelingly how about me said it and i never even thought of it till now he snorted boy am i disgusted with myself as far as i can see the only thing i knew that you didnt was that corazzini clouted our friend smallwood back in the pass there simply in order to throw suspicion on me but then i knew that even trying to tell you that would have been crazy there was a long moments silence while we listened to the rise and fall of the citroens exhaust note in the gusting strengthening wind then solly levin spoke the plane he said the fire how come there was enough highoctane fuel in its tanks to take hillcrests snocat a couple of thousand miles i explained if hillcrests tanks had been empty when he arrived back at base and if hed found out right away that the spare fuel in the tunnel had been doctored well it wouldnt have taken him long to siphon out the stuff in the plane so no plane the silence this time was even longer then zagero cleared his throat as if uncertain how to begin seeing explanations are in the air well i guess its time we made one too zagero to my astonishment sounded almost embarrassed its about the phony conduct of that phony character to your left doc one solly levin wed plenty of time to talk about it when we were lashed to this damned sledge all of last night and come to the point i interrupted impatiently sorry he leaned across to solly levin want i should make a formal introduction pop i stared at him in the darkness did i hear sure you did doc he laughed softly top the old man the paternal parent says so on my birth certificate and everything he was enjoying himself vastly confirmation on the right here its perfectly true dr mason solly levin smiled the dreadful bowery accent was quite gone yielding place to a crisper more decisive version of zageros cultured drawl til put it briefly im the owner and managing director or was till i retired a year ago of a plastics factory in trenton new jersey near princeton where johnny managed to acquire a splendid accent and very little else it was not i might add princetons fault johnny spent most of his time in the gymnasium nursing his ah pugilistic ambitions much to my annoyance as i wanted him to take over from me alas zagero put in i was almost as stubborn as he is himself a great deal more so his father said so i made him a proposition id give him two years it seemed enough he was already amateur heavyweight champion to prove himself and at the end of that time if he hadnt made it he was to take his place in the factory his first manager was as corrupt as they come and johnny literally kicked him out at the end of a year so i took over id newly retired id time on my hands id a very strong vested interest in his wellbeing apart from the fact that he was my son and quite frankly id begun to see that he really was going to get to the very top he broke off there so i took the opportunity to interrupt zagero or levin which is it zagero the elder man answered why the levin some state and national boxing commissions refuse to permit a close relative to be either manager or second especially second so i used an alias a practice by no means uncommon and officially winked at a harmless deception not so harmless i said grimly it was one of the worst acting performances ive ever seen and that was one of the primary reasons for my suspecting your son and in turn for corazzini and smallwood getting away with what they did had you come clean earlier on i would have known that they were bound even in the absence of all possible evidence to be the guilty men but with solly levin ill find it very difficult to think of you as mr zagero im afraid with solly levin sticking out like a sore thumb as an obvious phony well i just couldnt leave you two out of the list of suspects i obviously modelled myself on the wrong person or type of person levin said wryly johnny ribbed me about it all the time im deeply sorry for any trouble we may have caused or mason i honestly never looked at it from your point of view never realised the dangers involved in maintaining the impersonation if you could call it that please forgive me nothing to forgive i said bitterly a hundred to one id have found some other way of messing things up shortly after five oclock in the evening corazzini stopped the tractor but he didnt stop the engine he came down from the drivers seat and walked round to the cabin pushing the searchlight slightly to one side he had to shout to make himself heard above the roar of the tractor and the high ululating whine of the stillstrengthening blizzard halfway boss thirtytwo miles on the clock thank you we couldnt see smallwood but we could see the tip of his gun barrel protruding menacingly into the searchlights beam the end of the line dr mason you and your friends will please get down there was nothing else for it stiffly numbly i climbed down took a couple of steps towards smallwood stopped as the pistol steadied unwaveringly on my chest youll be with your friends in a few hours i told smallwood you could leave us a little food a portable stove and tent is that too much to ask it is nothing nothing at all youre wasting your time dr mason and it grieves me to see you reduced to begging the dog sledge then we dont even want the dogs but neither mahler nor miss legarde can walk youre wasting your time he turned his attention to the sledge everybody off i said did you hear me levin get down its my legs in the harsh glare of the searchlight we could see the lines of pain deepetched round levins eyes and mouth and i wondered how long he had been sitting there suffering saying nothing i think theyre frozen or sleeping or something get down smallwood repeated sharply in a moment levin swung one of his legs over the edge of the sledge his teeth bared with the effort i dont seem to be able maybe a bullet in one of your legs will help smallwood said unemotionally to get the feeling back i didnt know whether he meant it or not i didnt think so gratuitous violence wasnt in character for this man i couldnt see him killing or wounding without sound reason but zagero thought differently he advanced within six feet of smallwood dont touch him smallwood he said warningly no the rising inflection was a challenge accepted and smallwood went on flatly id snuff you and him like a candle no zagero said softly and savagely the words carrying clearly in a sudden lull in the wind lay a finger on my old man smallwood and ill get you and break your neck like a rotten carrot if you empty the entire magazine into me i looked at him as he crouched there like a great cat toes digging into the frozen snow fists clenched and slightly in advance of him ready for the explosive leap that would take him across that tiny space in a split second of time and i believed he could do exactly what he said so too i suspected did smallwood your old man he inquired your father zagero nodded good smallwood showed no surprise into the tractor cabin with him zagero well exchange him for the german girl nobody cares about her his point was clear i couldnt see how we could offer any danger to smallwood and corazzini now but smallwood was a nan who guarded even against impossibilities levin would be a far better surety for zageros conduct than helene levin halfwalked was halfcarried into the tractor cabin with corazzini and smallwood both armed resistance was hopeless smallwood had us summed up to a nicety he knew we were desperate men that we would fling ourselves on him and his gun a moment of desperate emergency but he also knew that we werent so desperate as to commit suicide when no lives were in mediate danger when levin was inside smallwood turned to the young german girl seated opposite him in the cabin out it was then that it happened with the stunning speed and inevitability that violent tragedy viewed in retrospect always seems to possess i thought perhaps that it was some calculated plan a lastminute desperate effort to save us that made helene fleming act as she did but i found out later that she had merely been driven and goaded into a painfilled unreasoning anger and resentment and despair by the agony she had suffered in her shoulder from having had her arms bound for so many long hours in the cruel jolting discomfort of the tractor cabin as she passed by smallwood she stumbled he put up an arm either to help her or ward her off and before he had realised what was happening it must have been the last quarter from which he expected any show of violence or resistance she kicked out blindly and knocked the gun spinning out of his hand to land in the snow beneath smallwood sprang after it like a cat the speed was unnecessary the low growl of warning from an armed corazzini put paid to any ideas we might have had of taking advantage of the situation picked up the gun and whirled round the gun lining up on helene his eyes narrowed to slits against the beam of the searchlight his face twisted into an unrecognisable snarl the lips drawn far back over the teeth id been wrong once more about smallwood he could kill without reason helene mrs dansbygregg was the nearest to her and her voice was highpitched almost a scream look out helene she plunged forward to push her maid to one side but i dont think smallwood even saw her he was mad with fury i knew he was and nothing on earth was going to stop him from pressing that trigger the bullet caught mrs dansbygregg squarely in the back and pitched her headlong to fall face down in the frozen snow already smallwoods moment of uncontrollable rage was spent as if it had never been he said not another word just nodded to corazzini and jumped up on to the tail of the tractor cabin to keep us covered with searchlight and gun as corazzini gunned the motor engaged gear and lumbered off into the darkness to the west we stood in a forlorn huddled little group and watched the train pass us by the tractor the tractor sled the dog sledge and finally the huskies themselves running on the loose traces astern i heard helene murmur something to herself and when i bent to listen she was saying in a strange wondering voice helene she called me helene i stared at her as if she were mad glanced down at the dead woman at my feet then gazed unseeingly after the receding lights of the citroen until both the lights and the sound had faded and vanished into the snowfilled darkness of the night chapter eleven friday pm saturday pm the white hell of that night the agony of the bitter dreadful hours that followed and god only knows how many hours these were is a memory that will never die how many hours did we stagger and lurch after that tractor like drunk or dying men six hours eight ten we didnt know we shall never know time as an independent system of measurement ceased to exist each second was an interminable unit of suffering of freezing of exhausted marching each minute an son where the fire in our aching leg muscles fought with the icecold misery of hands and feet and faces for domination in our minds each hour an eternity which we knew could never end not one of us i am sure expected to live through that night the thoughts the emotions of these hours i could never afterwards recall chagrin there was the most bitter i have ever known an overwhelming mortification and selfcondemnation that i had all along been deceived with such childish ease that i had been powerless to offer any hindrance or resistance to the endless resourcefulness of that brilliant little man and then i would think of mrs dansbygregg and of margaret bound and hostage and afraid and looking at smallwood in the dim light of that lurching tractor cabin looking at smallwood and the gun in smallwoods hand and with that thought anger would flood in to supplant the chagrin a consuming hatred and a fury that flamed throughout my entire being but even that anger wasnt all exclusive it couldnt be not so long as fear a fear such as i had never before known was the dominating factor in my mind and it was it was too i should think in zageros mind he hadnt spoken a word since mrs dansbygregg had died had just flung himself uncaringly ruthlessly into what had to be done head bowed he plodded on like an automaton i wondered how many times he must have regretted that impetuous slip of the tongue when he had betrayed to smallwood the fact that solly levin was his father and jackstraw was as silent as we were noncommittal speaking only when he had to keeping his thoughts strictly to himself i wondered if he was blaming me for what had happened but i didnt think so jackstraws mind just didnt work that way i could guess what he was thinking i knew the explosive temper that slumbered under that placid exterior had we met an unarmed smallwood and corazzini then i do not think we would have stopped short of killing him with our hands i suppose too that we were all three of us exhausted as we had never been before frostbitten bleeding thirsty and steadily weakening from lack of food i say suppose because logic and reason tell me that these things must have been so but if they were i do not think they touched the minds of any of us that night we were no longer ourselves we were outside ourselves our bodies were but machines to serve the demands of our minds and our minds so consumed with anxiety and anger that there was no place left for any further thought we were following the tractor we could i suppose have turned back in the hope of stumbling across hillcrest and his men i knew hillcrest well enough to know that he would know that those who had taken over our tractor he had no means of knowing who they were for all he knew zagero might have suddenly overpowered us would never dare make for uplavnik but would almost certainly head for the coast the likelihood was that hillcrest too would head for the kangalak fjord together with a small bay beside it the kangalak fjord was the only break the only likely rendezvous in a hundred miles of cliffbound coast and he could go there arrowstraight on board his snocat he had a test prototype of a new compact and as yet unmarketed arma gyroscope specially designed for land use which had proved to have such astonishing accuracy that navigation on the icecap as a problem had ceased to exist for him but even should he be heading towards the coast our chances of meeting him in that blizzard did not exist and if we once passed them by we would have been lost for ever better by far to head for the coast where some patrolling ship or plane might just possibly pick us up if we ever got there besides i knew that both jackstraw and zagero felt exactly as i did under a pointless but overpowering compulsion to follow smallwood and corazzini untilwe dropped in our tracks and the truth was that we couldnt have gone any other way even had we wished to when smallwood had dropped us off we had been fairly into the steadily deepening depression in the icecap that wound down to the kangalak glacier and it was a perfect drainage channel for the katabatic wind that was pouring down off the plateau although powerful enough already when we had been abandoned that wind was now blowing with the force of a full gale and for the first time on the greenland iceplateau although we were now admittedly down to a level of feet heard a wind where the deep ululating moaning was completely absent it howled instead howled and shrieked like a hurricane in the upper works and rigging of a ship and it carried with it a numbing bruising flying wall of snow and ice against which progress would have been utterly impossible so we went the only way we could with the lash of the storm ever on our bent and aching backs and ache our backs did only three people zagero jackstraw and myself were able to carry anything more than their own weight and we had among us three people completely unable to walk mahler was still unconscious still in coma but i didnt think we would have him with us very much longer zagero carried him for hour after endless hour through that white nightmare and for his selfsacrifice he paid the cruellest price of all for when some hours later i examined the frozen useless appendages that had once been his hands i knew that johnny zagero would never step into a boxing ring again marie legarde had lost consciousness too and as i staggered along with her in my arms i felt it to be no more than a wasted token gesture without shelter and shelter soon she would never see this night out helene too had collapsed within an hour of the tractors disappearance her slender strength had just given out and jackstraw had her over his shoulder how all three of us exhausted starved numbed almost to death as we were managed to carry them for so long even though with so many halts is beyond my understanding but zagero had his strength jackstraw his superb fitness and i still the sense of responsibility that carried me on long hours after my legs and arms had given out behind us senator brewster blundered along in a blind world all of his own stumbling often falling occasionally but always pushing himself up and staggering gamely on and in those few hours hoffman brewster for me ceased to be a senator and became again my earliest conception of the old dixie colonel not the proud rather overbearing aristocrat but the embodiment of a bygone southern chivalry when courtesy and a splendid gallantry in the greatest perils and hardships were so routine as to excite no comment time and time again during thatbitter night be insisted forcibly insisted on relieving one of the three of us of our burdens and would stagger along under the load until he reached the point of collapse despite his age he was a powerful man but he had no longer the heart and the lungs and the circulation to match his muscles and his distress as the night wore on became pitiful to see the bloodshot eyes were almost closed in exhaustion his face deepetched in grey suffering and his breath coming in painful whooping gasps that reached me clearly even above the thin high shriek of the wind no doubt but that small wood and corazzini had left us to die but they had made one mistake they had forgotten balto balto as always had been running loose when they had left us and they had either failed to see him or forgotten all about him but balto hadnt forgotten us he must have known something was far wrong for all the hours we had been prisoners on the tractor sled he had never come within a quartermile of us but as soon as the tractor had dumped and left us he had come loping in out of the driving snow and settled to the task of leading us down towards the glacier at least we hoped he was doing that jackstraw declared that he was following the crimp marks of the citroens caterpillars now deep buried under the flying drift and newfallen snow zagero wasnt so sure once twice a dozen times that night i heard him muttering the same words i hope to hell that hound knows where its goinv but balto knew where he was going sometime during the night it might have been any time between midnight and three oclock in the morning he stopped suddenly stretched out his neck and gave his long eerie wolf call he seemed to listen for an answer and if he heard anything it was beyond our range but he seemed satisfied for he suddenly changed direction and angled off to the left into the blizzard at jackstraws nod we followed three minutes later we came upon the dogsledge with two of the dogs curled up beside it their backs to the wind their muzzles to their bellies and long brushes of tails over their faces the drift wailing high around them they were comfortable enough so splendid an insulation does a huskys thick coat provide that snow at forty degrees below zero will lie on its back indefinitely without being melted by body heat but they preferred freedom to comfort for they were on their feet and vanished into the swirling whiteness beyond before we could lay hands on them that left only the sledge i suppose that after smallwood had gone far enough to consider that we would never be able to reach that point he had cut loose dogs and dogsledge as a needless encumbrance but not before he had severed all the traces attaching the dogs to the sledge and i noticed grimly removed all the wraps and the magnetic compass that had been there he thought of everything for a moment admiration for the mans undoubtedly remarkable qualities came in to supplant what had become the motivating reason for my existence a reason that as the hours crawled by were crowding out even the feelings i had for margaret ross my hatred for small wood burned like a cold steady flame an obsession with the idea of sinking my fingers into that scrawny throat and never jetting go within three minutes of finding the sledge we had tied together the severed remnants of the traces changed them to the front and were on our way again marie legarde mahler and helene propped up on the thin wooden slats we had of course to pull the sledge ourselves but that was nothing for jackstraw zagero and myself the relief was beyond measure but it was only momentary we were running on to the smooth slick ice of the kangalak glacier but our progress was no faster than it had been before we found the sledge the wind was climbing up to its maximum now the blizzard shrieking along horizontally to the ground and coming in great smoking flurries that cut visibility to zero and made us stop and grab one another lest one of us be knocked flying and for ever lost to sight several times theodore mahler restless in unconsciousness rolled off the sledge until i at last made brewster sit at the back and watch he protested violently but he was glad to do as i said i dont remember much after that i think i must have been unconscious eyes shut but still plodding along in my sleep on leaden frozen feet my first conscious memory after installing brewster on the back of the sledge was of someone shaking me urgently by the shoulder it was jackstraw no more he shouted in my ear we must stop dr mason wait till its blown itself out we cant live through this i said something that was unintelligible even to myself but jackstraw took it for agreement and began pulling the sledge into the sloping side of the glacier valley and to the leeward side of one of the snowdrifts piled up against some of the ridges on the side of the valley it wasnt all that much of an improvement but the wind and the effect of the blizzard were perceptibly less we unloaded the three sick people on the sledge into what pitiful shelter the ridge offered i was just about to let my knees buckle and collapse beside them when i realised that someone was missing it was a fair indication of the toll taken by wind and cold and exhaustion that almost twenty seconds passed before i realised it was brewster good god i cried in jackstraws ear the senator weve lost him ill go back and look i wont be a minute stay here the grip on my arm was promise enough that jackstraw meant to detain me by force if necessary youd never come back balto balto he shouted a few eskimo words which meant nothing to me but the big siberian seemed to understand for he was gone in a moment following the direction of jackstraws pointing hand he was back again inside two minutes hes found him i asked jackstraw jackstraw nodded silently lets bring him in balto led us there but we didnt bring him in instead we left him lying where we found him face down in the snow dead the blizzard was already drawing its concealing shroud over him in an hour he would be no more than a featureless white mound in a featureless white valley my hands were too numb to examine him but i wouldnt have bothered anyway the halfcentury of selfindulgence in food and drink and temper all of which had been so clearly reflected in the heavy florid face when first id seen him had had their inevitable way the heart cerebral thrombosis it didnt matter now but he had been a man how long we lay there the six of us and balto huddled close together for warmth unconscious or dozing while that hurricane of a blizzard reached then passed its howling crescendo i never knew probably only half an hour perhaps not even that when i awoke stiff and numbed i reached for jackstraws torch it was exactly four oclock in the morning i looked at the others jackstraw was wide awake was pretty sure hed never shut an eye lest one of us slip away from sleep into that easy frozen sleep from which there would have been no wakening and zagero was stirring that they and i would survive i didnt doubt helene was a question mark a seventeenyearold though short on endurance was usually high on resilience and recuperative powers but helenes seemed to have deserted her after the death of her mistress and up to the time she had collapsed she had become strangely withdrawn and unresponsive and i guessed that the death of mrs dansbygregg had hit her far more than any of us would have guessed the previous fortyeight hours apart it seemed to me that she had had little enough to thank mrs dansbygregg for in the way of affection and warmth but then she was young mrs dansbygregg had been the person she had known best and as a foreigner she must have regarded mrs dansbygregg as her sole anchor in an alien sea i asked jackstraw if he would massage her hands then turned to have a look at mahler and marie legarde they dont look so hot to me zagero too was studying them whats their chances doc i just dont know i said wearily i dont know at all dont take it to heart doc its no fault of yours zagero waved a hand towards the snowfilled emptiness and desolation of the glacier your dispensary aint all that well stocked no i smiled faintly then nodded at mahler bend down and listen to his breathing the ends coming pretty close ordinarily id say a couple of hours with mahler i dont know hes got the will to livesheer gutshis beliefsthe lot but in twelve hours hell be dead and how long do you give me dr mason i twisted round and gazed down at marie legarde her voice was no more than a weak husky whisper she was trying to smile but the smile was a pitiful grimace and there was no humour in either the eyes or the voice good lord youve come to i reached out pulled off her gloves and started to massage the frozen wasted hands this is wonderful how do you feel miss legarde how do you think i feel she said with a flash of her old spirit dont try to put me off peter how long about another thousand curtain calls at the old adelphi the light came from the torch that had been thrust butt down into the snow and i bent forward so that my face was shadowed my expression unreadable seriously the fact that youve recovered consciousness is a good sign i once played a queen who recovered consciousness only to speak a few dramatic words before she died only i cant think of any dramatic words i had to strain to catch the feeble whispered words youre a shocking liar peter is there any hope for us at all certainly i lied anything to get away from that topic well be on the coast with a good chance of being picked up by ship or plane tomorrow afternoon this afternoon rather it cant be more than twenty miles from here twenty miles zagero interjected in this little lot he raised a cupped hand significantly to his ear a gesture superbly superfluous in the ululating shriek of the blizzard it wont last mr zagero jackstraw put in these williwaws always blow themselves out in a short time this already has gone on longer than most and its easing a lot tomorrow will be clear and calm and cold the cold will be a change zagero saidfeelingly he looked past me the old ladys off again doc yes i stopped massaging her hands and slid the gloves on lets have a look at these paws of yours mr zagero will you johnny to you doc ive been dismissed without a stain on my character remember he thrust his big hands out for inspection pretty arent they they werent pretty they were the worst case of frostbite i had ever seen and i had seen all too many in korea and later they were white and yellow and dead the original skin had vanished under a mass of blisters and from the few warm spots i could detect on either hand i knew that much of the tissue had been permanently destroyed fraid i was a mite careless with my gloves zagero said apologetically in fact i lost the damn things about five miles back didnt notice it at the time hands were too cold i reckon feel anything in them now here and there he nodded as i touched some spots where the blood still flowed and went on conversationally am i goin to lose my hands doc amputation i mean no i shook my head definitely i saw no point in mentioning that some of his fingers were beyond hope will i ever fight again still the same casual careless tone its difficult to say you never know will i ever fight again youll never fight again there was a long pause then he said quietly youre sure doc youre absolutely sure im absolutely sure johnny no boxing commission doctor in the world would ever let you climb into a ring it would cost him his listing in the medical register okay so thats how it is consolidated plastics of trenton new jersey have just got themselves a new factory hand this boxin racket was too damn strenuous anyway there was no regret in his voice no resignation even but that meant nothing like me he had more important things to worry about he looked away into the darkness then twisted round whats the matter with that hound of yours jackstraw i dont know i think id better find out twice while we had been talking balto had left us vanished into the snow and returned after a few minutes he seemed restless uneasy i wont be long he rose followed balto into the darkness returned in a short time come and see this dr mason this was a spot less than a hundred yards away close into the side of the glacier valley jackstraw flashed his torch on to the snowdusted ice i stooped made out a black circular patch on the ground and a few feet away a smaller discoloured area where the surface snow had frozen solid oil from the gearcase or sump water from the radiator jackstraw said briefly he altered the torchbeam and you can still see the crimp marks of the caterpillars and very recent i suggested the drifting snow the scouring effect of the flying iceparticles had scarcely begun to obliterate the traces left by the treads i think so and they were stopped here a long time dr mason look at the size of that oil patch mechanical trouble i hazarded i didnt really believe it myself riding out the storm corazzini must have been blind jackstraw said definitely if the engine had stopped on that pair theyd never have got it started again i knew he was right neither smallwood nor corazzini had shown any mechanical ability at all and i was convinced that it had been no act perhaps they were still here when we arrived back there my god if wed only carried on another hundred yards spilt milk as you say dr mason yes im sure they were here then we wouldnt have heard their engine not in this wind jackstraw a sudden thought a flash of hope jackstraw did you sleep back there no how long were we stopped half an hour maybe less and you think they were still here good god man they cant be more than a mile away the winds dropping right away its getting colder and well only freeze to death if we stay here maybe therell be crevasses on the glacier to hold them up i was already on my way running slipping stumbling jackstraw by my side balto leading the way zagero was standing up waiting and the young german girl by his side helene i caught her hands you all right how are you feeling better much better she didnt sound all that much better im sorry i was so silly dr mason i dont know it doesnt matter i cut in rather brusquely you can walk fine fine i could feel new hope surging through me as i rapped out a brief explanation to zagero within a minute we had mahler and marie legarde bundled aboard the sledge and were on our way but the hope was shortlived we made the best speed we could at times breaking into a kind of staggering run but the sledge slowed us up terribly on that uneven surface of the glacier once it overturned throwing both mahler and marie legarde heavily on to the snow and after that we were forced to slow down another such violent capsizing or even too severe a jolting and that sledge would become a bier from time to time jackstraw flashed his failing torch on the crimp marks we were following and even to my inexperienced eye it was obvious that the tracks in the snow were becoming progressively fainter every time we looked at them until the time came at last when i knew we must call a halt to this pursuit admit defeat we had fallen so far behind now three or four miles i was certain that the hope and chance of overtaking them no longer existed we were only chasing a hopeless dream and killing ourselves doing it jackstraw and zagero agreed we put helene aboard the sledge to steady the two sick people took a trace apiece over our shoulders and plodded on slowly down the glacier backs bent heads bowed each one of us lost in his own hopeless thoughts as jackstraw had prophesied the storm had blown itself out completely the wind had gone so that not a breath stirred across the glacier the snow had vanished with the dark and heavy clouds that had carried it the white stars stood high in a dark and frozen sky it was cold with a temperature well below zero but cold was an old friend now by eight oclock that morning some three hours and six miles after we had left our resting place the conditions for travel were perfect the weather conditions that was underfoot they varied from the indifferent to the abominable we were now fairly into the kangalak glacier and the going was often difficult indeed a glacier is seldom a smooth river of ice that flows evenly downhill but much more frequently an irregularly surfaced fissured and crevassed mass descending as often as not in a series of rounded steps and ledges like a sea of petrified lava the kangalak was no exception here and there we found some straight stretches but for the most part progress was possible only at the sides where the rate of flow was less and the ice smoother it was the lefthand side that we were following but even so it was heavy work for our path was frequently blocked by the debris of ground moraines that had been forced out on the sides and when these were absent we were as often as not floundering through the thick drifts that the great wind of the night just gone had piled up high against the sides the one consolation i found was that if it were difficult for us it was proving doubly so for the tractor whose irregularly weaving twisting crimp marks we were so doggedly following i wondered how far away hillcrest and the snocat were i was as certain as i could be of anything that he would have headed due west as soon as he would have emerged from the vindeby nunataks and hed had time and to spare to make the coast by this time not even the blizzard of last night could have stopped the snocat the engine was a completely enclosed unit its great caterpillars would take it over the loosest the most newly fallen snow but even had he backed his hunches and headed for the coast as i hoped he might still be anything up to twenty miles to the north or south of us or he might be not only north or south but fifteen miles ahead of us we had no maps left but i was fairly certain we were about that distance from the coast or was it possible that hillcrest a shrewd and thoughtful man might have thought the gambit of a break for the coast too obvious a move could it not be that he might have indeed pressed on for uplavnik or even turned due north after he had come through the hills or if he were coming west would he not perhaps be driving in a search pattern quartering the ground between the vindeby nunataks and the coast in a series of wide advancing zigzags if that were so he might still be anything up to thirty miles behind it was infuriating beyond measure to know that he was almost certainly within two or three hours driving time from where we were but without a wireless or any other means of contacting him he might as well have been a thousand miles away for any hope there was of two tiny moving objects encountering each other by chance in that vast and featureless land soon after eight oclock in the morning i stopped to have a look at the two sick people on the sledge professional instinct i suppose but an empty token gesture there was nothing we could do for them except give massage at frequent intervals the sound of mahlers dyspnoea his whooping gasping breathing was the tolling of a deathbell to our ears and this effort to breathe was extinguishing the last embers of life in his emaciated and frozen body in three hours time by noon at the latest mahler would be dead nothing could ever save him now it was madness an utterly wasted effort to continue to drag him along on a sledge he was past caring or knowing or feeling now he could die just as peacefully if we left him lying on the glacier or so i have thought since then but mahler was more than a man to us that day he was a symbol we would leave mahler when he had drawn his last gasping breath but never before marie legarde was dying too but quietly softly peacefully like a little candle flame flickering to extinction maybe she would go first maybe mahler but both of them would die this day the going was becoming increasingly difficult now not so much because of the gradually steepening slope of the glacier which made the sledge overrun us more and more frequently but because of the fact that jackstraws torch had all but completely given out and the fissures and crevasses that earlier had merely been nuisances to be negotiated now became menaces to be avoided at the cost of our lives it was now that balto proved of his greatest value yet as jackstraw had said on our first day out from the igy cabin the big siberian had an uncanny nose for crevasses both open and hidden in daytime or dark and he made never a mistake that morning constantly running ahead and then back towards us to guide us in the safest direction even so progress was heartbreakingly slow shortly after halfpast eight in the morning we came across the tractor sled lying at an angle against a moraine even in the near darkness it was plain to see what had happened the steepness of the glacier not to mention sudden unaccountable dips to left and right across its width must have made the heavy sled a dangerous liability for from its tracks we had several times seen where it had slewed wildly at an angle pivoting round on its iron towbar as brakeless it had sought to overrun the tractor obviously smallwood and corazzini must have feared and with reason that on one of these occasions it would pull round the tail of the tractor after it and topple the tractor on its side or worse drag it into a crevasse so they had unhooked the towbar and left the sled it was surprising that they hadnt done this earlier apart from carrying their fuel and food which reserves could easily have gone into the tractor cabin itself it had been a useless encumbrance to them as far as i could judge they had abandoned it with all its contentsapart of course from the portable radioincluding the wraps we had given zagero and levin when they had ridden on it at the point of a gun we took these tucked them round mahler and marie legarde and passed on three hundred yards later i stopped so abruptly that the sledge bumping into me made me lose my footing on the slippery ice i stood up laughing softly laughing for the first time for days and zagero came up close and peered into my face what gives doc i laughed again and was just on the point of speaking when his hand struck me sharply across the face cut it out doc his voice was harsh that aint goin to help us any on the contrary its going to help us a very great deal i rubbed a hand across my cheek i couldnt blame him for what he had done my god and i almost missed it missed what he still wasnt sure that i wasnt hysterical come on back to the tractor sled and see smallwood claims he thinks of everything but hes missed out at last hes made his first big mistake but oh brother what a mistake and the weathers just perfect for it i turned on my heel and actually ran up the glacier towards the sled many items were carried as standard equipment in icy parties both in the field and at base camps and none more standard than the magnesium flares which first came into common use in the antarctic over a quarter of a century ago they are indispensable as location beacons in the long polar nights and radiosondes we carried more radiosondes than any other item of equipment for our primary purpose on the icecap the garnering of information about density pressure temperature humidity and wind direction of the upper atmosphere was impossible without them these sondes still crated with the tents ropes axes and shovels which we had found no occasion to use on this trip were radiocarrying balloons which wirelessed back information from heights of between and feet we also carried rockoons radio rockets fired from balloons which took them clear of the denser parts of the atmosphere before releasing them but right then rockoons were useless to me so too were balloons at their normal operating height feet should serve our purpose admirably the dim glow from the torch was more than sufficient jackstraw and i had worked with these things a hundred times to couple the balloon to the hydrogen cylinder disconnect the radio and substitute a group of three magnesium flares fused with rdx took only minutes we lit the fuse cut the holding cord and had a second balloon coupled on to the cylinder before the first was feet up then just as we had the third on the cylinder and were disconnecting its radio the first flare now at about a height of feet burst into scintillating brilliant life it was all i could have wished for indeed it was more than id ever hoped for and zageros heavy thump on my back showed how joyfully he shared my feelings dr mason he said solemnly i take it all back all i ever said about you this dr mason is genius its not bad i admitted and indeed if anyone in those perfect conditions of visibility couldnt see the coruscating dazzlement of those flares at any distance up to thirty miles he would have to be blind if they were looking in the right direction that was but i was sure that with hillcrest carrying five men and everybody almost certainly on the lookout for us the chances of missing it were remote the second flare considerably higher burst into life just as the first went sputtering into extinction and the further thought struck me that if there were any ships patrolling out in the sea beyond it would give them a bearing the significance of which none of them could surely overlook and then i saw jackstraw and zagero looking at me and though i couldnt read their expressions in the darkness i knew from their stillness what they were both thinking and suddenly i didnt feel so happy any more the odds were high that corazzini and smallwood they could be no more than a few miles distant had seen the flares also they would know what it signified they would know it was the first tug on the drawstring of the net that might even then be starting to close round them in addition to being dangerous ruthless killers they would become frightened killers and they had margaret and johnny zageros father with them but i knew id had no option tried to thrust all thought of the hostages from my mind turned to look at the third balloon that we had just released then winced and closed my eyes involuntarily as the third flare through some flaw or mis judgment in the length of the fuse ignited not more than five hundred feet above us the bluewhite intensity mingling almost immediately with a bright orange flame as the balloon also caught fire and both started drifting slowly earthwards and so intently was i watching this through narrowed eyes that i all but missed something vastly more important but jackstraw didnt he never missed anything i felt his hand on my arm turned to see the strong white teeth gleaming in the widest grin i had seen for weeks then halfturned again to follow the direction of his pointing arm just in time to see low on the horizon in the southeast and not more than five miles away the earthward curving red and white flare of a signal rocket our feelings were impossible to describe know at least that mine were i had never seen anything half so wonderful in all my life not even the sight twenty minutes later of the powerful wavering headlight beams of the snocat as it appeared over a rise in the plateau and headed towards the spot we had scrambled up from the glacier to the flat land above where we had just ignited the last of our flares and were waving it round and round our heads on the end of a long metal pole like men demented it seemed an age although i dont suppose it was much more than ten minutes before the great red and yellow snocat ground to a halt beside us and willing arms reached down to help us into the incredible warmth and comfort of that superbly equipped and insulated cabin hillcrest was a great bull of a man redfaced blackbearded jovial confident with a tremendous zest for living a deceptive external appearance that concealed a firstclass brain and a competence of a very high order indeed it did me good just to sit there glass of brandy in hand relaxed if only for a moment for the first time in five days and just to look at him i could tell that it hadnt done him the same good to look at us in the bright overhead light i could clearly see our yellowed blistered emaciated faces the bleeding blacknailed suppurating all but useless hands and i was shocked myself but he concealed it well and busied himself with handing out restoratives tucking away mahler and marie legarde in two deep heatpadfilled bunks and supervising the efforts of the cook who had a steaming hot meal ready prepared all this he had done before he had as much as asked us a question right he said briskly first things first wheres the citroen i presume the missile mechanism is still aboard it brother you just dont begin to have any idea how many heart attacks this thing is causing thats not the first thing i said quietly i nodded to theodore mahler whose hoarse gasping breath filled the room this man is dying all under control he boomed he jerked a thumb at joss who after the first delighted greeting had returned to his radio set in the corner the boy here hasnt left his set for over twentyfour hours ever since we got your mayday call he looked at me speculatively you took a chance there i wonder you didnt stop a bullet for your pains i just about did we were talking about mahler yes weve been in constant contact same wavelength with two ships hi that time the destroyer wykenham and the carrier triton i had a fair idea your friends must be heading in this direction so the wykenham has been moving up overnight and is lying off the coast but the leads and patches in the ice arent big enough for the triton to manoeuvre to fly off planes shes about eighty miles south in clear water eighty miles i didnt bother to conceal my shock and my disappointment id begun to have a faint irrational hope that we might yet save the dying man eighty miles i have news for you doctor hillcrest announced jovially we have moved into the air age he turned towards joss and raised an inquiring eyebrow a scimitar jet fighter is just taking off joss tried to speak unemotionally but failed its airbornenow timecheck were to fire our first rocket at thirteen minutes from now then two more at intervals of thirty seconds at were to set off a slowburning magnesium flare where we want the stuff dropped at least two hundred yards from the tractor joss listened for another few moments and grinned he says were to get the hell out of it after weve lit the flare or were liable to collect a headache or worse i didnt know what to say where to look moments like this came all too seldom not until that moment did i realise how much of a symbol theodore mahler had become how much his survival had meant for me hillcrest must have had some intuitive understanding of how i felt for he spoke at once his voice normal matter of fact service old boy sorry we couldnt have laid it on earlier but the triton refused to risk an expensive plane and an even more expensive pilot flying low over virtually uncharted territory unless they definitely knew that mahler was alive theyve done all anyone could ask a sudden thought struck me these planes dont usually carry ammunition in peacetime do they dont worry hillcrest said grimly he ladled some steaming stew on to our plates nobodys playing any more theres been a flight of scimitars standing by since midnight and every cannons loaded right doctor give with the story i gave as briefly and concisely as possible at the end he clapped his hands together maybe five miles ahead eh then its tallyho down the old glacier and after em he rubbed his hands in anticipation were three times as fast and weve three times as many rifles this is the way any decent igy expedition should be run i smiled faintly a token response to his bubbling enthusiasm i never felt less like smiling now that the worry of mahler and in that warmth and with hot food almost certainly also the worry of marie legarde was off my hands my anxiety about margaret had returned with redoubled force were not tallyhoingdown any old glacier captain hillcrest apart from the fact that its a rotten surface which would bring your speed down to about the same as the citroens open pursuit is a pretty sure way of guaranteeing that margaret ross and mr levin get a bullet through their heads incidentally mr levin is the father of mr zagero what both hillcrest and joss had spoken at the same time yes but later have you a map of the area sure hillcrest handed it over like most greenland maps it showed topographical detail for no more than the first twenty miles inland but it was sufficient for my purpose it showed the twisting kangalak glacier debouching into the kangalak fjord the wide deep bay beyond the southern headland of the fjord the northern headland continuing in a wide shallow smooth curve for many miles to the north where did you say the destroyer was i asked the wykenhaml im not sure blocking the kangalak fjord here perhaps i indicated the spot on the map no that im certain of he shook his head regretfully captain said the packice was too heavy he couldnt risk his destroyer in any of the leads in case they closed hillcrest snorted in disgust i gather its hull is made of paper its not much thicker ive served in destroyers i dont blame him but ill bet his trawler probably a specially strengthened job is well inside the fjord and a submarine no great distance away look this is all we can do i traced my finger on the map we must parallel the glacier maybe a mile away with the slope of the valley sides smallwood wont see us and with his own engine running he cant hear us down here whats to stop him from cutting his engine now and again to listen hillcrest demanded because what smallwood and corazzini dont know about engines would fill an encyclopedia theyd be dead scared to stop it in case they couldnt start it again down here at the base of the headland separating the fjord from the bay to the south about a mile from the end of the glacier i would say the sides of the glacier valley fall away and level off into the plateau on either side but theres bound to be some kind of moraine or shelter there thats where well ambush them ambush he frowned at me whats the difference between that and pursuing them itll still come to a fight and they can still hold pistols to the heads of levin and the stewardess and bargain from there therell be no fight i said quietly theyve been following the lefthand side of the glacier all the way down i see no reason why they should change they should come into sight maybe fifty yards from where were hiding farther out on the glacier the going is impossible for tractors i nodded at the telescopic sighted in the corner with that jackstraw can hit a threeinch target at a hundred yards a mans head at fifty yards is six times that size first he gets corazzini whos probably driving and when smallwood sticks his head out the back as he certainly will well thats it but good god man you cant do that hillcrest was horrified without a chance without warning its murder simple murder want me to go over the number of people theyve murdered i shook my head you just dont begin to know those two hillcrest but he broke off turned to jackstraw its you hes asking to do it what do you say it will be a pleasure jackstraw said very softly hillcrest stared at us both baffled incomprehension in his eyes i suppose he thought he knew both of us well and he did but he didnt know what we had been through words couldnt even begin to make him understand the atmosphere was uncomfortable tense even and i was grateful for josss sudden calm words captain hillcrest three minutes to go good he was i could see as glad of the interruption as i was barclay this to the cook the only other of hillcrests men there the other three were in the big driving cabin to make room for us three wessex rockets line them up on the and stand wait for the word ill go myself with the flare two for safety give a beep on the horn joss when its time to set em off i went with him to watch and the whole thing went off without a hitch dead on time just seconds after the third rocket had been fired to curve upwards and explode into incandescent light in the stardusted darkness above we heard the highpitched whine approaching out of the southwest and in an incredibly short space of time a vague dark blur carrying no navigation lights screamed by five hundred feet overhead banked in the distance came at us again at much reduced speed banked a second time and then with a crescendoing banshee shriek of the jet engine had vanished again into the vaguely lightening darkness to the southeast before we had realised that the pilot had made his drop it was a measure of his complete selfconfidence that he didnt even trouble to check the accuracy of his drop but for a man skilled in landing on the handkerchiefsized flight deck of a carrier in the middle of the night this must have been a childishly simple exercise there were two packages not one attached not to parachutes but to insignificant little drogues that seemed to let them fall much too fast for safety they landed almost together not forty yards from the magnesium flares and with such force that i was sure that their contents must be smashed but i had underestimated the fleet air arms skill and experience in these matters the contents were so beautifully packed and cushioned that everything was completely intact the packages were duplicated two ampoules of insulin and three hypodermic syringes in each package whoever had packed these had been taking no chances but gratitude was the last thought in my mind at that moment i just tucked the boxes under my arm and made for the tractor at a dead run for close on two hours hillcrests driver pushed the big snocat along at its maximum speed and despite the inherent stability afforded by its four wide caterpillars the tractor swayed and lurched in terrifying fashion this was bad country this was crevasse country and we had been forced to make a wide detour that had carried us more than three miles away from the kangalak glacier and once again jackstraws big siberian wolf proved how invaluable he was running tirelessly ahead he repeatedly guided the snocat away from dangerous territory but even so our route was a necessarily devious and twisted one though the picking out of a path became considerably easier after the pale grey light of the arctic noon spread across the icecap for all of us it was a time of tension of an evermounting anxiety that reached intolerable proportions for the first halfhour or so i was busy enough in broaching the tractors firstaid kit and doing what doctoring i could to mahler a mahler whose dyspnoea was already dramatically easing marie legarde helene jackstraw and above all to zageros shattered hands then i myself submitted to hillcrests rough and ready ministrations but after that there was nothing for me to do nothing for any of us to do except try to avoid the bitterness of thinking what must happen if the citroen reached the tongue of the glacier before us suddenly exactly on noon the tractor stopped abruptly we jumped out to see what the matter was and it became apparent soon enough the driver was awaiting instructions we had abruptly rounded the humpback of the last ice ridge that had lain between us and the glacier itself even in the halflight of the arctic day the panorama suddenly unfolded before us was a breathtaking one to the north the icesheet extended all the way down to the coast forming vertical and in some places overhanging cliffs the wellknown phenomenon of the chinese wall fronts nobody nothing could hope to land there to the south and separated from the fjord by the milelong ridgeback of the seawardprojecting southern wall of the fjord was a wide bay fringed by a low icebare rocky coast quilted here and there with drifts of snow blown off the icecap there if anywhere was where we would have to leave in the centre between the low walls of the fjord the kangalak glacier itself here at its tongue about yards wide ran down to the waters of the fjord in a great dogleg curving sharply thirty degrees right about halfway down its length ending abruptly with its upper surface a hundred perhaps a hundred and fifty feet above the packicestrewn water beneath for the first half of its length the tongue of the glacier sloped fairly sharply from right to left down to the nunataks crescentfringed by the debris of moraines that thrust up through the ice at the far corner of the dogleg the surface of the glacier was a nightmare of transverse and longitudinal fissures some of them anything up to two hundred feet deep great gaping chasms fanged with seracs the irregular often needlepointed ice pinnacles that reached up between the walls of the larger crevasses surely smallwood could never be so desperate so insane as to drive the citroen out on that apart from the fissures the very steepness of the slope downwards and to the left would be enough to send him into an uncontrollable slide and beyond everything lay the sea the islandstudded icefilled waters of baffin bay offshore there was a milewide belt of loose pressure ice the season was not yet far enough advanced for the fantastic shapes it would assume in the early spring streaked with open everchanging leads and dotted at rare intervals with small icebergs probably ones that had broken off from the east coast drifted south round cape farewell and then moved north again the whole halflost unearthly and impossibly weirdly continuously altered in configuration by the white drifting fog that hung miasmalike over the sea but two things there were that were not lost two ships the one to the southwest wraithlike and blurred though its lines were through the swirling mist was quite unmistakable that raked and slender silhouette would have been unmistakable anywhere it was a destroyer it could only be the wykenham moving slowly cautiously shorewards through the icefilled waters of the bay to our left a heartwarming immensely reassuring spectacle or it should have been but after the first cursory identifying glance i lost interest my attention was taken and completely held by the second ship i couldnt see all of it most of its hull was hidden by the precipitous end of the glacier but its small squat bridge two masts and broad bluff seawardpointing bows were clearly etched against the mirrorcalm waters of the head of the fjord and the sloping icebare rock that brushed its portside fenders i could see no flag it was a trawler unmistakably so and i thought grimly that it must have been a very special trawler indeed to have battered that stillvisible path through the icechoked mouth of the fjord my gaze moved back to the trawler again and a second later i was grabbing hillcrests binoculars without so much as by your leave one glance was enough even in that shadowed gloom of the depth of the fjord i could see all i wanted to see by the grey noonlight i could see a great deal more than i wanted to for a few seconds i stood stockstill listening desperately for the sound of the citroens engines moments later i was in the tractor cabin by the radio table still in contact with the triton joss he nodded and i rushed on tell them theres a group of men coming ashore from a trawler in the kangalak fjord ten twelve im not sure and im not sure whether theyre armed ill be damned surprised if they arent tell them im certain theyre going to move up on the glacier now of course i snapped send a message immediately and no i meant are they moving up the glacier now take them ten fifteen minutes the fjord walls are pretty steep and its tricky to climb after that ask the wykenham if they will send a landing party ashore an armed party and for gods sake tell them its urgent will they get here in time doc zagero was behind me by the time they lower a boat row ashore cross this headland its half a mile if its an inch itll take them fifteen minutes maybe more i know i said irritably irritably but softly for joss was already talking into the table microphone in the swift staccato yet strangely unhurried voice of the trained radioman if you have any better suggestions its coming hillcrests excited face had just appeared at the door of the cabin come on we can hear it coming down the glacier and indeed they could the deep throaty roar of that heavy engine was recognisable anywhere hurriedly we moved about a hundred yards away from the moraineringed depression where we had parked the tractor jackstraw hillcrest and i each with a rifle in our hands and crouched down behind the concealing protection of some icecovered debris at the edge of the glacier from where we lay we could command a view of the glacier across its entire width and up to a point several hundred yards away where it curved sharply out of sight we neednt have hurried the citroen was still some good way off the sound of its engine being funnelled down through the glacier valley well ahead of it and i had time to look around me what i saw seemed good i was banking everything on the hope that the citroen would still be on the same side of the glacier as when we had last seen it and from what i could see the chances were high that it still would be the entire centre of the glacier was a devils playground of crevasses ranging from hairlines to chasms twenty and more feet in width transverse longitudinal and diagonal and as far as i could see they extended clear to the other wall but here on the left side close in to the lining wall of moraine was a relatively clear path fissured only at long intervals and not more than thirty yards broad thirty yards jackstraw could never miss at this pointblank range even with a moving target i stole a glance at him but his face might have been carved from the glacier itself it was immobile and utterly devoid of expression hillcrest on the other hand was restless forever shifting his cramped position he was unhappy i knew he didnt tike this one little bit he didnt like murder neither did i but this wasnt murder it was a long overdue execution it wasnt lifetaking it was lifesaving the lives of margaret and solly levin there came the sudden click abnormally loud even above the closing roar of the tractor and jackstraw stretched his length on the snow had the rifle raised to his shoulder and then suddenly the citroen had come clearly into sight and jackstraw was gently lowering his rifle to the ground i had gambled and i had lost the tractor was on the far side of the glacier hugging the right bank as closely as possible even at its nearest point of approach it would still be three hundred yards away chapter twelve saturday pm pm the citroen was travelling in a most erratic fashion one moment slowing down almost to a stop the next jerking forward and covering perhaps twenty to thirty yards at a rush although we couldnt see the glacier surface at that distance it was obvious that the driver was picking his way round icemounds and threading along between fissures at the best speed he could manage but his average speed was very low it would probably take him almost five minutes to reach that point opposite us where the glacier fell away sharply to the left towards the outer angle of the dogleg halfway down towards the fjord all these things i noted mechanically without in any way consciously thinking of them all i could think of was that smallwood and corazzmi had outwitted us right up to the last almost certainly i could understand now they had seen and been warned by the rockets hillcrest had fired to give the scimitar our position and decided to give that side of the glacier the widest possible berth but the reasons no longer mattered a damn all that mattered was the accomplished fact and the fact was that corazzini and smallwood could no longer be stopped not in the way we had intended even yet of course they could be stopped but i had no illusions but that that would be at the cost of the lives of the two hostages in the tractor frantically i tried to work out what to do for the best there was no chance in the world that we might approach them openly over the glacier we would be spotted before we had covered ten yards and a pistol at the heads of margaret and levin would halt us before we got halfway if we did nothing let them get away i knew the hostages chances of survival were still pretty slim that trawler would almost certainly have a name or number or both and i couldnt see smallwood letting them make an identification of the trawler and then come back to report to us and to all the waiting ships and planes in the davis strait baffin sea area why should he take the slightest risk when it would be so easy to shoot them so much easier still to throw them down a crevasse or shove them over the edge of the glacier into the freezing waters of the fjord a hundred and fifty feet below already the citroen was no more than three minutes away from the nearest point of approach they would make to us looks like theyre going to get away with it hillcrest whispered it seemed as if he feared he might be overheard though smallwood and corazzini couldnt have heard him had he shouted at the top of his voice well that was what you wanted wasnt it i asked bitterly what i wanted my god man that missile mechanism i dont give a single solitary damn about the missile mechanism i ground the words out between clenched teeth six months from now other scientists will have invented something twice as good and ten times as secret theyre welcome to it and with pleasure hillcrest was shocked but said nothing but someone was in agreement with me hear hear zagero had just come up his hands swathed to the size of boxing gloves in white bandages the words were light enough but his face was grim and his eyes bleak as he stared out across the glacier my sentiments exactly doc to hell with their murderous little toys my old mans in that buggy out there and your girl his girl hillcrest turned looked sharply at me under creased brows for a long moment then murmured sorry boy i didnt understand i made no response but twisted my head as i heard footsteps behind me it was joss hatless and gloveless in his excitement wykenhams anchored sir he panted out her get down man theyll see you sorry he dropped to his hands and knees her powerboats already moving inshore and there was a flight of four scimitars already airborne they should be halfway here already in two minutestime four or five bombers are taking off with he and incendiaries theyre slower but bombers i snapped irritably bombers what do they think this is the second front no sir theyre going to clobber the trawler if smallwood gets away with that missile mechanism they wont get a hundred yards the hell with their missile mechanism do human lives mean nothing to them what is it jackstraw lights dr mason he pointed to the spot on the fjord wall where the men from the trawler had already covered twothirds of the horizontal and vertical distance to the end of the glacier signalling i think i saw it right away a small light but powerful winking irregularly i watched it for a few moments then heard josss voice its morse but its not our morse sir theyre hardly likely to signal in english just for our benefit i said dryly i tried to speak calmly to hide the fear the near despair in my mind and when i spoke again my voice i knew was abnormally matteroffact its the tipoff to our friends smallwood and corazzini if we can see the men from the trawler its a cinch the men from the trawler can see us the point is do smallwood and corazzini understand them five seconds later i had my answer in the form of a suddenly deepening roar coming to us across the glacier from the engine of the citroen corazzini hillcrests binoculars had shown him to be the driver had understood the danger all right he was casting caution to the winds and gunning the engine to its maximum he must have been desperate desperate to the point of madness for no sane man would have taken the fearful risks of driving that tractor through sloping crevasse ice with the friction coefficient between treads and surface reduced almost to zero or could it be that he just didnt know the suicidal dangers involved after a few seconds i was convinced he didnt in the first place i couldnt see either corazzini or smallwood as men who would panic under pressure no matter how severe that pressure and in the second place suicidal risks werent absolutely necessary they would have stood a more than even chance of getting away with their lives and the missile mechanism if they had stopped the tractor got out and picked their cautious way down the glacier on foot with their pistol barrels stuck in the backs of their hostages or would they rather did they think they would i tried fleetingly frantically to get inside their cold and criminal minds to try to understand their conception of us did they think that we thought like them that the mechanism was all important that human lives were cheap and readily expendable if they did and guessing the quality of jackstraws marksmanship with a rifle would they not be convinced that they would be shot down as soon as they had stepped out on to the ice regardless of the fate of their hostages or did they have a better understanding than that of minds more normal than their own even as these thoughts flashed through my mind i knew i must act now the time for thought had there ever been such a time was past if they were left to continue in the tractor they would either kill themselves on the glacier or if by a miracle they reached the bottom safely they would then kill their hostages if they were stopped now there was a faint chance that margaret and levin might survive at least for the moment they were smallwoods and corazzinis only two trump cards and would be kept intact as long as lay within their power for they were their only guarantee of escape i just had to gamble on the hope that they would be desperately reluctant to kill them where they were now still a mile from the end of the glacier and the last time i had gambled i had lost can you stop the tractor i asked jackstraw my voice a flat lifeless monotone in my own ear he nodded his eyes on me i nodded silently in return you cant do that zagero shouted in urgent protest the drawl had gone for the first time ever theyll kill them theyll kill them my god mason if youre really stuck on that kid youd never shut up i said savagely i grabbed acoil of rope picked up my rifle and went on brutally if you think theyd ever let your father come out of this alive you must be crazy a second later i was on my way plunging out into the open across the narrow thirtyyard stretch of ice that led into the first of the fissures wincing and ducking involuntarily as the first shell from jackstraws rifle screamed past me only feet to my right and smashed through the hood of the citroen and into the engine with all the metallic clamour the vicious power of a sledgehammer wielded by some giant hand but still the citroen came on i leapt across a narrow crevasse steadied myself glanced back for a moment saw that hillcrest joss zagero and a couple of hillcrests men were following then rushed on again weaving and twisting my way through the cracks and mounds in the ice what was zagero doing there i asked myself angrily unarmed with two useless hands that could hold no firearm he was nothing but a liability what could any man do with ruined hands like those i was to find out just what a man with ruined hands could do we were running straight across the narrowest neck of the glacier making straight for the spot where the tractor would arrive if it survived jackstraws attempts to halt it jackstraw was firing in a line well above us now but we could still hear the thin high whine of every bullet the metallic crash as it struck the citroen every bullet went home but that engine was incredibly tough we were about halfway across when we heard the engine change gear the high unmistakable whine of the tractor beginning to overrun its engine corazzini i could clearly see him now even without the aid of binoculars must have found himself losing control on the steepening slope and was using the engine to brake the citroen and then when we were less than a hundred yards away and after a longer than usual lull in the firing jackstraw must have stopped to change magazines the sixth shell smashed through the riddled hood and the engine stopped as abruptly as if the ignition had been switched off the tractor stopped too on that steep slope this was surprising the last thing i would have expected but there was no doubt that not only had it stopped but that it had been stopped deliberately there was no mistaking the highpitched screech of those worn brakes and then i could see the reason why there was some violent activity taking place in the driving cabin of the tractor and as we neared a maddeningly slow process there were dozens of crevasses to be jumped as many more to be skirted we could see what it was corazzini and solly levin were struggling furiously and from thirty or forty yards it seemed incredibly enough that solly levin was getting the better of it he had flung himself completely on top of corazzini where the latter sat behind the wheel and was butting him savagely in the face with the top of his bald head and corazzini trapped in the narrow space could find no room to make use of his much greater strength then abruptly the door on the drivers side burst open we could see it clearly having been lower down than the tractor when it had stopped we were approaching it now almost head on and the two men fell out fighting and struggling furiously we could see now why levin had been using his head both hands were bound behind his back it had been an act of desperate courage to attack corazzini in the first place but the old man wasnt to get the reward he deserved for his selflessness even as we came up to them corazzini got his automatic clear and fired down pointblank at solly levin who was lying helplessly on his back but still gamely trying to get a leg lock on the bigger man i was a split second too late in getting there even as i crashed into corazzini and sent his automatic flying away to slide down the glacier i knew i was too late solly levin was a crumpled little bloodstained figure lying on the ice even before corazzinis gun went slithering over the edge of a crevasse and then i felt myself being pushed to one side and johnny zagero was staring down at the outspread stillness of the man huddled at his feet for what seemed an eternity but was probably no more than three seconds he stood there without moving then when he turned to corazzini his face was empty of all expression it might have been a flash of fear of realisation that he had come to the end of his road that i saw in corazzinis eyes but i could never swear to it the turn of his head the sudden headlong dash for the shelter of the icecovered moraine rocks by the side of the glacier ten yards away were so swift that i could be certain of nothing but swift as he was zagero was even swifter he caught corazzini before he had covered four yards and they crashed to the glacier together clawing punching and kicking in the grim desperate silence of men who know that the winners prize is his life drop that gun i whirled round at the sound of the voice behind me but all i could see at first was the white strained face of margaret ross the brown eyes dulled with sickness and fear involuntarily i brought up the rifle in my hands drop it smallwoods voice was curt deadly his face barely visible behind margarets shoulder as he peered out through the canvas screen at the rear of the tractor cabin he was completely shielded by her body it was typical of the mans cunning his icecold calculation that he should have waited until our attention was completely distracted before making his move and your friend quickly now i hesitated glanced at hillcrest the only otherman with a weapon to see how he was placed then jerked my head back again as there came a sudden plop from the silenced automatic and a sharp cry of pain from margaret she was clutching her left arm just below the elbow quickly i said the next one goes through her shoulder his voice was soft with menace his face implacable not for a moment did i doubt that he would do exactly as he said the clatter of hillcrests rifle and mine falling on the ice came in the same instant now kick them over the edge of that crevasse we did as he said and stood there powerless to do anything except watch the savage mauling fight on the glacier neither man had regained his feet since the struggle had begun the ice was too slippery for that and still they rolled over and over first one on top now the other both were powerful men but zagero was severely handicapped by the exhaustion of the terrible nights march that lay behind him by his crippled useless hands by thicklyswathed bandages over his hands that not only prevented him from catching or holding corazzini but softened the impact of every blow he struck for all that there was no question how the battle was going those broken hands id said would never fight again were clubbing and hammering the life out of corazzini i thought of the tremendous force with which id seen zagero strike a blow only the previous morning and felt a momentary flash of pity for corazzini then i remembered he was just as smallwood was that smallwood was prepared to kill margaret with as little compunction as he would snuff out the life of a fly i looked at the crumpled figure at my feet and every shadow of pity vanished as if it had never been smallwood his eyes unblinking his face expressionless as ever had his gun on them all the time waiting for that second when the two men would break far enough apart to give him a clear sight of zagero but now zagero was underneath nearly all the time one arm crooked round corazzinis neck while the other delivered a murderous series of shortarm jabs each one drawing a grunting gasp of agony from a whitefaced corazzini finally goaded into supreme effort by panic and fear corazzini managed to break loose and hurled himself not towards smallwood where safety lay but for the shelter of the moraine rocks where he would never know safety again zagero catlike as ever was only feet behind him moving so fast so unexpectedly that smallwoods swift snapshot missed him altogether call your friend nielsen smallwood must have realised how things were going behind the concealing shelter of the rocks for his voice was suddenly savage urgent he spared a swift glance in jackstraws direction jackstraw followed at some distance by two more of hillcrests crew was crossing the glacier at a dead run and now less than fifty yards away his rifle in a crevasse quickly jackstraw my voice was hoarse cracked throw your rifle away hes got a gun on miss ross and hes going to kill her jackstraw braked slipped on the ice halted and stood there for a moment irresolute and then at my repeated desperate cry carefully deliberately dropped his rifle into a nearby fissure and came slowly on to join us it was at that moment that hillcrest grabbed me by the arm hes moving mason hes alive he was pointing down to levin who was indeed stirring slightly i had never thought to examine levin it had seemed a ludicrous idea that a professional like corazzini could have missed at such pointblank range but now regardless of smallwoods reaction i dropped to my knees on the glacier and put my face close to levins hillcrest was right the breathing was shallow but breathing there undoubtedly was and now i could see the thin red line that extended from the temple almost to the back of the head i rose to my feet creased concussed probably thats all involuntarily i glanced over my shoulder towards the rocks but too late now for corazzini and i needed no eyes to know that this was so the unseen battle behind the rocks had been fought out with a dumb feral ferocity with a silent savagery that had been far more frightening than all the most maddened oaths and shouting could ever have been but even now as smallwood jumped down from the tailboard of the tractor cabin margaret ross still held in front of him and started hustling her towards the rocks a hoarse highpitched scream that raised the hackles on the back of my neck froze us all even smallwood to immobility and then came a long quavering moan of agony cut off as abruptly as it had begun and now there was no more screaming or moaning no more slipping of feet on ice no more gasping or frenzied flurries bespeaking the interchange of desperate blows there was only silence a silence chillingly broken by regular rhythmic pounding blows like the stamping feet of a piledriver smallwood had recovered had just reached the rocks when zagero came out to meet him face to face smallwood moved to one side his gun covering him as zagero came slowly towards us his face cut and bruised his bloodsaturated bandaged hands hanging by his sides with two long ribbons of redstained bandage trailing on the ice behind him finished i asked finished good i said and meant it your fathers still alive johnny scalp wound thats all his battered face transformed first by disbelief then by sheer joy zagero dropped on his knees beside solly levin i saw smallwood line his pistol on zageros back dont do it smallwood i shouted youll only have four shells left his eyes swivelled to my face the cold flat eyes of a killer then the meaning of my words struck home his expression subtly altered and he nodded as if i had made some reasonable suggestion he turned to jackstraw the nearest man to him and said bring out my radio jackstraw moved to obey and while he was inside the cabin zagero rose slowly to his feet does look like i was a mite premature he murmured he glanced towards the rocks and there was no regret in his face only indifference half a dozen witnesses and you all saw him beatin himself to death youre next smallwood corazzini was a fool smallwood said contemptuously the mans coldblooded callousness was staggering i can easily replace him just leave that radio here nielsen and join your friends while i join mine he nodded down the glacier or perhaps you hadnt noticed and we hadnt but we noticed it now all right the first of the party from the trawler climbing on to the ice at the precipitous tip of the glacier within seconds half a dozen of them were on the ice running stumbling falling picking themselves up again as they clawed their way up the slippery ice with all the speed they could muster my ah reception committee smallwood permitted himself the shadow of a smile you will remain here while miss ross and i make our way down to meet them you will not move i have the girl victory complete and absolute victory was in his grasp but his voice his face were again devoid as ever of all shadow of expression or feeling he stooped to pick up the portable radio then swung round and stared up into the sky i had heard it too and i knew what it was before smallwood did because it was a factor that had never entered into his calculations but there was no need for me to explain within seconds of hearing the first high screaming whine from the south a flight of four lean sleek deadly scimitar jet fighters whistled by less than four hundred feet overhead banked almost immediately broke formation and came back again speed reduced flying a tight circle over the tongue of the fjord i dont like planes and i hate the sound of jets but i had never seen so welcome a sight heard so wonderful a sound in all my life jet fighters smallwood i cried exultantly jet fighters from a naval carrier we called them up by radio he was staring at the circling planes with his thin lips drawn back wolfishly over his teeth and i went on more softly theyve had orders to shoot and destroy any person seen going down that glacier any person especially with a case or radio in his hand it was a lie but smallwood wasnt to know that the very presence of the jets above must have seemed confirmation of the truth of my words they wouldnt dare he said slowly theyd kill the girl too you fool i said contemptuously not only doesnt human life matter a damn to either side compared to the recovery of the mechanism you should know that better than anyone smallwood but these planes have been told to watch out for and kill two people going down the glacier wrapped in these clothes miss ross is indistinguishable from a man especially from the air theyll think its you and corazzini and theyll blast you both off the face of the glacier i knew smallwood believed me believed me absolutely this was so exactly the way his own killers mind would have worked in its utterly callous indifference to human life that conviction could not be stayed but he had courage ill grant him that and that firstclass brain of his never stopped working theres no hurry he said comfortably he was back on balance again they can circle there as long as they like they can send out relief planes to take over it doesnt matter as long as im with you here they wont touch me and in just over an hour or so it will be dark again after which i can leave meantime stay close to me gentlemen i dont think you would so willingly sacrifice miss rosss life dont listen to him margaret said desperately her voice was almost a sob her face twisted in pain go away please all of you go away i know hes going to kill me in the end anyway it may as well be now she buried her face in her hands i dont care any more i dont i dont but i care i said angrily soft words sympathetic words were useless here we all care dont be such a little fool everything will be all right youll see spoken like a man said smallwood approvingly only my dear i wouldnt pay much attention to the last pan of his speech why dont you give up smallwood i asked him quietly i had neither hope nor intention of persuading this fanatic i was only talking for time for i had seen something that had made my heart leap moving quietly out over the righthand side of the glacier from the selfsame spot where we had lain in ambush was a file of about a dozen men bombers have already taken off from the carrier and believe me theyre carrying bombs bombs and incendiaries and do you know why smallwood they were dressed in khaki this landing party from the wykenham not navy blue marines almost certainly unless they had been carrying soldiers on some combined manoeuvres they were heavily armed and had that indefinable but unmistakable look of men who knew exactly what they were about their leader i noticed wasnt fooling around with the usual pistol a naval officer in charge of a landing party traditionally carried he had a submachinegun under his arm the barrel gripped in his left hand three others had similar weapons the rest rifles because theyre going to make good and sure youre never going to get off this glacier alive smallwood i went on at least not out of the fjord alive neither you nor any of your friends coming to meet you nor any of the men waiting aboard that trawler down there god how slowly they were coming why didnt one of their marksmen with a rifle shoot smallwood there and then at that moment the thought that a rifle bullet would have gone clear though smallwood and killed the girl held so tightly in front of him never occurred to me but if i could hold his attention another thirty seconds if none of the others standing by my side betrayed by the slightest flicker of expression theyre going to destroy that trawler smallwood i rushed on quickly the men advancing up from the foot of the glacier were waving their arms furiously now shouting wildly in warning and even at over threequarters of a mile their voices were carrying clearly i had to try to drown their voices to make sure that smallwood kept his eyes fixed only on me theyre going to blow it out of the water it and you and that damned missile mechanism whats the use of but it was too late smallwood had heard the shouts even as i had begun to speak twisted his head to look down the valley saw the direction of the pointing arms glanced briefly over his shoulder then turned to face me again his face twisted in a bestial snarl that monolithic calm shattered at last who are they he demanded viciously what are they doing quick or the girl gets it its a landing party from the destroyer in the next bay i said steadily this is the end smallwood maybe youll stand trial yet til kill the girl he whispered savagely theyll kill you theyve been ordered to recover that mechanism at all costs nobodys playing any more smallwood give up your gun he swore vilely blasphemously the first time i had ever heard such words from him and leapt for the driving cabin of the tractor pushing the girl in front of him while his pistol swung in a wide arc covering all of us i understood what he was going to do what this last desperate suicidal gamble was going to be and hurled myself at the door of the driving cabin you madman my voice was a scream youll kill yourself youll kill the girl the gun coughed softly i felt the whitehot burning pain in my upper arm and crashed backward on to the ice just as smallwood released the brakes of the citroen at once the big tractor started to move those murderous treads passing inches from me as jackstraw leapt forward and dragged me to safety a second before they would have run over my face the next moment i was on my feet running after the tractor jackstraw at my heels i suppose that wound just below my shoulder must have been hurting like hell but the truth is that i felt nothing at all the tractor with next to no adhesion left on the steepening slope of ice accelerated with dismaying speed soon outdistancing us at first it seemed as if smallwood was making some attempt to steer it but it was obvious almost immediately that any such attempts were utterly useless five tons of steel ran amok it was completely out of control skidding violently first to one side then the other finally making a complete halfcircle and sliding backward down the glacier at terrifying speed following the slope of the ice which led from the righthand side where we had been standing to the big nunataks thrusting up through the ice on the far lefthand corner of the dogleg halfway down how it missed all the crevasses it went straight across some narrow ones thanks to its treads and all the icemounds on the way down and across the glacier i shall never know but miss them it did increasing speed with every second that passed its treads screeching out a shrilly metallic cacophony of sound as they scored their serrated way across and through the uneven ice of the glacier but then i shall never know either how jackstraw and i survived all the crazy chances we took on our mad headlong run down that glacier unable to stop leaping across crevasses we would never have dared attempt in our normal minds pounding our sliding way alongside others where the slip of either foot would have been our death we were still two hundred yards behind the tractor when less than fifty yards from the corner it struck an icemound spun round crazily several times and then smashed tail first with horrifying force into the biggest of the nunataks a fiftyfoot pinnacle of rock at the very corner we were still over a hundred yards away when we saw small wood obviously dazed halffall out of the still upright driving cabin hatbox in hand followed by the girl whether she flung herself at him or just stumbled against him it was impossible to say but both of them slipped and fell together and next moment had disappeared from sight against the face of the nunatak still fifty yards away already trying all we could to brake ourselves we heard the staccato roar of cannon shells seemingly directly above us and as i flung myself flat on the ice not to avoid the fire but to stop myself before i too plunged into the crevasse by the nunatak where i knew margaret and smallwood must have disappeared i caught a glimpse of two scimitars hurtling low across the glacier red fire streaking from their guns for a moment rolling over and over i saw no more then i had another glimpse of the lower part of the glacier of exploding cannon shells raking a lethal barrier of fragmenting steel across the glaciers entire width and about sixty or seventy yards lower down the men from the trawler lying flat on their faces to escape the whistling flying shrapnel even in that brief moment i had time to see a third scimitar screaming down out of the north exactly following the path of the other two they were making no attempt to kill the trawler men obviously they were under the strictest instructions to avoid any but the most necessary bloodshed and it wasnt necessary if ever anything was crystal clear it was the fact that we werent going to have any trouble at all from those trawler men both men and trawler could depart now unmolested with the missile mechanism beyond their reach they no longer mattered ten yards ahead of jackstraw sick to the heart and almost mad with fear i reached the crevasse by the nunatak no more than a threefoot wide gap between ice and rock peered down over the side and as i peered i felt faint from the wave of relief that swept over me the crevasse narrowing as it went down to not much more than two feet ended about fifteen feet down in a solid shelf of rock a ledge sculpted by thousands of years of moving grinding ice margaret and smallwood were still on their feet shaky i could see but seemingly unharmed it had been a short drop and they could have slowed their descent by pressing against both sides of the crevasse as they fell smallwood flattened lips drawn back over his teeth was staring up at me his pistol barrel pressed savagely against margarets temple a rope mason he said softly get me a rope this crevasse is closing the ice is moving and it was i knew it was all glaciers moved some of them on this west greenland coast with astonishing speed the great upernivik glacier farther north covered over four feet every hour as if in confirmation of his words the ice beneath my feet groaned and shuddered and slid forward a couple of inches hurry up smallwoods incomparable nerve held to the last his voice was urgent but completely under control his face tightlipped but calm hurry up or ill kill her i knew he meant it absolutely very well i said calmly my mind felt preternaturally clear i knew margarets life hung on a fraying thread but i had never felt so cool so selfpossessed in my life i unwound the rope round my shoulders here it comes he reached up both hands to catch the falling rope i took a short step forward and then stifflegged and with my hands pressed close to my sides fell on top of him like a plummeting stone he saw me coming but with the tangle of the rope and the narrowness of the crevasse he had no chance to get clear my feet caught him on the shoulder and outstretched arm and we crashed on to the ledge together he was as i have said phenomenally strong for his size but he had no chance then true he was partially numbed by the shock of my fall but that was more than cancelled out by my weakness by the loss of blood from my wounded shoulder but he still had no chance i locked my hands round that scrawny throat ignored his kickings his eyegougings the fusillade of blows rained on my unprotected head and squeezed and knocked his head against the bluebanded striations of the side of the crevasse until i felt him go limp in my hands and then it was time to go the icewall was now no more than eighteen inches distant from the polished rock of the nunatak smallwood apart i found myself alone on that narrowing ledge jackstraw had already been lowered by hillcrest and his men fastened a rope round margaret and been pulled up himself after her i could have sworn that i had fought with smallwood for no more than ten seconds but was told later that we had struggled like madmen for three or four minutes it may well have been so i have no memory of that time my coolness my detachment was something altogether outside me my first clear recollection was hearing jackstraws voice quick and urgent as a rope snaked down over my shoulders quickly dr mason itll close any second now im coming but another rope first please i pointed to the radio lying at my feet weve come too long a way with this weve suffered too much for this to leave it now twenty seconds later just as i scrambled over the edge of the crevasse the grinding icewall lurched another inch or two towards the rock of the nunatak and at the same moment smallwoods voice came to us again he had propped himself up on his hands and knees and was staring up numbly almost disbelievingly at the narrowing walls above him throw me a rope he could see deaths hand reaching out to touch him but the urgency in his voice was still under that iron control his face an expressionless mask for gods sake throw me a rope i thought of the trail of death smallwood had left behind him of the planes dead captain the three dead crew members colonel harrison brewster and mrs dansbygregg of how close to the brink of death he had brought marie legarde and mahler of how often he had threatened death to the girl now trembling violently in the crook of my arm i thought of these things then i looked at jackstraw who carried a rope over his arm and i saw reflected in his face the same implacability the same bleak mercilessness that informed my own mind and then jackstraw moved towards the brink of the crevasse lifted the tightly coiled rope high above his head hurled it down on top of the man below and stepped back without a word we turned jackstraw and i with margaret ross supported between us and walked slowly up the glacier to meet the officer in charge of the landing party and as we walked we could feel the glacier shiver beneath our feet as a million tons of ice lurched down towards the head of the kangalak fjord the end
