 enid blyton the rilloby fair mystery chapter first day of the holidays morning mother morning dad said roger and ruffled his fathers hair as he passed him and dropped a kiss on his mothers curls dont do that roger said his father impatiently smoothing his hair down why are you late for breakfast and wheres diana cant imagine said roger cheerfully helping himself to an enormous plateful of porridge asleep i suppose never mind said his mother its only the second day of the holidays roger you cant possibly eat all that porridge with sausages to follow oh jolly good said roger sitting down in front of his great plateful any fried onions with them not at breakfasttime roger you know we dont have onions then i cant imagine why not said roger he began to eat his porridge craning his neck to read the back of his fathers newspaper as the newspaper was folded in two the reading matter was upside down for roger and his father glanced at him irritably roger what are you screwing your head round like that for have you got a stiff neck no only just reading that exciting bit in the paper about the dog that well dont you know its bad manners to read a paper when someone else is reading it said his father dont they teach you manners at school no they think we learn them at home said roger cheekily mr lynton glared over the top of his newspaper well then perhaps id better teach you a few these holidays he began and just at that moment diana burst into the room beaming hallo mother morning dad i say isnt this a heavenly day all daffodils and primroses and sunshine gosh i do love the easter hols get your porridge dear said her mother roger you havent taken all the cream surely no theres a spot left said roger anyway it wont hurt diana to have plain milk shes too fat im not am i mother said diana indignantly her father gave an exasperated click sit down diana eat your porridge if you must be late be late quietly breakfast is at eight oclock and its now halfpast mr lynton gathered up his newspaper put it beside his wifes place and went out of the room whats the matter with dad this morning asked diana pulling up one of her stockings blow this stocking it keeps coming down why is dad so mouldy mother dont talk like that diana said mrs lynton theres nothing wrong with your father except that he does like you two to be punctual for meals and also hes heard that his uncle robert is coming to stay you know the dear old fellow bores your father terribly oh my goodness is greatuncle robert really coming said roger whatever for and where are you going to put him snubbys coming tomorrow isnt he and hell have the only guestroom well he cant now hell have to sleep in your room said his mother ill have a bed put up there im sorry roger but its the only thing to do uncle robert must have the guestroom oh gosh snubby sleeping with me and playing his fool tricks all the time groaned roger i shant mind having loony in the room but snubbys awful id very much rather you didnt have loony sleeping in the bedroom with you said mrs lynton hes a very nice spaniel i know although hes completely mad but i do not like dogs in bedrooms mother you say that every single time snubby and loony come to stay said diana and you know quite well that if you turned loony out into the kennel snubby would go too and sleep with him there at night yes i know said mrs lynton with a sigh i dont know which is worse snubby or loony snubby was a cousin of the two children and owned a black cocker spaniel called loony short for lunatic snubbys parents were dead so he spent his holidays staying with various relations mrs lynton was sorry for him and fond of him and he came more often to her house than to anyone elses hes coming tomorrow isnt he asked diana ill order a big bone for loony today when i go by the butchers dear old lenny i wonder if hes still mad on brushes mother last summer hols he took every single brush he could find he put some of them down a rabbithole we found quite a collection there one day mrs lynton hurriedly made up her mind that she would warn the household to keep all brushes out of loonys reach oh dear what with snubby and loony and uncle robert it looked as if things would be much too hectic for the next few weeks i wonder what snubby will say to greatuncle robert said diana with a giggle helping herself to sausages oh mother i just cant see them together somehow uncle roberts so hawhawish and pompous and snubbys so mad and idiotic youll just have to keep snubby and loony out of your uncles way thats all said her mother getting up from the table well im sorry i cant wait for you two any more i see youve finished up the toast and have begun on the loaf of bread when youve finished that perhaps youd like to call it a meal i cannot imagine how you can put all that away easy said roger and grinned at his mother as she went out of the room she smiled back it was nice to have the children at home again but it did take a little time to get used to their enormous appetites careless ways and constant sparring silence fell when mrs lynton had gone out of the room the two munched away hard gazing out of the window daffodils danced at the edges of the lawn and wallflowers shook the scent from their velvet petals sunshine flooded the garden and the two children felt happy and excited the weeks stretched before them no lessons no rules only day after day of sunshine and holidays enormous meals icecreams and loony the dog to take for walks heavenly said diana coming out of her daydream roger knew what she had been thinking and he agreed yes super he said i wonder how loony will get on with sardine sardine was their big black cat socalled because of her great fondness for the tinned fish called sardine the grocer was always astonished at the amount of tinned sardines mrs lynton bought fancy a family eating as many sardines as that but it was sardine the cat who ate it all and waxed fat and sleek on it i should think loony will give sardine a frightful time said roger scraping out the marmalade dish i shouldnt be surprised if sardine doesnt hold her own quite well said diana let me have a scrape of that marmalade roger dont be a pig i wish greatuncle robert wasnt coming said roger handing over the marmalade pot i wonder why hes coming he doesnt usually come in our hols its the last thing youd think hed want to do considering he thinks all children are perfect pests diana havent you two finished yet called mrs lynton from upstairs come along i want you to help me with snubbys bed im putting the playroom divan into rogers room roger come and give me a hand with it never a moments peace said roger with a grin at diana come on lets give a hand they tore upstairs falling over sardine as they went the big black cat fled up in front of them tail in air green eyes gleaming wickedly sardine do you still lie on the stairs you wicked cat shouted roger you be careful tomorrow or loony will get you if you dont look out loonyll get you if you dont look out loonyll get you if you dont look out chanted diana and skipped into rogers room to help her mother sardine was sitting on the windowsill there her long tail waving from side to side what have you two been doing to make sardine so cross asked her mother well i like that she was lying doggo on the stairs waiting to trip us up said diana indignantly lying catto you mean said roger with a chortle oh roger you sound like snubby when you say things like that said his mother diana make rogers bed whilst he and i bring in the divan they were all busy that day preparing for greatuncle robert and snubby what an odd pair greatuncle robert was so old and polite and pompous correct in every way and snubby was so very much the opposite cheeky idiotic and unexpected in all he did mrs lynton had quite a few qualms when she thought of them in the house together as for loony he would probably drive the old man mad all the same loony was a darling and mrs lynton like everyone else had fallen under his spell dear silkycoated meltingeyed loony there was probably only one person in the household who would regard loony with bitter dislike and that was sardine at last the two rooms were done the guestroom looked nice and bright and clean flowers arranged by diana stood on the dressingtable bright yellow daffodils matched by the yellow towels hanging by the basin rogers room looked different now that it had the extra divan in it wasnt very big anyhow and looked very crowded now with the divan and an extra chair mrs lynton also added an old rug in one corner for loony to sleep on oh mother whats the good of that said roger you know where loony always sleeps on snubbys feet his mother sighed it looked as if these holidays were going to be just a little bit too exciting she was quite right they were chapter snubby enjoys himself snubby was pleased to be going to his cousins home for the holidays he liked mrs lynton their mother and he quite liked mr lynton though he was secretly afraid of his sudden tempers it would be good to see diana and roger again his luggage had gone in advance he only had a small bag with him and loony of course he was now waiting for the train a snubnosed redhaired freckled boy of twelve he whistled tunelessly as he waited and loony pricked up his ears as he always did when his beloved master made a noise of any sort the train came in with such a roar and rumble that loony was startled he jerked away in alarm and rushed into the waitingroom where he cowered under a seat snubby followed indignantly what do you think youre doing idiot rushing away like that anyone would think youd never seen a train before come here the train gave a piercing whistle and loony cowered back still farther snubby had a job to get him to move look here the train will be gone before weve caught it if you dont look out shouted snubby exasperated come out i tell you whats come over you he dragged poor loony out at last lumped him into his arms and staggered to the train the porter was already slamming the doors hey you get in quickly yelled the man trains just going poor snubby had no chance to choose his carriage carefully as he usually did he liked a completely empty one so that he could occupy each corner in turn and look out of any window he liked there was no time to look into even one carriage now he wrenched open a door threw loony in and fell in himself landing on hands and knees the porter slammed the door and the train moved off loony retired under the seat snubby glared at him idiotic dog you nearly made us miss the train he got up and dusted himself down he looked round the carriage only one other person was there thank goodness the one other person stared at snubby in annoyed surprise he was an old man with a head of silverywhite hair a real mane his eyes were a faded blue and he had a small pointed beard also very white my boy he said it is most inadvisable to leave so little time for catching a train ive been waiting for twenty minutes said snubby indignantly here loony come on out youll get filthy under there loony appeared his tail well between his legs the old man looked at him with dislike dogs he said i think they should travel in the guards van they always smell and they scratch themselves in such an objectionable manner of course dogs smell said snubby sitting down opposite the old man its a nice smell a doggy smell so is a horsy smell and i like a cows smell too and as for i dont think i want to discuss smells said the old man i do not like the smell of dogs and i do not like the way they scratch themselves loony never scratches said snubby at once a dog only scratches when hes got heaps of fleas i keep loony jolly clean brush him every single day and loony put himself into a peculiar position and began to scratch himself very hard indeed making a thumping noise against the floor of the carriage snubby pushed him crossly with the toe of his shoe shut up idiot didnt you hear what i just said loony looked up politely and then began to scratch himself again the old man looked disgusted do you mind taking him to the other end of the carriage he said bearing in mind your remark about dogs only scratching themselves when they have a large number of fleas i dont feel too happy about having him in quite such close proximity whats that mean asked snubby obstinately not moving i tell you he hasnt got fleas hes never i dont think i want to discuss fleas said the old man stiffly well if you wont move your dog i must move myself but i must say that children nowadays are not remarkable for their good manners snubby hastily removed loony to the other end of the carriage feeling rather ashamed of himself the spaniel tried to climb up the seat but the old man looked so very disapproving that snubby changed his mind about letting him loony fortunately went to sleep snubby undid his case and took out a papercovered book he settled down to read the old man looked to see what snubby was reading the book had a most lurid cover and an extraordinary title it was called spies spies spies snubby curled himself up lost to the world the old man was astonished to see such a peculiar title what is your book about he asked at last snubby thought that was a silly question considering that the books title was plainly to be seen its about spies he said stealing old maps and plans and things like that the old man gazed at snubby and then made a curious remark spies i never thought of that it might have been spies snubby looked up astonished funny old fellow he thought whats he talking about now its strange you should be reading a book about old documents being stolen said the old man because ive just left a place where theres been a theft of that kind terrible terrible snubby stared at him what exactly was stolen he asked the letter of lord macaulay of maps of the county of lincolnshire and the correspondence between lady eleanor ritchie and her sister said the old man shaking his head solemnly and the old recipes of the dowager lady lucy and this was all greek to snubby he began to think the old man was pulling his leg all right he could do some of that too and i suppose the pedigree tables of all the dogs went too and the letters written by lord popoffski he said solemnly and sympathetically now it was the old mans turn to stare ah i see you dont believe me he said with dignity well let me tell you this young man the thief got into a locked room without unlocking it he got into a room with every window fastened and didnt unfasten one he left no fingerprints he made no noise snubby didnt believe a word he looked disbelievingly at the old man well said the old fellow thats a queer story isnt it too queer for me ive left the house where it all happened and im not going back there i dont like thieves who go through locked doors do you snubby put down his book if there was to be a bit of storytelling well he would do some too funny you should tell me this sir he said earnestly im running away too ive unearthed a plot sir a very sinister plot good gracious said the old man alarmed what kind of a plot sort of atombomb plot sir went on snubby enjoying himself they tried to get me sir and they very nearly did who tried to get you asked the old man amazed sh said snubby mysteriously looking all round the compartment as if he thought they were listening its the green hands sir surely youve heard of that gang no no i cant say i have said the old man who are they an international gang sir said snubby enjoying himself more and more and marvelling at his powers of invention theyve got the secret of the atom bomb sir and i stumbled on it by accident they captured me and wanted me to work for them what a boy like you said the old man they can use boys said snubby for experiments and so on you know well i didnt want to be blown to bits did i good heavens said the old fellow this is incredible you should go to the police im running away said snubby sinking his voice to a whisper but theyre after me sir the green hands i know they are theyll track me down theyll get me in the end but this is unbelievable said the old man mopping his forehead with a big white silk handkerchief first i stay in a house where thieves go through locked doors and fastened windows and now i travel with a boy hunted by by what did you say the green hands do they do they have green hands they wear green gloves invented snubby wildly beware if you ever see anyone wearing green gloves wont you man or woman yes yes i certainly will said the old man my poor boy have you no parents to look after you no said snubby telling the truth for the first time in five minutes i havent im fleeing to the country to stay with my cousins i hope the green hands dont track me there i dont want the whole lot of us blown up good heavens incredible the things that happen these days said the old man take my advice my boy and go to the police the train drew to a stop snubby looked out casually and then leapt to his feet suddenly startling the old man considerably golly this is my station here loony wake up stir yourself goodbye sir and i hope you catch your lockeddoor thief goodbye my boy weve had a most interesting conversation and take my advice go to but his words were lost in the whistling of the engine and the slamming of the door snubby was gone and so was loony the old man sank back in his seat well well well what was the world coming to to think that even a young boy could be mixed up in such extraordinary plots most alarming nobodys safe these days thought the old man gloomily its all most alarming chapter an unexpected meeting snubby arrived on the platform very hurriedly fell over loony and sat down with a bump a squeal of laughter greeted him oh snubby cried dianas voice you always fall out of a train hallo loony loony flung himself on diana in a mad bound almost knocking her over he barked and yelped pawing her ecstatically she had to push him off at last no loony no more get down snubby tell him hes just as loony as ever isnt he i say rogers sorry he couldnt come and meet you but hes gone to the next station to meet greatuncle robert why you couldnt both come to the same station i dont know i suppose greatuncle thought the next one was nearer to us whos greatuncle asked snubby in surprise ive never heard of him before surely hes not coming to stay yes he is maddening isnt it considering its our hols said diana as they walked out of the station hes not a bad old thing only awfully pompous and polite mother didnt know till yesterday that he was coming weve had to put you in rogers room oooh good said snubby loony will like that does he still take every brush he can find asked diana he was awful last summer hols yes hes still pretty bad about brushes said snubby and mats and cats too i say youve got a cat now havent you yes a big black one called sardine said diana shes almost a year old so shes still pretty idiotic at times i dont know how shell get on with loony itll be a lively household said snubby pleased cats and dogs flying all over the place and us three and your old greatgreatuncle only one great said diana hes daddys uncle well theres our house loony remembers it look hes rushing in at the gate my word hell startle old sardine shes basking on the wall snubby ran after loony loony had already discovered sardine and was chasing her madly round the front garden yelping in excitement sardine flew into the house loony raced after her and snubby tore after them both mrs lynton was amazed to see sardine flash past her head and land on top of the bookcase she was even more amazed to see loony coming in like a streak of black lightning followed by a shouting snubby oh its you arriving snubby i might have guessed she said theres really not much difference between you and a tornado how are you dear hallo aunt susan said snubby come here loony oh good sardines gone out of the window now gosh so has loony he disappeared at top speed and mrs lynton sat down again with a sigh peace always vanished when snubby arrived there were loud cries from the garden and finally a scream from diana mother heres greatuncle in a taxi with roger mrs lynton got up hurriedly she wondered what uncle robert would say when he found the front garden full of yells and yelps howls and yowls and screaming children she went into the garden and hissed at snubby catch loony at once take him away go and wash your hands or something snubby gave her a startled glance how cross she sounded he gave a piercing whistle and loony responded at once he arrived like a cannonball at snubbys heels and the two disappeared indoors just as greatuncle robert opened the front gate diana smoothed back her hair and went to welcome him too so nice to be here at last my dear susan said the old fellow such a peaceful place far from thieves and wars and spies mrs lynton felt astonished oh were peaceful enough here out in the country she said come along up to your room you will like a wash i expect thank you my dear thank you said uncle robert and followed his niece up the stairs she took him to the guestroom and put his bag down for him very nice room said uncle robert very nice view too beautiful ah whos this it was loony he came nosing into the bedroom having smelt somebody new he stood at the door wagging his black stump of a tail his long ears drooping like a judges wig at each side of his head uncle robert looked at him most peculiar he said there was a dog in the train in my carriage exactly like that oh well black cockers are very much alike said mrs lynton now you wash uncle robert and then come down to lunch you must be hungry she went to a cupboard on the landing to put some things away snubby was whistling in rogers room brushing his wiry hair and making it stand up straighter than ever he suddenly missed loony hey loony where have you got to he said he went to find him ah there he was standing in the doorway of the room next but one he went to get him somebody came walking out at the same moment stepping carefully over loony who didnt attempt to move out of the way he never did if people were stupid enough to walk round or over him snubby stopped in the utmost amazement when he saw greatuncle robert he stared as if he couldnt believe his eyes greatuncle robert stared too incredible he muttered taking a step backwards and nearly falling over loony you again what are you doing here im staying with my cousins said snubby horrified to see that the old man in the train had suddenly become greatuncle robert gosh this was frightful that awful story he had told him about the gang called green hands suppose he told aunt susan about it what in the world would she say she wouldnt understand at all she would be furious so you ran away here began uncle robert do your cousins know why sh said snubby desperately dont say a word to anyone remember the green hands theyll get you too if you split split repeated uncle robert faintly not understanding the word blab spill the beans give the game away said snubby urgently dont say a word just remember the green hands the gong in the hall suddenly sounded for lunch and both uncle robert and snubby jumped violently sh said snubby again and looked all round him as if he were being hunted ill remember the green hands said uncle robert in a stronger voice but be careful my boy do be careful he went downstairs wiping his broad forehead with his silk handkerchief he had escaped from one house where thieves made their way through locked doors only to come to another place where there was a boy hunted by the green hands where should he go next incredible quite incredible up on the landing halfhidden by the open cupboard door was a most astonished mrs lynton she had overheard the extraordinary conversation and couldnt understand a word of it what was all this talk of green hands and all the shushings and warnings she had heard she was filled with amazement whats snubby up to now and how does he know uncle robert and what is this talk of green hands she thought shutting the cupboard door impatiently an agonised yowl made her jump she opened the door hurriedly and sardine jumped out silly cat why put your tail in the door when you know im going to shut it said mrs lynton youre always doing things like that there now im sorry i hurt your tail and just look out for loony because i dont want you streaking across the diningtable as soon as you see him loony was downstairs with the others he had attached himself to greatuncle robert much to dianas surprise he was sniffing round his feet and pawing at his legs in a most friendly manner hes acting just as if hes met you before said diana er is he said uncle robert not knowing quite what to say snubby call him off will you i dont particularly want his fleas you know how do you know hes got fleas asked roger surprised has he snubby it looked as if the conversation was now going to be awkward snubby pulled loony away and shoved him firmly under the table of course he hasnt got fleas he said youd jolly well know if he had why a chap at school had a dog that had about three hun mrs lynton came in still looking puzzled what are you talking about she asked sitting down at the head of the table nobody told her she didnt encourage subjects of that sort at mealtimes uncle robert took his place gingerly looking under the table to see exactly where loony was whats that noise inquired mrs lynton hearing a thumpthumpthump on the floor under the table oh just loony scratching himself said diana oh dear snubby and i hope you havent brought loony here with began mrs lynton no aunt susan i havent said snubby hurriedly i say is that chops and chip potatoes and onions golly how smashing the subject was safely changed mrs lynton served the meal still wondering about such curious things as green hands she glanced at uncle robert he seemed such a nice harmless old fellow what did he mean whispering about running away and green hands up on the landing with snubby it was really most extraordinary chapter greatuncle tells his story after the meal snubby escaped into the garden with roger and diana loony at their heels they all went into the little summerhouse which faced south and was very warm in the april sun gosh its as hot as summer said roger ill really have to take off my coat i say greatuncle is rather an old stick isnt he well have to mind our manners a bit now or hell get going on the good old days when children knew their manners and were seen and not heard and all the rest of it ive got something to tell you said snubby rather awkwardly about greatuncle go on then out with it what have you been doing using his hairlotion for loony or something asked roger dont try and be funny said snubby it doesnt suit you listen i came in the train with him and i got off at the north station and he went on to south where you met him we had quite a lot of er conversation the other two looked at him in surprise you did said diana well why ever didnt you say so then why keep it such a deep dark secret well you see its like this he told me a silly story about running away from somewhere hed been staying because thieves had got through locked doors and stolen papers and things said snubby lord somebodys letters and lady somebodys recipes a lot of awful nonsense and well i told him a story too i thought to myself well two can play at this game and i sort of let myself go do you mean you went and stuffed him up with some frightful fairy tale said roger whatever did you tell him snubby related the story he had told to greatuncle robert ending with his running away from a gang called green hands who always wore green gloves diana and roger listened in astonishment that ended in giggles gosh snubby you really are the biggest fathead that ever lived said roger at last what in the world did you go and stuff greatuncle up with that for well how was i to know he was your greatuncle demanded snubby i didnt know youd even got one and i certainly didnt know he was coming to stay with you i got a shock i can tell you when i saw him in the guestroom i nearly passed out youll get another when he tells dad the rigmarole you told him said roger dad doesnt like fairy tales of that sort he doesnt understand that mad of joke i know said snubby dismally ive warned greatuncle not to say a word he really believes it all you see i expect hes terrified of the green hands gang now just as terrified as he is of the thieves that walked through the locked doors at the house where he was staying well he must be a mutt if he believes a word you say said diana oh dear snubby you always bring trouble with you now dont you go frightening the old man with sinister notes or drawings of green hands or anything oooh thats an idea said snubby sitting up oooh i say wouldnt he have a fit yes he would and the first thing hed do would be to tell dad and youd get a whacking said roger thats no go then said snubby who had quite clear memories of one of uncle richards whackings i dont want to go too far with uncle richard youd better not said roger hes not in a very good mood so far these hols because greatuncle has come to stay i think and what with that and us and you and loony life seems pretty grim to him at the moment poor dad said diana wed better keep out of his way its an idea said snubby making up his mind not to obtrude himself on his uncle richard any more than could be helped i say i wonder if greatuncle will tell his thiefstory to uncle and aunt he did that very night they were all sitting in the lounge together the children playing a game mrs lynton sewing her husband reading and loony having one of his lengthy rolls all over the floor greatuncle filled his pipe and then spoke to mrs lynton its really very kind of you susan to have me here at such short notice he said but to tell you the truth i was at my wits end i simply had to leave the manor house did you uncle robert why werent you comfortable asked mrs lynton oh yes quite very warm comfortable house the manor house at chelie said uncle robert but there were such extraordinary goingson you know mrs lynton looked rather startled the children nudged one another and laid down their cards now its coming whispered snubby mr lynton put down the evening paper what extraordinary goingson he asked surely not much can happen in a house like that thats more a museum than anything else its a place of great treasures said greatuncle reprovingly it belongs to sir john huberry as you know a man who collects rarities of many kinds in particular old papers letters and documents er hasnt he got some of lord macaulays letters said snubby innocently remembering what greatuncle had mentioned in the train there was a surprised silence during which loony could be heard scratching himself vigorously shut up loony said snubby and poked him with his toe loony stopped well its the first time ive ever heard you make an intelligent remark said mr lynton in surprise i shouldnt have thought you had ever heard of lord macaulays name er snubby is quite right said greatuncle hastily there were some of macaulays letters they were among the stolen articles richard it was the most extraordinary theft doors were locked windows were fastened tightly there was no skylight or other way into the room where these papers were kept and yet one night thieves got in took the whole lot and vanished the way they came through locked doors or fastened windows what do you think of that i think its rather foolish to make a statement like that said mr lynton thieves cant get through locked doors unless they have a key well they hadnt a key said greatuncle the keys are kept on sir johns keyring in his pocket there are no duplicates in existence what is more the doors showed no fingerprints of any sort the thieves wore gloves said mrs lynton green gloves said snubby before he could stop himself greatuncle looked extremely startled mrs lynton stared at snubby puzzled first it was green hands now it was green gloves what did he mean mr lynton took no notice of snubbys remark he just put it down to snubbys usual silliness well uncle robert he said picking up his paper again all i can say is if thats what you ran away from the idea of thieves going through locked doors it wasnt very sensible of you you should have stayed to try and find out who stole the papers why if your hosts didnt know you well they might think it was you as you ran away i hardly think so said greatuncle on his high horse at once no my dear richard that is quite unthinkable quite i expect it was gypsies or tramps said mrs lynton soothingly greatuncle gave a most unexpected snort he looked scornfully at mrs lynton my dear susan do you think a gipsy or a tramp would know what papers were valuable and what were not this thief knew exactly what to take well ive no doubt the mystery will be solved sooner or later said mr lynton opening his paper again i imagine if the thief is as clever as you say hell try his hand somewhere else hes already tried it three tunes said greatuncle sir john told me he thinks it must be the same thieves because each tune they apparently passed through locked doors quite easily well ill believe somebody can go through locked doors when i see them said mr lynton dryly greatuncle do you think the thief will steal papers again somewhere asked diana id like to read about it if he does would it be in the papers oh yes said greatuncle its always in the paper i think ive got a report of the last theft in my bag you can go and get it if you like roger sped upstairs with loony at his heels loony always went upstairs with everybody if he could and then tried to get in their way going down again either by getting between their legs or hurling himself on top of them as they went down there was a thunderous noise after a minute or two and then a crash and a yelp oh dear said mrs lynton are you hurt roger roger came limping in followed by a saddened loony ive smacked him he explained to snubby he did his cannonball act at me and sent me flying down the stairs hes loonier than ever ive got the paper wheres the burglary reported greatuncle greatuncle found the report it wasnt much more than a few lines the children read them eagerly then diana noticed an advertisement nearby and pointed to it look she said theres a notice about a fair held in the same town i wonder if barney and miranda were there is this the barney you told me about the boy with the monkey that had the adventure with you last summer holidays asked his mother roger nodded yes hes awfully nice mother he leads a peculiar sort of life you know going from fair to circus and circus to fair earning his living with miranda his monkey shes a darling mrs lynton looked doubtful well i dont like monkeys she said but from all you have told me barney seems a nice boy though a queer roving kind of character i wonder if hes at the fair advertised here said diana looking at the notice again look roger it gives all the performers the main ones anyway vosta and his two chimpanzees hurly and burly what lovely names tonnerre and his elephants shooting gallery in charge of the famous cracksman billy tell short for william tell i suppose grinned snubby go on hoopla stalls roundabouts swingboats no it doesnt say anything about a boy with a monkey said diana disappointed though perhaps they wouldnt mention him really ho wouldnt be one of the chief performers anyone got his address asked snubby nobody had barney was a very bad letterwriter and the children had not heard from him since christmas come on lets finish our game said roger losing interest in the paper no you cant get on my knee loony go and play with sardine a nice little game of spitandhiss or growlandsnap youll like that chapter diana has an idea a day or two went by greatuncle tried to settle down and go on writing what he called his memoirs which roger said were another name for nodding over a pipe snubby had settled in at once as usual he was perfectly at home and rogers usually neat bedroom now always looked exactly as if a whirlwind had just passed by if snubby doesnt mess it about loony does roger complained im tired of keeping my shoes and the bedroom slippers and hairbrushes in a drawer so that loony cant get them so am i said diana and i do wish he wouldnt drag all the mats in a heap and leave them on the landing or in the hall for people to fall over i nearly broke my ankle twice yesterday as for poor greatuncle hes so scared of falling over mats or brushes left about that he walks like a cat on hot bricks lifting up his feet very gingerly indeed roger laughed oh dear that lunatic dog put half a dozen brushes into the pond this morning and two of them were greatuncles snubby told him he supposed mother was washing the brushes in pondwater because it was good for them and he believed him theres looney now barking at sardine i suppose said diana she leaned out of the window loony loony shut up havent you learnt by now that once sardine is up on the wall you cant get her off shut up her mothers voice came floating up from the garden diana stop yelling out of the window like that your greatuncle is trying to work that means loonys woken him up from a doze said diana pulling her head in she put it out again mother mother shall i do the flowers this morning will you stop shouting out of the window called back her mother whilst greatuncle robert flung down his pipe in exasperation and stood up he would go for a walk what with dogs barking and children yelling and now his niece yelling too the house was unbearable yes he would go for a walk but at the sight of him appearing in coat and hat with a stick in his hand loony flung himself on him in delight a walk people with hats and coats on meant only one thing a walk loony snuffled round greatuncles ankles thrilled and then rolled over on his back doing what snubby called his bicycling act riding an imaginary bicycle upside down you are not coming with me said greatuncle firmly i dont like you you can only do two things well and i dont like either of them you can bark louder than any dog i know and you can scratch yourself more vigorously but loony meant to come with him he kept so close to greatuncles ankles all the way to the gate that he almost tripped him up home said greatuncle sternly home woof said loony and sat down expectantly exactly as if greatuncle had said bone not home the old man tried to open the gate quickly and slip out without loony but loony was up to that game he was out in the road with greatuncle at once dancing round him maddeningly the old man lost his temper snubby he yelled call this dog of yours call him i say do you hear me boy a woman opposite came over to greatuncle im so sorry she said but may i ask you not to shout and not to let your dog bark so much your shouting and his barking have kept my baby awake half the morning greatuncle was really exasperated he walked off down the road thumping the pavement with his stick i kept her baby awake what rubbish and calling loony my dog i wouldnt own him for a hundred pounds but it certainly looked as if he did because loony kept faithfully with him during the whole of the walk occasionally halfdisappearing down a rabbithole but always coming back poor greatuncle he bought himself a paper and came back reading it as he walked he suddenly stood still and gave an exclamation loony sat down beside him and looked at him what was this old gentleman up to now loony hadnt any use for him really except to snatch a walk with him now and again look at that said greatuncle another robbery same kind of thing and same way of going about it locked doors again extraordinary he showed the report of the new theft to mrs lynton when he got back the children crowded round in interest see said greatuncle pointing to the paragraphs with a beautifully clean and polished nail another robbery rare and valuable papers again and not a trace of the thieves doors locked and windows bolted and yet the things are gone theres something queer about all this green hands whispered roger mischievously behind him greatuncle turned sharply but rogers face was innocent can i borrow the paper please asked diana thanks awfully she took it to the summerhouse and the three of them pored over it diana looked rather pleased with herself ive discovered something she announced to the others have you roger considered no what he asked well you know the first paper we saw the one greatuncle brought with him and let us read said diana do you remember the bit about the fair yes what about it said roger theres nothing about a fair in this paper i know ive looked said diana but did you notice what the first paper said about the fair where it was going to next it said it was going to pilbury pilbury does that ring a bell gosh yes said roger at once this theft is at pilbury i see what youre getting at either the fair goes to places where there are rare papers to be stolen or somebody in the fair makes inquiries at each place they go to to see if there are any in the neighbourhood worth stealing thats what i meant said diana lets find out if the fair was actually at pilbury when the papers disappeared shall we yes though i must say were rather jumping to conclusions said roger its probably sheer coincidence i bet it is said snubby just like diana to think shes spotted something clever diana gave him a push get out of the summerhouse if youre going to talk like that go on if youre not interested you neednt be i am interested protested snubby and dont shove me like that if you want a shoving match you know wholl win you wont anyway and all i said was if you say it again out you go said diana getting angry im tired of you today snubby youve hidden my gloves i know you have and you left my bedroom door open so that loony could take my mats again and now just look at loony hes got somebodys brush again its greatuncles hairbrush this time snubby ran to get the brush away from loony who at once regarded this as a wonderful game and danced away down the garden flinging the brush up into the air and catching it in his mouth diana turned to roger roger there maynt be anything in my idea at all lets find out first whether the fair is at pilbury and then lets try and find out where its going to next and see if a theft of rare papers is reported from there too its quite an idea di said roger well bike over this afternoon its not more than ten miles away well leave snubby behind im getting tired of him so they said nothing of their plans to snubby but got out their bicycles without his seeing and had a look to see if the tyres were all right yes they were they set off after lunch creeping off whilst snubby was arguing with their mother about some missing shoes which she was perfectly certain loony knew something about they mounted their bicycles and rode gleefully off down the road sucks to snubby said roger wont he be wild hell hunt all over the place for us it was a long way to pilbury farther than they thought but they got there at last they rode all through it but could see no fair diana felt a little dampened well ask someone said roger and he got off his bicycle he called to a small boy nearby hey sonny is there a fair in pilbury do you know there was called back the boy but its gone went yesterday to ricklesham i heard thanks said roger and beamed at diana well it was here and now its at ricklesham well just see if theres a robbery there next then well know your ideas got something in it i say this is rather exciting isnt it chapter snubby says something silly snubby was most annoyed with the other two when they came back where have you been you beasts youve been for a bike ride and didnt tell me well you were so jolly unbelieving in the summerhouse we thought wed go off alone said diana sucks to you snubby whatevers the matter with loony asked roger staring at the spaniel in surprise why is he looking so dismal he didnt even come rushing to meet us hes in trouble said snubby sos sardine they chased your mothers ball of wool all round the lounge and didnt have the sense to see it was joined to a jersey shes knitting they undid the ball for about a mile of wool rolled it out to the kitchen and almost into the pond aunt susans awfully cross she smacked poor old loony so hard that he went under the sofa for half an hour and she tried to smack sardine but she escaped just like a cat said roger poor old loony you go and eat up sardines dinner said diana encouragingly to loony he wouldnt touch sardines if he were starving said snubby where have you been you two they told him so you see the fairs gone to ricklesham now said roger and now well just wait and see if any burglary occurs there i wish we could hear from barney said diana he might know some of the people in the fair hes been all over the country now in fairs and circuses and shows id like to see old barney again and dear little miranda said snubby who had a very soft spot for the small monkey belonging to barney is it any good writing to barneys last address we did that said roger no answer came at all well have to wait till he writes to us himself a strange dog ventured into the garden it went out again at top speed as loony hurled himself at it yelping madly hes feeling better now said snubby looking at loony his tails got a wag again loony disappeared into the house his little tail wagging he came out again with the brush from the sittingroom fireplace look at that said roger exasperated im always carrying brushes about now putting them back in their places loony your dippy he and diana went in with the brush snubby went off to the summerhouse with a book but greatuncle was there smoking his pipe oh sorry sir said snubby and began hastily to retreat quite all right my boy come along in said greatuncle theres plenty of room for two i want to talk to you snubby never liked to hear that a grownup wanted to talk to him it usually meant a tickingoff of some sort he sat down with a sigh about this gang of yours said greatuncle in his rather pompous voice this er green hands gang wasnt that what you called it have you heard anything more about them or was it possibly a little makeup of yours snubby considered he didnt really want to give up his lovely idea of a green hands gang that wore green gloves on the other hand it wouldnt do to work up greatuncle about it because he might be foolish enough to say something to uncle richard then the fat would be in the fire uncle richard wouldnt see that a silly pretend didnt matter he would call it a lie and treat it as such and snubby wouldnt be let off lightly i think the gang have lost track of me said snubby at last deciding that would be the safest thing to say i havent heard a word from them since ive been here he added truthfully really said greatuncle eyeing snubby in a way he didnt much like er perhaps you think the gang have bigger fish to fry other things that are more important than you snubby blinked was greatuncle getting at him a sudden thought flashed into his mind and was out in words before he could stop it yes i think youre right sir and i think youll hear of their activities next at ricklesham ricklesham said greatuncle surprised why ricklesham snubby now wished he hadnt spoken so quickly he fidgeted uncomfortably on the wooden seat dont know sir just a hunch you see if you knew that gang as well as i do youd sort of know where they were going to to operate next bless us all said greatuncle staring at snubby i dont know what to make of you talking of gangs and how they operate and looking just a dirty untidy boy with the most disgusting fingernails i ever saw that was a nasty jab snubby took a hurried look at his nails everybody was always worrying him about them why couldnt they mind their own business he didnt sneer at their clean nails why should they sneer at his dirty ones he got up ill go and clean my nails sir he said pleased at having thought of such a good excuse to get away before greatuncle asked more searching questions about the gang a very good idea said greatuncle and while youre about it wash behind your ears and see if you can possibly reach the back of your neck snubby fled nasty sarcastic old man snubby brushed his nails hard with the nailbrush and thought darkly that it would be rather nice to have a real gang to frighten people like greatuncle diana called to him from her room snubby is that you come here a minute he went into dianas room she and roger were sitting on her bed with a map spread out between them whats that asked snubby its a map with ricklesham on it said diana we thought we might as well see exactly where it is in case we want to go over to the fair its about six miles off well take you with us next time if you behave yourself gosh look at snubbys nails hes cleaned them said roger astonished you turning over a new leaf snubby shut up said snubby feeling quite ashamed of his spotless nails greatuncles been on at me about them i say i said rather a silly thing to him well thats nothing new said roger what did you say this time he began asking me in a sneering sort of voice about the green hands gang said snubby and when i said i hadnt heard a word from them he said in a horrid scornful voice i suppose theyve got bigger fish to fry and i said yes they might be operating next at ricklesham there was a moments silence diana and roger stared at snubby in dismay well youre a bigger idiot than i thought you were said roger at last suppose there is a robbery at ricklesham whats greatuncle going to think that it is your silly green hands gang and you are mixed up in it and hell most certainly split on you and tell dad i know said poor snubby looking very downcast i thought of all that afterwards youre crazy said diana here we are on the track of something exciting and you go and blab about it to greatuncle and mix it up with your idiotic fairy tale perhaps there wont be a burglary at ricklesham suggested snubby hopefully but that didnt find favour with the others either thats right pour cold water on our ideas now said diana tell us were wrong make out its silly to im not diana im not cried poor snubby feeling that whatever he said would be wrong ill believe anything you tell me really i will shall we let him go with us if we go to ricklesham or not said roger grimly to diana well see said diana any more fatheadedness on his part and we dont tell him a thing snubby departed to find loony feeling very subdued he fell over on the stairs and roger and diana heard him rolling down yelling they grinned thats sardine again said diana she always lies in wait for snubby on the stairs do you really think therell be a burglary at ricklesham asked roger folding up the map well not really said diana i did feel it was a sort of hunch you know but its a bit farfetched actually isnt it i dont suppose anything will happen there at all well watch the papers said roger and what a thrill it will be if we see ricklesham in the news chapter snubby in difficulties three or four days went by each morning the three children took the paper after the grownups had finished with it and pored over it but ricklesham was never in the news it was most disappointing and then suddenly it was mr lynton was glancing down the paper one morning when something caught his eye he read it quickly and then spoke to greatuncle robert uncle he said heres a bit of news for you didnt you have something to do with the arranging of some old seventeenthcentury letters or documents ive forgotten what they were for the forbesking collection yes yes i did said greatuncle a very fine collection that was most interesting old letters why what does it say about them theyve been stolen said mr lynton and the three children sat up at once in excitement stolen echoed greatuncle no have they really where from they were on loan to a mr curticeknowles at ricklesham house said mr lynton diana gave an exclamation roger kicked her under the table snubby looked anxiously at greatuncle ricklesham house ricklesham did you say said greatuncle in a faint voice good heavens ricklesham he looked at snubby snubby had said that the green hands gang might operate at ricklesham next and lo and behold what it had done but steal valuable old documents there greatuncle did some rapid thinking then that meant yes it must mean that the green hands gang that snubby was afraid of was the same one that was mixed up with the continual theft of precious documents it must have been that very gang that came into chelie manor house when i was there and stole all those papers thought greatuncle robert fancy that boy being mixed up with them most extraordinary ill have to have a long talk with him about all this really the police should be told snubby wouldnt look at greatuncle he was terrified that he would suddenly ask him awkward questions fortunately mrs lynton plunged into the matter and asked several questions but richard do you think that its the same thieves who went to chelie manor house when uncle robert was there does it say anything about locked doors did the thieves go through fastened windows and locked doors again yes apparently it is just as mysterious a theft as the others said her husband there is a small room set apart at ricklesham house for these old and rare papers and they are displayed under glass cases the door to this room was locked of course the windows are not only safely fastened but also barred so the paper says and yet the things were stolen said mrs lynton well it certainly sounds very mysterious the police must be very puzzled greatuncle took the paper and read the report very carefully there was no mention of a green hands gang how on earth did snubby know that there was going to be a crime committed at ricklesham he lifted his head to have another look at snubby but snubby had gone he had mentioned to his aunt in a low voice that he didnt want any more breakfast could he go please dont you feel well dear began mrs lynton but seeing that snubbys cheeks were the same fiery red as usual she felt there was nothing serious wrong so she nodded and snubby slipped away thankful that greatuncle was buried in the paper there was an excited meeting in the summerhouse that morning snubby diana and roger rushed there as soon as their jobs were done loony rushed too sensing the excitement roger greatuncle kept on and on looking at me at breakfasttime said snubby as soon as they were safely in the wooden house i know hes going to ask me awkward questions i dont want to meet him at all say you dont know where i am if he asks you well we cant tell a lie if we do know where you are said diana but well do our best not to give you away it serves you right for talking too much now of course greatuncle will believe in your silly green hands gang all over again because of this upset at ricklesham i know groaned snubby loony go and sit outside on guard on guard do you hear and you jolly well know what that means bark if you see anyone coming loony thumped his little tail on the ground as he sat himself down in the sunshine he knew what on guard meant all right of course he did he barked loudly at once and snubby in a great flurry squeezed himself under the seat in the summerhouse while diana and roger sat just above their legs hiding him but it was only sardine arriving she had seen loony and wanted to have a game so she came walking up the path waving her tail in the air as usual black and sleek and purring loony knew now that her purr meant pax dont chase me just as she knew that when he wagged his tail it meant the same still he had to bark as he was on guard and sardine paused in surprise she sat down a good way from loony and began to wash herself loony could never imagine why cats washed themselves so much they were always doing it its all right snubby its only sardine said diana peering out of the summerhouse shut up loony youre on guard for people not cats shush loony stopped barking sardine strolled right up to him purring very loudly he wagged his stump of a tail sardine lay down stretched herself out on the path and patted his nose with her paw loony gave the tiniest bark it meant sorry i cant play now but im on guard so sardine went to sleep leaving a crack of one eye open just in case loony also settled down shutting both his eyes but listening with his long droopy ears snubby came out from under the seat draped with cobwebs and powdered with dust that idiot of a loony he grumbled look at me im in a frightful mess i cant see that you look much worse than usual said diana looking at him come on sit down again we really have got something to discuss they talked and talked about the affair they had all read the bit in the paper now they knew that once again valuable letters had been stolen and that once again the thief had apparently passed through locked doors or barred windows and more important still they knew that once again the fair had been in the same district as the burglary that couldnt be sheer coincidence it couldnt be chance the fair or somebody in the fair must be connected with these strange thefts and that somebody must be clever enough to know about rare documents where they were and how to get them the two things dont seem to go together somehow said roger thoughtfully i mean you dont associate show people with a knowledge of that kind of thing you have to be a person like well like uncle robert to know about historical documents you have to have a lot of specialised learning you mean you have to be an antiquarian said diana showing off a little thats what people of that kind are called uncle robert told me gosh i always thought an anti antiwhateveryousaid was somebody who was against keeping aquariums said snubby surprised roger laughed you would anyway its not antiaquarium idiot its antiquarian sounds just the same to me said snubby i say are we going to ricklesham do say we are roger looked at diana and they both nodded solemnly yes said roger well go to the fair and well snoop round and see if we can find out anyone there whos an antiquarian then we might be on the track thats an awfully good idea said snubby we can put the police on to him at once it wont be as easy as that said diana scornfully we loony set up a tremendous barking again snubby dived beneath the wooden seat once more and roger and diana sat close to hide him its greatuncle this time all right said roger keep still snubby well do our best for you greatuncle came to the entrance of the summerhouse he looked in ah he said i thought i should find you here i want to talk to snubby well tell him greatuncle said roger politely your mother said he was here said greatuncle did she said diana is she busy greatuncle does she want me yet no she didnt say she wanted any of you said greatuncle do you know where snubby is hes not far off said roger truthfully loonys never very far from him you know loony wagged his tail at his name he was most astonished to see snubby under the seat and would have liked to go to him but every time he went near either roger or diana pushed him off with a determined foot do you think hed hear me if i called him asked greatuncle i really do want to speak to him its important you could try shouting said diana greatuncle shouted snubby snubby i want you snubby there was no answer of course except that loony barked and sardine fled up to the wall do you think he heard me said greatuncle er if hes near enough he would certainly hear you said roger cautiously never mind greatuncle ill tell him you want him next time i speak to him greatuncle called again feeling somehow certain that snubby was not very far away otherwise why was loony there snubby i want you greatuncle that woman with her baby in the house opposite is looking out of the window said diana i hope her baby isnt asleep bless us all i forgot the baby said greatuncle the mother will be after me again well you tell snubby ive been looking for him will you he went off down the path and roger and diana heaved sighs of relief you can come out now snubby said roger hes gone snubby came out dirtier than ever you did jolly well he said admiringly never told a lie at all and didnt give me away either thanks awfully i dont know how youre going to manage to avoid greatuncle all day long said diana itll be difficult it wont said snubby beaming lets bike over to ricklesham for the day take our lunch and everything right thats a fine idea said roger ill go and ask mother now come on di stay here snubby and well fetch you when were ready so long chapter off to the fair mrs lynton thought it would be a very good idea for the three to go off for a picnic it would be a change to have a nice quiet house for once uncle robert would like it too wheres snubby she said your greatuncle has been calling all over the place for him has he got into trouble with him i dont think so said roger mother i suppose we couldnt have hardboiled eggs could we and tomato sandwiches and i suppose there arent any jam tarts left over from yesterday are there youre doing quite a lot of supposing said his mother suppose you go and ask cook what shes got she happens to be pleased with you because you took the trouble to fetch the fish for her yesterday so ive no doubt she will look favourably on all your supposing cook did she willingly did them hardboiled eggs put salt and pepper into a screw of paper made tomato and lettuce sandwiches by the dozen added plain bread and butter for the eggs nine jam tarts and enormous slices of ginger cake oooh i say can you really spare us some of that said roger you only made it yesterday its chockful of bits of ginger and some chopped up cherries its a heavenly cake greatuncle appeared in the doorway oh i thought i heard you here have you seen snubby roger turned to cook have you seen snubby he asked innocently cook shook her head hasnt been near the kitchen this morning she said and thats unusual i never did see a boy that came snooping round for titbits so often no nor a dog either its funny i cant find him said greatuncle irritably hes always about when hes not wanted and never here when he is now ive got someone coming to see me in a few minutes he went diana winked at roger did you hear that hes got someone coming to see him so well just be able to slip off nicely with snubby lets get some bottles of ginger bear to take with us and well be ready in five minutes time they were ready the lunch was packed into two neat parcels roger and diana carried the food and drink to the bicycle shed ill just pop round to the study and see if greatuncles got his visitor yet said roger he came back immediately yes he has come on get the bikes ill wheel snubbys hurry they hurried they put the lunch into the baskets and strapped a big oblong box on to snubbys back mudguard they put a small rug inside that was for loony if he got tired of running beside them he was very good at sitting in the box and going along like that they wheeled the bikes to the summerhouse loony ran to meet them in delight barking madly bikes meant a long long run no time for rabbitholes alas but still a lovely long run snubby peered out he could hear them ringing their bicycle bells to tell him he was safe got everything oh good he said wheres greatuncle hes seeing somebody said diana weve got the lunch basket and some ginger beer weve strapped on loonys carrier too lets go while the goings good so they went they cycled down the path and round by the window greatuncle saw them and stared after snubby in exasperation there he is i thought hed turn up just when i couldnt see him loony ran along by snubbys bicycle his red tongue hanging out feeling very happy indeed he knew the children would not go too fast for him if he got tired snubby would be the first to notice and stop then he would be lifted into the carrier box and be taken along like a lord in a carriage how loony looked down his long black nose at other dogs then well picnic at the fair or near it said roger we shall have plenty of time to look at everyone then if were sitting down in the fair field got any money said snubby jingling his in his pocket i like a fair i shall go on the roundabout and on the swings and have a go at hoopla i threw a ring over a super torch last time ive got plenty of holiday money left said roger so has diana more than i have well be all right well buy some icecreams too said diana youll have to remember not to take loony on the roundabout snubby he was awfully sick last time yes he wasted a perfectly good dinner said snubby didnt you loony are we going too fast loony was too out of breath to answer with a bark he didnt look tired he loped along on his silky black legs his long ears flapflapflapping as he went they stopped and put him into the carrierbox after about three miles that was as much as he could do at a run he sat in the box panting his tongue hanging out looking as long as his ears now hold tight loony said snubby getting on again here we go loony kept his balance perfectly and enjoyed his ride enormously snubby didnt enjoy it quite so much because loony was rather heavy still it was better than leaving him behind they came to ricklesham at last they had a look at the house from which the valuable papers had been stolen there was a policeman on guard at the gate that impressed the three children very much they got off their bicycles and looked in at the big gateway no one allowed in without a pass said the policeman not even a dog the children grinned do they know who the thief was yet asked roger not a clue said the policeman you on the job too the children laughed and rode off he little knew we were on the job more or less said diana now lets ask where the fair is they asked a woman over in longlands field the other side of the wood she said pointing they thanked her and rode off loony in the carrier again because of the traffic they skirted the wood and came to open country at the edge of it in a big field was the fair here we are said roger coming to a standstill and leaning against the fence on his bicycle looks pretty good to me quite a big fair there were round and oblong tents with flags flying there were caravans of all colours and shapes round the field there were horses grazing nearby and at the far end tied to a tree were two enormous elephants the roundabout was not going it stood there gay but silent set all round with wooden animals and birds lions tigers giraffes swans cats dogs bears and what looked like a chimpanzee swingboats were there too but no one was using them its dinnertime i expect said roger looking at his watch yes its a quarter to one i expect everything will be going strong this afternoon theres a shooting range over there said snubby ill have a shot afterwards i was pretty good last time i shot at a fair well tell me when youre going to shoot and ill get a mile away said diana i say what a big fair this is heaps of stalls and tents and things and theres nobody that looks in the least like an anti shut up said roger hedges and fences have ears as much as walls come on lets go through the gate and ask if we can picnic in the field well say were going to spend money at the fair afterwards they went through the gate and a shockheaded boy shouted to them hey you youre not allowed in till two oclock were coming to the fair all afternoon called back roger we only want to have our picnic here now do you mind okay shouted the boy he was a strangelooking fellow with his shock of yellow hair ears that stuck out at each side of his head and very wide grin he was small too smaller than snubby and yet he looked about fifteen wonder what he does in the fair said roger getting the lunch packet out of his bicycle basket di youve got the drinks loonys biscuits are in your basket snubby better keep him by us or hell be eaten up by that pack of mongrels over there loony had no intention of wandering away if there was any lunch going nor did he like the look of the lean hungrylooking dogs that were sitting down at a distance watching he growled at them just to tell them who he was it was a lovely picnic the hardboiled eggs went down well and so did the sandwiches loony got one or two but not many because the children were so terribly hungry he got no jam tart or cake but managed to beg two pieces of bread and butter from diana whats the time is it two oclock yet said snubby i can see some people wandering along up to the gate i expect the roundabout will start going soon the fair people were on the move too some shutters were being taken down from the stalls a man went over to the swingboats and idly swung one the shockheaded boy went to the shootingrange and handled a few guns whistling shrilly an elephant trumpeted and made loony jump people came out of caravans and hastened to various tents the fair was opening the children cleared up the litter even snubby was good about that never a scrap of paper was left lying about the grass when they had finished any picnic loony snuffled about for crumbs look whats that coming along said diana suddenly golly its a monkey isnt it all dressed up oh how sweet shes coming over here to us shes rather like miranda isnt she the little creature came right up to them and took a flying leap to snubbys shoulder she whispered excitedly in his ear and pulled his hair the others watched intently roger roger it is miranda i know it is cried diana suddenly and when she heard her name the tiny creature bounded up on to dianas shoulder and put her little paw down the girls neck just as miranda always used to do well if mirandas here barney is too cried snubby come on lets look for him fancy that barney chapter good old barney again they passed the shootingrange where the shockheaded boy was still polishing the guns and whistling is there a boy in the fair called barney asked roger yep that monkeys his said the boy with his wide grin lovaduck fancy miranda going to you like that fussing you up good and proper isnt she barney is here said diana joyfully and the three smiled at one another what a bit of luck and what a surprise too loony was jumping up trying to reach miranda he knew her all right she suddenly dropped down on his back and rode him like a little horse as she used to do but he knew how to deal with that he promptly rolled over and off she went she bounded chattering on to snubbys shoulder she was dressed in a tiny red skirt and a little blue coat with silver buttons down it she looked too amusing for words dear little miranda said roger patting the tiny monkey paw you saw us first didnt you you recognised us all right and came along straightaway youll find barney up by the hoopla stall called the shockheaded boy he runs it they hurried to the stall he was pointing at a boy stood there with his back to them arranging the goods neatly on the round stall so that people might throw hoops at them and try to ring a prize thats barney cried diana as he heard his name the boy swung round and sure enough it was barney barney with his corncoloured hair his brownasaberry face his strange blue eyes set so far apart and his wide engaging grin well heres a go he cried in amazement you kids all three of you hiya roger diana hiya snubby and loony still the same mad dog i see loony of course had recognised barney immediately and had hurled himself at him in his usual lunatic way barking and whining licking and nuzzling doing all he could to tell barney how pleased he was to see his friend once more miranda leapt to barneys shoulder chattering excitedly miranda found us first said diana she came over the field to us we didnt recognise her at first because shes wearing clothes now and she didnt before oh isnt she sweet barney its grand to see you grand said barney his blue eyes brilliant with pleasure ive been thinking of you a lot wanting to see you all again what are you doing here you didnt know i was here did you no of course not said roger we came over for a certain reason well tell you about it some time when were alone and we never really hoped to see you of course you might have told us you were so near us barney said diana reproachfully we only live a few miles away you know is that so said barney surprised his geography was not at all good he never had much idea where he was as he wandered round well to think of that im not much good at writing letters anyway still youre here you on holiday or something yes were home for the easter hols said snubby weve got about three more weeks barney how long are you going to be here were here a week said barney excuse for a bit ive got to get this show going im in charge of the hoopla you know its not my own stall of course i run it for the owner you watch miranda and see what she does shes a scream he handed out some rings and received money in return the customer stood by the bar that separated her from the stall and took aim with a wooden ring got your eye on the alarm clock miss called barney now then steady does it the ring bounced on the stall touched the clock and lay still half on the clock half off the woman tried again and yet again using her last ring hard luck miss said barney sympathetically you nearly did it miranda get busy and miranda got busy she leapt to the stall gathered up the rings deftly in her tiny paws and handed them back to barney the children laughed in delight oh barney isnt she clever you watch her now said barney as more people came up to the stall go on miranda do your job miranda looked at him inquiringly she made a little chattering noise and picked up a dozen or two of the wooden hoopla rings she slipped them over her left arm she held out her paw for the pennies the people presented and gave each one three rings the customers were amused and delighted they called their children to watch miranda and soon there was a great crowd round the hoopla stand she cant count more than three said barney so its lucky we only have to give out three rings anyway if she makes a mistake and gives two the customer always points it out to her she really is wonderful said diana barney you must do awfully well at this stall with miranda to attract attention like this we do said barney ive made more money at the stall than anyone else ever has i dont get the money of course i give it to tonnerre who owns the fair and takes it about tonnerre what a queer name said diana is he french yes he is said barney looking surprised how do you know well tonnerre is french for thunder explained diana is it really said barney well i never knew he had such a good name it suits him fine why asked snubby watching miranda giving out rings again and taking the money to give to barney well hes got a thunderous voice and hes enormous and he stamps about all the time said barney hes got a fearful temper and hes an old miser underpays everyone and kicks them out if they dont do well enough for him there he is over there look the elephants are his the children looked where barney pointed they saw the two elephants having their ropes undone from the tree in order to take children for rides the man with them was a giantlike fellow with legs like treetrunks enormous feet and great shoulders he was shouting at the patient elephants and his voice carried right over the field it sounds as if somebodys turned the wireless on as full as can be said roger with a grin what a voice tonnerre is a good name for him he looks as black as thunder too he always does said barney hes not a pleasant follow to work with there are about twenty people who go with the fair wherever it goes the rest of them join it here and there leave it others come in their place and so it goes on ive been with it about four months weve been all over the place i dont like the sound of mister thunder said diana is there a mrs lightning by any chance barney laughed his uproarious laugh that made everyone want to laugh with him no hes not married if anyone could be called mrs lightning its old ma over there by that caravan see my word her tongues sharp as a knife if she flashes out at anyone they just shrivel up even tonnerre goes off hurriedly if she begins to scold him ma was a peculiarlooking old woman she looked more like a witch than anything else as she stood stirring something in a big iron pot over a fire just outside her caravan she had a shock of perfectly white hair brown monkey eyes and a chin and nose that almost met she stood over her pot muttering im sure shes making a spell of some kind said diana with a giggle theres plenty of us showfolk that think the same said barney i dont but lots do theyre scared stiff of old ma theres only one person can do anything with her and thats young un hes the kid in charge of the shootingrange see over there oh the shockheaded boy said snubby yes weve seen him hes a bit like a hobgoblin with ears sticking right out of his head a nice hobgoblin though he got hair just like mas only a different colour of course it sticks up straight like hers shes his grandma said barney he gets round the old lady all right but nobody else does dont you go near her shell fly at you like a cat could we see the two chimpanzees asked diana we saw them advertised in a paper they were called hurly and burly oh yes they belong to mr vosta said barney youll like him full of fun and will do anything for you too much sometimes cant say no to anyone hes been with the fair for years and slaves for tonnerre day and night i cant understand it myself i shant stay with this fair for long being kicked around by that badtempered tonnerre the fair sounded a fascinating place with its loudvoiced tonnerre its sharptongued old ma the shockheaded young un vosta and his chimpanzees and barney and miranda of course the three children stood by the hoopla stall and looked round the fair eagerly wondering which of all these people would be the most likely to be the thief who could get through locked doors and fastened windows they hadnt told barney about that yet there hadnt been a chance with customers coming and going it would be best not to say anything till they were quite alone with him you go on round the fair and have a looksee for yourselves said barney i could leave miranda here to look after the stall shes as good at it as i am but if tonnerre sees im gone hell yell the place down right well come back later my word it was a fine surprise to see you barney best surprise weve had these hols chapter an interesting afternoon they went round the fair looking at everything and trying everything too they went on the roundabouts and on the swings they rode on the elephants and they paid to go in and see the wonderful chimpanzees they didnt miss a thing make the roundabout go as fast as you can snubby asked the boy in charge of it hold on tight then said the boy with a grin what about your dog no hes sick if he goes on said snubby hell sit by you and wait sit loony sit he chose the chimpanzee and the others chose lions the wooden animals went up and down as well as round and round the music began to play and the roundabout moved off the boy kept his word and ran the machinery as fast as it would go the children had to cling tightly to the animals or they would have been thrown off diana began to feel sick the other three riders began to yell at the boy he slowed down and grinned again that all right for you he asked snubby who was now looking slightly green and found that he couldnt walk straight nor could the others it was wizard said snubby faster than ive ever been it was worth double fare not only the roundabout had gone fast but the music too and tonnerre had heard it of course his face went purple and he yelled at the roundabout boy but the music was so loud that the boy didnt hear the yells it was only when the roundabout had stopped and tonnerre had parked his elephants for a minute shouting all the while that the poor boy knew what he was in for you you boy you toad of a boy yelled mr tonnerre in his thunderous voice what you think you do eh you want to make people sick you want to break my machine arrrrrrrrr he finished off with a noise so like the growl of a giant dog that loony was astonished and leapt to his feet biff tonnerre boxed the roundabout boys ear with a resounding slap snubby stepped forward mr tonnerre it was my fault i paid him double fare to go fast it looked as if mr tonnerre was about to box his ears too then he turned to the roundabout boy ah aha double fare where is the money you think to keep it for yourself give me all the money you have got queeek queeek queeek queeek apparently meant quick quick mr tonnerre had a peculiar accent english and french mixed up with american and cockney he towered over everyone as elephantine as his two elephants he turned to snubby next you come to ride on my elephants no yes for double fare i make them trittrot like horses yes no thanks said snubby i mean yes id like to ride on your elephants but no trittrotting thank you i dont feel as if i could bear a trotting elephant so they rode on the great elephants and swayed from side to side in a most alarming manner loony refused to get up with snubby he retired behind a tree very much afraid of the enormous creatures that appeared to have tails in front as well as behind now you go watch mr billy tell said mr tonnerre hi his enormous voice as he helped them off the elephants he very very clever man crickcrack his gun goes and off goes the apple on young uns head billy tell does the same act as william tell who was probably his greatgreatgreatgreatgreatuncle remarked roger as they made their way to a tent marked in enormous red letters billy tell old ma shambled over to look after the shootingrange when young un went to stand inside billy tells tent with an apple perched high on his shock of hair he grinned as the children came in to watch hiya he said come to watch my hair being singed billy tell was dressed in a redskin suit and looked rather grand he would have looked grander if he hadnt been quite so dirty there was a long wait until enough people had paid to come into the tent billy tell sat looking bored with his gun across his knee young un cleverly walked about balancing the apple on his head all the time collecting the entrance money the news had got round that it was snubby who had paid double fare to the roundabout boy to make the roundabout go fast young un came up to him grinning sure you havent paid double to see billy shoot off the tips of my ears he asked snubby snubby liked him you bet i have he said so look out he hadnt of course and young un knew it he stood with his back to a steel sheet the apple on his head billy tell stood up at last and walked to the other end of the tent he took aim casually bang the apple was split into a hundred bits and pieces and young un wiped some out of his eyes he set another on his head billy tell put his head between his legs and took aim from there bang again the apple split into tiny pieces everyone applauded loudly loony crouched against snubbys legs frightened at the bangs so near to him young un wiped his face again and walked over to the children good shooting he said im a good shot too a jolly good one i shot a weathercock off a steeple once garn said billy tells drawling voice you and your tales here take my gun and clean it and tell old ma ill have sausages for my supper tonight yes dad said young un and somehow the children felt surprised so billy tell was his father and old ma was his grandmother what an interesting family to have have you got a mother asked snubby naw one woman in the family is enough for me to manage said young un winking towards old ma as she stood at her shootingrange say ma he said to her as they came up billy tell says please to give him sausages tonight sausages squealed the old lady what does he think i am sausages cost money you tell him the varmint and rabbits and hares dont cost nothing at all if theyre shot and whats his gun for id like to know think hes got it just for shooting apples off your turnip head where is he ill give him sausages so i will well ma thats all he asked you to give him sausages yelled young un cheekily and put his hands behind his stickingout ears the better to hear all the rude names old ma called him as she went back to her caravan snubby had a turn with a gun trying his hardest to shoot one of the pingpong balls that bobbed up and down on the top of the little fountain of water spouting continually at the back of the range but he couldnt shoot one young un took a quick glance to see if billy tell old ma or tonnerre were anywhere near then he took a gun aimed it and bang went one pingpong ball bang went another bang went a third there was no doubt about it young un was a very good shot snubby quite believed he had once shot a weathercock down now you choose a prize he said to snubby go on i like you choose one of these here prizes but i didnt shoot the balls off the water said snubby in astonishment dont matter i did and nobodys to know that said young un i like you see no stuckup nonsense about you or your dog go on quick take a prize what about them there toffees theyre good it took snubby quite a long time to convince young un that he thought it wrong to take a prize he hadnt won young un gave way at last but he didnt understand in the least he didnt seem to know what honesty meant where that kind of thing was concerned its awfully nice of you poor snubby kept saying but it isnt right aw shucks said young un and gave in you better go with the others now theyre yelling to you to have a swing choose the boat at the end its best and you can make it go high what with roundabout riding elephant riding shooting going in swingboats and sampling all kinds of other things the children hadnt much money left by the end of the day they had bought themselves enormous sticky buns in the buntent and slices of cake and lemonade and had carried a good share over to barney who was still in charge of the hoopla and doing very well partly of course because of mirandas amusing antics when do you get off asked diana we shall have to be going soon couldnt you come back to supper with us id like to do that said barney his eyes shining with delight at the invitation ill get young un to take over from me old ma always takes over from him about now if i give him sixpence hell come to my stall im due for an evening off so tonnerre cant say anything if i go sure your mother wont mind me coming she wont mind she wants to meet you said roger weve told her all about you how we met you last summer and had that adventure at rockingdown how can you get to our place we biked oh i can borrow a bike said barney miranda can either ride on my shoulder or on the handlebars she doesnt mind which she can ride in the carrierbox with loony if she likes said snubby but she didnt like she preferred to ride in the middle of barneys handlebars her soft monkeyhair streaming backwards in the wind and her funny little skirt flapping hard they left the fair behind it was gay and noisy and crowded now the stallkeepers were shouting people were laughing the roundabout was playing its harsh music snubby wished he could stay come on said roger as he lingered behind well be late and dont forget weve got to tell barney our secret well have to make time for that yes their secret barney might be able to help them over that how surprised he would be when they told him chapter barney comes to supper i shall have to be careful not to give greatuncle a chance to nab me and ask me awkward questions said snubby as they rode off it will be easy to get out of that if weve got a guest with us said roger look where youre going snubby you idiot you rode over that hole and nearly tipped poor loony out of his box sorry loony called back snubby barney had tried to clean himself up a little in order to meet mrs lynton he put on clean flannel trousers and a clean or nearly clean sweater his shoes were bad but he could do nothing about those because he had on his only pair his toes poked out of one and roger wondered if he had a pair that would fit barney but it looked as if barneys feet were bigger than his they arrived home tired and hungry loony leapt thankfully out of the basket and ran straight to the kitchen to beg for a bone cook wasnt there but there was a dish of sardine put down for the cat loony went over and sniffed at it should he take a bit he was so hungry no it smelt nasty let sardine the cat have it sardine came in and spat at him he ran at her and she fled out of the kitchen up the passage and up the stairs into rogers room she went and leapt up on the chest of drawers somebody else was sitting there it was miranda the monkey waiting for the boys sardine got the shock of her life she had never seen a monkey before she went off like a firework fizzing and hissing and spitting her tail three times its size miranda looked at her in horror whatever was this explosive animal in a fright miranda leapt down to the floor scampered on all fours across the room out on to the landing and into greatuncle roberts room he was there brushing his mane of silver hair he was startled to see a monkey leap on to his bed then came sardine and after sardine came an excited loony the three of them rushed round the room twice and then disappeared greatuncle sat down suddenly what a household a monkey had he seen right really his bedroom was becoming a menagerie he would have to speak to his niece susan about it no guest could be expected to put up with hordes of monkeys cats and dogs running in circles round his bedroom roger was trying out his shoes on barney they were too small roger remembered what a lot of shoes greatuncle had surely he could spare a pair he went along and knocked at the door who is it now asked greatuncle pettishly as if he halfexpected some more animals its me roger said roger greatuncle have you an old pair of shoes you could give me whats come over this household said greatuncle first my bedrooms full of oh well never mind what on earth do you want a pair of my shoes for they wont fit you its for a friend of mine whos come to supper explained roger did he come without shoes then asked greatuncle good heavens theres that monkey again if i can find out whos brought a monkey to this house and let it loose ill ill ill roger departed hurriedly if greatuncle knew it was the owner of the monkey who wanted the shoes he wouldnt lend them or give them that was certain come on miranda you little wretch he said to the excited monkey dont rush all over the place youll give my mother a fit if she meets you on the stairs he rummaged in the hall cupboard and found an old pair of tennis shoes belonging to his father at least barneys toes wouldnt stick out of those barney put them on gratefully do i look too awful to come to supper with you he asked diana anxiously when she came to see if the boys were ready no youre quite all right she said hoping that her mother would think so too and even more her father ive told mother youre here she is looking forward to meeting you barney was nervous he had seldom been in a big house and he was afraid his manners were bad but he neednt have worried he had naturally good manners and a pleasant voice when mrs lynton saw his strange blue eyes set so wide and noticed the anxious expression in them she gave him an even warmer welcome than she had planned so youre barney ive heard all about you richard this is barney the boy who went through those hairraising adventures with our three last summer mr lynton looked up he expected to see a gipsylooking boy sly and shrewd instead he saw barney with his bright corncoloured hair brushed back his honest eyes and straight fearless look he held out his hand youre welcome barney he said any friend of rogers is a friend of mine rogers heart warmed to his father good old dad he might be hottempered and strict and all the rest of it but he had the right thoughts and feelings every time barney blushed with relief and pleasure what nice parents roger and diana had and how lucky they were mother do you mind miranda asked diana anxiously as she saw her mothers eyes stray in the monkeys direction for the first time miranda was sitting demurely on the back of a chair looking most amusing in her little skirt and coat diana had given her a dolls bonnet and she was wearing that too oh dear said her mother and began to laugh helplessly richard do look at that i dont think i shall mind her diana if she doesnt come too near me i really dont like monkeys you know shall i take her out asked barney at once no no said mrs lynton if i can put up willingly with sardine and loony i can surely put up with a harmless little creature like this but what your greatuncle will say i cannot imagine greatuncle was a little late for the meal loony had hidden his evening shoes and it took him a long time to find them when he came down at last it was to find the family very friendly indeed with barney and miranda it would have been difficult for him to make any trouble about them barney thoroughly enjoyed himself he loved the wellcooked food the chatter the laughter the spotless mats the flowers on the table in fact everything mrs lynton liked him very much how could this boy be a circus boy a boy who wandered about with fairs who probably hardly ever had a bath and yet was nice enough to make a good friend for her son mr lynton liked barney too have you no parents he asked my mother died some while ago answered barney i never knew my father he doesnt know anything about me im afraid all i know is that hes an actor sir and used to act in shakespeares plays ive been looking for him all over the place but i havent found him yet do you know the name he plays under asked mr lynton thinking that surely any father would like to have a son like this turning up to claim him barney shook his head no i dont even know what he looks like i dont know his right name either sir because my mother was in the circus and took her name always not her married name im afraid ill never find him it seems doubtful i must say said mr lynton well you seem to have done quite well on your own after supper the four children went out into the garden it was about halfpast eight and still light they went into the summerhouse and put loony on guard again miranda came too of course she had been on her very best behaviour at suppertime and had sat on barneys shoulder all the time accepting pieces of tomato from him and a few apricot slices from the pudding dish now she sat on snubbys shoulder and tucked her little paws into his collar to keep them warm he loved her loony was jealous and tried to get up on snubbys knee now what was it you wanted to tell me barney asked when loony had been sent outside on guard well said roger hardly knowing how to begin its a peculiar story really our greatuncle is mixed up in it too its like this he told the whole tale with the others joining in occasionally so you see he ended we did just wonder if the fair has got anything to do with robberies whether somebody in the fair knows enough about old papers and documents to steal them when the show goes near a museum or near any other place where its known that valuable papers are kept and we want to find out how the thief can go through locked doors said diana its a bit like magic youd want a spell to do that perhaps its old ma said snubby remembering how witchlike she looked bent over her iron pot everyone laughed barney sat in silence considering i dont know anyone in the fair whos interested in old things except tonnerre he said at last tonnerre collects tiny carved ivory statues but ive never heard of him collecting old papers i shouldnt have thought he was educated enough to know whether they were valuable or not or even where to go for them and surely he couldnt go through locked doors said diana remembering how enormous tonnerre was no he couldnt said barney there was a silence who decides the places where the fair is to go asked diana suddenly well tonnerre i suppose as he owns the fair said barney why oh i see what you mean somebody knows where rare papers can be got and that somebody decides to take the fair there in order to steal them yes well as far as i know tonnerre always decides he gives the orders anyway does anyone else in the fair collect anything asked snubby playing with mirandas tail no only burly one of the chimps said barney with a laugh he collects toy animals didnt you know if youll only give him a toy animal hell be your slave far life odd isnt it very odd said diana and laughed what does hurly collect sweets but they dont last long said barney you have to be careful of your pockets with hurly if youve got any sweets or chocolates there hell pick your pockets as quickly as anything we must really make friends with them said diana we hardly spoke to them today there were so many things to see well barney you cant really help us much can you about the probable thief in the fair except that it is more likely to be tonnerre than anyone else theres vosta said barney thoughtfully and theres billy tell both artful as can be but somehow i cant see either of them knowing about rare papers why i dont believe billy tell can read oh well perhaps it really is just chance that the burglaries occur when the fair is in the district said diana i wonder where its going to next didnt i tell you its coming near here said barney about a mile away i think on dolling hill over at rilloby how smashing said snubby how absolutely super well see you every single day then and ill tell you what well take it in turns to watch old tonnerre i bet hes the one ive a feeling in my bones chapter plans the four children talked for a long while that night in the summerhouse now that barney too seemed to think that dianas hunch might have something in it they were keener than ever to solve the mystery snubby had an unexpectedly good idea i say i wonder if theres any place at rilloby or near there that has a museum or rare collections of any kind he said now thats a brainwave of yours said diana warmly you dont often have a brainwave but that really is an idea yes if we find out any place like that near the fair or within a mile or two we could perhaps watch it suggested roger gosh yes watch it and see if tonnerre came wandering round it to snoop about said snubby we couldnt help seeing him if he did hes so enormous said diana and if we did see him wandering about we could go to the place at night and see if we could catch him getting in went on snubby excitedly we might learn a thing or two about locked doors and how to get through them then everyone began suddenly to feel very thrilled could they really do all this well perhaps they couldnt but it would be very exciting to try the thing to do first is to find out whether there is a museum or anything near rilloby said roger how can we do that asked diana ive never heard of one and weve jived here for years it might not be a museum said roger it might be a private collection of some sort like the one greatuncle was arranging at chelie manor house gosh i know how to find out how said everyone well ask greatuncle of course said roger triumphantly hed know i do believe he knows where every single valuable letter map plan chronicle and all the rest of it is in the whole of great britain he really is very learned you know these antiquarians are anti what inquired barney who had never heard the word before diana explained barney listened solemnly he always liked to pick up any bit of knowledge that he could well now whos to ask greatuncle about this said roger not me said snubby promptly hed think i was getting the information out of him to hand to the green hands gang dont be an idiot said diana he would said snubby firmly he may be learned and all the rest of it but he believes anything you tell him i mean he swallowed all about the green hands gang and the rest of it absolutely whole you should have seen his hair stand on end when i told him dont exaggerate said roger anyway we wouldnt dream of you asking him anything youd only make a mess of it and say something silly snubby subsided diana considered the question ill ask him she said ill take my autograph book to him for his autograph hell like that and then ill get him talking about collections of signatures or something like that and from that ill get to other collections of papers and i can ask him what t want to know quite casually he wont suspect a thing thats well worked out di said roger approvingly you do that tomorrow snubby had better still keep out of greatuncles way in case hes asked too many awkward questions about how he knew there was to be a robbery at ricklesham you really were an idiot over that snubby all right all right tell me again said snubby sulkily always going on at me and yet i thought of the best idea this evening yes it was a good idea said roger well let it cancel out that mistake of yours i say isnt it getting dark mother will be after us in a minute saying its bedtime said diana then id better go said barney and he got up this has been a lovely evening for me thanks an awful lot are you coming over to the fair tomorrow of course said diana well see you every day till we go back to school barney im glad mother likes you you can come here often now dad likes him too said roger well see you tomorrow barney is miranda asleep shes been awfully quiet sound asleep said barney shes inside my shirt feel her warm as toast she works hard at that hoopla stall with me you know loonys been quiet too i suppose hes tired out with his long run he was he was stretched out on the step of the summerhouse sound asleep too he wouldnt have been much good as a watchdog this evening said roger poking him with his foot here wake up you sleepy hound didnt you know you were on guard woof said loony and sat up very suddenly goodbye barney said diana im awfully glad weve found you again dont forget to keep an eye on tonnerre ill remember said barney with a laugh his caravan stands near to ours ill keep an ear open all night now to hear if he creeps out of his van and ill watch to see if he puts his light on in the middle of the night and if he creeps out follow him said roger barney slipped away to his bicycle mrs lyntons voice could be heard calling the children it was quite dark now but the evening was very warm for april i like the smell of those wallflowers said snubby sniffing hard as they walked down the path now if i were a dog id go round sniffing at all the nicesmelling flowers theyd just be the right height for sniffing look theres greatuncle standing by mother said diana clutching snubby i bet hes waiting to have a few quiet words with you snubby gosh said snubby and stopped go to bed quickly said roger go in the back way and slip up the stairs dont undress get into bed at once so that if greatuncle comes up to find you youll look fast asleep quick snubby slipped round to the back door ran through the kitchen much to the astonishment of cook and anna and disappeared upstairs loony at his heels he fell over sardine on the way of course and loony took the opportunity of getting in a little nip as he passed aha that would teach sardine to lie in wait on the stairs an explosive spitting noise followed loony as he bounded off snubby ran into his bedroom slipped off his shoes without unlacing them and flung himself under the sheets he left out just the top of his shock of red hair wheres snubby said mrs lynton when the others appeared at the door greatuncle wants a word with him oh dear i think hes gone to bed said diana has he said her mother astonished to hear that he had gone before he was sent it was usually quite a job to get snubby off to bed he must be very tired well we went a long bikeride today said roger ill say goodnight too mother im half asleep already did you like barney very much said his mother ask him here whenever you like and if you can tell him without offending him say to him that he can have a hot bath whenever hed like one im sure there are never any hot baths at a fair oh mother you would think of that said roger with a laugh he gave her a hug im so glad you liked him goodnight and sweet dreams goodnight greatuncle goodnight said greatuncle er ill just come up with you and see if snubbys asleep i really do want a word with him he went up with them mrs lynton went too rather puzzled why did uncle robert keep wanting to talk to snubby what could snubby have done nothing was to be seen of snubby but a tuft of red hair and a small mound under the bedclothes loony was lying on his feet fast asleep said mrs lynton dont disturb him uncle robert hes tired out oh dear look at loony on the bed i dont like to take him off in case i wake snubby snubby gave a gentle little snore idiot thought roger now hes going to overdo things as usual well ill talk to him tomorrow said greatuncle and he and mrs lynton went out snubby theyve gone said roger and pulled the clothes down but snubby didnt move he was fast asleep in all his clothes too what a boy said diana let him be hes really tired out sos loony not a flicker in him goodnight roger well have some fun now weve found old barney again chapter diana does her bit most fortunately for snubby greatuncle robert had one of his bad nights that night and asked to have his breakfast in bed the next day snubby was full of glee i thought id have to get down early to breakfast gulp a bit of porridge and make that do he said so as to be away from the table when greatuncle came down but now i shall be able to have a proper breakfast goodo well go over to the fair after dinner today said diana ive got to help mother do all the flowers and turn out some of my cupboards we could take tea over to ricklesham and have it with barney well take enough for him too and that will give you a chance to get on to greatuncle about any museum or private collection said roger snubby youd better spend the morning doing errands for cook then youll be out of the way oh said snubby who was never very keen on doing errands all right ill see if cook wants anything she said something about somebody fetching a new roller for the wringer id have to go to rilloby for that well that would take you out of greatuncles way for ages said diana you can go mooching round the toy shops and have a few icecreams at the dairy and forget where youve left your bike and take ages finding it again and dont try and be funny diana said snubby giving her a push youll be an old nagger when you grow up if you dont look out like old ma i shant and dont push me like that said diana shoving back why do little boys give people pushes and shoves when they get annoyed same reason as big girls do i expect said snubby and went off pleased with himself he went to the kitchen and asked cook if there were any errands she wanted done she stared at him in surprise whats come over you want me to make you meringues or something for dinner oh no i mean yes well no i didnt ask you for that reason said snubby getting into a muddle what i mean is meringues didnt enter my head but if theyre in yours and you want to make them for dinner well all i can say is you go ahead youre after something i know said cook well ill think about the meringues and seeing you are suddenly so helpful yes id be glad if you could get the new roller for my wringer i keep on and on about it but nobody fetches it ill fetch it cookie said snubby anything else well bless me you cant be feeling yourself to come and ask for jobs said cook still i may as well take advantage of it you can bring back the kippers with you and seeing that youre going all the way to rilloby would you leave a note at my sisters house to say ill be over on wednesday and if you could call at the cobblers and get me my best shoes and here wait a minute i havent got all day to spare said snubby suddenly feeling that he was taking on more than he had bargained for i was just about to finish and say id be making meringues for your dinner said cook with a twinkle youd better write all those things down while i get my bike said snubby ill be back in half a jiffy he came back and took the list from cook she had added one or two things it was a real chance to get everything brought back with snubby in such a rare obliging mood ill just give you a jam tart to munch before you go said cook and went to the larder oh by the way your greatuncle was in here a minute ago asking for you snubby vanished at once without even waiting for the jam tart cook was most surprised greatuncle marched into the lounge where mrs lynton was doing the flowers im looking for snubby he said mrs lynton leaned out of the window and called to diana who was picking daffodils for the vases diana wheres snubby greatuncle wants him oh mother hes just gone to rilloby on his bike said diana coming to the window he told me hes fetching the new roller for cooks wringer and hes bringing back the kippers and fetching some mended shoes and mrs lynton couldnt believe her ears snubby is doing all that on his own she asked disbelievingly whats come over him oh he can be helpful when he likes said diana and turned away to hide a smile im afraid he wont be back for ages greatuncle a nuisance this grumbled greatuncle crossly slippery as an eel that boy anyone would think he was avoiding me oh no uncle robert said mrs lynton of course hes not why should he i shant be in to lunch my dear said greatuncle not bothering to answer her im going up to london to see an old friend of mine oh greatuncle before you go will you sign my autograph album called diana suddenly dear me she mustnt let him slip off without asking him a few important questions ask your greatuncle another time dear said her mother exasperatingly hes off to catch a train oh im not going just yet said greatuncle beaming at diana ill sign dianas album ive got an old sixteenthcentury proverb i once found in an old document that ill write in for her and ill write it exactly as i saw it in the old printing oh thank you said diana ill get my album now ill bring it into the study greatuncle i expect youll be in there i will my dear i will said greatuncle so diana took her album there and the old man painstakingly printed in old letters the sixteenthcentury proverb he had once found there he said can you read that when ye thunderclouds come think on the stormcock bird he sings diana read with difficulty for the shape of the letters and the spelling of the words were strange very nice isnt it said greatuncle we havent a saying like that in these modern times well we have really said diana you know when youre up to your neck in hot water think of the kettle and sing ah hm said greatuncle surprised ive not heard that typical of these times flippant my dear flippant where the other proverb is beautiful diana wasnt sure what flippant meant it somehow reminded her of tiddleywinks yes you flipped the counters so they were probably flippant she decided not to enter into that question but to push on with what she wanted to know greatuncle you know an awful lot about old things dont you she said yes my dear its always been my great interest delving into the past spreading my net there and seeing what i can bring up said greatuncle youve brought up some wonderful old things havent you said diana well you probably wouldnt think they were wonderful said greatuncle im interested really in old writings you know particularly old letters which give us a vivid picture of the times in which they were written i suppose you know every collection in the country said diana in an awed voice greatuncle was flattered at dianas interest no no he said i know the most famous ones of course and many of the minor ones but not all my dear no not all are there any interesting collections near here greatuncle asked diana bringing out her important question quite airily she was pleased with herself any near rilloby for instance now let me see said greatuncle considering well theres marloes castle of course but theres only a very small collection there lord marloes was more interested in animals and birds than old documents hes got a fine collection of those so i hear began to stuff them himself as a boy are the documents valuable very valuable asked diana yes yes i suppose they are said greatuncle i know some americans were after them last year so marloes told me he wouldnt sell though theyre all family letters and historical documents relating to his own estate hed never part with them he wouldnt part with his stuffed animals either now i wonder i believe i can get in touch with him in town would you and the others like to go and see his collection of animals if i can get you permission oh yes please greatuncle said diana delighted this was a bit of luck they could have a good look round the collections and see the lie of the land then if there happened to be a burglary there they would be able to picture the rooms and everything well ill telephone marloes and see if hes back in town said greatuncle ill take you over to the old castle myself and you can look at the stuffed animals and ill have another look at the documents itll be quite a day out wont it my dear oh yes said diana thanks awfully greatuncle wed all love to come dear dear look at the time said greatuncle getting up in a hurry i shall miss that train he went off and diana shut up her album thoughtfully she considered she had done very well indeed she had found out where valuable papers were in marloes castle and it was possible that greatuncle would take her and the others there and they would be able to do a good snoop round wonderful she went out to find roger roger roger where are you quick ive got good news mrs lynton heard her calling and saw her talking excitedly to roger what could the good news be she wondered how surprised she would have been if she had known chapter at the fair again snubby arrived home complete with everything cook had asked for she beamed at him there are two meringues for each of you she told him and theres one over ill tell your aunt i made it specially for you so you can have three smashing said snubby pleased i say this roller thing was frightfully heavy i shall think twice before i say ill fetch one again oh we shant want one for years said cook loony come out of the larder bless us all if i leave that larder door open for so much as half a moment that dogs in there loony yelled snubby and loony backed out hurriedly oh the smells in a larder it was a far far better place than the biggest smelliest rabbithole roger and diana went to tell snubby the news about marloes castle he was excited gosh thats a bit of luck youre clever di to manage all that how did you wangle it easy said diana greatuncle just gobbled down all i said i told you hed swallow anything said snubby now you can see why he swallowed my green hands gang yarn well if he really does get permission to take us over the collection and theres a burglary some time well be able to picture how its done said roger well make a plan of the rooms where the collections are or anyway of the room where the papers are the thief wont be interested in the stuffed animals they had a very good lunch indeed and enjoyed cooks meringues immensely they wished there were far far more cant you go shopping for cook every single morning said diana to snubby no i cant said snubby decidedly if you want meringues again you go shopping for her ive done my bit my bike almost broke down with all the weight it had to carry poor loony had to run all the way back i couldnt possibly carry him as well anyway the carrierbox was full of shoes and things are you going to see barney today said mrs lynton after dinner if so take him this shirt will you its one thats too small for your father and it would do for him nicely right mother hell be pleased said roger were just off now cooks packed us up some tea itll be nice for you to have an afternoon without us or greatuncle wont it they were off at last and mrs lynton sank down thankfully on the sofa with a book now for peace they arrived at the fair after it had opened and heard the roundabout music a long way away barney was on the lookout for them he waved cheerily as they came up young un waved too and so did the roundabout boy now that it was known that they were barneys friends they were welcome any time whether they had money to spend or not there was no one at the hoopla stall just then hurly and burly the two chimpanzees were giving their show in vostas tent and most people had gone to see them they were able to tell barney their news about marloes castle jolly good grinned barney ive got no news im afraid ive kept an eye on tonnerre but hes done nothing suspicious all ive heard is that we move to rilloby tomorrow i saw the notices this morning said snubby there were posters advertising rilloby fair all over the place itll be easier for you to see me when were there said barney nearer for you wheres miranda asked snubby missing the little monkey suddenly gone to watch hurly and burly do their tricks said barney they love her you know hold her and nurse her like a baby especially burly the one that likes toy animals could we go and peep in at hurly and burly asked diana have they finished yet almost said barney ill take you over theres nobody likely to come to the hoopla stall till the chimps show is over look out for old ma today shes in one of her tempers even tonnerre is keeping away from her they kept an eye open for old ma but they didnt see her they heard her though muttering loudly in her caravan young un saw them as they went by and winked have to go and give old ma a spanking soon he grinned getting above herself she is barney took them to vostas tent he nodded to the attendant and let them peep inside hurly and burly were just finishing their performance burly was riding a bicycle made specially for him and hurly was standing on the handlebars turning somersaults as the bicycle went round and round the small ring of grass he landed neatly back on the handlebars each time good arent they said barney hurly did one last somersault and landed on burlys head burly leaped off the bicycle he bowed to the audience and hurly fell off everyone laughed and clapped burly ran to vosta and put his hairy arms round him vosta patted the big chimpanzee and gave him an apple hurly got overexcited at the shouting and clapping and began to turn somersaults at a terrific rate round the ring making peculiar noises then he scampered round on all fours something landed on his back it was miranda seeing a chance for a ride burly snatched her off hurlys back and began to nurse her in his arms making little crooning noises ladies and gentlemen the show is now over shouted vosta seeing that nobody made a move nobody wanted to because the chimpanzees and miranda were so funny but the tent was cleared at last and vosta came up to the children carrying miranda he was very fond of her too she was busy pulling his tie undone chattering without stopping hallo folks said vosta what do you think of my chimps theyre champs absolutely champion said snubby making one of his frightful jokes and youre a chump a champion chump said roger joining in i say mr vosta how did you teach your chimps to ride a bike didnt have to teach them said vosta they saw me riding mine one day and when i put it down hurly got on it and rode off straightaway then burly had a go like to have tea with us this afternoon oh yes said all three diana turned to barney what about you can you barney yes ill get young un to come across again said barney well i must be getting back to my stall going on the roundabout snubby dont you get jimmy to run it too fast again or youll get into trouble i can see old tonnerres got his eye on you today tonnerre was with his elephants watching the children and loony he shouted to them in his enormous voice you come to ride on my fine elephants yes no but they didnt ride on the elephants id rather go on the roundabout said snubby its not so swayabout as the elephants come on loony they spent a pleasant afternoon and went to every stall they saw brilliant the juggler they watched the hoopla with miranda gathering up the rings so deftly they went to the skittles and threw balls to knock them down for prizes diana was the only one who managed to knock down three skittles and win a prize the boy in charge of the skittles waved his hand towards a pile of prizes take what you like miss nice to see a girl beat her brothers shouldnt have thought it that made roger and snubby immediately pay to throw some more balls of course just as the boy had meant them to he winked at diana not as good as you yet see miss only knocked one skittle down between them poor shots arent they diana looked at the pile of prizes she chose a small toy dog much to the boys surprise roger teased her about it baby fancy choosing that why didnt you take that little blue vase ive chosen it for a purpose said diana you wait and see pity theres nothing for loony to go in for said snubby i bet hed win like anything hed win a rabbithole scratching competition said roger i never did see a dog scratch so fast at a rabbithole as he does or with so little result said diana what hed do if he really came upon a rabbit in a hole i cant imagine probably back out in a frightful hurry woof said loony knowing they were talking about him snubby patted his silky head theyre saying horrid things about you he said never mind youre the best dog ever a super dog a real smasher theres mr vosta calling us said diana he says hes going to have tea get the things out of the bikebaskets roger well share them and ill tell barney to come along now if he can they all went to vostas caravan inside was a small table spread with a marvellous tea and sitting at it already were hurly and burly wearing feeders get up chaps and bow said vosta and the two chimps rose and bowed politely this is going to be fun said diana and she was right chapter a nice afternoon and a sudden ending it was rather a hilarious teaparty because miranda and loony were there too miranda behaved really badly like a spoilt child she snatched at this and that she took things off burlys plate and she teased loony unmercifully miranda ill give you to tonnerre to deal with if i have any more nonsense said barney sternly oh let her do what she wants to said snubby delighted shes frightfully funny like this look shes picking all the cherries out of the cake now hurly reached out a hairy paw and smacked miranda sharply he liked cherries too miranda made little crying noises and burly reached out his paws and picked her up cradling her against his redstriped jersey hurly at once pulled her tail which lay across his plate burly then punched hurly and vosta hammered on the table behave yourselves dont you know how to behave when visitors are here the chimpanzees looked ashamed hurly took off his sailor hat and hid his face behind it the children squealed with laughter the tea was fine a peculiar mixture but very appetising its the sort of tea i like said snubby pleased potted meat and bread and butter and tinned pineapple and cream and cherry cake and biscuits and our own tomato sandwiches and jam tarts and theres ham here too if youd like it said vosta hospitably snubby did it was amazing what he could put away when he really liked a meal the others did their best but he outdid them all vosta grinned to see him munching away happily he liked snubby and he loved loony loony lay with his head on vostas foot snubby felt quite jealous it wasnt often loony did that with anyone vostas a magician with animals said barney hes better with tonnerres elephants than tonnerre is himself ho tonnerre brrrrrr said vosta unexpectedly all these years i have worked for him and still he shouts at me brrrrrr hurly imitated him brrrrrr then he bent down and looked under the table loony was near him his head still on vostas foot burly made crooning noises to loony who lifted his head and looked astonished burly suddenly disappeared below the table and put his arms round the surprised spaniel he tried to lift him up loony yelped and snapped but he did not bite snubby rescued him its all right said barney burly is cracked on monkeys and dogs and cats hes got a nursemaid idea of himself i think wants to nurse them all vosta show us burlys collection of toy animals vosta opened a cupboard inside were a good number of toy animals a teddy bear a tiny monkey two pink cats a golliwog and a few others burly made a grab at them he set them out on the teatable his eyes watchful in case anyone tried to take them from him but nobody did they were his toys precious to him they watched him arrange them to his liking then miranda snatched the teddy bear and was off to the top of the caravan with it at once sitting by the chimney chattering burly leapt up growling queerly vosta forced him back stop it now silly of me to have let him have his toys out with miranda there barney can you get the bear back before theres trouble barney went out of the caravan and called sternly to miranda who was still hugging the chimney looking very comical in her little skirt and coat burly made a miserable howling noise diana felt sorry for him she remembered something she had brought for him and felt in her pockets for the little toy dog she had won for a prize at the skittle match she held it out to burly he looked at it in surprise he sat up and reached out a paw for it he took it very gently and set it down on the table still keeping hold of it he stroked it with his other paw and crooned to it he was a queer chimpanzee he forgot about the bear that miranda had taken he gave his whole attention to the little toy dog he loves it said vosta that was nice of you miss diana hes all right now forgotten about the bear good thing too i thought he was going to turn nasty for a minute burly took up the toy dog and looked at vosta making a deep chattering noise as if he were talking vosta understood yes its yours burly he said yours you can put it with your other toys burly gathered all the toys up and put them back in the cupboard barney came in at that moment with the teddy bear burly took it and put that in the cupboard too he placed the little dog in the very front vosta shut the cupboard and rubbed burly affectionately on the head funny fellow aint you isnt this a nice girl to bring you a present like that burly understood he put out a big paw and stroked diana gently on the arm making a funny crooning sound as he did so hes thanking you said vosta and now look at poor old hurly he feels left out of all this hurly was stretching out both hands as if to say what about me i havent had anything ive brought him some sweets said snubby remembering and felt in his pocket roger began to feel in his too i got him some chocolate he said but neither of the boys found the sweets or chocolate they were puzzled ive lost the sweets said snubby blow barney smiled his wide smile i guess mr vosta can find them for you watch vosta spoke sternly to hurly hurly turn out your pockets go on you heard what i said your pockets hurly made a whimpering sound and stood up he pulled at his pockets vosta slipped his hand in and out came a bag of sweets and a bar of chocolate hes a pickpocket when theres any sweets around said vosta cant blame him hes only a chimp and he doesnt really know right from wrong when it comes to things like honesty bad boy hurly very bad hurly took off his hat and hid his face behind it again but he peeped over it his bright eyes looking at vosta give them back to him mr vosta said snubby hes an awful dear they both are gosh i wish i had a couple of chimps of my own its the first thing i shall buy when im grown up it will be fine to see three chimps walking together down the road said vosta solemnly and laughed to see snubbys indignant face hallo tonnerres taken his elephants off somewhere said barney when the teaparty was over and the little company climbed down the steps of the caravan to the grassy field hes probably taken them to rilloby said vosta thats where we go tomorrow he sometimes takes his elephants the day before we leave they are so slow in their walking snubby pricked up his ears if tonnerre had gone for the evening it would be a good idea to snoop round his caravan a bit look in at the window or at the door see if there was a safe there that valuable papers could be kept in perhaps he didnt say anything to the others he wanted to snoop by himself and anyway three or four people would be noticed at once round a caravan he waited till roger and diana had gone on the roundabout again and then he set off to tonnerres big caravan loony went with him puzzled by the sudden hists and pssts that snubby suddenly addressed to him he trotted at his heels obediently he liked the fair it was full of astonishing smells and amazing animals he didnt much like the mongrel dogs though and kept strictly to himself where they were concerned snubby came to tonnerres caravan no one seemed to be about he looked underneath it it was hung with all kinds of things below but then so were all the other caravans the underneath of a van was a convenient place to put a lot of things not wanted for a time he stood on a wheel and peeped in at a window but the curtain was drawn and he couldnt see inside he went to the other side of the van ah the curtain was not drawn across there he could see in quite well snubby took a good long look it seemed a fairly ordinary caravan really a bunk for a bed a table that folded down a stove in one corner for heating a chair and a stool but what was that under the bunk snubby could see something sticking out a little it looked like a black box a good big one would precious papers be kept in there the more he looked at that box the more he felt certain that it was full of stolen papers he decided to go round to the door and see if it had been left unlatched but it hadnt of course it was locked snubby bent to peep through the keyhole to see if he could get another view of that big black box three things happened at exactly the same moment loony gave a terrific growl somebody gave a tremendous yell that almost deafened snubby and a hand descended on a very tender part of him with a terrific whack snubby yelled and fell off the caravan steps loony yelped too as the hand dealt him a slap as well snubby caught sight of a giantlike figure about to whack him again and he rolled over quickly jumped up and fled an enormous voice came after him you come here ill teach you to pry yes it was tonnerre he had only taken his elephants for a little walk down the lane and back and had just caught snubby nicely he tore after snubby and loony shouting everyone stared roger and diana saw snubby shoot past like a bullet out of a gun with loony at his heels after them came tonnerre black as thunder yelling for all he was worth gosh wed better go said roger come on di slip round to the back of the stall and well get behind the vans and creep down to the gate what in the world has that idiot of a snubby done see you at rilloby tomorrow barney i hope chapter a morning at the castle snubby had a bad time from the others that evening messing things up putting tonnerre against us even perhaps putting him on his guard raged roger on the way home what do you want to go snooping round his caravan like that for its just the sort of crazy thing that snubby would do said diana making everyone stare i dont feel as if i want to go to the fair any more oh shut up said snubby angry with the others and angry with himself too going on and on at me i tell you i thought tonnerre had gone off to rilloby with his elephants anyway i wasnt doing any harm harm you keep on doing harm said roger what with your silly green hands gang and your blabbing about the possibility of a theft at ricklesham and now this snooping round tonnerres caravan there was a silence as the three rode on down the road snubby was really very much upset about it all he went off like a crack of thunder he said at last and i got a frightful whack not nearly frightful enough said roger at once and snubby gave up trying to make peace let them be as cross as they liked he still had old loony loony never raged at him or nagged him or thought badly of him never greatuncle robert was not back from town when they arrived home snubby was glad now he wouldnt have to go dodging about all evening to avoid him they had their supper with their mother and father and then snubby wandered off alone with loony the others still looked annoyed with him greatuncle came back about halfpast nine snubby bored had retired to bed roger and diana were just about to go had a good day uncle robert said mrs lynton taking his coat and scarf from him yes most interesting my dear most interesting said uncle robert and ive got a nice bit of news for the children where are they they were in the lounge clearing up their things well my dears said greatuncle beaming at them i managed to get into touch with lord marloes this morning and hes given me permission to take you to his castle and see his collection of rare papers and interesting animals well go tomorrow if you like oh thanks greatuncle thats fine said diana roger beamed too now they would be able to have a look round before the thief came if he meant to come i thought youd be pleased said greatuncle im pleased myself i havent seen his collection for years it will refresh my memory nicely mrs lynton looked slightly astonished she went out into the hall with diana and roger when they left the room to go up to bed do you really want to go looking at dull old papers she said because you will find them terribly dull you know and dear old uncle robert can be a bit of a bore when hes explaining them i know because he often took me with him when i was a girl its all right mother we shall love it diana assured her its really the stuffed animals we want to see theres quite a good collection of them there oh well you go if you like said her mother it will please your greatuncle tremendously it certainly did he set off with them at ten oclock the next morning in a specially hired car smiling all over his face he was so pleased about the little expedition that he quite forgot that for the last two days he had wanted to talk to snubby about something important loony alas was not allowed to come im sorry but no dogs are allowed in the castle said greatuncle quite determined in no circumstance to take loony loony had only to see greatuncle to take it into his head to sit down and scratch himself violently and the old man wasnt going to have him indulging in a prolonged scratch in the car they arrived at the castle it was not really a very large one more like a big mansion in fact the big iron gates at the entrance to the drive were opened by the lodgekeeper who came out of his little lodge nearby your pass please sir he said and greatuncle gave it to him thats all right sir said the man quite busy this morning we are yours is the third pass ive checked today well weve got a nice little museum up there sir and be sure to look at the albino badger sir i caught him myself his lordship was right down pleased with me well look at it my man said greatuncle and the car went on up the drive to a large front door a butler opened it and the pass was shown once more this way sir said the butler in a voice as pompous as greatuncles snubby nudged diana and she smiled she knew what snubby was thinking the man took them down a stonefloored hall and up a vast flight of marble stairs that swept round in a magnificent curve to the floor above they went up to another floor and the man led the way to a small wing built off from the main part of the house he unlocked a big wooden door that led into a dark stone passage another door stood at the end he unlocked that too it led into a big room that was lined with books from ceiling to floor on they went through the room to the other side where a small stout door was let into the wall this was unlocked by two different keys you keep the place well locked said roger two locked doors and now a third one doublelocked you dont mean burglars to get in no sir said the butler his lordship prizes his collection greatly here you will find the stuffed animals sir and beyond on those shelves are the papers before you leave sir i must ask you to wait whilst mr johns the custodian checks up the collection we have to do that sir otherwise it would be easy for people to put something valuable in their pockets there are plenty of dishonest people about these days thats all right said greatuncle check all you like its good to see such care taken of a valuable collection there have been so many thefts lately yes sir said the butler and locked them into the room were locked in said diana halfalarmed thats quite usual said greatuncle its just a sensible precaution we have to ring that bell when we are ready to go hallo theres somebody else here there were two people one an old old man who was so bent that it was quite impossible to see his face the other was a younger man with a beard and very bushy eyebrows indeed he had a moustache and was altogether a most hairylooking person hes even got hairs growing out of his ears whispered snubby to diana like eyebrows sh hell hear you said diana crossly snubbys whispers were always much too loud the two men were examining the various papers set out and labelled on the shelves the bearded man glanced round at the newcomers and then lost interest in them he turned the pages of a manuscript carefully over and over as the children wandered round di you go and listen to greatuncle robert and well have a look round whispered roger ill make a rough plan of the room just in case you know diana went with greatuncle and began to ask him questions the old man began a lengthy explanation of this manuscript and that one diana was very bored she hardly understood a word she looked round for the boys they were walking all round looking here and there they were not really very thrilled with the stuffed animals which were a poor mangylooking lot some with the moth in their furry coats the white badger was there looking extremely dirty there were two foxes with a litter of cubs all stuffed and standing together looking very unnatural there was a polecat with one eye the other had apparently dropped out at some time and had not been put back there were two squirrels red ones outside what was supposed to be their nest the very motheaten head of a young squirrel peeped over the edge of the dusty nest i dont think much of these said snubby disgusted they must be animals lord marloes stuffed when he was a boy and was so proud of them that he couldnt bear to part with them theyre horrible whats that fellow doing whispered roger suddenly to snubby nudging him snubby looked at the man with the beard he was laying something down on one of the manuscripts moving it up and down the page its only a magnifyingglass idiot said snubby youve seen greatuncle using one on his old papers dont be so suspicious roger looked a bit crestfallen he turned to look at the bent old man how could anyone be so bent it must be dreadful even when he walked from shelf to shelf he was so bent that he was forced to look down at the floor all the time roger was glad when the two men rang the bell and went the custodian a wrinkled old man came in shut the door and went rapidly through the papers on the shelves to make sure they were all there he didnt even glance at the animals i expect he hopes somebody will steal them some day the horrible motheaten things said snubby as the two men went out with the custodian the door was once more doublelocked now im going to make a sketch of the room said roger just in case put in the other two locked doors leading to the room said snubby watching roger beginning to draw oh youre doing it awfully well what are those windows yes theyre well and truly fastened did you notice said roger and theyve got bars outside too nobody could get in there he looked up to see if there was a skylight but there wasnt he sketched in where the shelves were put and put dots for the stuffed animals on the floor he marked where the chairs were a desk the fireplace and a small table on which stood some kind of plant it really was quite a good drawing roger felt rather pleased snubby admired it wholeheartedly they glanced at poor diana she was looking rather pale having been standing beside greatuncle for about an hour listening wearily to a lecture she didnt understand and didnt like poor old di said roger under his breath to snubby she looks fed up shall we go and take her place no said snubby firmly you can if you want to im not going to i should be sick well go and be sick said roger greatuncle would take us all out then you couldnt be sick in here snubby caught sight of something on the broad mantelpiece it was a clock the hands pointed to halfpast eleven snubby tiptoed over to it opened the front of the clock and turned the hands till they said halfpast twelve roger gave a snort of laughter which he hurriedly turned into a sneeze snubby went up to greatuncle robert er greatuncle i just hate to interrupt you but do you think its time to go the clock on the mantelpiece says halfpast twelve bless us all how the time flies said greatuncle in amazement and rang the bell for the custodian incredible quite incredible chapter the fair moves to rilloby they went home in the car roger longing to show diana his really excellent drawing greatuncle rambled on unable to stop the children listened bored wishing they were home thanks awfully greatuncle said roger politely weve had a wizard morning a what morning asked greatuncle puzzled wizard smashing super explained snubby thanks a lot im very glad very glad beamed greatuncle thinking what nice interesting children they were all of a sudden he really must take them to some other collection some time now youd better go and get tidy for dinner he said dear me i hope your mother wont think ive brought you back too late considering that it was only ten to twelve and not ten to one as greatuncle thought mrs lynton thought they were back very early not late as for greatuncle he was simply amazed to find what a long time there was before the dinnergong went he couldnt understand it at all roger showed his map to diana now he said if theres a burglary we shall have a map of the whole place it may be very very useful loony was so pleased to see them again that he had one of his mad fits rushing up and down the stairs at top speed in and out of all the bedrooms sending mats flying this way and that sardine was scared out of her life and fled to the top of the grandfather clock where she sat swinging her tail like a pendulum till loonys madness had exhausted itself greatuncle locked himself into his bedroom when he realised that loony was having a mad fit that dog if he wasnt barking he was scratching and if he wasnt scratching he was going mad the only really satisfactory dogs were stuffed ones greatuncle thought at least they didnt scratch the children didnt go to see barney that day partly because mr lynton was at home and told them all to come out into the garden and help him with some trees he was chopping down and partly because they knew the fair was moving to rilloby and they thought that barney might be too busy to want them that day snubby had a third reason he was still smarting from the enormous whack tonnerre had given him and he thought it would be wise to allow him to forget what had happened he meant to give tonnerre a very wide berth in future barney turned up himself that evening with miranda on his shoulder he waited in the garden till he saw roger then he whistled his low clear whistle roger turned that you barney he called oh good had any supper weve had ours but we can easily ask cook for something for you i wouldnt mind a bit of cake said barney who had had very little to eat that day in the move to rilloby come to the back door well ask cook for something said roger they appeared at the back door and cook gave a shriek to see miranda land sakes is it a monkey dont you dare to let it come into my kitchen whatever next however she calmed down enough to cut poor hungry barney some sandwiches and gave him a big chunk of treacle tart he held up a sandwich to miranda and she delicately took out a bit of tomato from the middle and ate it a monkey now what next said cook you come to rilloby fair and youll see a couple of chimpanzees said roger you should see them ride their bicycles now that i dont believe said cook all right ill come and if i see two chimpanzees riding bicycles well ill eat my best sunday hat you look out youll have to go to church in your second best hat now youll have eaten your best one grinned roger barney hadnt any news except that they had moved the fair successfully to dolling hill at rilloby and that tonnerre seemed to have recovered his temper and had spent a happy afternoon springcleaning his two elephants springcleaning them what do you mean said diana who had joined them with snubby oh he gets a stepladder and a can of oil and a brush and he oils the creases in their skins and rubs them all over said barney eating the sandwiches very fast indeed he loves that job its put him into quite a good temper he gave me an awful whack said snubby i can hardly sit down serves you right said diana if you always got what you always deserve youd always never be able to sit down i dont like that remark said snubby having worked it out bit by bit but by that time roger was showing barney his map of the room in the castle and nobody took any notice of him how are hurly and burly asked diana do they get upset with a move not a bit said barney giving miranda a tiny piece of treacle tart oh you little nuisance youve dropped it down my neck what the treacle said diana sympathetically how awful that reminded roger of something would you like a bath he asked barney mother says you can have one any time barney hesitated well id awfully like one now if she really means it im filthy with all the moving today i just cant seem to get clean in cold water and thats all i get so barney was escorted to the bathroom where he stared at the great creamcoloured bath quite overcome diana brought him a thick creamcoloured towel a very big one whats this he asked thinking it was a bedquilt or something he was astonished when she told him it was only a towel his towel was usually a very dirty rag of a handkerchief how he enjoyed that hot bath miranda sat on the cold tap and looked on in amazement what could barney be doing in water that smoked she put one small foot down into it and curled it up with a squeal did it bite you asked barney soaping himself all over and replacing the soap in its dish miranda took it up and smelt it she nibbled it and flung the soap into the water in disgust she spat out the bit she had nibbled miranda thats not nice behaviour in a bathroom like this said barney now wheres the soap gone he hunted in the water for it and then lay peacefully in the warmth loony scratched at the door sorry the bathrooms engaged loony murmured barney half asleep then he heard the voices of the others outside in the garden and he sat up reaching for the wonderful towel it was a lovely night and the children walked back to the fair with barney in the moonlight miranda couldnt understand barneys sweetscented smell it didnt seem like barney she sat on snubbys shoulder all the way hoping barneys nice barneysmell would come back to him as they came to the gate of the field where the fair was being held someone came out it was tonnerre all by himself snubby recognised him at once and hid quickly in the hedge the others walked boldly on evening sir said barney politely tonnerre peered at him oh its you give an eye to my elephants will you when you get in young uns with them now but theyre restless they dont like a move yes sir said barney will you be long sir no just one hour said tonnerre going down the road and back roger pulled barney to him wheres he really going you go on into the field ill follow him and see where hes going you never know barney nodded and went through the gate snubby detached himself from the hedge he had heard rogers whisper i say are we really going to follow tonnerre he asked excitedly loony would be awfully good at following his track if we lost it he wont follow it because hes jolly well not coming said roger nor are you you take di home ill do the tracking go on now snubby i must get after him or ill lose him he left the other two and ran down the lane where was tonnerre going was he really only going down the road and back he came to a fork and saw tonnerres figure in the distance enormous in the moonlight oho said roger to himself hes taken the turning to marloes castle now what do you think of that chapter snubby enjoys himself tonnerre strode on down the road right in the very middle of it his shadow black behind him roger followed marloes castle was by the signpost half a mile away not very far from rilloby fair roger kept close to the hedge not wanting tonnerre to see him he felt excited what was tonnerre going to do surely he wasnt going to commit any kind of robbery at that time of night it was early surely for thieves if i see him shin up over the wall or do any other funny business i shall call the police somehow or other thought roger id better notice if theres any house on the way that has telephone wires running to it because i could go and ask to use their telephone gosh this is exciting he thought of the room in the little separate wing of the castle protected by two locked doors and a third one doublelocked windows fastened and barred well well if tonnerre could go through all those leaving them still locked and fastened he was a very clever man indeed tonnerre walked on and on roger kept well back in the shadows at the side of the lane tonnerre did not turn to see if anyone was following him he simply walked straight on marloes castle loomed up in the distance it had a high wall all round it its windows gleamed in the moonlight roger tried to see the barred window of the room where the stuffed animals and valuable old papers were kept he spotted it at last how on earth could a great fellow like tonnerre climb up a sheer straight wall and get through barred windows tonnerre did nothing of the sort of course he came to the big iron gates and there he stopped for the first time he peered through at marloes castle his great arms holding on to the gates as he looked this way and that roger held his breath what was going to happen now it was all very disappointing nothing happened at all tonnerre simply went on walking round the walls of the grounds went all the way round followed by roger and finally arrived at the iron gates again and went back by the way he had come well thought roger what a long walk ive had for nothing all the same perhaps tonnerre was looking to see how he could get in some other night making his plans yes thats it i expect he means to come back some other night and get in but how does he mean to do it it beats me roger saw tonnerre safely back to the fair field and then went home mrs lynton was cross with him for being so late the others have been hi for a long time she said and have gone up to bed do you know its ten oclock im surprised at you roger i suppose youve been with barney but do remember that although i like him very much i shall not allow you to keep the hours he does sorry mother said roger and said no more he couldnt possibly explain about tonnerre the others were very disappointed when they heard that all that tonnerre had done was to peer through the gates of the castle and walk round the walls still i think youre right when you say he was looking round and laying his plans said diana good night well talk about it again tomorrow they all went to the fair again the next day after it had opened they saw cook there having an afternoon off snubby went over to her got your best sunday hat out ready to eat he said youll see the two chimps riding their bicycles this afternoon come on ill buy your ticket ive never seen anybody eat their hat and id just love to see you gobble yours go on with you now said cook she went with all of them into the tent where hurly and burly gave their performances vosta nodded to them and gave cook a front seat she was very pleased her eyes nearly fell out of her head when she saw hurly and burly doing their tricks and when they rode the bicycle round and round the grass ring burly on the pedals first with hurly on the bars and then the other way about she exclaimed in wonder well i never did well i never did in all my life well who would have thought of that now well of all the extraordinary things snubby grinned youll have to eat your words as well as your hat when can i come and see you at your meal cook and do you eat your hat with a knife and fork or just chew it get away with your nonsense now said cook in a daze watching the chimpanzees going headoverheels without stopping it fair makes me dizzy watching them do that yes but what about your sunday hat persisted snubby you cant go back on your word you know cook began to feel uncomfortable go on now you know a hat cant be eaten she said you let me off you little pest and ill make you some more meringues oh my goodness what are the creatures doing now tell this one to go away i dont like its hairy face hurly had come up to snubby grinning all over his funny face he patted snubby and then as cook appeared to be snubbys friend he patted her to she rose from her chair and fled out of the tent scared and trembling well there now i never did in all my life she kept saying to herself i never did snubby wondered what it was she never did he followed her and reminded her of her bargain remember either you eat your hat or i eat your meringues youre a caution you are said cook you keep away from me now i want to enjoy myself you and your hats and meringues snubby kept carefully out of tonnerres sight he kept as far from his caravan as possible too he didnt want another whack he saw the others by the hoopla stall and went to have a word with them cooks not going to eat her best sunday hat shell make us some meringues instead good work said roger hallo here comes old ma wonder what she wants old ma came up to the hoopla stall her brightbirdlike eyes darted all round she spoke to barney you seen young un anywhere barney i want him to come and watch my pot for me i got to do some washing and i cant do both hes gone to help with the elephants said barney theres such a lot of people here today that mr tonnerre cant cope with everyone that wants rides there he is look billy tells got the shootingrange never anyone to help old ma muttered the old woman and turned to go ill come along and stir up your pot said snubby thinking it might be interesting to talk to the old woman you the only thing youll ever stir up is trouble said old ma and went off into a cackle of laughter all right you come along then and you can get me some water from the stream ive not got enough snubby found that he had taken on more than he bargained for he had to fetch various pails of water from the stream first of all then he had to fetch more wood for the fire and then stand and stir the big iron pot with a long iron spoon whose handle got hotter and hotter whats in here asked snubby peering into the bubbling liquid ah dont you ask no questions and you wont get no lies answered the old woman now busy washing clothes in a tub snubby grinned by the smell it seemed as if rabbit hare a chicken or two and possibly a duck were all in the big pot snubby felt that he wouldnt at all mind having a plateful of the delicioussmelling concoction ma began to talk as she washed snubby listened fascinated she talked about billy tell and vosta and many others he didnt know presto the conjurer sticky stanley the clown mr volla and his bear madame petronella and her parrots people in other circuses and fairs people she had known and had never forgotten out came the names in a neverending stream all with some story attached to them what about mr tonnerre ventured snubby have you known him long long too long ah that mans temper it doesnt bear thinking about said old ma rinsing a peculiarlooking garment in her tub always he had a temper always he was shouting always he was big but what a wonderful acrobat ah to see him on the tightrope why he could dance better on that than most men on a dance floor snubby was amazed tonnerre an acrobat how very extraordinary he didnt look a bit like one he was so big and heavy and yet when snubby thought of it he walked very lightly and softly when he wanted to as he must have walked when he caught snubby snooping round his caravan snubby remembered how easily and lightly he leapt up to the necks of his elephants when he wanted to too yes he must have been a fine acrobat does he do any er acrobating now asked snubby who tonnerre old ma gave a squeal of laughter that fat old man he is nothing but an elephant now but still he can walk the tightrope and he can leap his own height from the ground but the strongest thing about tonnerre now is his temper he is afraid of nothing that one nothing but one thing and thats you isnt it old ma said snubby with a grin i say how long have i got to stir this stuff the smell is so super that i cant stand it much longer unless i keep licking the spoon old ma cackled again she liked snubby and his cheek you stay and have dinner with old ma she said just you and that dog of yours whats his name now snubby isnt it and yours is loony well well whoever named you was a clever one here ma youve got it all wrong protested snubby leaping out of the way as old ma emptied her tub of soapy water much too near him mind out loony she said to him and both dog and boy minded out now you set yourself down and wait a minute and ill give you the best meal youve ever tasted in your life old ma knows how to cook she does chapter more doings of snubby the others were quite jealous when they saw old ma ladling out an enormous plateful from her iron pot and presenting it to snubby look at that now said barney in amazement and envy never seen old ma so generous before how does snubby do it getting supper from old ma and meringues out of your cook and just pure cheek said roger gosh look old mas putting a plate down for loony too how wild all those mongrels look sitting in a ring there watching snubby came over to the others at last looking very satisfied with himself and his supper loony looked more than satisfied he looked extremely fat and developed a fit of hiccups at once stop it said snubby severely hiccups mean youve been overeating dont give yourself away like that loony loony did another hiccup and looked surprised sneezes and hiccups always surprised him they were so sudden and seemed to belong to him in some mysterious way that he couldnt understand he sat down and began to nod feeling full and comfortable snubby suddenly got the hiccups too and retired to get over them annoyed at the laughter and remarks of the others he decided to buy some sweets for hurly and burly he could see vosta walking them round the field holding them by their paws one on each side of him they loved a walk like that when there were plenty of people to see vosta brought them over to the hoopla stall miranda chattered to the two chimpanzees showing them the row of wooden rings she had pushed up her left arm ready to hand out to customers hurly held out a hand for some no you dont said barney swiftly why not asked roger well he rings everything in sight said barney never misses and then he makes such a clamour for the things hes ringed hes as cute as can be oh do lets see him begged diana snubby came up and joined in too he had a pocketful of cheap sweets for the chimpanzees and some better ones for himself and the others go on let him throw said snubby ill pay for the rings for him ill let him have them for nothing said barney but dont you let him grab the things he rings like he did last time mr vosta he smashed one of my clocks hurly threw a ring it fell exactly over a small doll he chattered excitedly everyone clapped him he threw another and that slid beautifully over a little green vase the third one fell round a packet of cigarettes without touching it it really was good throwing miranda deftly gathered up the rings and slipped them back on her arm she held out her hand to hurly for the penny he should have given her for them its all right hes not paying said barney and hes not having the things he ringed either take your great paws away hurly hurly was longing to get the things he had ringed snubby felt quite sorry for him it did seem a shame to throw so well and not have any reward he remembered the sweets he had bought he put his hand into his pocket to get the ones he had bought for them and they were not there of course hurly youve pinched the sweets i bought for you he cried and pulled at the chimpanzees hairy arm hurly at once put it round him and hugged him affectionately no youre a wicked pickpocket said snubby severely mr vosta i bought some sweets for them both and theyre gone hurly turn out your pockets said mr vosta sternly hurly whimpered and pulled at one of his pockets out came a bag of sweets bad boy naughty boy said vosta smacking him hard no more rings for you no more sweets either keep the sweets and give them to hurly and burly later on said snubby i bought them for them i say cant you let burly throw rings too yes but he goes wild after a bit and throws them at everybody said vosta so we dont encourage him to begin come along hurly and burly well go and see mr tonnerre and say goodnight to him and his elephants the chimpanzees loved the two elephants and went willingly to see them snubby roared to see one of the elephants put his trunk round burly and lift him right to the top of his great head there sat burly swinging himself to and fro chattering excitedly i wish i belonged to a fair said snubby enviously gosh wouldnt i like to have a couple of chimps like that id have a string of monkeys too and some elephants and i wouldnt mind a bear or two i think we ought to be going home to supper said roger looking at his watch i suppose you cant come too barney tonight id love to said barney but theres no one to take over my stall and as you can see were pretty busy tonight young un cant take it hes still with the elephants bad luck come on snubby we shant get any supper if we dont go now said roger i cant face supper tonight said snubby dolefully not after old mas helping out of her pot i just cant face it i say barney could i take over the hoopla stall for you and you go and have supper with the others what will tonnerre say said barney doubtfully i darent go and ask him hell probably run you out of the field if he sees you at the stall ill go and ask old ma said snubby suddenly tonnerres afraid of her if she says i can i will he went off to where she was hanging out clothes on a line she had put up from caravan to caravan ma he began im afraid of asking mr tonnerre so can i ask you instead barney wants to go off for a bit may i take over his stall ill do it properly course you can loony said old ma with a twinkle you and your dog snubby can surely look after a stall for an hour or two ill manage tonnerre if he starts shouting around whats she call you loony for asked roger who had followed him all right you neednt tell me i can guess its quite a good idea on her part snubby scowled then he cheered up he was to have the hoopla stall to himself that was fine hed make a terrific lot of money and show barney what he could do shall i leave miranda to help you asked barney no thanks i can manage with loony said snubby go on all of you leave me to it i shall do fine they went off and left him all feeling very hungry snubby must indeed have eaten a magnificent meal not to be able to manage two suppers snubby had a good time with the stall he really let himself go he tried out the loudest voice he possessed and it really was a pretty good one walkup walkup walkup walkup walkup walkup he bellowed finest stall in the fair clocks cigs chocs bowls spoons brooches pins ring anything you like try your skill try your skill mothers come and beat the fathers sisters come and beat your brothers choose what you like and ring it walkup walkup walkup people listened in amusement surprised to see such a small boy in charge of the stall snubby was only twelve and with his snub nose red hair and masses of freckles to say nothing of his cheeky grin he made people smile whenever they looked at him they drifted over to the hoopla stall and soon he was doing a brisk business loony was very useful he kept watch for any rings that fell to the ground and picked them up at once youre as good as miranda snubby told him and loony wagged his stump of a tail pleased tonnerre soon spotted that it was not barney in charge of the stall and he wandered over to see what was up when he saw snubby his face took on its look of black thunder snubby saw him and was petrified but old ma was there at once you let him be she cried shrilly hes doing fine you lay a finger on him tonnerre and ill tell you some of the things you did when you were a lad yes and i put you across my knee many a time and you yelled like but tonnerre was gone he was no match for old mas tongue and he knew it anyway the boy was doing well and taking money there was no need to interfere plenty of time later on to take it out of that snooping little rogue if he wanted to snubby stayed there till barney came back the others werent with him youre aunt says youre to go straight back he told snubby i dont think i ought to have left you here really she didnt seem very pleased thanks a lot i say did you take all that money yes it was easy boasted snubby and you should have seen tonnerre turn green when he came up and saw me raking in all that money more than hes taken all night with his elephants i bet he just faded away and didnt say a word to me i just looked him in the eye and go on you didnt do anything of the sort said barney who knew snubbys little ways very well indeed by now but anyway thanks very much i enjoyed my supper and going to your home again snubby remembered the sweets he had bought for himself and the others he felt hungry and thought he would like a few he could give some to barney too he put his hand into his pocket and gosh the sweets werent there blow that tiresome hurly must have taken them at the same time as he had taken the other bag snubby felt annoyed really hurly might have been content with just one bag he wasnt only dishonest he was greedy too im just going over to vostas caravan to see if hurlys got some more sweets of mine said snubby ill be back he went over to the van it was in darkness except for a very small oillamp burning on a shelf with a safetyledge snubby knocked a chattering noise greeted him and he heard the creaking of bunks hurly and burly slept in the same van as vosta he would never be separated from them even at night are you there mr vosta asked snubby but vosta was not there only the chimps were there curled up in their blankets on the small bunks they had hurly came to the door and opened it both chimpanzees could do ordinary things like that hurly did you take my sweets said snubby severely turn out your pockets but hurly had no clothes on he always had to undress at night and he stood there dressed only in his hairy coat loony sniffed at his legs with a bound burly was beside them trying to lift loony up in his arms oh burly dont loony doesnt like it said snubby trying to rescue poor loony get back to bed go on do you hear me to snubbys surprise the chimpanzees obeyed him they got back under their blankets making a few peculiar noises to one another snubby saw their clothes on the floor nearby he saw that there was a bulge in one of the pockets and he slipped his hand into it he pulled out his paper bag of sweets bad hurly he scolded go to sleep both of you i shant buy you sweets again if you behave like this goodnight you couple of scamps chapter a most exciting find snubby went over to barney again but barney didnt want any sweets he had had such a fine supper he said do go home he begged snubby your aunt will be so annoyed shell never ask me to supper again do go snubby snubby went very fortunately for him his aunt was telephoning to somebody so he simply crept behind her gave her a kiss and rushed upstairs before she could turn and scold him youre frightfully late snubby said rogers sleepy voice i say mother wasnt at all pleased at us leaving you there with the hoopla stall snubby yawned he suddenly found that he was really very tired he said a few words to roger and fell into bed after a very short wash and a rubover of his teeth it was the next morning that he discovered something that excited the three of them so tremendously that they could hardly do their morning tasks snubby overslept he rushed down late to breakfast got a scolding from his uncle and decided that he had better go straight upstairs and make his bed as soon after breakfast as possible to get out of any further scolding from his aunt he stripped his bed under the pillow was the bag of sweets he had rescued from hurlys pocket the night before he picked them up wishing that toffees didnt ooze out and make everything sticky stuck to the bag was a bit of torn paper snubby pulled it away without thinking there was something written on it but first he didnt even bother to read it then a word caught his eye castle that rang a bell in snubbys mind immediately of course and he smoothed out the dirty sticky bit of paper at once part of two words were there and the whole of one this is what snubby read oes castle midnig he stared in excitement he gave such a whistle of surprise that roger came over and looked at the paper too whats this he said where did you get it why the excitement roger hurly stole a bag of sweets last night and i went to get it out of his pocket in his van and stuck to the bag was this torn bit of paper it must have been part of a note said snubby his face red with excitement see what it says roger looked at it a lot more carefully he took it from snubby and his face went red too gosh yes oes thats the end of marloes i suppose marloes castle midnight that last word must surely be part of midnight i say snubby were on to something now the two stared at one another thrilled loony whined and scraped at snubbys leg what was up lets tell di said snubby and they called her she was as excited as they were lets work it out said roger how did this bit of paper get into hurlys pocket with the sweets to begin with well you know what hurly is he picks up anything he sees on the ground said snubby or he takes things out of peoples pockets he may have got this from anywhere somebody must have torn it up thats plain and probably thrown it away on the field this is just one of the bits who handed the note out and who got the note wondered diana or did a messenger come and give it to somebody in the fair or did it come by post to somebody who read it noted what it said and tore it up we cant tell the only thing we do know is that somebody got the note and somebody is going to marloes castle at midnight and we can jolly well guess why said snubby i say isnt this thrilling absolutely super smashing agreed roger i wonder who got the note do you suppose the one who got it is to meet the one who sent it theres only one way of finding out said snubby his eyes shining and his voice solemn only one way well have to go there at midnight ourselves and watch there was a silence i say what a thrill said roger but we dont know what night the note only says midnight it doesnt say monday tuesday wednesday though the whole note must have of course well well go every night then said snubby there was another silence anyone know how long the fairs going to be at rilloby said diana at last barney says till wednesday said snubby and today is thursday five more nights till they go and on one of them we know theres a robbery going to take place had we better tell the police do you think asked diana the boys looked at her scornfully what when were nicely on the track now dont be a spoilsport said roger besides what exactly can we tell the police about dianas hunch our suspicion of tonnerre and this torn note theyd laugh at us course they would said snubby who couldnt bear the thought of handing over this mystery to anyone else just like a girl to think of the police all right all right i dont want to said diana but i dont see how we can go on watching marloes castle for five nights running well be so sleepy we wont be able to do a thing the next day di the note says midnight said roger exasperated that means the robbery will be done then and we can go home and go to sleep pooh as if wed any of us go to sleep after seeing a robbery done said diana all right im not really making difficulties im just seeing whats the best thing to do it really was a most exciting thing to discuss mrs lynton couldnt imagine what was the matter with the children that morning no beds made no jobs done even loony not brushed what mischief are you planning i should like to know she said diana the beds if they are not made in the next twenty minutes i shall be really cross of course barney had to be told they streaked over to rilloby fair as soon as ever they could and got him into a corner where nobody could possibly hear them or see the torn bit of paper they handed him barney was amazed well think of that he said diana was right there is somebody in this fair whos got something to do with the robberies we saw tonnerre going off to the castle the other night said diana but the thing is i cant picture him doing any acrobatics climbing up walls and so on hes so big snubby remembered what old ma had told him he was a very fine acrobat he told the others and old ma says he can still walk tightropes and do things like that although hes so enormous how do you suppose he goes through locked doors asked diana perhaps he has skeleton keys or whatever you call them said snubby or perhaps he can wiggle the locks with a wire like some burglars can or perhaps its all perhaps perhaps said diana impatiently if only we could find out something solid its impossible to think of tonnerre doing the robbery and yet he went off to the castle the other night and we know hes the one who decides where the fairs to go and it always seems to go to a place where there is some valuable collection of papers its a good old mystery said snubby and were going to solve it weve only got to hide somewhere in the grounds of the castle some time before midnight and watch who comes and what he does easy oh very easy said diana mockingly and how do you suppose youre going to get into the grounds can you walk through a locked gate or through a high wall its easy enough to get into the grounds said barney there are spikes at the top of the wall we can chuck up a ropeladder let it catch on the spikes and climb up well im not sitting on any spikes thank you said diana promptly dianas not very helpful is she said snubby getting annoyed with her lets leave her out of it no said barney shes in it all right of course she doesnt want to sit on spikes nobody does but well just take half a dozen sacks fold them and pop them over the spikes we can climb over easily enough then and hide somewhere where we can watch the windows of that wing said snubby gosh well go tonight wont we all of us what an adventure yes tonight said barney well meet at eleven oclock near the gate and for goodness sake keep quiet just in case somebody else is hiding there too chapter midnight at the castle snubby could hardly contain himself all day he whistled and sang and was altogether so noisy and restless that greatuncle robert nearly went mad wherever he was he could hear snubby making a noise what was the matter with that boy the evening came at last to mrs lyntons surprise snubby didnt seem to be hungry for his dinner nor diana roger ate stolidly as usual he wasnt so excitable as the other two do you feel quite well snubby asked mrs lynton anxiously when he refused a second helping and you too diana im all right said snubby and mrs lynton looking at his bright red cheeks and shining eyes had no more doubts of his health i suppose youve been stuffing yourself up with sweets and icecreams again she said well i shall think twice about getting you a nice supper if you do that they all went to bed at the usual time but they didnt undress roger fell asleep and had to be awakened at halfpast ten are mother and dad in bed yet whispered roger yes they went early thank goodness there isnt a light anywhere except in greatuncles room said diana hes reading in bed i expect they crept downstairs warning each other to look out for sardine but sardine was away on business of her own that night loony crept down with them his tailstump wagging what was up they went into the moonlit garden and out of the gate then they made off across the fields to marloes castle there was a shortcut to it which didnt take very long they came to the big iron gates and then disappeared into the hedge on the other side diana gave a sudden little scream shut up idiot said roger fiercely in a low tone diana pulled away from him shaking theres somebody there already she whispered oh roger so there was but it was only barney and miranda who had got there first and happened to choose just the bit of hedge that diana had pushed herself into barney came out grinning sorry i scared you diana you scared me too you were all so quiet i didnt hear you i got an awful fright when you pushed against me in the hedge have you seen anything or anyone asked roger not a thing said barney come on well choose a place to get over the wall ive got a rough ropeladder and a few thick sacks carry the sacks roger and snubby and ill take the rope with miranda on his shoulder and loony at his heels barney led the way keeping to the shadows of the hedge they came at last to a place where the wall curved round and the spikes did not seem to be quite so thick thisll do said barney in a low voice snubby will loony growl if he hears anyone and warn us yes of course said snubby loony do you hear youre on guard on guard woof said loony understanding at once and he sat down ears eyes and nose all on guard together the four of them got busy barney deftly threw the ropeladder up to the spikes the first time it slithered back again the second time the spikes held one of the rungs barney pulled it was quite tight up he went like a cat his feet treading the wooden rungs lightly chuck up the sacks he whispered down roger and snubby threw them up one by one barney put them in a neat pile over a dozen or so of the sharp pointed spikes then sitting on the sacks he pulled at the ropeladder till he had got a lot of loose slack up enough to let half the ladder down the other side into the grounds thats jolly clever thought roger admiringly a ladder up to the top and a ladder down the other side and a pile of sacks in the middle to protect him against the spikes i should never have thought of all that come on up whispered barney diana went up first barney helped her over and she sat on the sacks beside him he then helped her down the other side then came roger then snubby hauling up loony with great difficulty helped by barney no good leaving him outside the wall gasped snubby hed bark the place down gosh loony youre an awful lump whoa there youre falling i say hes gone down the other side at top speed hell break his legs there was a thud and a yelp diana called up softly its all right hes not hurt hes like sardine always falls on his feet barney pulled up the ladder so that no one could climb up it from the road the place he had chosen to climb over the wall was in deep shadow and nobody could see the pile of sacks on the spikes from the road barney slipped down and joined the others where shall we hide whispered roger excited barney stood a moment or two to get his bearings there are the barred windows up there he whispered lets make our way to that clump of trees we can watch the windows easily from there they crept from tree to tree and shrub to shrub until they were under the clump that barney had decided on from there they could easily see the barred windows now if any thief were going to enter from outside they couldnt possibly help seeing him they found a dry place under a bush and huddled together parting the branches to keep a good lookout on the windows from somewhere not far off a church clock began to strike it chimed first and then the deep clanging sounds came through the moonlight night one two three counted snubby under his breath its going to strike twelve its midnight we must watch out lie down loony not a whimper from you on guard old fellow on guard there wasnt a sound anywhere then a nightingale began to sing but it didnt sing for long just tried out its notes and stopped not for a week or two would it sing all night long not even an owl hooted the children watched the moon move slowly along the sky and waited patiently loony listened with both his ears diana always thought he would be able to hear much better if his earholes were not covered up by such long drooping ears but drooping ears or not he still heard twice as well as they did the church clock chimed the quarter and then the halfhour snubby yawned diana felt cold miranda cuddled inside barneys shirt and went to sleep the clock chimed the threequarters still there was no sound there was not even a tiny breeze blowing that night and no mouse or rat or rabbit was to be seen or heard i say i dont think the thiefs coming tonight whispered barney its long past midnight this cant be the night wed better go nobody minded they were cold and tired the excitement had fizzled out and they all thought longingly of nice warm beds loony gave a sigh of relief when he felt them on the move once more come on then said diana thankfully weve had enough for tonight well try again tomorrow they made their way to the wall still keeping well in the shadows just in case anyone was about over the wall they went and down the other side barney sat on the sacks beside the rope unhitched it from the spikes and threw it down to roger have to leave the sacks here and hope no one notices them he said taking a flying leap to the ground he landed on hands and knees and rolled over quite unhurt he sat up dont you think the sacks will be noticed by anyone coming down the lane asked diana anxiously no this bit of the wall is well hidden by trees and unless anyone is actually walking just below looking up i dont think theyd be noticed said barney well stuff the ropeladder under this bush save us carrying it to and fro they were silent and disappointed as they went off down the lane they said goodnight at the fork and barney went one way and they another taking the shortcut across the fields better luck next time said roger to diana rather gloomily when he said goodnight gosh im sleepy they all overslept the next morning of course and mr lynton told them wrathfully that they would have to go to bed an hour earlier that night but alas when the evening came barney roger and diana were all feeling ill diana and the two boys had gone over to see barney at rilloby fair and roger had bought some sausage sandwiches snubby refused them and bought himself some tomato sandwiches of which he was very fond as he was the only one who didnt feel very sick that night everyone felt that the sausage sandwiches must be to blame barney put young un in charge of the hoopla stall and staggered off to the caravan he shared with somebody else feeling very ill roger and diana got home somehow and promptly collapsed in the hall groaning snubby rushed to tell mrs lynton its the sausage sandwiches he explained there must have been something wrong with them they feel awfully sick they were poor things mrs lynton got them into bed and dosed them well snubby looked in on them and was quite shocked to see them looking so green oh i say what about tonight he asked in a loud whisper will you be able to go and watch roger groaned of course not i dont feel as if i shall ever be able to get up again diana didnt even answer when he asked her she felt really ill snubby tiptoed out with a most surprised loony and fell over sardine on the stairs oh snubby dont do that said mrs lynton crossly looking out of the lounge door cant you possibly be quiet when people are feeling ill well i like that said snubby indignantly how did i know sardine was lying in wait for me its sardine you want to nag at not me now snubby dont you talk to me like that began mrs lynton advancing on him but snubby fled what about tonight somebody ought to watch surely all right snubby would watch all alone chapter a night out for snubby snubby went to bed very early for two reasons one was that mrs lynton was worried about the other two and was inclined to be very cross with snubby he thought it best to get out of her way the other was that he had quite made up his mind to go and watch in the castlegrounds by himself that night and he wanted to get a little sleep before he went so he popped off to bed immediately after supper and took an alarm clock with him set for a quarterpast eleven he put it under his pillow wrapped in a scarf so that it would be heard only by him he hoped roger wouldnt hear it roger was sound asleep exhausted by his bouts of sickness snubby didnt undress he just got into bed and shut his eyes immediately he was asleep and slept peacefully till the alarm went off loony who was on his bed leapt up in fright barking shut up you silly crazy idiot said snubby fiercely and loony shut up snubby lay and listened for a moment after he had shut off the alarm had anyone heard apparently not roger muttered something in his sleep but that was all nobody else seemed to be stirring good snubby got cautiously out of bed and felt for his clothes remembered with agreeable surprise that he was fully dressed and got his coat out of the cupboard he had been cold the night before and snubby didnt like feeling cold come on loony and if you fall over sardine on the stairs ill drown you snubby threatened they got downstairs safely and were soon running over the fields loony surprised but pleased at this second unusual excursion they came to the castle walls as the church clock struck the threequarters a quarter to midnight thought snubby feeling feverishly about in the bush for the ropeladder blow it wheres the ladder is this the right bush it wasnt loony knew the right bush and dragged out the ladder for snubby then followed an agonised five minutes with snubby trying to throw the ladder up to the spikes it wasnt as easy as it had looked when barney did it snubby grew extremely hot and agitated go up and stick you beast of a ladder he muttered and miraculously the ladder did stick on a spike or two and held up went snubby joyfully pleased to find that the ladder was fairly close to the pile of sacks that barney had left on the spikes he lifted them off and pulled them to the ropeladder soon he was sitting on them the spikes beneath him blunted by the sacking he hauled up the ladder in the way that barney had done and soon half was on one side of the wall and half on the other snubby felt really proud of himself as he climbed down the other side into the grounds the church clock struck midnight dong dong dong it began a whine reached snubby and he stopped short blow ive forgotten loony i dont see how im going to get him up without help hell have to stay on the other side ill put him on guard he climbed up to the top again and whispered to loony its all right old fellow i shant be long youre on guard see on guard loony settled down with a whimper all right he would be on guard but he thought it was very mean of snubby to go off without him snubby crept over to the clump of trees where he and the others had stood the night before it was a moonlight night again but with much more cloud about there were periods of brilliant light and then periods of darkness when the moon went behind clouds snubby settled down under a bush and waited he felt extremely pleased with himself he had been the only one sensible enough not to take the sausage sandwiches he had actually got over the wall by himself and he didnt feel a scrap scared not a scrap he hadnt even got loony with him and he felt as brave as a lion yes snubby felt very pleased with himself indeed ready for anything that might happen the moon went in everywhere became dark and in the darkness snubby thought he heard a little noise he didnt know if it was near him or not he listened and thought he heard another small noise no it wasnt near him it was over by the castle he thought he waited impatiently for the moon to come out again when it came out snubby got a terrific shock a black shadow seemed to be climbing up the side of the castle walls up it went and up lithe and confident snubby strained his eyes who was it it was too far away to see was it tonnerre no surely it wasnt nearly big enough for him but the moonlight played tricks with your eyes it looked as if the black figure was climbing up a pipe leaping on to windowsills climbing up again now scrambling up ivy this was the thief all right no doubt about that but how was he going to get through the barred windows snubby held his breath to see the bars were so close together oh blow the moon it had gone behind a cloud again when it came sailing out one more there was no sign of the climbing figure it had vanished snubby suddenly began to feel very scared indeed his hair gradually rose up from his head with a horrid prickly sensation shivers went down his spine he longed for loony his eyes began to play tricks with him was that a figure standing at the bottom of the castle walls far below the barred windows or was it a shadow was that a figure halfway up the walls no no that was the outline of a small window was that a figure up on the roof by the chimney no no of course not it was a shadow just the shadow of the chimney and was that a snubby groaned and shut his eyes he was scared stiff why had he come why had he thought he was so brave he darent look anywhere because he thought he saw sinister figures creeping climbing running oh loony loony if only you werent on the other side of the wall there was a noise near him somebody was panting not far off snubby turned quite cold with fear he stayed absolutely still hoping that whoever or whatever it was would go away but it didnt it came nearer and nearer there was the crack of twigs the rustle of dead leaves under the bushes snubby nearly died of fright and then worse than ever something stuck itself into his back and snuffled there snubby was absolutely petrified what was it a tiny whimper came to him and snubby felt so relieved that he could have wept it was loony he got the spaniels head in his hands and let the delighted loony lick his face till it was wet all over loony he whispered its really you how did you get here you couldnt climb that ladder oh loony i was never so glad to see you in all my life loony was simply delighted at his welcome having been left on guard he had been afraid that snubby would be very angry to see him but it was all right snubby was pleased very very pleased it didnt matter that loony had left the place he had to guard had found a convenient hole by the wall and had enlarged it to go underneath it with terrific squeezings and struggling everything was all right he had found his master and what a welcome he had got snubby recovered completely from his fright he sat with his arm round loony and squeezed him telling him in whispers what he had seen then he stiffened again as loony growled softly his hackles rising at the back of his neck what is it whats the matter is it the thief coming back whispered snubby but it was quite impossible to see anything because the moon was now behind a very big cloud indeed loony went on growling softly snubby didnt dare to move he thought he heard noises from the direction of the castle and longed for the moon to come out again it came out for a fleeting instant and snubby thought he saw a black figure descending the walls again but he couldnt be sure anyway he was sure of one thing he wasnt going to move from his hidingplace for a very long while he didnt want to bump up against that terrifying robber he cuddled up to loony and put his head on the dogs warm silkycoated body loony licked him lovingly most surprisingly snubby went to sleep when he awoke he couldnt at first think where he was then with a twinge of fright he remembered good gracious how long had he been asleep he waited till the church clock struck again and found with relief that he hadnt slept for more than half an hour how could he have gone to sleep like that anyway it should be safe to go home again now surely the thief would have gone long since my word what a tale he had to tell the others feeling a good deal braver with loony at his heels snubby pushed his way cautiously out of the bush the moon came out and lighted up the castle brilliantly nothing was to be seen of any climbing creeping figure with a sigh of relief snubby made his way to the wall somehow he missed his way and wandered too far to the left towards the iron gates and then he got a really dreadful shock he came through a little copse of trees and found himself looking into a small dell and from the dell many pairs of gleaming eyes looked up at him he could see small shadowy bodies behind but it was the eyes that frightened him the moon sent its beams into the little dell and picked out the glassy staring eyes that seemed to watch snubby warily loony growled and then barked his hackles rising again he backed away and began to whimper then snubby knew that poor loony too was scared and he turned and fled how he ran stumbling through bushes and shrubs tearing his coat scratching his legs away away from those gleaming eyes that waited for him in the dell how he found the ladder he never knew he climbed up it pulled it up behind him loosened it from the spikes and sent it down to the ground he left the sacks and flung himself to the ground he wasnt as clever as barney at this kind of thing and fell far too heavily twisting one ankle and bruising and grazing his knees badly loony ran to find his hole he squeezed through with difficulty and raced up to snubby snubby was trembling almost in tears he flung his arms round loonys neck keep with me loony lets go home theres something queer about and i dont like it keep near me loony had every intention of doing so he wasnt feeling too happy himself he kept as close to snubbys feet as he could almost tripping him up at times the two of them took the shortcut across the fields and got home at last roger was sound asleep so was diana snubby longed to wake them up and tell them everything but he hadnt the heart to they had both been so very very sick but he woke them up early in the morning and told them he shook roger and woke up diana he made roger go into dianas room and then he told them both i had an adventure last night he said youll never believe it listen chapter its all in the papers roger and diana still felt a little weak from their upset of the day before they were not too pleased at being awakened so early but they soon pricked up their ears when they heard snubbys story he exaggerated of course which was a pity he related how he had gone to the wall and got over it how he had waited without loony and how he had suddenly seen the black figure climbing up the wall up and up said snubby jumping from windowsill to windowsill climbing up the ivy using pipes gosh you should have seen him talk about an acrobat was it tonnerre asked roger excitedly might have been said snubby i was too far away to see and there was a figure at the foot of the walls too and one on the roof and by the time snubby had finished it sounded as if the castle grounds had been swarming with thieves i saw something else too went on snubby both of us saw them loony too and loony was really scared i bet you were too said diana i was as brave as could be said snubby most untruthfully having completely forgotten his terror do listen well we came to a little kind of dell and there lying in wait for us were all kinds of things with gleaming eyes and i suppose you did what any sensible person would have done you took to your heels and fled said roger well i didnt stay long admitted snubby nor would you you bet i wouldnt said roger what did they do snarl growl call out oh a kind of mixture of all the lot said snubby exaggerating wildly again and one or two took a step forward as if they were going for loony and me diana and roger couldnt help being impressed by all this could you take us to see this field asked roger in the daytime not at night said snubby promptly well go this morning but they didnt when snubby got down to breakfast late as usual but forgiven because he offered to take up breakfast trays to roger and diana he found everyone exclaiming over the morning paper whats up asked snubby and suddenly he knew of course the robbery it would be in the paper so it was with big headlines strange robbery last night at marloes castle stuffed animals taken and left in grounds is thief a madman how did he get in through fastened windows and locked doors snubby looked over the shoulders of the grownups and read the report there it all was somebody had mysteriously got into the locked room and had taken dear me how queer taken all the smaller animals but apparently nothing else snubby felt himself blushing gosh those gleaming eyes they must have been the eyes of the stuffed animals that the thief had put together in that little dell why had he said anything about the creatures making noises and moving towards him oh gosh the others would rag him like anything snubby ate his breakfast very soberly he didnt say a word about what he knew he would let the grownups discuss it and wondered what to say to roger and diana upstairs he was very puzzled why had the thief stolen worthless animals why hadnt he taken the valuable papers there it didnt make sense was the thief really a madman then he must be a different thief from the one that so sensibly took rare papers and anyway how did even a madman get into that room snubby had seen him climbing the wall but according to the papers the windows were still fastened and the bars unbroken greatuncle robert suddenly gave a loud exclamation and made everyone jump listen to this its in the stoppress news theyve found a clue to the thief what mr and mrs lynton and snubby chorussed greatuncle robert lowered the paper and spoke in a very peculiar kind of voice the clue theyve found out in the grounds is a green glove he stared hard at snubby snubby went pale gosh how extraordinary why ever had he made up that fool story of the green hands gang that wore green gloves it was going to haunt him for the rest of his life i think said greatuncle ominously i think it must be the green hands gang what do you think snubby mr and mrs lynton stared at greatuncle and snubby in bewilderment snubby swallowed down his last bit of toast nearly choked and got up i er i dont know anything about a green hands gang he said nothing at all aunt susan ill go and get rogers tray and dianas mr lynton turned to greatuncle when snubby had gone what is all this he said it sounds like a film plot or something green hands gang absurd the time has come for me to tell you what i know said greatuncle solemnly it isnt much i dismissed it the last few days as snubbys silly makeup but now that a green glove has been found things look different whereupon he told them the fairy tale that snubby had told him in the train about the gang that had its hold on snubby because of his stumbling on their plot his running away and how he had told greatuncle that the gang called the green hands gang because they wore green gloves would be operating at ricklesham stealing valuable papers and bless us all so they did said uncle robert and heres a theft again and a green glove is dropped snubbys been pulling your leg uncle robert said mrs lynton soothingly ill speak to him about this yes but the green glove said uncle robert the boy couldnt have made that up there actually is a clue of a green glove coincidence sheer chance said mr lynton impatiently snubby doesnt know a thing he wants a good whacking and ill see he gets it no no dont do that said uncle robert in alarm i really do think snubby knows something give him a chance richard i wouldnt have given him away if id known you would whip him oh its beer coming to him for some long time said mr lynton gathering up his letters you can tell him from me that hes going to get a whacking unless of course he really does know something and can produce a member if this wonderful gang who actually does wear green gloves pah out he went greatuncle robert sighed he was getting mixed up in a lot of things dear dear to think marloes castle was burgled and not one of those precious papers taken only the stuffed animals extraordinary snubby tiptoed into the room where only greatuncle was left there what did you tell them he demanded uncle richards furious i can tell by the way he went out my boy i told them what you had told me and they not only disbelieved your whole tale in spite of the green gloves said greatuncle solemnly but your uncle i very much regret to say is going to give you a beating unless you can er produce one of the green glove thieves you shouldnt have given me away said poor snubby feeling very sorry for himself indeed didnt i twist my ankle last night and bruise and cut my knees look and now im to have a whacking it isnt fair especially as i know more than anyone else about the burglary do you said greatuncle startled or is that just another of your tales he asked more cautiously tell me im not telling you or anybody else a single thing declared snubby almost in tears sneaking and blabbing like that getting me a whacking its not fair i wish there was a green hands gang id jolly well set them on to everyone in this house and be glad to he went out and slammed the door greatuncle was upset and worried he also felt extremely muddled dear dear snubby was a most unreliable and really extraordinary boy chapter the police arrive suddenly quite a lot of things began to happen the first one was the arrival of the police i say theres inspector williams coming up the front path and somebody in plain clothes with him a detective i should think called roger in excitement why should they come here said diana snubby began to shake at the knees had greatuncle said anything to the police about the green hands gang surely not poor snubby crept into the boxroom and shut the door he was absolutely certain that the police had come to question him about his idiotic green hands story ill never make up a tale again never vowed poor snubby this one has followed me and followed me and however much i say i made it up no one will believe me now that a green glove has been found the inspector asked for greatuncle robert he and his colleague were shown into the study mr robert lynton asked the inspector ive come in connection with this queer marloes castle case sir lord marloes asked us to come and have a word with you he is thinking of placing all his papers somewhere in safety now that a thief has actually been able to get into the room where he keeps them funny business that sir taking the animals and leaving the papers must be mad i should think very strange indeed agreed greatuncle er does lord marloes want me to do anything about the papers for him yes sir he wondered if you would go up to the castle and advise the custodian how to pack them and in what order they should be packed and so on said the inspector id be pleased to said greatuncle theres another thing said the inspector when you went there with the children the other day sir did you notice two other men there yes i did said greatuncle why well sir anyone visiting the marloes collection has to have a pass on which is written his name and address said the inspector he gave greatuncle three passes thats yours sir with the names of the three children on thats another visitors a professor cummings very very bent old fellow and heres another name of alfred james smith address given thurlow crescent leeds well weve checked yours of course and professor cummings addresses given correct but in the case of this third one sir its false i suppose said greatuncle getting excited but why and whats the connection between a man with a false name and address coming to look at the papers and another man presumably mad coming to steal the stuffed animals it doesnt make sense youre right it doesnt agreed the inspector and the plainclothes man nodded his head but it may be there is a connection and we want to find out all we can about this fellow with the false name and address can you give us an exact description sir well no i cant i hardly noticed him said greatuncle but why not ask the three children theyre as sharp as needles all of them theyll give you a full description good idea can you get them for us sir said the inspector greatuncle rose and went out he called loudly roger the police want to have a word with you three come down will you roger felt excited what was up he went to fetch diana wheres snubby snubby i say snubby where are you the police want to talk to you snubbys heart went cold inside him he clutched at the trunk he was sitting on now what would happen to him snubby where are you yelled roger he opened the boxroom door gosh what do you think youre doing in here all alone with loony didnt you hear me calling you come on down the police want a word with us snubby rose and with shaking knees went down the stairs roger and diana skipped down thrilled good morning youngsters said the inspector with a very nice smile i want a word with you now did any of you notice the two men who were in the room with you at marloes castle when you went to see the animals and the papers snubbys heart lightened a little perhaps the police hadnt come for him after all roger nodded yes i remember them quite well one was very old and bent he bent so far forward that we couldnt see his face and the other one was so hairy you couldnt see his face either said diana the plainclothes man who had been writing in a little notebook looked up at this description how hairy was he he asked well said diana he had very thick hair on his head thick shaggy eyebrows a thick moustache and a beard you couldnt tell what he was really like at all because he was all hair was he big asked the detective yes said diana a heavy sort of man why do you know him the detective was turning back some pages of his notebook your description happens to fit men who were known to visit two collections of rare documents some of which were stolen recently he said it fits exactly in fact the children digested this in silence then do you think thats the man that stole the other papers and stole the animals from marloes castle too asked rover at last why should he take those motheaten animals ask me another said the detective now would you know this hairy man again if you saw him yes if he was still hairy said roger but i should think most of the hair was false youre probably right said the inspector er did you see the mans hands by any chance the children frowned trying to remember i saw him using a magnifying glass sliding it up and down the pages said roger and as far as i can remember he had quite ordinary hands i didnt notice that they were very hairy now i come to think of it and perhaps they should have been as he was such a hairy man greatuncle roberts got an awful lot of hair and his hands are hairy on the back look everyone gazed at greatuncles hairy hands he looked rather uncomfortable and put them in his pockets as soon as he could would you say that the hairy man could wear this glove said the inspector producing a green glove from his pocket the children gazed at the glove loony went over to it and sniffed it excitedly he pawed at it and whined why he knows who wore that glove said snubby astonished thats the way he always acts if you show him anything that smells of a person he knows aha now were getting somewhere said the detective sitting up suddenly you sure your dog knows the owner of that glove quite sure then that narrows things down considerably the owner of the glove must be somebody you children know gosh said roger his thoughts flying to tonnerre at once he looked closely at the glove it was a small one made of the very softest finest leather imaginable no he didnt think it would fit tonnerre as far as he remembered tonnerre had very large hands or had he perhaps he hadnt perhaps roger only thought that because tonnerre was enormous and therefore it seemed right for him to have large hands snubby took the glove and looked at it loony stood on his hind legs still sniffing and whining if only he could speak what name would he say who wears this glove loony asked snubby woof said loony at once the detective took the glove from snubby and tossed it to the inspector he didnt want loony to nibble their biggest clue you havent answered my question said the inspector pocketing the glove i asked you if you thought the hairy man could have worn a glove as small as this the children thought hard yes he might said roger i dont remember said diana he couldnt possibly said snubby hmm very helpful said the inspector with a laugh well thanks children thats all i want to ask you keep your eyes open for the hairy man will you its just possible he might tell us a few interesting things if we can find him snubby escaped thankfully throwing a grateful glance at greatuncle robert loony tore after the children roger stopped to pat him so you know who the owner of the green glove is do you he said who wore that glove so as not to leave fingerprints loony and wheres the other glove of the pair cant you find it cant you tell us anything woofwoof said loony joyfully enjoying this earnest conversation and leaping round roger excitedly its funny about that hairy man isnt it said diana what was he doing there that day if he was the thief looking to see if there were any papers worth stealing or what goodness knows said roger its all a muddle the hairy man the green glove the stolen animals and loony knowing who it is its really very very peculiar chapter quite a lot of talk roger and diana felt quite themselves again and suggested going over to see barney to see if he had got over his sick attack too they had a tremendous lot to tell him yes you go and see him said mrs lynton a walk on this sunny morning will do you good after that nasty attack you had yesterday be careful what you buy at the fair please youd be wise not to buy any food there at all after your horrid experience they went off together loony wild with delight at the thought of a walk he capered ahead putting his head down every hole they came to sniffing for rabbits barney was quite all right again he had felt very sick and ill all night but had at last gone to sleep and slept soundly till ten oclock that morning now he was up and about whistling giving his hoopla stall a really good clean down its saturday he explained we always get most people that day so i like to have everything looking spick and span hey miranda leave loony alone if you pull his long ears hell pull your long tail but thats just what loony couldnt do because miranda aggravatingly went and sat up on top of the round roof of the stall swinging her tail well out of poor loonys reach barney have you seen the paper said roger urgently no said barney surprised whats up gosh you dont mean to say theres been a robbery at the castle blow weve missed it we were ill and didnt go to watch sh said diana warningly weve heaps to tell you barney can you come into some safe place for half an hour where no one can hear us let me finish cleaning my stall and ill come said barney looking thrilled ill be another ten minutes go and talk to the chimps they seem rather down in the mouth this morning so they were they sat together their arms twined round one another looking very mournful have they had sausage sandwiches too asked snubby of vosta but vosta seemed cross and answered him shortly dont be silly id never give them that kind of food theyre all right tonnerres been at them thats all they cant bear his shouting nor can i said roger putting his hand to his ears he could hear tonnerre yelling loudly somebody else was getting into trouble too it was young un he came along howling holding one side of his head whacked me for nothing he wailed and showed the children his red and swollen ear said id kept some of his elephantride money for myself i didnt but i will next time no you mustnt said diana shocked why not asked poor young un look hes boxed my ears for something i didnt do all right ill go and do it then to earn my punishment ill be straight with him then straight with him and crooked with yourself said roger dont do anything wrong young un youll be sorry young un didnt think so hed get even with tonnerre see if he wouldnt he went off muttering the children left the badtempered vosta and his mournful chimps with their arms still round one another and went to see if barney was ready he was they went off to the caravan barney shared with another boy well be all right here if we talk quietly said barney now whats in the paper whats happened they had bought a paper on the way and they showed it to barney his face was a study as he read about the curious robbery stuffed animals are they valuable he asked not these said roger theyre the ones we saw ourselves up in the castle motheaten badlystuffed things and i saw them in the castle grounds last night where the thief had put them and where the police found them this morning put in snubby barneys eyes nearly fell out of his head what he said did you go last night all by yourself to watch my but youre a brave one snubby swelled with pride at this he told his story to barney who listened with intense interest barney do you know anyone who wears green gloves small ones asked diana eagerly especially an acrobatic man one who could climb up steep walls and jump from sill to sill and all that does tonnerre wear green gloves ever asked snubby in a whisper never seen him wear any gloves at all never seen anyone in the fair wear gloves said barney why theyd laugh at it is there anyone in the fair whos an acrobat and has small hands asked diana anyone at all barney thought hard theres vosta he said at last hes a fine acrobat you know though training chimps is his job here and hes got small hands almost like a womans vosta could it be vosta did the figure you saw climbing up the wall look anything like vosta roger asked snubby snubby considered well its difficult to say because i really couldnt see him clearly all i know is he seemed absolutely certain and confident in all his movements said snubby as if he was quite used to such amazing climbing and leaping it cant be vosta said barney he wouldnt be such an idiot as to steal the wrong things the one who steals the papers and things must either know them himself or be told in great detail which to take vosta wouldnt be such an idiot something went wrong last night roger got out his map the map he had made of the room in the castle we mustnt forget that once again the thief apparently got in through fastened and locked windows he said the paper says he didnt go through the locked doors because theres a burglar alarm set there which rings if a door is opened at night and the alarm didnt ring so the doors werent opened they looked at the map poring over it it was obvious that the thief meant to get in through the windows as he climbed the outside walls but how did he unfasten windows that were locked on the inside and how in the world did he squeeze through the narrow bars give it up said roger unless by any chance he was santa claus and came down the chimney now thats an idea would the thief be santa claus do you suppose snubby did it look like santa climbing up the walls dont be daft said snubby all the same i did think i saw a figure up on the roof by the chimney you saw figures everywhere according to you said diana disbelievingly the trouble with you snubby is that we never know how much you are exaggerating you dont suppose the thief could come down the chimney do you asked roger suddenly joking apart i mean look ive marked where the fireplace is in this map there was only one chimney up on the roof of that wing because i expect all the fireplaces in the wing are under one another in each room and one chimney serves for all these old houses have very wide chimneys said diana big enough for a man to come down them quite easily i should think that fireplace didnt look awfully big though said snubby remembering i could have got down perhaps but im pretty certain that a fellow as big as tonnerre couldnt then well have to rule the chimney out too said roger its queer you know its impossible for anyone to have gone through the burglaralarm doors its impossible for anyone to have unfastened the windows from outside and were agreed that the chimney and fireplace are too small for anyone to get down those all these impossibilities and yet somebody found it possible to enter that room and take from it a dozen or so stuffed animals he couldnt have taken them all at once said snubby there were too many he must have made a good many journeys i suppose he did all his climbing up and down whilst i popped off to sleep for half an hour well you didnt tell us that before said diana i didnt think about it said snubby footsteps came up the caravan steps at that moment and the door was flung open tonnerre stood there black as thunder so this is where you idle with your fine friends barney he roared reading the newspapers too when you should be doing your work he snatched the paper from barney and tore it across snubby began to tremble he really was scared of tonnerre get back to your work he roared to barney and you you clear out of my field he shouted at the others not this boy though aha it is the little snooper again i will take him to my caravan and teach him a few things come my little snooper poor snubby was hauled off before the others could do anything roger and barney ran off after the angry tonnerre but they might as well have been dogs barking at a bull for all the notice he took of them he really was in a towering rage barney ran to old ma old ma can you go after mr tonnerre and make him let snubby go he hasnt done anything but even old ma was afraid of tonnerre that day a blackhearted man he is she said staring after him as he dragged poor snubby to his van i cant do nothing with him in one of his black moods but loony wasnt afraid of anyone if they were hurting his beloved snubby he flew at tonnerre snapping and growling he snapped at his ankles all the way up the steps of tonnerres caravan he tore his trousers as he went in and he bit his leg so hard at last that tonnerre dropped snubby with a yell and turned on the dog loony shot out of his way under the bunkbeds snubby took his chance and leapt down the caravan stops taking them all in one bound tonnerre leapt after him also taking the steps in one bound loony was scrabbling under the bunk he came out with something in his mouth and shot down the steps with it he dropped it on the ground and went after tonnerre again at top speed diana standing nearby quite petrified by all this looked to see what loony had dropped she stared in the greatest amazement it was a green glove partner to the one that the police had shown the children that morning chapter the second green glove diana picked up the glove at once she stuffed it into the pocket of her dress she didnt know why she did that she just felt that it was important that she should snubby was now outside the field gate loony was worrying tonnerres ankles and the giantlike man was kicking out at him shouting all the people in the fair ground were watching most of them silent barney sidled up to roger take diana and go go through the gate at the opposite end of the field snubbys all right now hell race home dont come back here i shall leave this fair today tonnerres got his knife into me and i wont work for him any more ill come to your home and tell you whats happened as soon as i can go quickly now will you be all right barney asked diana anxiously as roger pulled her away to the gate barney had pointed to barney nodded i know how to look after myself tonnerres had some bad luck somethings gone wrong with him hes always like this then a dangerous fellow did you notice his hands enormous he couldnt have worn that green glove diana had no time to tell him about the other glove she was being dragged out of the gate at top speed by roger they set off to skirt the field and join poor snubby they found him sitting on a fence by the roadside loony licking his ankles he looked rather pale and gave them a watery grin hallo he said so you escaped all right gosh im scared stiff of tonnerre i shall dream about him all night come on home quick ive got something to show you said diana they went home together loony at their heels occasionally looking back to see if tonnerre was by any chance stalking them but he wasnt of course he was probably giving poor barney a bad time now diana could hardly contain herself she was bursting to produce the glove come into the summerhouse quickly she said come on they all went in and sat down sardine strolled in to join them loony wagged his tail feeling so pleased with himself for biting tonnerre that he couldnt even find it in him to chase sardine diana put her hand in her pocket and took out the green glove the boys stared at it where did you get it asked roger did the police leave it somewhere no its not the glove they brought its the other glove said diana what do you think of that roger snatched it up with a loud exclamation good gracious where did you get it i didnt get it said diana loony did when tonnerre tool snubby into his caravan loony followed snapping and snarling and when he came out he had this green glove in his mouth he must have picked it up from the floor of the van both boys stared at the glove and roger fingered it and turned it over in his hands what exactly does that mean then he said as far as i can see it means that although tonnerre himself cant wear these he lends them to someone who does in other words he lends them to the thief thats right said snubby he bent down and held the glove to loonys nose the spaniel at once whined and sniffed excitedly see he knows the owner of this glove too its the same owner as the glove he sniffed this morning its somebody at the fair said snubby its vosta then said roger i noticed he had quite small hands this morning diana slipped the glove on to her own hand it fitted her perfectly she laughed she put on a mysterious sinister voice i belong to the green hands gang she said in a deep hollow voice see my green glove greatuncle robert was coming up to the summerhouse with a book when he suddenly heard these words spoken in a very peculiar voice indeed he stopped alarmed who was that speaking what a queer voice and good gracious was that a greengloved hand appearing out of the door of the summerhouse it was diana was now doing a weird dance in the little house and waving her greengloved hand about greatuncle robert was very surprised indeed he suddenly walked determinedly up to the summerhouse and looked in expecting to see something extraordinary all he saw was the three children and loony very startled by his sudden appearance diana put her greengloved hand behind her back at once what is the meaning of this greatuncle asked irritably diana where did you get that glove tell me at once there was silence diana glanced desperately at the boys well said greatuncle in quite a nasty voice are you going to tell me or would you rather i called your parents diana i am quite sure you children know something that we ought to know that maybe even the police ought to know wed better tell him said roger to the others anyway i think its got a bit beyond us now weve found this glove all right greatuncle well tell you all we know and really its quite a lot but first youll have to believe that snubbys tale of the green hands gang was all a lot of nonsense said diana or else youll get muddled its just chance that a pair of green gloves has come into this will you please begin to tell me all you know said greatuncle impatiently and sat himself down on the wooden seat in the summerhouse roger began the tale diana and snubby added bits to it that he forgot it was a long tale and an extraordinary one especially the bit where snubby had come across the gleamingeyed creatures in the dell the night before greatuncle grunted hmm an alarming experience i hope it taught you a lesson tuttut what a story and now what about this glove it seems to me that this fellow tonnerre had better be handed over to the police for questioning snubby thought that was an awfully good idea aha hed get a bit of his own back on tonnerre then yes snubby certainly thought that was a very good idea give me the glove said greatuncle importantly and understand this the matter is out of your hands entirely now youve nothing to do with it and you must keep your noses out of it or youll get into trouble this is for grownups to solve not children but alas not even greatuncle or mr and mrs lynton or even the police seemed to be able to solve the mystery of rilloby fair and the thefts at the castle mr tonnerre said he didnt know anything at all about the green glove somebody must have put it into his caravan he had never never seen it before why should he have a green glove so small see his enormous hands it would fit his thumb and no more did you lend them to the thief to wear in order that he might leave no fingerprints asked the inspector patiently for the twentieth time but tonnerre shook his great head impatiently what have i to do with thieves who steal stuffed animals i who have live ones of my own i tell you i know nothing of this pest of a green glove nothing at all and so the police had to let him go because they certainly could not prove that he had lent the gloves to anyone or that he even knew the thief he went back to his van grumbling loudly and everyone kept well out of his way then the police called on vosta what did he know about the gloves were they his had he ever worn them could he climb walls would he please put them on he did so and certainly they seemed rather small for him although his hands were not very large for a man the two chimpanzees watched the policemen when they went to vostas tent to interview him they still seemed rather subdued especially burly and sat quietly with their arms round one anothers necks they were interested to see the gloves they got up and peered at them and patted them anything new interests them said vosta pushing the chimps away go and sit down you two look out for your handkerchief sir if youve got one in your pocket theyll be after it especially hurly whos a real pickpocket it was impossible to get anything helpful out of vosta at all he just said he didnt know he didnt know whose the gloves were he didnt know who the thief was he didnt know anything the inspector put the gloves into his pocket impatiently he felt that both tonnerre and vosta did know something but he was up against a blank wall he could ask no more questions go no further he went off with the detective vosta made a grimace after them he watched them go all the way across the field he didnt see hurly show burly something he didnt see burly hold out his paw for it he didnt see the chimps tuck their find under the blankets in their bunk hurly had picked the inspectors pocket as he turned to go he had got the pair of green gloves and now they were well hidden under the blankets the gloves excited burly he wanted to put them on he must wait till vosta wasnt there because vosta would take them away chapter sunday and monday the next day came it was sunday it seemed very peaceful and quiet after all the excitement of the day before barney turned up in the morning with miranda he saw roger at the window and waved roger opened the window and shouted to him the others are in the summerhouse im just coming barney went to the summerhouse and found diana and snubby there with loony loony gave barney and miranda a tremendous welcome i say said barney looking at diana in awe you going to a party or something youre all dressed up and snubby looks awfully clean no were not going to a party said diana surprised its sunday and weve just been to church thats all dont you ever go no but id like to said barney he wanted to do everything these friends of his did if he could hallo roger roger walked in also looking very clean and spruce hallo barney he said have you left the fair no tonnerre wont let me go till the fair leaves rilloby said barney but hes better now not nearly so fierce i really think the visit of the police gave him a fright i came to see if youd got any more news solved the mystery yet no i dont think it ever will be solved said roger its just a list of impossible things things that cant happen and yet did with a pair of green gloves complicating everything still more listen said barney i shant be able to see you tomorrow vostas having the day off goodness knows why and im to see to the chimps young un is taking the hoopla stall you mustnt come to the fair again of course youd be like a red rag to a bull if tonnerre caught sight of you well cant you spend the day with us today said diana at once the fair doesnt open on sundays wouldnt you like to be with us well yes of course i would said barney his blue eyes shining i love your home but would your mother mind and what about your father hes home today isnt he they wont mind if we keep out of their way said diana they do like us to be quiet on sundays of course but we can always talk and read you lend me another book of shakespeares said barney ill be quiet enough then the others laughed it always amused them to see barney labouring through a play of shakespeare determined to understand it so that if ever he did come across his unknown father who had once acted in so many of shakespeares plays he would at least have something in common with him ill lend you hamlet said roger youll like that theres a super ghost in it mrs lynton was very willing for barney to spend the day greatuncle robert was not too pleased to see yet another child complete with monkey added to the riotous trio how im ever going to get my memoirs written i dont know he complained to mrs lynton children and dogs and cats and monkeys everywhere i go you go and have your little nap in the study and ill send the children outofdoors this glorious day said mrs lynton i said my memoirs not a nap said greatuncle with dignity and retired to the study he carefully put out paper fountain pen and notes on the table headed a page chapter five and then promptly settled down in an armchair and went to sleep now dont you dare to disturb your greatuncle mrs lynton warned the children dont let miranda leap in at the window on to him and dont let loony bark and see that sardine doesnt get into the study and jump up on greatuncles knee right mother said roger and ill tell that loudvoice thrush to pipe down and shoo all the bees out of the garden and as for that earwig i saw stamping about this morning ill now now roger said his mother smiling dont be ridiculous go along to the summerhouse and dont let me hear a sound from any of you sunday was very peaceful barney enjoyed it more than anyone it was heaven to him to be in a family in a home to belong even for only one day to a little company of people who liked him and accepted him as one of themselves they cant understand what its like not to have any people of your own not to have a home you can always go to no not even snubby understands although hes got no parents he belongs here i dont belong anywhere thought barney soberly perhaps if i ever find my father i shall have a home with him and belong there the children talked a lot about the green gloves tonnerre vosta the castle and the rest they went over and over everything again and again what a mystery the mystery of rilloby fair said diana it would be exciting if we could solve it barney went back to the fair reluctantly that evening miranda had enjoyed her day as much as he had goodbye he said ill see you on tuesday if i can get over here the fair leaves on wednesday you know and i certainly shant go with it i dont want to work for tonnerre what will you do then barney asked diana oh ill get another job somewhere said barney but ill keep in touch with you ill send you a card telling you where i am always and perhaps i shall be able to get a job somewhere near here when the summer holidays come he went off the children all went to bed feeling tired though i cant imagine why said snubby we simply havent done a thing today not even taken poor old loony for a walk woof said loony hopefully but there was no walk that night the next day greatuncle announced that he was going to marloes castle to arrange and pack up the valuable papers there in order that they might be locked away in safety i shall go about three oclock he said and seeing that diana here has such an interest in old documents id be glad to take her with me she would be a help im sure diana was horrified what spend ages listening to dry information about centuriesold papers that she couldnt even read all alone with greatuncle she gazed round at roger and snubby in despair they looked back poor old diana how awful then a thought came into rogers mind it would be rather interesting to go to that room again and have a good look round he might find a clue the police had missed anyway it would be fun to see if there was any single place where the thief could have come hi its just conceivable there might be a secret passage somewhere thought roger i never thought of that he pictured himself tapping round the wall of the room he could have a look at the fireplace too and see if it really was big enough for say tonnerre greatuncle i should like to come too he said politely so should i said snubby id awfully like to have a look round the grounds greatuncle do you think lord marloes would mind dear me so you would all like to keep me company this afternoon beamed greatuncle pleased at finding himself so popular all of a sudden very well i will certainly take you i see no harm in your looking round the grounds snubby if you behave yourself he said nothing about loony and neither did snubby but when snubby heard that greatuncle was going in a car he knew there was no hope for loony id like a walk greatuncle he said so if its all right with you ill walk across the fields and join you at the gates certainly my boy certainly said greatuncle anything you like well have a grand time together we shall have to be back in good time for supper said snubby suddenly therell be meringues how do you know asked diana cook told me she wouldnt eat her sunday hat yesterday though i begged and begged her to so were eating meringues tonight instead mrs lynton looked astonished whats all this about cooks sunday hat oh snubby you havent been upsetting cook finding fault with her sunday hat surely aunt susan shes got a marvellous sunday hat said snubby indignantly its got three roses a wreath of violets and five carnations in it its wizard i can quite well understand why she doesnt want to eat it there are times when i think you are not quite sane snubby said mrs lynton i dont know what your masters at school think of you oh they think the same as you snubby assured her cheerfully i dont mind its all the same to me that afternoon the car came for greatuncle and he and diana and roger got into it snubby had already gone off with loony he was to meet them at the gates now for a nice happy afternoon said greatuncle pleased nothing i like better than browsing among old rare papers breathing in the air of past centuries what a peaceful place that old room is it wasnt going to be it was going to be just about the most exciting place in rilloby that afternoon but greatuncle didnt know that chapter things begin to happen snubby met them at the castle gates with loony greatuncle eyed the spaniel with annoyance i didnt say you could bring that dog you didnt say i wasnt to pointed out snubby in a reasonable voice stop scratching loony you do seem to have a bad effect on loony greatuncle it seems as if hes got to scratch whenever he sees you you cant bring him into the castle said greatuncle determined not to enter into a conversation about scratching again youll have to stay out here in the grounds snubby didnt mind he meant to explore the grounds thoroughly and see if he could find any clues he also meant to go and find the dell again where the stuffed animals had been and enjoy remembering that terrifying episode he wondered if the sacks were still up on the wall and what about the ropeladder was it still under the bush i expect its there still and the sacks too he thought the police said nothing about those gosh theyre not very bright id have spotted those at once if id been one of the police on the job greatuncle presented his pass he and diana and roger were taken into the castle whilst snubby wandered off into the grounds with an excited loony who foresaw all kinds of rabbit adventures for himself that afternoon roger was impatient to be inside the room with the doublelocked door the butler unlocked one door then the second one and finally the third one with its two keys they then were in the old room with its shelves of yellowed papers roger and diana glanced round with interest half the stuffed animals were gone of course the police had not brought them back they were probably still somewhere in the police station staring at the policemen with their lifeless glassy eyes all the big animals are left said roger i suppose the thief couldnt manage them the squirrels are gone and the foxcubs but not the foxes and the polecat and the albino badger he wasnt very big either diana well just go carefully through all the papers before we pack them said greatuncle longing to explain pages upon pages to poor diana now this one diana cast a look of misery at roger and went to listen roger began to look round he examined the windows nobody could possibly undo those fastenings from outside and only the very smallest thinnest person could squeeze through the bars he went to the doublelocked door and examined that no thief could come in that way without keys and if he had the keys the burglar alarm would ring as soon as the door was opened no that way was impossible too he went to the fireplace it was an oldfashioned open grate as the fire was never used there were no fireirons at all but only an old firescreen made of wroughtiron roger bent down and tried to look up the chimney it looked decidedly narrow i might be able to squeeze up thought roger but i doubt it and it would be frightfully uncomfortable i dare say it widens out a bit above though he looked at the fire place itself it was full of bits and pieces that had fallen down the chimney of course they might have been dislodged by somebody getting down but on the other hand bits and pieces always do fall down chimneys thought roger feeling rather like a detective he went to the window and looked out he saw something that filled him with extreme amazement he stared intently then a shout came to his ears i say look at this cried roger suddenly making diana and greatuncle jump violently whats going on down there he might well ask snubby down in the grounds was also feeling extremely astonished he had been wandering round with loony and had come to the little dell where he had seen the stuffed animals when he heard a sound nearby he had turned and looking down at him from out of the bushes was a hairy grinning face with shining eyes snubby got a frightful shock he thought it was one of the stuffed animals come to life gosh what is it he said and took a step backwards loony gave a delighted bark and rushed into the bushes where the hairy face was snubby was amazed loony should have barked or growled instead of that he had yelped in delight and gone off with the face then snubby heard yells and recognised barneys voice come here you pest you do your hear where have you gone its barney whats he doing here said snubby full of surprise loony where have you gone hey barney where are you barneys voice came back surprised that you snubby what are you doing here i say have you seen burly hes gone completely mad so look out burly said snubby more amazed than ever whats he here for gosh yes ive seen him at least i saw his grinning face hes gone now and taken loony with him he made his way towards barneys voice barney was on the road side of the wall he called again im going to see if our ropeladder is still under the bush and the sacks on the wall if the police havent found them im coming over i simply must find burly hes gone crackers he found the ropeladder under the bush and soon had it up on the wall he climbed it quickly and sat on the sacks he looked all round to see if he could spot burly what happened to make burly so mad asked snubby why did he come all the way here dont ask me said barney i was in vostas caravan with both chimps when bless me if hurly didnt pull out a pair of green gloves from under the blankets of his bunk what the ones we saw said snubby i dont know the police had those but i wouldnt put it past hurly to sneak them out of the inspectors pocket said barney i bet thats what he did anyway burly snatched them and put them on and they fitted him marvellously like a glove in fact he kept stroking them and muttering to himself and then he rapped at the cupboard where his toy animals are kept he stopped for breath still keeping a lookout for burly from the top of the wall well i hadnt the key to his toy cupboard vostas got that said barney so he couldnt have his little toy animals to play with then he just seemed to go mad he banged himself with his arms and yowled like anything and then he was out of the window like a streak haring over the fair field gosh said snubby enthralled with this story go on well i followed him of course said barney and he came straight here i couldnt catch him up he was up and over the wall as easy as anything he didnt need a ladder well i suppose hes somewhere in the grounds whats made him come here before snubby could answer a deep voice spoke from the other side of the wall im afraid i shall have to hold you for questioning concerning this here ladder said the voice barney almost fell off the wall golly its a bobby he said where were you ive been hiding behind that tree ever since we found this here ladder hidden and the sacks atop of the wall said the policeman we reckoned whoever put them there might use them again if we didnt let on wed found them and seemingly we were right you come down and let me take you to the police station for questioning no said barney and scrambled down the other side as fast as he could i must find burly he said to the petrified snubby and miranda too she scampered after him over the wall and left me standing on the other side come on take no notice of the bobby we can easily shake him off he dragged poor snubby into the bushes whilst the annoyed policeman began to climb slowly and painfully up the ropeladder take me to the place you saw burly in just now said barney he may still be near there snubby took him to the dell and sure enough there was burly with miranda and loony burly was behaving in a peculiar fashion his head held in his hands he was rocking to and fro making a little whimpering noise miranda was stroking him and loony was licking him it was plain that the chimpanzee was very unhappy he looked extremely queer in his red shorts redstriped jersey and green gloves what was the matter with him why was he behaving like that burly suddenly sprang up he gave a loud howl and bounded away loony ran after him and miranda ran too whimpering both the animals knew that something was wrong with burly burly ran through the trees to the castle walls barney gave a shout hey burly come back come to old barney that was the shout that roger had heard up in the old room on the second floor he looked out and saw burly tearing over to the castle with his green gloves on and behind him came loony and miranda followed at some distance by barney and snubby and behind them good gracious a policeman no wonder roger could hardly believe his eyes but what was to come was even more unbelievable burly came to the walls of the castle he leapt to a windowsill he leapt to a gutterpipe and shinned up it rapidly and easily he leapt to another windowsill and up another pipe then he climbed confidently up the thick ivy nearby right to the roof look at that said snubby awed what a climb it was burly i saw the other night im sure it was burly was now on the roof he ran to the one and only chimney and peered down it he leapt into it and disappeared down in the room below three startled people stared at one another greatuncle roger and diana had tried in vain to see what was happening outside they had lost sight of burly when he had begun to climb up the walls and then had caught a quick glimpse of him again as he leapt on to their windowsill and off what in the world was he doing they heard a noise in the chimney roger ran to it two hairy legs appeared and then burly swung himself down into the fireplace blinking he had managed it easily he stood there looking at three amazed people diana spoke to him burly what are you doing ah that was the kind girl who had given him a toy dog burly was no longer frightened to see people staring at him he came out into the room looking very strange in his queer dress greatuncle shrank back he had never seen burly before to him the chimpanzee looked fierce and savage he was horrified to see diana go up and take the greengloved paw suppose the creature bit her but burly didnt bite he stroked dianas arm and then he looked round the room he sniffed the air he ran to the shelves where the yellowed parchments were the three watched him amazed what was he doing now burly smelt each pile he stopped at one and took out a paper he sniffed at another lot and took another piece of parchment greatuncle watched him gaping roger touched dianas arm the solution of the mystery he said i see it all now how could we have been so blind chapter burly is very clever all three watched the chimpanzee as he sniffed through the papers and took one here and one there he seemed quite certain which to take there was no hesitation at all how does he know which to choose said greatuncle robert puzzled hes taking one or two of the most valuable i can see that but how does he know he sniffs before he pulls a paper out of its pile said diana look each time he sniffs first well of course i know how he knows which papers to take exclaimed roger suddenly diana do you remember that hairy man how we watched him sliding his magnifyingglass up and down some of the papers yes i remember said diana well he must have had something on the base of the magnifyingglass that was rubbed off on the papers said roger excitedly and the stuff would leave a smell and when the chimp was sent to take certain papers he knew which to take because of the smell see him sniffing at them all now remarkable most remarkable said greatuncle who looked rather dazed i suppose hes trained to do that chimpanzees must be extremely clever oh they are said roger watching burly take yet another paper but thats an old circus trick greatuncle to smear papers with something that smells so that an animal will instinctively choose those who trained you burly burly looked up at his name and gabbled something his greengloved hands worked quickly through the parchments no fingerprints you see not even a chimps prints left behind said roger i wonder what made him come along here this afternoon to do the job he should really have done the other night perhaps he saw the gloves and they reminded him suggested diana oh whats he going to do now burly had caught sight of the stuffed animals he dropped all his papers on the floor and whimpered he ran across to the few animals left and lifted up a fox greatuncle quietly gathered up the papers opened a drawer in the nearby table and put them inside he meant to have them examined to see exactly what gave them the smell that burly recognised so easily the chimpanzee sat down on the floor and nursed the stuffed fox diana nudged roger im sure i know what happened the other night she whispered he came for the papers with no other idea in his head but to do the sort of job hes often done before and he must suddenly have seen the stuffed animals staring at him in the moonlight you know how mad he is on toy animals he must have thought these stuffed ones were extra big toy ones possibly put there for him yes and he took them into the grounds one after the other just the little ones that he could manage easily went on roger poor burly he stood them all in the dell and for some reason left them there but he didnt take any of the papers he was so wrapped up in the animals and i expect thats why the chimps were so miserable the next day when we saw them said diana somebody had scolded burly hard and he was upset so hurly was upset too do you remember how they sat with their arms round one another looking thoroughly miserable who had scolded them wondered roger vosta do you suppose maybe and probably tonnerre too because vosta said he had you remember said diana somehow or other tonnerres in this mystery roger im sure he is burly put down the fox and picked up a stuffed dog very motheaten indeed he nursed that too then he got up and looked at the fireplace evidently considering whether or not he could get up the chimney with such a large animal there suddenly came the sound of doors being unlocked voices were heard burly looked alarmed he ran to diana and crouched down beside her chattering she patted him gently on the head dont be afraid burly i wont let anyone hurt you the door of the room was unlocked with its two separate keys it opened in poured barney snubby miranda loony the policeman the custodian and the butler is burly here he went down the chimney cried snubby yes there he is cried barney and ran to the chimpanzee who took his hand trustingly he loved barney miranda leapt on to the chimpanzees shoulder chattering he looked happier at once the policeman looked absolutely bewildered what with cheeky boys a spaniel and a monkey and now a chimpanzee he didnt really know what to do he looked with relief at greatuncle glad to see a responsiblelooking grownup perhaps you can help me sir he said whats all this here about constable we have found the one who stole the stuffed animals said greatuncle solemnly before our very eyes this afternoon he stole more valuable papers then i shall arrest him said the constable at once importantly which of them is it sir its the chimpanzee said greatuncle be careful how you arrest him snubby gave a chortle at the sight of the policemans alarmed face loony sat down and began to scratch himself violently burly put down the stuffed dog he was hugging and took miranda into his arms instead nursing her and crooning hmmm i find that beast rather pathetic said greatuncle unexpectedly cant blame him for anything hes done constable whoever trained him is responsible thats the fellow you want the trainer heavy footsteps came down the little passage to the door and in came the inspector the policeman had telephoned for him as soon as he had got into the castle and he had jumped into his car and come along at once well he said looking round at the big company in amazement youre a mixed lot i must say my word the green gloves look whos wearing them well well well he stared at burly as if he couldnt believe his eyes the chimpanzee stared back he remembered the inspector this was the man out of whose pocket hurly had taken the green gloves he took them off suddenly and flung them on the floor the constable began to talk to the inspector trying to tell him what had happened but barney interrupted i can tell you all that happened sir he said i can see it all now i understand why the sight of the gloves sent burly here again i understand why speak when youre spoken to said the inspector he turned to greatuncle mr lynton sir perhaps you would say a few words first im all at sea somehow or other first by this person and then by that he was told every single thing he listened astonished and almost disbelieving he was shown the fireplace where burly had come down he was shown the pile of papers that burly had so carefully chosen after sniffing at them he sniffed at them too i can smell something myself he said sniffing again yes a very clever trick the chimp had no other way of telling which were the valuable papers and which werent except by smell theres somebody remarkably clever behind all this who is it everyone took a turn at sniffing at the papers certainly they had a fault elusive smell quite distinguishable so thats how the other thefts were planned said the inspector thoughtfully someone examined the collections first and smeared the papers he wanted with something to make them smell he must also have examined how the chimp could get in and out a skylight sometimes a chimney another time a small window a third time or maybe a ventilator somewhere impossible for a grown man to get through but the chimp could always manage to climb and wriggle through a tiny entrance hes small and supple and a born acrobat a most remarkable and successful plan put in greatuncle if we could only lay our hands on the hairy man who was here the other day smearing the papers with something on the base of his large magnifyingglass youd have the ringleader inspector yes said barney but there must be two or three gobetweens inspector vosta must be one hed have to take burly to whatever place had been chosen and point out the way to go up the walls and there must be another gobetween too the one who warns vosta what to do the one who received the note we found a bit of the other day that said marloes castle midnight who received that note quite a lot of loose ends to tie up said the inspector well well see if we can tie up a few today well take this chimp back to the fair and find out where vosta is he may be back by this time the custodian and the butler neither of whom had said a single word so completely amazed and bewildered were they let the little company out of the castle the inspector took the pile of papers with him that burly had so carefully chosen burly went down the stairs holding barneys hand chattering away to him two cars stood outside the inspectors and the one that greatuncle had hired room for everyone said the inspector genially hop in well all go to the fair take the chimp the monkey and the dog into the other car if you dont mind now are we all set to the fair then chapter the mystery is solved vosta was back in his tent puzzled to find burly gone when they all arrived in the field he looked frightened when he saw the inspector burly ran to him and flung his arms round him what have you been up to said vosta to burly and where have you been he said to barney i told you not to leave the chimps illia juan vosta i have some questions to ask you and i must warn you that anything you say may be taken down and used hi evidence against you said the inspector sternly the constable took out a black notebook and licked his pencil preparing to write vosta looked extremely alarmed i havent done anything he stammered you have trained this chimpanzee to steal and to break into various buildings went on the inspector in a cold calm voice we know that various papers are smeared with a substance that the chimpanzee can smell and these are the papers he takes we know further that i didnt have anything to do with that cried out vosta turning very pale ive always said it was a mugs game using the chimp ive never had anything to do with it except that you lent your chimpanzee which you yourself had trained to steal and you took him each time to the place where the theft was to be committed said the inspector in a voice that sent a shiver down snubbys back didnt you vosta theyre not my chimps muttered vosta and i never trained them to steal they were trained before i had them whose were they before you had them rapped out the inspector vosta looked terrified they were tonnerres he said in a low voice he trained them he trained hurly to pick pockets and he trained burly to do all kinds of other stealing tricks burlys clever you can teach him anything why did you take on the chimpanzees from tonnerre asked the inspector i was an acrobat said vosta still in a low voice and i hurt my back so tonnerre offered me the chimps if id keep on with him in the fair and do one or two things he wanted i see and one of the things he wanted was that you should take burly to whatever building he told you and see that he got in somehow and sniffed out the papers he had marked said the inspector he never marked them said vosta he didnt know a thing about old papers i used to take them from burly and give them to tonnerre and he passed them on to someone else i dont know who but it was the fellow who did the marking of the papers this fellow used to tell tonnerre where to take the fair we never knew where we were going quite i imagine he chose whatever place he had marked down for his next theft said the inspector and now just tell me the name of the man at the top of all this i tell you i dont know said vosta obstinately why dont you ask tonnerre why pick on me im only the catspaw i am its the hairy man said snubby butting in we do know that do you know a very hairy man vosta im not answering any questions from you snarled vosta if you kids hadnt come here snooping and prying thats enough vosta said the inspector constable stay here with him im going across to this fellow tonnerre he too is only a catspaw it seems but a bigger one than vosta still maybe hell lead us to the real villain barney led him to tonnerres caravan the fair folk who had stood around in silence watching vosta being interviewed moved back old ma called out tonnerres got a visitor hes in a black mood youve got to watch out mister the inspector did not deign to reply he rapped imperiously on the door of tonnerres caravan get out yelled tonnerres voice didnt i say i wasnt to be disturbed open up came the inspectors stern voice the door was flung open and tonnerre stood there frowning blackly he shut the door behind him and came down the steps say what youve got to say and go he growled whos your visitor tonnerre asked the inspector mildly lets have a look at him hes a gentleman see im not going to have him dragged into any funny business said tonnerre angrily hes a friend of mine with nothing to do with you at all anyway whats brought you here again wasting my time and interfering lets have a look at your visitor tonnerre repeated the inspector what are you hiding him away for snubby was so full of excitement and anticipation that he could hardly contain himself his enemy had met his match the inspector wouldnt take no for an answer who was the visitor i bet its the hairy man i bet it is said snubby to himself hes come to get the papers and hes wild with tonnerre because the chimp didnt get them tonnerre made no move to open the door but it suddenly opened behind him and somebody came out on to the top step what is all this disturbance said a cultured voice tonnerre have i come at an awkward moment i will go he stepped down but the inspector placed himself in front of him your name sir he asked the four children gazed at the man in disappointment he was not the hairy man he was quite cleanshaven he had smooth black hair tinged with grey no moustache no shaggy eyebrows no beard my name is thomas colville said the man my business with mr tonnerre is private he and i are old friends i am sorry to see he seems to be in trouble my business with him can wait you didnt happen to come and see him about some papers you wanted him to get for you did you said the inspector stolidly i dont know what you are talking about my good fellow said the man and pushed by the inspector impatiently snubby stared at him no he certainly wasnt a bit like the hairy man though he was about the same size and build snubby walked a few steps beside the man staring at him much to his annoyance then snubby suddenly gave such a yell that loony barked wildly and ran to him i say he is the man we saw looking at the papers the hairy man he is i couldnt help noticing the tremendous tufts of hair he had growing out of his ears and look hes got them just the same its him things happened all at once then the man began to run the constable watching from vostas tent saw him and ran to cut him off young un ran out and tripped him up neatly tonnerre went mad and tried to hit the inspector loony bit him and then everyone closed in yelling and shrieking with excitement so that the poor inspector didnt know what was going on for a few minutes you take your sister and brother home he said urgently to roger he thought that snubby was rogers brother go on we may be going to have a rough time here telephone the police station and tell them to send up men quickly roger fled with diana snubby and loony he was sorry to go at such a time but he knew he had to take diana into safety in case things began to get too rough outside the gate stood two cars one was the police car with greatuncle robert waiting patiently inside rather alarmed at the excitement going on in the fair field the other was the taxi he had hired complete with its driver oh good said roger stopping id forgotten the cars and greatuncle i say greatuncle things are boiling up terrifically everythings really smashing and weve got to telephone the police station for more men can we bag the taxi and drive there bless us all said poor greatuncle in alarm and clambered out of the police car as quickly as he could he got into the taxi and in a quavering voice told the man to drive to the police station greatuncle wouldnt let the car stop at the police station more than half a minute just time enough for roger to give his message i must get home the old man kept saying this isnt good for my heart dear dear little did i think id get mixed up with a lot of criminals and madmen and chimpanzees when i came to stay with your mother i must go i must leave i cant stay a night longer but greatuncle its been absolutely wizard protested snubby i mean if you want a firstclass mystery well you couldnt have a better one than the one to do with rilloby fair but greatuncle didnt want any mysteries or adventures i just want to pack my things and go he said that man tonnerres a dreadful fellow i was glad i was safely in the car when i saw him come down the caravan steps as black as as thunder said diana he looked as if he might be the chief of some horrible gang shuddered poor greatuncle the green hands gang said snubby with a chortle chapter alls well greatuncle was as good as his word as soon as he got in he found mrs lynton announced his intention of leaving that very night and went up to pack his bag mrs lynton was amazed she looked at the excited children whats the matter with him what have you been doing nothing said roger indignantly oh mother do listen weve got the most exciting news well heres your father tell him too said his mother and do come in to your supper youre so dreadfully late and cooks made you some meringues for your pudding gosh do you know weve never had any tea said snubby in an injured voice would you believe it no wonder i feel jolly hungry so many things have been happening that its difficult to know where to begin our story said roger to his mother go and wash before you begin said his mother suddenly noticing how dirty they all looked your news can wait it cant be as important and exciting as all that but it was of course and when the three children were at last sitting down to eat an enormous meal the two grownups gaped in astonishment when told the extraordinary tale you should have seen the chimp going top speed up the wall said snubby waving his fork you should have seen him coming down the chimney said roger getting out of the way of snubbys fork you should have seen him sniffing at the papers to see which to take said diana it was a very disturbed evening greatuncle condescended to have some dinner when he had packed his bag and he too added his quota to the tale the inspector arrived to make his report lord marloes telephoned to greatuncle to ask for details of the latest excitement at the castle and asked him to be his guest in town greatuncle then telephoned for a taxi im really very sorry youve had such an upsetting stay said mrs lynton certainly you seemed to be as much in the thick of things as anyone else uncle robert say goodbye children the three stood at the gate and shouted good bye the last that greatuncle saw of them was snubby holding loony in his arms making him wave his paw violently that dog said greatuncle sinking back into the taxi well thank goodness he cant sit down and scratch himself in front of me any more and then barney arrived he whistled outside the window standing halfhidden in the darkness theres barney said snubby almost falling from his chair in his anxiety to get to the window ask him in said mrs lynton we might as well hear his tale too i never did know such a set of children for getting into all kinds of trouble come in barney yelled snubby and loony raced out of the room into the garden barking madly barney came in looking rather pale and worried miranda was on his shoulder as usual and she chattered merrily when she saw the friends she knew she leapt off barneys shoulder on to snubbys dont let her come too near me said mrs lynton in alarm i do like her but i really cant bear monkeys ill stick her under my shirt said snubby shes cold miranda disappeared from view for a while loony went and sniffed at snubbys shirt he felt a little jealous to think miranda was so close to his beloved master what happened when we left barney asked roger did everything blow up pretty well said barney tonnerres been taken off and so has vosta i hear theyre not coming back so i dont know if that means theyve gone to prison they havent taken hurly and burly to prison have they asked snubby in alarm of course not said barney billy tells taking care of them i offered to but the showfolk say they dont want me there any more they say i put the police on to tonnerre and vosta but you didnt cried all three children indignantly you didnt well they think i did said barney so ive been chucked out and miranda too the fairs breaking up tomorrow and everyones going here there and everywhere but nobody wants me to go with them what was even young un horrid and old ma asked snubby amazed young uns all right but hes got to do what the others do said barney showfolk dont like the police and if they think somebodys split on them they chuck them out its not fair said diana almost in tears it wasnt your fault that tonnerre and vosta and the hairy man got caught so they should be too what happened to the hairy man asked roger was he taken off too yes hes the big man behind all these planned thefts said barney he paid tonnerre to arrange with vosta for the chimp to steal the papers he always went beforehand and marked the papers he wanted well im glad tonnerres gone he was a blackhearted fellow thats what old ma said put in roger well barney what are you going to do where are you going to sleep tonight its a fine night said barney im sleeping in a barn not far off the farmer said i could oh no youre not said mrs lynton suddenly entering into the conversation barney looked at her in surprise the children stared too they had forgotten that she was in the room sewing greatuncles left tonight said mrs lynton so weve got a guestroom again if diana likes to give me a hand ill have the bed made up for barney he can stay with you till you have to go back to school and by that time perhaps we shall have found a job for him barney was quite overcome its very good of you he began but he couldnt finish because snubby swept by him and almost knocked him over he flung his arms round his aunts neck and hugged her like a bear aunt susan i was willing you to say that i was i was i kept saying to myself say barney can stay and you said it oh dont be so ridiculous dear said his aunt and stop strangling me it was nothing to do with your willing me i made up my mind to ask barney as soon as i saw your greatuncle off in the car barneys face shone why ill be here about two weeks he said two whole weeks but what about miranda you dont like monkeys mrs lynton oh i can put up with miranda so long as she doesnt leap on to my shoulder said mrs lynton bravely i dare say i shall get used to monkeys if she comes to stay after all ive got used to loony and i really didnt think id ever do that woof said loony hearing his name mentioned he hadnt stopped watching the lump inside snubbys shirt which meant that miranda was still curled up there it will be lovely said diana thinking of the two weeks ahead therell be us four and miranda and loony and sardine said roger seeing the big black cat coming softly in eyeing loony in a way that meant she was just about to spring on him yes well have a super time and a peaceful time i hope said mrs lynton getting up to go and make barneys bed its all been much too exciting for me oh mother i loved the rilloby fair mystery said roger every minute of it id like it all over again no another one would be better still said snubby tickling miranda under his shirt id like another mystery as wizard as this and well have one too wont we loony woof said loony and jumped up to sniff at miranda she put out a tiny paw and pulled his ear well as long as you four and miranda and loony are together youre sure to get into plenty of trouble said mrs lynton but spare me a mystery for a little while will you i havent got over this one yet right promised snubby generously well give you a bit of a rest aunt susan and then whoosh well be heading into another mystery the biggest one that ever was the end
