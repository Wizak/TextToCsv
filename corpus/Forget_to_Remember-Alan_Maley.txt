leave a message after the beep jan tried to make her message as calm as possible hello kate this is jan im sorry but youll have to come down to mothers weve got to talk i cant go on like this its becoming impossible i know youre always busy but youll have to come i cant manage with mother any more please call me back at mothers house as soon as you can her mothers voice called weakly from the next room who was that dear noone important dont worry mum well if i dont worry whos going to worry someone has to do the worrying its ok mum really oh good did you have a nice time then sorry didnt you go on holiday somewhere not me mum that was mrs jenkins from next door oh who are you then mum im jan im your daughter surely you can recognise me oh yes thats right the trouble is theres too much to remember i cant remember everything you know i know that mum i know jan sighed it was late on sunday afternoon the room was already getting dark on the table there was a bowl of rotting fruit the bananas were black the oranges brown on the shelf above stood her parents wedding photograph in a silver frame it was yellow with age next to it stood a framed photo of her sister kate getting her degree from oxford university then there were pictures of jans daughter cindy and kates children jeremy and caroline when they were all on holiday together in spain in happier times there was a picture of kate and her husband and children by the river in the garden of their beautiful house in marlow there were pictures of herself and kate as children she picked up a picture of her father he was carrying kate on his shoulders he looked so strong so confident so full of life there were no photos of jan with her father that was typical he had always loved kate more she had been his favourite in everything jan remembered how hed always treated her so badly and kate so well when jan left school shed had to go out to work not go to university like kate but kate had had the best of everything jan had always felt hurt by it why were families like this she wondered anyway now her father had been dead for nearly four years as she put the photograph back jan noticed the thick dust on the shelf she sighed again outside the window a cold wind was blowing the petals off the spring flowers it began to rain is my father still alive came the tired voice from the armchair no mum he died twenty years ago oh did he what about my mum did she die too yes mum she died ten years ago dont you remember are you sure i thought she came round for a cup of tea last week no mum that was old mrs jenkins who lives next door oh was it her voice died away as she slowly thought about this piece of confusing information she was silent for a while her hands lay still in her lap except when she occasionally moved the newspaper she was holding her eyelids were heavy her eyes almost closed she began to breathe more loudly a low bubbling sound coming from her throat she was dribbling from the corner of her mouth and down her chin like a baby jan tiptoed to the kitchen and put the kettle on for a cup of tea when she returned her mother was still fast asleep her mouth loosely open her head had fallen to one side suddenly she woke up her eyes were wide open but they were empty they seemed to see nothing then they slowly focused again oh hello she said brightly nice of you to visit me have you been here long ive been here since yesterday mum dont you remember oh have you yes perhaps you have but you cant expect me to remember every little thing you know she picked up the newspaper from her lap and looked at it but without reading it anyway wheres my tea i cant do without my tea ive already put the kettle on mum it wont be long i should hope not i cant wait around forever can i ive got work to do i know mum i know jan went to the kitchen and prepared a tray with cups milk and sugar then she made the tea strong and dark the way her mother liked it suddenly her eyes filled with tears she swore softly under her breath why do you have to hang on to life like this its over for you why cant you just die like other people god forgive me but why dont you just let go and die i cant bear to see you suffering like this anymore she dried her eyes took a deep breath and carried the tray in to her mother it was past eleven oclock that night when the phone rang jan had already fed and bathed her mother and put her to bed she felt tired so tired she picked up the phone hello hello jan its kate i got your message whats the problem jan took the phone into the kitchen and closed the door the problem what do you think the problem is its our mother of course why has something happened something is happening all the time her mind is falling to pieces bits of her memory are falling into a big black hole but surely its not that bad is it i mean she seemed pretty lively to me when i came down to see her last month yes it is that bad in fact it gets worse every week every day even ive had to see the doctor about her again and he says she shouldnt be on her own she cant look after herself he says she needs twentyfourhour care its all happening so fast ah its all very well for you you come down here once a month if that spend a few hours with her and then rush off home again you should try living round the corner from her like me surely youre not suggesting that i should drop everything in marlow and move down to lewisham are you oh no i wouldnt dream of it your life has to run like clockwork doesnt it nothing must upset your routines your law cases and your children and your holidays and your husband and your maid it all has to be organised doesnt it you have so much to do dont be so unfair jan i made my choices and you made yours its not my fault that youre stuck in lewisham you should have moved away when you had the chance when dad died maybe it would have saved your marriage too leave my marriage out of this mind your own business my husband was a stupid idiot and he would have been a stupid idiot wherever we were ok ok calm down i didnt mean to hurt you all right sorry im tired ive been staying here with mother all weekend and im going to stay tonight as well well im tired too we went mountain climbing in wales over the weekend and the drive back here was terrible you know what the motorway traffic is like on a sunday it took us absolutely hours to get back home look kate weve got to meet i cant talk to you properly over the phone can you get down here any day this week not during the week jan you know that i have this big case coming up and i may have to fly over to paris to see some clients what about next weekend well i was planning to go up to cambridge to see jeremy for the weekend but i suppose i could just go for the day on saturday good can you come straight here from cambridge on saturday evening and stay the night sorry jan i dont think so it would be too much of a rush and weve got a dinner party with some of hughs business partners on sunday evening its important i have to be there so ill come down in time for lunch at your place on sunday and drive back here in the evening what about hugh will he come with you erm there was a long pause i doubt it you know how he loves his golf all right then lets leave it like that youll come down next sunday but please come prepared to listen to me we cant just go on arguing all the time quite all right big sister sleep well you too goodnight jan went back into the lounge she needed a drink she searched through her mothers drinks cupboard and found a halfempty bottle of napoleon brandy in fact it looked as if it had been there since the time of napoleon she poured herself a glass drank it down and went up to bed chapter two a perfect couple kate put down the telephone in her study and went back to join her husband hugh in the lounge like the rest of their house it had expensive modern furniture with glass and shiny metal tables leather sofas and armchairs and a thick creamcoloured carpet hugh was sitting in one of the armchairs his feet up on a low table reading the business and finance pages of the sunday newspaper and sipping a large glass of whisky as she looked down at him kate noticed not for the first time that he was losing his hair and getting rather too fat around the middle sometimes she wondered why she had married him he put the newspaper down so what was that all about he asked it was jan i know it was jan you told me shed left a message what did she want this time its about mother oh no not again surely does she really expect you to call on a sunday evening just to talk about your mother his voice sounded unpleasant impatient she says mother is getting worse she says that she forgets things and cant look after herself anymore well shes old isnt she thats the way old people are they do forget things and get mixed up what does she expect whats it got to do with us anyway well she is my mother you know and jan says that she cant manage any longer she wants me to go down there and discuss it i dont see what there is to discuss said hugh unhelpfully thank goodness my parents are both dead at least they cant cause any trouble like that anyway i told her id go down to lewisham next sunday you told her what have you forgotten we have a dinner on sunday evening i told you it was important im trying to get clerides and mazumdar to sign up to my new investment fund god cant you remember anything i didnt forget im not like my mother not yet anyway ill go down there for lunch and ill be back late afternoon in plenty of time for your dinner dont be so badtempered its not easy for me you know its not easy for any of us said hugh and picked up his newspaper again kate went back to her study switched on the desk light and began to read the papers for her court case the next morning it was a complicated case involving a disagreement between members of a family about who should own the parents house and business property she sighed she felt tired exhausted by the mountain climbing in wales and the long drive back to marlow and now she couldnt stop herself thinking about jan and the problems with her mother why wasnt life simpler she thought she had a successful career as a lawyer hugh was doing well again in his investment business the children were grown up well almost she and hugh had plenty of money it should have been the time for them to relax and enjoy it but instead she felt discontented and unhappy why something was wrong but she couldnt say what it was just a feeling that things should be different it was past two oclock in the morning by the time they both went upstairs as they were getting ready for bed kate looked at hugh again and wondered if he was the same person she had married all those years ago he got into bed and turned off the light good night darling he said and turned his back to her he was soon fast asleep kate lay awake for a long time thinking how easy it was to say darling and wondering if it meant anything anymore chapter three so what are we going to do sunday lunch at jans was over on the kitchen table were the bones of a small roast chicken potatoes in cold fat some broccoli in a bowl half a chocolate pudding from the supermarket and a plastic pot of cream there was also an empty bottle of cheap red wine and two glasses coffee that would be nice kate played with her wine glass then drank the last few drops im afraid i can only offer instant coffee i dont do proper coffee any more its just too expensive oh kate paused she was obviously disappointed never mind instant will be fine she lied the april afternoon light shone weakly into the kitchen from the small backyard jan put on the kettle for coffee and switched on the light we need some light on the subject she said as she banged two mugs on to the table and spooned in coffee from ajar kate had arrived at one oclock just in time for lunch when there was no risk of having to help prepare it she parked her new red bmw outside jans house there were empty beer cans on the pavement the front gardens along the street were full of bags of rubbish lying among the weeds and long grass the new car looked out of place among the old fords fiats and skodas parked in the dirty grey street jan poured hot water into the mugs and passed one over to kate sugar she asked no thanks i must be careful about my figure said kate of course i know you have to keep up appearances in your position said jan without smiling true said kate with a meaningful look at jans old sweater and dirty jeans i cant afford to let myself go so what are we going to do about mother asked jan her voice sounded nervous what do you suggest replied kate trying to control her nervousness too the sisters were like wild animals getting ready to attack each other well lets face facts mother cant look after herself any more the doctor says so too its all happened so fast she cant remember things she forgets to turn off the cooker she leaves the lights on all the time her fridge is full of rotten food she wets the bed she cant walk properly kate interrupted her but is it really that bad i mean there are lots of old people who manage well enough on their own surely if you just carry on coming round a couple of times a week to check up on her why me jan was beginning to lose control of her feelings why always me you seem to think i have nothing better to do than look after mother its not that well what is it then im still trying to get a proper job you know and when i do i certainly wont have time to check up on mother all the time and anyway thats not a solution i told you shes getting worse all the time she cant be left alone what if she falls down in the bathroom or falls out of bed noone would know weve got to find a proper solution its no good burying your head in the sand like an ostrich its time to stop pretending kate this is serious you may have been dads little favourite but shes our mother not just my mother dont forget that as if youd let me forget said kate in a sharp voice anyway what do you suggest you obviously have an idea jan took a deep breath then in a calm voice she said i think there are three possibilities number one we find a permanent nurse someone who can move in with mother and take care of her all the time number two we find a good old peoples home or care centre i think thats what people call them these days the only problem is that both these solutions cost money lots of money and money is something i dont have even if we sold mums house to raise the cash it would take time and we dont have time but i do have money is that what you mean said kate well yes you do when dad died he left you half the money from the business mum got the other half i dont mind that but all i got was enough to buy this miserable little house that was typical of the way dad always treated me anyway and you cant pretend you dont earn plenty from your law business so i can afford it is that it said kate yes i think you can my dear jan i dont think you understand anything about money said kate with a cold smile its true that we earn a lot of money but we have to spend a lot too the childrens education for a start you have no idea how much it cost to send caroline to oxford university and we had to buy her a flat to live in afterwards too and jeremy still has to finish another year at university in cambridge and then hell need money to help him get started too and then theres the cost of running the house and the garden and all the entertainment expenses of course but i wouldnt know anything about any of that would i my cindy was a dropout from school so she didnt even get to university and as for your kids when did they last visit their grandmother and you seem to forget how much it cost mother and father to send you to oxford i didnt even get the chance to go to university dad couldnt wait for me to start work as soon as i left school and as you can see my lifestyle is not quite on the same level as yours she pointed at the remains of the meal on the table the small chicken and the cheap wine all im saying jan is that you mustnt think weve got piles of cash to spend on mother our money is tied up in property and investments not under the bed oh no but you dont seem to have any problems when you want to go on a luxury holiday abroad or buy a new car or designer clothes do you said jan sharply she was beginning to lose her calm look jan how we use our money is our business not yours i realise that something has to be done about mother but dont just think that im going to sign a blank cheque so what now asked jan angrily are you still hoping ill checkup on mother for the rest of her life wait a minute didnt you say there were three possible solutions whats the third one there was a long uncomfortable pause then jan took a deep breath and said what she had on her mind the third solution well kate you have a very big house your kids have moved out so you have plenty of room how about fixing up part of the house as a small separate flat for mother your maid could keep an eye on her make sure she had regular meals kept herself clean and all that she wouldnt be in your way are you completely mad how could we possibly manage with having mother all the time and what do you think hugh will say when i tell him about your crazy idea its his house too you know i doubt if hugh would even notice he seems to spend most of his time away on business trips or playing golf anyway surely you could explain things to him after all he is your husband isnt he arent you supposed to share things including your problems are you suggesting that we dont kate said angrily not really im just asking you to think carefully about my idea dont simply say no now i dont think it would be that much of a problem for you at least you wouldnt have to pay for a nurse or an expensive care centre and mother would be in her own rooms so she wouldnt get in the way of your lifestyle you wouldnt have to include her in your dinner parties or anything like that kate looked at her watch it was half past three look jan its getting late i really have to be home by five thirty i told you were going out for dinner tonight but we dont seem to have come to a proper decision do we we certainly do not replied jan bitterly you say you have no money to pay for mother and i certainly have none i have no proper job and i have cindy to look after too she still has no job and nowhere to live except with me and youve just refused to even consider the idea of having mother living with you we mustnt upset hugh thats not quite what i said said kate ill tell you what ill speak to hugh when i can and see what he says but i really dont think hell agree ok speak to him but meanwhile what am i supposed to do ive got job interviews in the next couple of weeks i cant look after mother the way i have been doing we need a temporary solution until we finally decide what to do couldnt you at least have mother for a week it would be a kind of trial youd have a chance to see what it would be like come on its not much to ask after all youve got your filipina maid corazon corrie or whatever her name is i need a break i cant go on like this any longer kate looked at her watch again ok ill call you tomorrow by then ill have spoken to hugh maybe we can take mother for a week or so till you get your job interviews sorted out will that help but if you do get a job there will still be the problem of what to do in the long term it will help thanks said jan she felt such relief at finding a solution even a temporary one ok then ill speak to you tomorrow evening thanks for a lovely lunch jan it was nice to see you again take care safe journey jan watched the red bmw drive off and closed the front door she went back to the kitchen and started to pile the dirty dishes in the sink as she did so tears began to run down her face she cried with relief she cried at the unfairness of life she cried about the way her father had treated her so unfairly all his life for no good reason she cried for the miserable life she had in her small dirty house she cried for cindy and her useless life above all she cried for the strange crazy woman her mother had become chapter four just this once the dinner party was a great success kate had made the reservation at a quiet restaurant by the river thames it was one of those restaurants which almost smelled of money the lights were low with candles and bowls of spring flowers on the tables there were plain white tablecloths with real silver knives and forks crystal wine glasses and large expensive white plates the walls were decorated with old pictures of the river and glass cases containing stuffed fish in one corner a wood fire was burning the waiters wore black bow ties with spotless white shirts and black suits noone spoke loudly apart from kate and hugh there were only four guests costas clerides and his wife melpa with dark flashing eyes and a lowcut silk dress and hari mazumdar and his wife shantha looking wonderful in a red sari and gold jewellery clerides was greek and owned oil tankers and container ships mazumdar had made his money out of call centers in india both men were seriously rich the food and wine were not only expensive but delicious and perfectly matched soon everyone was relaxed and chatting comfortably towards the end of the meal the men moved to one end of the table and were soon deep in discussion about hughs new investment fund the women sat together and talked about fashion books films and holidays kate thought she noticed melpa looking towards hugh quite a lot but maybe it was just her imagination they left the restaurant quite late so it was midnight by the time kate and hugh got home he immediately headed to the drinks cupboard and poured himself a large glass of his favourite malt whisky havent you had enough to drink darling asked kate im celebrating my success said hugh they both want to come in with me if this investment fund works out ill be so rich ill never have to work again well done darling said kate though her voice didnt sound as though she meant it but you should be careful ive noticed you seem to be drinking more these days its not good for your health you know dont worry about me i know when ive had enough darling said hugh and took a large sip from his glass do you know them well asked kate i mean have you met them with their wives before weve had lunch in london a few times but they only brought their wives tonight why do you ask oh i dont know i thought they were both very attractive didnt you especially melpa there was a pause before hugh answered then he said i suppose so it was the men i was concentrating on anyway well done darling said kate again there was another pause she was wondering if this was the right moment to talk about jans idea when hugh asked her how did you get on at your sisters today i hope it wasnt too boring she decided that this was the right time to mention it not boring but a bit awkward what do you mean asked hugh sipping his drink well jan thinks we should do more to help with mother what sort of help i hope she doesnt think were going to pay for everything we did talk about that and i told her we couldnt but she really does need some help we talked about having mother here for a few days just as a temporary thing what have you gone mad how could we possibly have your mother here it would only be for a few days she could sleep in carolines old room and corrie could make sure shes ok but you never know what she might do you told me yourself that she forgets where she is and does crazy things she might set fire to the house or leave the taps running in the bath who knows what she might do darling in a weeks time youre going away on a business trip she could come then and ill make sure corrie keeps a close watch on her hugh finished the last few drops of his whisky and put down the glass all right then let her stay while im in the states but for goodness sake make sure she doesnt do anything crazy and kate this is just for a week right and just this once no ideas about her living with us of course darling its just this once ill call jan tomorrow and ill talk to corrie now are you coming to bed its monday tomorrow no no you go up darling i need to think about how im going to move this investment fund ahead now ive caught the two biggest fish goodnight darling kate bent down to give hugh a quick kiss and went upstairs as she looked back she saw hugh pouring himself another large glass of whisky chapter five back to where we started the following sunday afternoon kate picked up her mother from lewisham and drove her to marlow everything started well sarah fell asleep in the car and only woke up when they arrived at kates house kate put her mother in her daughter carolines old room it was a big bright room and overlooked the large garden which went down to the river kate had prepared an early supper for her mother so that she would be back in her room before hugh returned from the golf club when kate looked into her mothers bedroom later she was already fast asleep hugh came back late from golf he seemed to be in a strange mood and kate wondered what had happened but he didnt tell her anything he had a quick supper and went straight to bed he left for the airport on his trip to the states very early the next morning without waking kate before leaving for work that morning kate left instructions with her maid corrie corrie was an important part of the household without her kate wouldnt have been able to lead her busy professional life as a lawyer corrie took care of everything she cleaned washed ironed and cooked for kate and hugh and she served at table whenever they had guests for dinner she was tiny with dark skin bright eyes and a lovely smile she never complained whatever kate asked her to do kate asked corrie to make sure her mother took a bath when she got up and to make her breakfast and midmorning coffee she suggested that corrie should call her mother by her first name sarah kate also explained that her mother acted strangely sometimes so corrie would need to be patient with her sometimes she forgets things or gets things mixed up in her head dont worry about it too much just try to make her as comfortable as you can i know you will and one last thing corrie she said as she left please make sure you give mother her supper before seven before i get back she likes to go to bed early ill go up and say goodnight to her after i get back corrie was surprised that sarah was already up and dressed when she went into her room at eight oclock sarah ate a big breakfast then sat reading the newspaper in her room corrie thought she seemed like a perfectly normal old lady but when corrie took her some coffee at eleven oclock things started to become a little unusual hello dear are you the waitress said sarah can you call the manager id like to talk to him corrie didnt know what to say so she began to put the coffee things on the small table next to sarahs chair im speaking to you young lady said sarah sharply youd better answer me i want to see the manager im not satisfied with the service here corrie was totally confused by this situation she tried to deal with it as best she could im sorry sarah we no got manager only got mr hugh and he go to america how dare you call me sarah since when does a waitress call a customer by her first name so impolite go and get me the manager immediately she screamed by now come was getting really worried she decided to play the part of a waitress in a hotel to satisfy sarah very well madam she said ill go downstairs and look for manager now i come back soonsoon thats better said sarah back in the kitchen corrie wondered what to do should she phone kate but she knew kate had an important meeting in london she decided to wait a few minutes and then go back to see how sarah was when corrie went back to sarahs room the old lady was asleep with the newspaper open on her lap the cup was on the floor and the coffee was all over the carpet corrie got a cloth and began to clean up the mess sarah suddenly woke up looked at her and said hello dear how nice of you to call in to see me would you like some coffee oh dear it looks as if someone has dropped it on the floor never mind i can get you some more is all right madam i not need coffee why are you calling me madam asked sarah with a puzzled expression i thought we were friends why dont you call me sarah yes sarah said corrie now completely confused by sarahs unusual changes of behaviour i look for manager but so sorry he go for meeting manager what manager said sarah but i wonder if youve seen my father someone told me he lives round here but i havent seen him for a long time have you seen him your father so sorry i dont know him said corrie yes you do said sarah hes tall and handsome he works for a tailor in the west end of london he makes clothes for all the famous people you must know him so sorry said corrie but i not see him never mind i expect hell come round to see me one of these days said sarah after a pause the expression on her face changed she looked nervously around the room this is a nice room isnt it dear where am i do i live here are they coming to ask me any questions i dont know the answers she seemed very upset and worried so corrie tried to hold her hand and put an arm round her shoulder to comfort her sarah suddenly became angry you take your hands off me who do think you are what are you doing in my house she shouted then quite suddenly she burst into tears rocking her body backwards and forwards in her armchair and mumbling confused phrases i dont want to say anything that will get me into trouble she moaned you dont know what its like theyre watching me all the time theyve got all these questions and i dont know the answers this time she allowed corrie to comfort her corrie helped sarah out of the chair and on to the bed you just have a little rest now sarah she said i come and call you for your lunch ok sarah eventually calmed down and soon she was asleep corrie tiptoed quietly out of the room sarah slept through lunchtime and only woke at five oclock she seemed to be quite normal again and ate a big piece of fish with peas and potatoes and drank several cups of strong tea she was warm and friendly towards corrie she chatted with her about life in the philippines and about corries family corrie told her how well her children were doing in school and she explained how hard it was for her when she thought of them growing up without their mother so far away when kate came back at seven they were still chatting how was your day mother kate asked oh ive had a lovely time this is my new friend i cant remember her name but shes from abroad somewhere have you met her before of course ive met her mother she works here oh does she said sarah absentmindedly then she fell silent obviously deep in her own private thoughts soon after this corrie took sarah back upstairs goodnight mother ill come up later after youve had your bath said kate corrie stayed with sarah for a while then when kate came up to say goodnight to her mother she went down to prepare kates supper later in the evening kate joined corrie in the kitchen so how was today how did you get on with mother corrie felt embarrassed she didnt know how to answer finally she said oh i think she very nice but sometime she forget about something i try to help her but sometime she a little bit difficult to understand oh im sure youll manage said kate just let me know how things go tomorrow all right i do my best said corrie i know you will i dont know what id do without you corrie i really dont goodnight goodnight madam said corrie suddenly she felt very tired and more than a little worried about the next day chapter six never again the next day started uneventfully it was only after lunch when corrie and sarah were sitting in the kitchen that things started to go wrong again sarah sat staring completely lost in her own thoughts again her eyes empty then suddenly she began to sing all things bright and beautiful all creatures great and small all things wise and wonderful the lord god made them all her voice was high and very shaky on the top notes and she sang the words of the old sunday school hymn very deliberately rolling the rs and pronouncing all the final consonants it was a strange almost crazy performance sarah suddenly looked straight at corrie and ordered her to sing too come on now all together and she began to sing again all things bright and beautiful come on dear all together join in come on corrie who had never heard the words or the tune of this hymn before didnt know what to do come on dear its a lovely hymn we used to sing it at sunday school come on and she sang the first verse again conducting wildly with her arms spread wide like some crazy old bird flapping its wings she moved on to the second verse come on you can do better than that she told corrie each little flower that opens each little bird that sings he made their glowing colours he made their tiny wings corrie tried her best to sing along but sarah was clearly not satisfied with her efforts back to the chorus she said and waved her arms even more wildly all things bright and beautiful and that wasnt the end of it sarah went on and on repeating the verses over and over again corrie began to wonder if she would ever stop singing the week went on and somehow corrie got used to the old woman and her crazy talk at times sarah would act quite normally but other times she would refuse to eat her food or throw it on the floor one morning she woke up and refused to get out of bed often she would ask corrie about her father and mother as if they were still alive sometimes she seemed not to recognise kate or she thought that corrie was her daughter luckily corrie was a patient and kind person so somehow they got through the week on wednesday evening after supper kate asked corrie again how do you think mother is now madam i think she very old and maybe she got problem with her memory but she a nice lady i think maybe she need her family with her yes well it would be nice i know but we havent got the time to be with her all day were so busy anyway shell be going home soon in fact kate had hardly spoken to her mother she left for work each morning before sarah was up and only got back in time to say goodnight to her kate was about to go up to bed when she remembered something hugh had called her from new york and wanted her to prepare a special dinner party on friday evening again for his business friends but this time he wanted it to be at home so it would be more informal and private oh corrie we have six people coming to dinner on friday well talk about the food tomorrow but can you manage to feed mother early and make sure shes back in her room before the guests arrive yes madam i will do my best said corrie though she wondered how she would manage to look after the old lady and cook the dinner too hugh got back on thursday evening he slept late on friday morning then went off to play golf kate was glad he wouldnt be around in case he met her mother hed obviously forgotten all about her and corrie felt grateful that she wouldnt have to cook him lunch it was always difficult to please him and he usually found something he didnt like about her cooking though everyone else always praised her skill as a cook she didnt like hugh she thought he wasnt a nice man at all after she had taken sarah her breakfast corrie went down to the kitchen to start preparing the evening meal for the guests at lunchtime she took up a light meal to sarahs room but sarah wasnt there kate was working at home in her study so corrie went to tell her and together they started to look for sarah they looked all over the house but didnt find her after half an hour they were both feeling very worried then by chance corrie looked out of the window in sarahs room and saw her at the bottom of the garden right next to the river they ran out of the house and down to the river just in time to see sarah standing in the river with the water up to her knees hello she said isnt it a lovely day shall we all go for a swim somehow they managed to get sarah out of the river and back to her room corrie gave her a hot bath and put her back to bed wasnt that lovely dear said sarah and immediately fell asleep but in the afternoon she woke up and started her crazy singing again kate had gone out so it was corrie who had to go up to her room with some tea and biscuits to try to calm her down sarah went on singing the same hymn she had sung earlier but much much louder this time corrie was starting to feel worried because she still hadnt finished preparing for kates dinner party eventually over half an hour later sarah stopped singing and without saying a word went back to bed and fell asleep again corrie sighed with relief and began to lay the table in the big dining room corrie served sarah a light supper on a tray in her room then left her to make the final dinner preparations where are you going dear i have to prepare some things for kate corrie replied oh i can help you dear said sarah no no no need thank you said corrie terrified at what might happen if sarah came downstairs oh all right then i think i shall have another bath the guests began arriving at seven thirty hugh served drinks in the lounge then everyone went through into the dining room this was an important business dinner for hugh he was hoping to get someone else to sign up for his new investment fund this time the clerides and the mazumdars were joined by an english couple the manninghams clive manningham had been at oxford university with hugh so they knew each other well all the ladies were dressed in expensive clothes again and melpa clerides was looking especially wonderful like a film star kate thought a little jealously melpa seemed so much more elegant than she did getting all these important people together in the same place at the same time hadnt been easy to arrange so hugh really wanted everything to go well then just as the guests were sitting down the dining room door flew open and sarah stood in the doorway she was wearing bright red lipstick lots of eye makeup and her nightdress im so sorry to keep you waiting she said in her best voice im truly very happy to see you all here please do make yourselves at home just like old times now shall we have a little singsong and she started to sing all things bright and beautiful in a very loud voice conducting wildly and encouraging the guests to join in hugh of course was furious get her out of here he said to kate in an angry voice after some confusion in which a couple of wine glasses were broken and some dishes knocked on to the floor they managed to lead her out of the room and back upstairs but hughs dinner party was ruined at least for him the guests didnt seem to mind they just found it amusing everything soon returned to normal and everyone enjoyed the excellent dinner that corrie had prepared but for hugh it felt like the end of the world just get her out of this house and never bring her back do you understand never hugh shouted as soon as their guests had gone kate followed him through to the lounge he suddenly turned on her his face still red with anger i want her out of here by tomorrow that mad old woman has ruined my business deal and made us both look like idiots in front of those people how can i ever invite them again i know it was bad darling but it wasnt that bad in fact i think they all thought it was quite funny their wives too im sure it wont ruin your business deal these are grownup people surely they wont hold it against you im not so sure that crazy old woman made us look like idiots if i look like an idiot maybe theyll think i am an idiot you dont know how these peoples minds work anyway im sorry it happened said kate and of course mother cant stay here it was a bad idea i should have known it wouldnt work something i didnt tell you was that she walked into the river this afternoon she could have drowned if she can do that goodness knows what else she might do it wouldnt be safe to have her here ill call jan in the morning and tell her ill be taking mother back to lewisham tomorrow she wont like it but its too bad we have our own lives to lead thats the least you can do after whats happened replied hugh now ill have to start trying to pick up the pieces ill have to call everyone tomorrow and try to calm things down lets hope my partners dont walk away from the investment fund now that weve got so far with it im sure it will all pass noone will even remember it in a month from now people easily forget these things i hope youre right now i think of it maybe it would have been better if your mother had kept walking into the river that would have been one less problem for us to think about hugh how can you say such a thing she may be a nuisance but noone wants her dead are you so sure said hugh roughly im pretty sure your sister jan wouldnt mind losing her lets leave jan out of this shall we ill have enough to do explaining to her why we cant keep mother here all right but sometimes i think it would be better to get rid of people like your mother theyre no use to anyone and it costs the country millions of dollars to keep them alive ok hugh thats enough im tired i want to go to bed its been a busy week kate walked to the door then paused oh by the way where did you go today when i was putting your things away i noticed your golf shoes were clean there was no dirt on them at all i thought you were supposed to be playing golf there was an uncomfortable silence well no actually said hugh i wanted to play but on the way to the club i got a call from macey he wanted me to meet him in the office something urgent i thought you were taking the day off since youd just got back from the states are you sure of course im sure what are you suggesting macey was right to call me too we could have lost a lot of money i spent most of the day with him trying to sort it out i cant afford any problems with this new fund all ready to start up kate had a strange feeling perhaps hugh was telling her the truth but perhaps he wasnt his story didnt sound quite right where could he have been if he wasnt playing golf and wasnt at work but she felt too tired to argue anyway goodnight darling she said as she kissed him lightly on the cheek and went towards the stairs as she went up the stairs she heard the usual pop of a cork from a bottle and the sound of whisky being poured things werent right between her and hugh he seemed more and more like a stranger to her things couldnt go on like this they must have a proper talk soon she decided the following morning kate called jan im sorry jan it wont work im driving mother back home this morning maybe you could be there when she arrives im sorry dont say anything i know all the arguments but she cant stay here she just cant thats final jan swore under her breath and put the phone down they were back to square one back to where they had started chapter seven difficult choices when kate took her mother home on saturday morning jan wasnt there instead it was cindy who opened the door cindy was twentyeight her hair was bright green and she wore rings lots of rings rings in her ears a nose ring and a lip ring and a ring through her tongue too her face was unnaturally pale like dough for making bread she looked as if shed just climbed out of bed she didnt speak to kate who for once didnt know quite what to do or say eventually kate said please tell your mother ill call her later clear off said cindy and shut the door in her face who was that nice lady taxi driver asked sarah cindy burst out laughing in spite of her bad mood never seen her before she replied she was very wellspoken said sarah perhaps her husband lost his job so she has to drive a taxi now could be said cindy smiling to herself it was such a lovely idea can i have my tea now asked sarah ok ill make us both a cup cindy took sarah into the kitchen and put on the kettle sarah sat looking out of the window with empty eyes where are we she asked suddenly have i been here before this is your home gran said cindy dont you remember are you sure i dont think ive been here before do i have to do anything special no gran just wait a minute and well have a cup of tea then you can have a rest i have to go out for a little while but ill be back later and make you your lunch do i have to do anything special today no gran i told you just sit there till the teas ready sarah sat nervously squeezing her hands with a frightened look in her eyes do i have to do anything special today she asked again cindys good mood began to disappear i told you no gran for gods sake stop asking me the same question all the time youre driving me bananas wheres my tea asked sarah cindy dropped two teabags into the pot and poured in boiling water nearly ready she said as they sat drinking the mugs of tea sarah began to show signs of nervousness again do i have to introduce you to anyone here she asked cindy replied heavily no gran when am i going home sarah suddenly asked youre at home now said cindy am i i dont recognise it have i been here before youve lived here for the past forty years gran said cindy dont you remember its a nice cup of tea said sarah do i have to do anything special today cindy took a deep breath and stopped herself from saying anything she was beginning to feel desperate to escape from this crazy old woman somehow cindy got through the rest of the day jan had gone to london so cindy couldnt just leave her grandmother alone though she really wanted to but she did manage to go backhome a couple of times which made the day just about bearable luckily it was only a few minutes walk away so she never left sarah alone for long when jan arrived at six cindy was cooking sarah an omelet hello mother said jan to sarah hello dear how was your holiday replied sarah oh dear said jan to cindy how did it go come into the other room and ill tell you said cindy they left sarah to eat her omelet and went into the lounge before you say anything cindy let me tell you my news i got the job i got a letter this morning they offered me the post of assistant to the sales director as a start but they told me there are plenty of opportunities for promotion the moneys not bad either and i can start next monday isnt that great news yes mum im really happy for you youll be working again at least well have some regular money coming in again apart from my weekly benefit payments and your odd jobs but tell me how you got on with your grandmother said jan she sounded worried well mum it was a whole new experience i hadnt realised just how strange she was i mean i havent had much contact with her recently not since i came back from the drug rehabilitation centre but shes totally mad most of the time if you ask me she almost drove me mad too asking the same questions over and over and half the time she doesnt know where she is or who anyone is but i have to say shes really funny too sometimes she thought kate was a taxi driver thought her husband had lost his job if only he had maybe kate might act a bit more like a human being said jan yeah she said shed call you by the way kate i mean i told her to clear off shes a real cow cindy and jan stayed with sarah till bedtime then walked back to their own place in the dirty sidestreet littered with empty beer cans and old plastic bags the following morning jan went round to see her mother when she opened the door she found smoke pouring out of the kitchen there was a terrible smell of burning sarah was sitting calmly in the lounge reading the newspaper jan rushed into the kitchen turned off the gas grabbed a saucepan from the cooker and took it out into the garden it was completely black and had started to melt mum what have you been doing why did you leave the saucepan on the cooker again couldnt you smell the burning burning oh i thought it was from next door has my milk boiled yet has it boiled you nearly set the house on fire thank goodness i came when i did if the milk has boiled can i have my coffee then said sarah completely unaware of the danger she had been in jan spent the rest of the morning cleaning up the mess and getting rid of the strong smell left by the burnt saucepan then she made some lunch for her mother and went home when she returned to her mothers at seven that evening her heart sank the house was in total darkness she opened the front door and called out to her mother but there was no answer she called again this time there was a faint sound from upstairs like a dog crying she ran up and found sarah lying on the floor of the bathroom her arm was bent at an awkward angle and there was blood on her face she was moaning with pain oh mum what have you done this time when the doctor came he told jan that her mother had broken her wrist he bandaged it tightly and told her to take sarah to hospital the next morning theres nothing to worry about he said but she mustnt be left on her own can you stay with her well ill have to i suppose at least till tomorrow how old is your mother now shes seventynine said jan shes been a bit of a problem since my father died four years ago she seems to be losing her memory and she gets very confused at times she doesnt seem to know where she is or who people are sometimes she thinks im her mother it worries me sick its got a lot worse in the last couple of weeks have you thought about getting her into a care centre i really dont think she should be living alone its dangerous for her or is there anyone who could move in with her jan sighed your colleague told me she needed twenty fourhour care too when i spoke to him a few weeks ago its something were discussing with my sister at the moment she said trying to smile good said the doctor and in the meantime ill arrange for her to have some tests for alzheimers sadly its more and more common the more old people there are the more cases of alzheimers we must expect we still dont know how to treat it properly but at least you should know how badly her memory has been affected the surgery will get in touch with you to fix an appointment thank you doctor said jan not even trying to smile this time the following evening jan and cindy were sitting downstairs in sarahs house sarah was fast asleep upstairs her arm was now covered in thick white plaster cindy theres something ive got to ask you whats that mum i want you to help me out ive never asked you before and ive always been there when you needed me when you had the drugs problem when you had the abortion to get rid of the baby when that steve man threw you out ive never blamed you and ive never asked you for anything in return i suppose i always blamed myself for not being a better mother but now i need you cindy someones got to take care of your grandmother she cant be left on her own any more the doctor says so and i say so and anyway its obvious ok ok i know what youre going to say why cant kate help out for a change why me but sometimes we have to do things its not fair but thats how it is i mean its ages since i went out for a meal or went to see a good film and you know how i love the cinema ever since i broke up with your father all those years ago ive been doing parttime rubbish jobs temporary work as a secretary supermarket checkout jobs nothing permanent now for once i have a chance at last i got my diploma in marketing it wasnt easy but i got it and now ive got a good job i wont be able to work and look after your grandmother as well its just not possible so please cindy mum im sorry but i just cant its not that i dont want to help you but look at yesterday after a while she just started to get on my nerves i mean i felt like killing her she goes on and on asking the same questions saying the same silly things and you know what will happen if i do break down ill run back to the drugs again i just cant do it mum i cant spend all my time with a crazy old woman like her i cant i dont mind helping out now and again but i cant be with her full time and youre right why should that selfish sister of yours walk away from it all god i hate her and that husband of hers too why cant we get gran into a care centre two reasons cindy we cant afford it and secondly i dont want my mother to be stuck with a lot of people just like her or worse sitting in a lounge with the tv on all day with nothing to do except drink weak tea those places are terrible i want her to have some dignity left at the end of her life not to be treated like an animal jan didnt argue any more she was exhausted she went upstairs to sleep in her old room at her mothers house but an idea was beginning to grow in her mind a solution to her problem a terrible desperate solution she fell asleep thinking about it chapter eight hopeless it was sunday again and raining a miserable wet british sunday the sky grey above the roofs of the sad grey houses jan hadnt slept well all night long she had been arguing with herself about what she planned to do she tried to be logical and to look at the facts clearly without emotion fact one her mother was now unable to look after herself her condition was getting worse fast fact two neither kate her sister nor cindy her daughter was willing to look after her fact three she herself now had the chance of a proper job with a good salary if she stayed at home to look after her mother that chance would be lost and she would probably never get another chance fact four if her mother took too much of her medicine by accident she wouldnt suffer and the problem would be solved but however logical her arguments were there was a voice in her head that kept whispering the word murderer she had tossed and turned in her bed all through the night but she had found no way out of her problem every way she turned she met a solid wall she felt trapped shes your mother how could you do it the voice said but why should i be the one to suffer she asked herself after all shes so far gone now that she doesnt get any pleasure out of life most of the time she doesnt even know where she is its as if shes sitting in the dark prison of forgetting she cant make sense of her life whats the point surely id be saving her from her misery then the other voice would attack her again how could you possibly even think of killing your mother once its done you wont be able to undo it you know youll be sorry for it for the rest of your life but i cant make her well again either noone can undo her condition whats the point of making her suffer like this the arguments went round and round in her head until she felt physically sick she felt like a wasp trapped in a jam jar finally in the late afternoon she decided her mother was upstairs having her afternoon sleep jan made a cup of tea she put the bottle of pills on the tray with the tea things then she took it up to her mother sarah swallowed her usual two pills without noticing them with her cup of tea jan had decided to give her two more pills a few minutes later then two more then two more sarah was so forgetful that she wouldnt remember taking the first pills noone would suspect jan when the police came they would find the empty pill bottle it would look like an accident jan opened the bottle and took out two more pills here you are mum time for your pills she said nervously and in her head she asked to be forgiven for what she was about to do but before she could give the pills to sarah the phone began to ring downstairs she waited but the phone went on ringing and ringing with the pills still in her hand she ran downstairs to answer it hello mum its cindy oh cindy erm i erm er what is it said jan mum are you ok your voice sounds all shaky and strange is anything wrong hows gran shes erm fine im just giving her tea why are you calling anyway listen mum ive been thinking about what you said i know how much this job means to you so ive decided to try and help you out after call ill look after gran for you at least for a time till we can find something better but i hope you can help me too sometimes i cant face being with her twentyfour hours a day seven days a week cindy youve saved my life said jan and your grandmothers too she thought of course ill help you whenever i can oh my god i think im going to cry look ill call you back later ok i just need to do something she ran back upstairs sarah was still sipping her tea jan put the pills back in the bottle put the top back on tightly and put it safely in her pocket more tea mum she asked yes please dear was that your father on the phone no mum it was cindy shell be coming to look after you tomorrow oh will she is she that small lady with the dark skin i liked her even if she is a foreigner she had a lovely smile no mum but you like cindy too oh do i i dont think i know her yes you do but dont worry about it what about my pills asked sarah have i taken my pills yes mum said jan with relief youve already taken them chapter nine hughs little problems in the weeks following the dinner party kate hardly saw her husband he always left very early in the morning and usually came back very late and sometimes he spent the night away in paris frankfurt milan or athens he said he was working hard to make sure his investment fund was a success he told kate he had meetings the whole time about how to attract money to the fund and how to invest it to make big profits for the partners and even when he was with kate he seemed uneasy he avoided her and didnt seem to want to talk about anything important she was getting more and more worried about what was happening between them was something seriously wrong with their marriage they had known each other since they met as students at oxford that was twentyfive years ago after all that time and with two grownup children they knew each other very well or she had thought they did now she wondered how well she really knew this man she had spent so much of her life with of course he wasnt perfect in fact he had some rather serious little problems he drank too much just like his father who had died from drink he seemed to be able to drink large quantities of any kind of alcohol beer wine whisky gin vodka and he rarely seemed to be affected by what he drank but kate knew that one day something serious would happen either he would do something stupid or he would get ill another of his little problems was that he was by nature a gambler he didnt play cards for money or bet on horses or go to the casino and play roulette but he was a gambler he played with money other peoples money of course that meant he was always taking chances hoping for a big win but it was dangerous kate knew this all too well because a few years back he had lost a lot of money and almost gone to prison for it luckily some of his friends had helped him out but this hadnt stopped his gambling habit it was an addiction he couldnt help it it was stronger than him his new investment fund was also a gamble and kate wondered how big the risk was this time and like many handsome men with a lot of money hugh had a weakness for beautiful women and they were attracted to him too kate remembered how he had looked when they met so strong and handsome with long dark hair and a smile like a film star and she remembered the brief affair he had had with that actress after jeremy was born but kate wondered if he was still quite so attractive now in his late forties losing his hair getting fat around the middle and without his smile too most of the time was it possible that he still attracted women as he had done when he was younger kate herself certainly didnt find him attractive in that way any longer then one evening when she came home with all these thoughts in her mind kate heard a mobile phone ringing it was coming from hughs study he was away in paris and hed obviously forgotten his mobile by the time she picked up the phone the ringing had stopped before switching off the phone she noticed there were ten missed calls all from the same number and the callers name was melpa chapter ten pictures from the past hello gran how are you feeling this morning cindy put a mug of tea down on her grandmothers bedside table heres your tea youd better drink it while its still hot im not feeling too good today oh whys that then im thinking too much what are you thinking about gran my feet your feet yes my feet they make me think and i keep forgetting things but my bloods better now so they say who says gran oh you know that nice young doctor cindy gave up trying to guess who her grandmother was talking about maybe this doctor was someone left over from a dream well thats good anyway the blood i mean said cindy as she smoothed the bed sheets but theres a lot of things i want to do but i cant there was a pause i dont know where the pots and pans are thats the trouble i expect theyre in the kitchen where they belong said cindy what kitchen asked her grandmother i dont remember any kitchen where is it its downstairs of course said cindy whose house is this anyway i dont think ive been here before its your house gran its where youve lived for the past forty years oh is it she asked and drank her tea cindy suddenly started to giggle uncontrollably oh gran sometimes youre really funny you know well at least i make you laugh its better than crying i can tell you that then all at once she put her mug of tea back on the table and knocked it over sarah was obviously in pain gran are you ok no is there any pain no its just the didgery she moved uncomfortably on the pillows but cindy couldnt stop giggling again at the didgery shed never heard the word before and it sounded so funny in spite of the situation her gran was in the didgery her gran had just added a new and original word to the english language here gran let me lift you up a bit youll be more comfortable ow dont you hurt me who are you anyway wheres that nice taxi lady its ok gran just rest for a minute ill get your pills for you just lie back and relax sarah lay back obviously more comfortable as cindy left the room she went back to sleep when cindy returned with the pills she was already fast asleep snoring loudly with her mouth wide open her hands moving nervously on the sheets as if she was trying to find something then quite suddenly she sat up opened her eyes and asked is this where we all get off get off what thought cindy does she think shes on a bus or does she mean this is where she gets off the journey office she felt a wave of sadness and sympathy for the human ruin her grandmother had become she began to cry quietly at first then sobbing uncontrollably sarah didnt seem to notice her tears come on then im not going to sit here all day lets get on with it cindy dried her eyes she helped her grandmother into the bathroom helped her wash and dress then she supported the old lady downstairs to the kitchen cindy thought and this is only the beginning of the day what will the rest be like she sat sarah at the table and made her some breakfast dont ask me what theyre saying about me said sarah i dont know and they keep on asking me all those questions and i cant answer i dont know the answers her voice sounded frightened again never mind gran just have some breakfast ok look some nice croissants with your favourite jam after she moved in to stay with sarah cindy gradually got used to her new routine helping her grandmother to wash and dress changing the sheets when she wet the bed getting her meals sitting with her when she wasnt asleep putting her to bed at night and she also somehow got used to the strange illogical conversations she had with the old lady sarah would suddenly say things that seemed to come from nowhere and she seemed to believe that they were watching her and asking her questions which she couldnt answer occasionally she would say something that was connected to a childhood memory at other times things she said seemed unconnected to anything it was tiring for cindy to try to make sense of what sarah said yet sometimes she could be so funny that cindy just couldnt help laughing people say that children often get along better with their grandparents than with their parents cindy had certainly had a stormy and sometimes unhappy relationship with her own mother now she began to feel herself growing fond of this strange old woman who was her grandmother one afternoon as she was tidying one of the cupboards cindy found an old photograph album she looked through the pages most of them were family pictures faded and yellow with age their corners turning up at the edges like autumn leaves cindy could recognise some of her relatives her grandfather and grandmother when they were young her mother jan as a child and as a teenager her aunt kate too but there were even older photos almost brown now and very faint they were like ghosts these men and women in victorian clothes standing stiffly for formal photographs children in oldfashioned school uniforms all of them staring at the camera like people from another world the past is another country cindy remembered reading somewhere how true it was what are you doing in these came sarahs voice im just looking at some of your old photos gran thats all here bring them over here i want to have a look cindy took the album and sat next to sarah on the sofa look gran she said sarah began to turn the pages slowly then she stopped and pointed at one of the photos my mum and dad she said in the photograph was a young couple the young woman was wearing clothes fashionable in the s the man was also fashionably dressed he had a sad sad smile sarah said again my mum and dad have you seen them anywhere cindy didnt answer the question instead she pointed to another photo this one showed a very young couple standing either side of a table with a pot plant on it the man was wearing a soldiers uniform the woman looked young enough to be a schoolgirl thats my mum and dad repeated sarah again this time she sounded really excited first world war they were engaged to be married my dad went to the war he went to the great war she found another photo this was a wedding photo it had the date underneath it december again sarah pointed and once more said excitedly my mum and dad its their wedding but i wasnt there i should hope not said cindy with a smile my dad was lucky he came back but he had something wrong with him they called it shell shock he couldnt work properly after that my poor dad cindy pointed at another photo a woman with a baby thats my mum and my little brother tom said sarah you had a brother asked cindy i didnt know that he died when he was one said sarah died of flu when were you born gran asked cindy is this you she pointed to another baby picture thats me thats me said sarah born in th of may thats my birthday mustnt forget my birthday name sarah morton address spring grove lewisham south london always remember your address my mum said in case you get lost and then you can tell the policeman cindy realised that somehow the old photos had opened a window into sarahs memory she had spoken sensibly for once cindy now felt sure that something of her grandmother remained somewhere inside that old weak body there was still a real person but only just and only sometimes by the time jan arrived a few minutes later the window into sarahs memory had already closed sarah looked at jan and said to cindy whos that its your daughter jan said cindy whats she come here for said sarah shes come to see you gran well shed better have a good look then hadnt she said sarah loudly both jan and cindy exploded in laughter chapter eleven a winwin situation kate had been intending to have a serious talk to hugh about the missed calls on his mobile phone when he came back from paris that weekend but somehow it never seemed to be the right time or maybe she was avoiding it by delaying for as long as possible something told her it was a very dangerous subject kate now knew for sure that he hadnt been playing golf that friday after he came back from the states she had called the club secretary and he had told her hugh hadnt been there that day she added this to the list of things she needed to face him with when they finally had their talk together but this evening hugh wanted to discuss something else he seemed quite excited about an idea he had had ive been thinking about your mother again he said how do you mean asked kate whatever made you think of her well ive had an idea that might just work out everyone would get what they want out of it a winwin situation everyone who is everyone get what whats this all about well the situation is that your mother needs special care your sister jan cant afford it your mother cant afford it and we dont want to pay for it ourselves right right said kate wondering where this was leading so what we do is this we offer to pay a month to jan to arrange a nurse for the old lady but i thought you said we wouldnt pay wait a minute theres more we dont do it for nothing we pay her the money monthly but when the old lady dies which is probably not long the house would belong to us wed draw up an agreement which jan would sign to agree that the house would become our property its quite a common kind of arrangement these days when people are living longer and cant look after themselves anymore so its like a gamble on how long mother will live in a way yes if she lives till shes ninety thats about ten years we would have paid but the house is worth at least i think and if they redevelop the area for new houses the land alone would be worth even more than that so we would make at least if she lives to be ninety but im sure she wont live that long just think if she only lived for another year wed make over its a fantastic opportunity for us and it solves jans problem too everyone wins its a winwin situation my god are you serious said kate but she could see from the look on hughs face that he really was of course im serious but when mother dies we might get the house anyway i cant see the point of spending money now your mother is a crazy old woman who knows who shell leave the house to this is one way to make sure of it and lets face it shes not likely to live for much longer so we wont have spent much anyway when he had started talking about her mothers death in terms of the money they might get from it kate had felt at first that it was wrong how could they use the situation to make more money for themselves but then she started to think it wasnt such a bad idea after all without their money jan would be stuck with mother till she died maybe it looked bad to make money like this but as hugh said in a way it was a winwin situation for once it would be a bet they were sure to win and it was a way to make sure their mothers house came to them she had no idea what was in her mothers will it was in an envelope at the solicitors office and would only be opened after she died suppose her mother had left the house to jan or cindy or the battersea dogs home anything was possible but if they could get jan to agree to this arrangement it would be theirs anyway let me think about it she said maybe ill call jan tomorrow and arrange to go and see her if shes still speaking to me that is chapter twelve planning an outing a week had gone by and it was sunday again jan was sitting with cindy in sarahs kitchen after lunch sarah was asleep upstairs how are you getting on then asked jan well i think its the most tiring thing ive ever done you know what grans like one minute she knows who you are the next minute she doesnt recognise you and she swings between saying all those crazy things with no connection to anything and moments when she says something totally sensible of course there are still times when i feel like killing her but im getting to like her a lot actually and sometimes she says things that make me fall about laughing shes so funny i told you about the didgery didnt i well every so often she comes out with something like that last night i was trying to help her into bed all of a sudden she says hey none of that frookypooky here i mean what can you do all you can do is laugh it sounds as if youre managing anyway i cant tell you how grateful i am cindy if you hadnt helped me out i couldnt have taken the job how are you getting on there asked cindy whats it like now that youve settled in a bit oh its great everyones very friendly and the works really interesting and my boss is nice and very good looking too i think he likes me well you know fancies me i must say i wouldnt mind that either oh come on mum just joking well anyway hes started to pass on really interesting jobs to me now he seems to trust me to meet clients and all that no its really good im so glad mum i really am there was a pause then jan got up to put the kettle on for coffee im sorry ive been so busy with my new job that i havent had time to help out with your grandmother ill stay with her tonight though if you want a break and i can be with her the whole of next weekend if you like its her birthday on sunday thats ok mum said cindy i dont mind i dont feel like going out tonight anyway but it might be nice to get out next weekend thanks but if its her birthday i might stay around anyway jan made coffee real coffee this time thinking of the coffee reminded her of kate she sighed of course we cant go on like this for ever i havent spoken to kate since she brought your grandmother back and dumped her on us again i cant bear the idea of phoning her she makes me feel sick shes so selfish but some time or other were going to have to face it again after all you cant be expected to spend the rest of your life looking after your old grandmother more like the rest of her life said cindy i dont think shell live longer than me do you you know what i mean said jan yes i do and anyway its time i got myself a proper job too jan said nothing yet she could hardly believe her ears cindy was talking about a proper job shed been a dropout since school shed never had a proper job at all shed wasted the last ten years shed been on drugs slept rough on the streets in london been involved with some criminal characters had an abortion when one of them made her pregnant everything you could think of but it seemed as if she might be changing jan hardly dared to hope it was so cindy went on i think it may be because of gran in a way i mean she makes me think look at her the poor old thing is all burnt out even if she does show the occasional spark of life i dont want to end up like her or if i do i want to make something of my life first well if youre going to get a proper job youll need to get some qualifications first have you got any idea what you want to do i could always be a barmaid i suppose just joking mum just joking no im not sure but maybe something to do with looking after people im not keen on nursing though not after looking after gran maybe something like physiotherapy or maybe chiropody or whatever they call it these days you know looking after peoples feet and all that i dont really know though what do you think jan thought for a moment ill ask around if you like i can check it out on the internet at work maybe its a pity we dont have a computer at home i think id better get one as soon as theres some money in the bank maybe you could ask around too theres a chiropodists in the high street maybe they could advise you about training thanks mum yes lets find out but i cant really do anything till we sort out what to do about gran i know we keep circling around the problem and we always come back to the same place if only my dear sister kate had a tiny bit of kindness in her we could easily sort it out just then as if it had been listening to their conversation the telephone rang ill get it said cindy hello there was a pause oh its you we were just talking about you another pause ok here she is cindy passed the phone to jan its kate she wants to talk to you jan took the phone yes what do you want kates voice on the other end sounded uncertain jan please i was worried about you and about mother how is she is she all right how dare you ask me that you dumped her on the doorstep like a sack of potatoes and went back to your palace on the thames for gods sake dont pretend you care about us or about her youve got rid of her thats all you care about jan please listen im really sorry about what happened whats the point of being sorry it doesnt help us it doesnt help mother either honestly youre such a liar if youre really so worried about her why dont you do something to help jan thats why im calling you what do you mean i mean im calling you because ive been thinking about the situation im really sorry for what i did but it was an impossible situation please try to understand anyway i think we may be able to help out with mother oh really and how do you suggest youll do that asked jan bitterly its a bit complicated jan i think i need to see you so that we can talk it through together can i come down to see you next weekend i suppose so ill be here with mother cindys going off for a break shes been looking after mother nonstop since you dumped her here i hope you realise wed be in a real mess without cindy its just as well we didnt have to depend on your kids to help so shall we say sunday all right then come to mothers for lunch in case youve forgotten its her birthday shell be eighty of course said kate who obviously had forgotten her mothers birthday thanks for reminding me is there anything she needs what can i bring her use your imagination said jan so ill see you on sunday then about eleven yes ill come as early as i can goodbye then goodbye what do you make of that then said jan to cindy i dont know what did she say she said she thinks she and hugh might be able to help out with mother how she didnt say said it was too complicated so shes coming down to see me on sunday you wont be here so no need to worry selfish woman why cant she just say straight out what they want to do whats so complicated about it i dont know i just hope its real this time me too said cindy but ive just had a brilliant idea for grans birthday present ill take her to the seaside for the day itll be fun for both of us and i can always take some time off later no way said jan she can hardly walk and she hasnt been out of the house for ages all the more reason for taking her out then isnt it said cindy i can borrow a wheelchair and im sure my friend sue will lend me her car just for a day ill take gran down to brighton i know she used to like going there before when grandad was still alive itll do her the world of good and then you wont have to worry about having her around when kate comes come on mum it will really do her good i dont know are you sure you can manage with her all by yourself of course i can no problem at all ok so thats settled then but what about kate if you take your grandmother out she wont be able to see her when she comes on sunday serves her right said cindy its about time that selfish woman was given some of her own medicine she doesnt care about us so why should we care about her and so it was agreed that cindy would drive sarah to brighton for the day on her eightieth birthday chapter thirteen i do like to be beside the seaside cindy made all the arrangements she managed to borrow a wheelchair from a friend of a friend whose father had recently died and her friend sue was happy to lend cindy her car for the day on the saturday night cindy went clubbing with a group of her old friends but she came home early somehow it didnt seem as much fun as before in fact the crowds loud music and silly shouted conversations made her feel a bit ill happy birthday gran she said as she took sarah her cup of tea the next morning what what are you talking about said sarah today is your birthday gran said cindy youre eighty years old today am i who told you that gran im taking you to brighton for the day were going to the seaside do you remember brighton sarah seemed confused but at the word seaside something seemed to connect she began singing in a high shaky voice oh i do like to be beside the seaside oh i do like to be beside the sea i do like to stroll along the prom prom prom where the brass bands play tiddelyompompom her voice faded away as her memory failed to find the words to complete the old musichall song thats right gran the seaside thats where were going i bet you know all sorts of other songs too i wouldnt be surprised said sarah but im not saying i do and im not saying i dont because theyll ask me questions if i do oh will they said cindy but do i have to meet anyone special today no gran noone special youre the special person for today its your birthday wheres my hat asked sarah all of a sudden what hat my hat i cant go to the seaside without a hat can i i suppose not ill look in the wardrobe said cindy eventually she found an old straw hat with plastic fruit on it here you are gran she said and put it gently on sarahs head sarah reached up immediately and changed the angle of the hat now she looked like one of those silent film actors from the s what about that then eh she asked as she looked at herself in the mirror again she broke into song in her strange high voice where did you get that hat where did you get that tile isnt it a nobby one and just the proper style i should like to have one just the same as that whereer i go they shout hello her voice faded away again she sat silently her eyes empty it seemed as if she could only recover small pieces of memory from the web of words and pictures that crowded her mind the amazing thing for cindy was that she could still speak and use language if she could remember how to speak why couldnt she remember anything else properly it was a puzzle for cindy she hadnt realised that the new words made up by sarah didgery frookypooky and the rest were the first signs that even her memory for words was slowly being destroyed sarah had by now fallen into another light sleep when she woke a few minutes later she asked where are we i dont remember this place wheres the bungalow the bungalow what bungalow asked cindy oh you know you think im stupid but im not so stupid as you think do we have to do anything special today oh come on gran its your birthday were going to brighton were going to the seaside oh are we who told you that i dont want to do anything wrong you know theyll be asking me all those questions again and i dont know the answers sarahs eyes looked about the room suspiciously as if looking for them its your birthday gran lets have a good time ok is my mother coming too what about my dad sarah looked upset and confused again come on gran lets get you dressed its a lovely day look at the sunshine its a lovely may morning lets get on the road jan helped cindy put sarah into the car by eleven oclock cindy had arrived in brighton the sun was shining brightly and the sea looked inviting she parked the car not farfrom the seafront and took the wheelchair out of the car boot somehow she managed to halflift halfpush sarah into it where are we asked sarah nervously this is brighton gran were at the seaside come on lets go and she began to push the wheelchair quickly down towards the pier shall we go on the pier gran asked cindy sarahs eyes suddenly brightened its the seaside its the seaside she kept repeating there were already crowds of people walking along the seafront and sitting on the stony beach english people are odd thought cindy the minute the sun comes out they take off their shirts and show their pale skin even if the temperature is well below fifteen degrees celsius and they become more open and start to talk more as cindy pushed the wheelchair through the crowds people began to talk to sarah hello dear going for a ride hello sweetheart where did you get that hat lovely day isnt it having a nice time are you sarah was a bit surprised by all the attention she looked around her turning her head to the left and right where are we going wheres my mum she asked cindy nervously its ok gran were going to the pier brighton pier sticks out into the sea like a bridge with no land at one end its like a big funfair with small stalls selling ice cream sticks of pink brighton rock souvenirs balloons and all sorts of toys for children of all ages and you can try your luck at the shooting gallery and win perhaps a large pink fluffy bear or you can ask the fortune teller to tell you your future or play on the pinball and gambling machines cindy pushed the wheelchair to the end of the pier where they had a good view of the sea a few men were fishing the sun was shining on the sea so brightly that it hurt cindys eyes she put on her sunglasses it was beginning to get quite hot shall i get you an ice cream gran ice cream sarah concentrated hard trying to decide whether these words had anything to do with something she could remember then she suddenly started to shout ice cream you scream ice cream nice ice cream oh yes please ok ill go and get you one i wont be a minute just wait here ill be straight back when cindy returned a few minutes later she found sarah surrounded by a group of teenage girls hi she said whats going on i dunno said one of the girls we was walking by and she called out to us wheres my mum she kept saying is she all right dont worry said cindy she gets a bit confused sometimes sarah who had been staring out to sea grabbed the ice cream from cindy and started to lick it greedily making loud noises with her tongue and lips she seems to be enjoying it said another girl its her birthday today said cindy shes eighty wow said the first girl eighty thats seriously old come on said the second girl lets sing happy birthday whats her name sarah said cindy so the group of girls began to sing happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear sarah happy birthday to you as they sang more people gathered round and some of them joined in the singing they sang the song through again then they went on with for shes a jolly good fellow for shes a jolly good fellow for shes a jolly good fellow and so say all of us by now a large crowd had gathered sarah still wearing her old straw hat decorated with the plastic fruit sat in her wheelchair like a queen on a throne the ice cream was melting in the hot sun she had ice cream all round her mouth and it was running down her hand and on to her dress careful gran watch out for the ice cream here let me clean it up said cindy trying to clean up the mess with some tissues dont take my ice cream shouted sarah i know your tricks the crowd started laughing goodhumouredly sarah frowned at them dont you laugh at me she said ill teach you a lesson you wont forget in a hurry then her mood changed again thank you all so much for coming she said in her best voice its very good of you id like to sing you a song but i want you all to join in now lets start ready and she began to sing all things bright and beautiful a few of the older people in the crowd began to sing with her until almost everyone was taking part even the ones who didnt know the words now lets have another song said sarah when she came to the end and she started again in her crazy high voice oh i do like to be beside the seaside but this time there was no need for her to tell the crowd to join in they began singing along with her straight away the concert went on for nearly half an hour and they sang lots of old favourite songs sometimes sarah forgot the words or got them all mixed up sometimes she sang wildly out of tune but nobody seemed to mind they were all enjoying themselves then sarah suddenly clapped her hands im very sorry im afraid i have to leave you now i have to meet someone in town it was so kind of you all to come thank you all so much the crowd parted to let her wheelchair through as cindy pushed her back towards the seafront sarah waved her hand at them just like a queen a man in the crowd called out shes a real character three cheers for sarah hiphip hooray hiphip hooray hiphip hooray so sarah and cindy left the pier in right royal style chapter fourteen get out of my life meanwhile back in lewisham kate had just arrived for lunch with jan at sarahs house wheres mother kate asked i brought her these flowers and some belgian chocolates and a whole lot of soaps and shampoos shes out for the day cindys taken her out theyve gone to brighton itll do them both good said jan you mean shes not here thats a bit much said kate she was obviously angry that her mother wasnt there to see her after all she said i am her daughter and its her eightieth birthday i know said jan its a pity you didnt remember that before but you knew i was coming accused kate yes i did but i didnt see why mother shouldnt get a treat on her birthday anyway you came to talk to me about your idea not to see her the conversation throughout lunch was difficult the sisters tried desperately to find something to say to each other that wouldnt start another argument over coffee jan finally asked the question they both knew had to be answered so whats this idea of yours about dealing with mother and her condition kate sighed i told you its a bit complicated but ill try to make it as simple as i can ok go ahead well you dont have the money to pay for care for mother no you know perfectly well that i dont said jan impatiently yes but what about her what do you mean she only has her pension and the money dad invested for her i checked up what it costs and she certainly doesnt have enough to pay for the kind of special care she needs thats true said kate but she owns the house its a big house this area isnt particularly fashionable but the house is still pretty valuable house prices are rising again and anywhere in london is always good surely youre not suggesting she should sell the house said jan starting to feel her anger rising inside her no no no of course not theres no need to sell it i think theres a much better way for all of us jan let me try to explain what a lot of old people do these days is this they make an agreement with someone this someone agrees to pay them a regular amount of money every month until they die but when they die the house becomes the property of the person who has been paying the money every month its a risk for the person who agrees to pay out the money if the old person lives for another twenty years its a very bad investment they could end up losing a lot of money the main thing for the older person is that they have some degree of comfort for the rest of their life i didnt think it was such a good idea when hugh mentioned it first but when i thought about it carefully i could see the advantages for mother and who do you think would make an agreement like that with mother well ive discussed it with hugh and weve agreed that we could pay mother a month i know that wouldnt cover everything but it would certainly help its at least something we could do to make her life more comfortable after seeing how she was when she came to stay i can see how she cant go on like this and neither can you are you serious said jan her voice becoming excited and emotional do you mean to say that you and your millionaire husband are planning to treat mother like an investment on the stock exchange or a bet on the horses youre betting her life against your money hoping shell die sooner rather than later you make me sick but jan listen it isnt like that just think mother is eighty shes weak and losing her memory but theres nothing seriously wrong with her with luck she could live till shes a hundred just think what that would mean we could pay her more than so we wouldnt exactly be making a fortune out of it we just thought it would be a good solution to the situation nothing more than that we certainly dont think of it as a gamble on mothers life im not that heartless you know but you are how can you be so calculating so cold jan said sharply were talking about your mother not about a property investment its not about profit and loss its about a human being i think youve lost all your human feelings youre like a machine programmed to make money cant you see how disgusting it is whats wrong with you if you can afford to pay her a month then just pay it dont expect to make a profit out of it but jan were just trying to be helpful its a very reasonable offer everyone does well out of it it gets cindy away from having to act as a nurse for her grandmother it allows you to get on with your new job it makes sure mother is properly looked after and mother doesnt lose anything she would go on living in her house till she dies ok we get the house at the end of it but we will have paid fork kate i was going to make you coffee but ive changed my mind i think youd better go i really think youd better leave before i throw you out youre disgusting calculating selfish i dont know what else to say get out and take your flowers and your chocolates and your other rubbish with you dont bother to contact us again its over as far as im concerned i dont have a sister anymore she took kate to the front door pushed her out and threw the flowers and the rest of the presents out after her then she banged the door shut and burst into tears chapter fifteen italian birthday lunch back in brighton cindy had found a cheerfullooking italian restaurant for lunch there were a few tables with big umbrellas outside on the pavement she managed to push sarahs wheelchair up to one of these tables hello signorina said the young italian waiter he was very handsome cindy thought buon giorno signora he said to sarah you having a nice day sarah didnt even look at him she was staring across the road at the sea but her eyes were empty is it your mamma he asked cindy oh no shes my grandmother said cindy ah la normal lovely hat signora i get you the menu yes please said cindy but im not sure what shell eat shes a bit difficult but today is her birthday so is her birthday oh lovely how old shes eighty today mamma mia ottantanni wait i go tell my papa hell come to see you and he rushed inside and came back with a smiling middleaged man with a round belly covered by a large white apron buon giorno signore he said and bowed his head to cindy and sarah he turned to sarah is your happy birthday happy birthday i make you something special ok you leave it to me leave it to paolo first i bring you some water and some wine we make the happy birthday brindisi how you say toast ok wheres my tea i want a cup of tea demanded sarah is all right no problem i make you a cup of tea a few minutes later the son whose name was giovanni brought them some mineral water a bottle of chianti wine and a cup of tea he then produced a plate of antipasti parma ham olives cheese sausage and tomatoes here gran try some of this ham said cindy is it cooked asked sarah suspiciously its special gran from italy i dont want any of that foreign stuff said sarah i want some fish and chips gran this is an italian restaurant they make lovely food and the owner is very nice come on just try a little cindy served herself with a large helping she felt really hungry after their morning on the pier and began to eat its delicious she said to giovanni when he came back but my gran is terribly difficult about her food its ok you enjoy it ok just then his father came back with four wine glasses and poured the wine ok everybody whats your nonnas name sarah lovely ok sarah lets drink to your happy birthday just a little drink not much ok he smiled sweedy at sarah who was delighted by all this special attention she picked up her wine glass carefully as if she was afraid to drop it ok everybody heres to lovely signora sarah for her eighty birthday salute cheers they all drank even sarah sipped a little of the wine this isnt bad she said unexpectedly and she emptied the whole glass in one go can i have some more with her glass refilled sarah said loudly i dont think ill have my tea after all you can take it away if you like and excuse me but have you seen my mum and dad anywhere around i heard they were coming today but i havent seen them so far cindy made a sign to the men not to take any notice of this strange question its ok gran i think theyve gone somewhere else today lets have some food excuse me young man said sarah to paolo the owner can i have some fish and chips im sorry signora sarah but we dont do the fish and chips its not italian you know but i want fish and chips demanded sarah paolo and giovanni had a whispered conversation in italian then paolo said ok is your birthday this time i make you the fish and chips special one ok italian style sarah didnt seem to have heard him she was staring at the sea again lost in a world of her own they were at the restaurant for nearly two hours sarah got her fish and chips italian style cindy had some tasty ravioli and a delicious veal dish cooked with herbs called saltimbocca alia romana they finished their lunch with a big chocolate cake paolo had written on it in cream hapy birtday sara when cindy asked for the bill paolo refused to let them pay for the wine fish and chips or cake is for happy birthday he said with a big smile all cindy could do was to thank him by the time they left sarah was looking tired but happy this was hardly surprising as shed managed to drink four glasses of wine giovanni and cindy had given each other their telephone numbers and agreed to meet again sometime on their way back to the car sarah fell asleep in the wheelchair it was difficult for cindy to get her into the car as they set off on the return journey to london sarah woke up again she seemed upset about something whats the matter gran asked cindy do you want me to stop wheres my mum why didnt she come have they taken her away you dont know anything about them did you see them its all plunky boodle doodle do i cant answer all the plimsywimsy questions why do they keep asking me all those questions i dont know the answers after a while she stopped talking to herself and fell asleep again getting back to lewisham took a long time all roads were full of cars driving back into london after a day at the seaside and the roads in south london were even worse with traffic stopping and starting it was seven oclock by the time cindy parked the car outside sarahs house jan came out to help cindy get sarah into the house they took her upstairs straight away and put her to bed have you had a good day mum asked jan sarah seemed confused then her eyes brightened and she said in her best voice ive had a lovely day then she began to sing again i do like to be beside the seaside her voice got fainter and fainter till it stopped her eyes closed and she fell asleep with a smile on her lips chapter sixteen time to face facts when kate arrived home from jans hugh was already back from his golf there was dirt on his golf shoes so perhaps he really had been playing golf this time hello darling he said in a tired voice kate noticed that he had an empty whisky glass on the small table next to him he saw the direction of her look do you think you could pour me another one he said opening the business pages of the sunday newspaper i think you can get it yourself if you really want to poison yourself to death kate said ive been driving and im tired i need a shower ill tell you about what happened when i come down all right all right said hugh and got up slowly from his armchair as she went upstairs when kate came down again hugh was still reading his newspaper and sipping his whisky she wondered how many glasses he had had so far so how was your dear older sister jan today i hope she was in a better mood than last time she looked ok but she made me really angry mother wasnt there and it was her eightieth birthday id bought her flowers and chocolates and everything can you believe it jan had let cindy take her to brighton of all places i was furious id gone all that way to see her and she wasnt there really im sure jan only did that to upset you but your mothers birthday wasnt your main reason for going was it so what did she say about our offer for the house hugh asked she said she couldnt believe what i was telling her she said it was disgusting to gamble on how long mother would live she said we werent human beings any more just machines for making money she said a lot of things like that then she threw me out of the house so the answers no and now i think about it im not surprised jans always been like that hottempered emotional never logical she can never think straight oh well we tried anyway said hugh though there was disappointment in his voice it seemed he had really been hoping that jan would accept their offer never mind at least we dont have to do anything more now that shes refused our help we dont need to worry about jan and your mother now its a pity about the house though that was a really good opportunity he picked up his newspaper again but this time kate knew the moment was right for them to talk she couldnt delay it any longer there had been too many suspicious things going on it was time to clear the air once and for all listen hugh she said in a tight nervous voice she really wasnt sure how to start this conversation i think its really time for us to have a proper talk what do you mean talk about what he said opening the newspaper for gods sake will you put down your newspaper and listen to me for a change im trying to talk to you hugh put down his newspaper and took a sip of whisky ok darling go ahead he said in a cheerful voice though his face didnt look cheerful at all and can you stop drinking just for five minutes this isnt a joke im serious we have to talk fine but what about exactly asked hugh looking bored about us i want to talk about us about our marriage hugh what do you mean whats wrong with our marriage asked hugh innocently kate thought to herself how men always tried to avoid unpleasant things but she went on whats right with it thats what you need to ask we hardly ever see each other these days youre always going off here or there half the time i dont even know where you are and when we are in the house together you have your nose stuck in the newspaper or in a glass of whisky its months since we really shared a meal together or talked about anything important oh come on darling its not as bad as that oh yes it is in fact its worse we never make love any more its over a year now youre always too tired but i wonder if thats the real reason anyway what are you suggesting im suggesting that you have someone else oh come on how can you think such a thing when do i have time for that sort of thing you know im working flat out on my investment fund hugh please dont take me for a fool ive known you for over twentyfive years now and i can read you like a book first of all what about all those times you told me you were playing golf i dont know where you were but you certainly werent at the golf club and what about the nights that you didnt come home and what about all those missed calls from melpa on your mobile phone i wonder what dear melpa needed to talk to you about so urgently hughs mouth fell open he hadnt been expecting this so said kate in an icecold voice whats going on i want to know how serious is it do you love her hugh looked down and didnt answer his face had gone bright red come on i want to know is it melpa do you love her instead of answering hugh took a large drink of his whisky and began walking nervously up and down look kate he said at last i dont know how to begin it started a few months ago i ran into melpa in london one day and we went for lunch and somehow one thing led to another till neither of us could do anything about it its so easy to start these things but once youre past a certain point its impossible to stop yes i do love her im sorry kate god knows what were all going to do you know perfectly well what will happen if her husband finds out hell do his best to ruin me right hugh thanks for being honest with me at last if thats how things are i want you to sleep in jeremys room tonight the bed is already made up i dont want to see you in the morning and i suggest you move into the flat in london until weve sorted out the divorce divorce said hugh who said anything about a divorce i did said kate in her cold unfeeling voice and i meant it surely you dont think im going to just sit there like an idiot while you do whatever you want to oh no this marriage is over it cant go on then youll be free to marry your greek beauty if she still wants you by then goodnight chapter seventeen there is a time next morning when cindy took sarah her tea she didnt answer her when she said cheerfully good morning gran its another lovely day she pulled the curtains back and let in the bright may sunshine come on gran dont let your tea get cold she said as she went back downstairs to prepare sarahs breakfast half an hour later she came back carrying the tray she noticed that sarah hadnt touched her tea come on gran youve let your tea get cold let me get you a fresh cup she said but when she looked down at sarah she realised that her grandmother would never drink a cup of tea again she had stopped breathing sarah was dead there was a smile on her lips and she looked peaceful as if she had died in a sleep full of pleasant dreams cindy sat down on the bed her head in her hands crying helplessly she realised just how much shed grown to love this crazy but lovely old lady all their times together came back to her the funny words sarah had made up her changes of mood her forgetfulness her old songs and above all the birthday trip to brighton cindy dried her eyes with a handkerchief and sat up she knew she had to do something quickly the first thing was to tell her mother she called jans office number mum im sorry but i have some bad news for you gran died in her sleep last night i thought she was asleep when i took her tea but when i came back with her breakfast i saw cindys voice broke as she started to cry again oh mum why did she have to die like this we didnt even have the chance to say goodbye to her properly there was a pause before jan spoke its a shock for us both i know said jan but just think maybe this was the best way for her to die she had a lovely day out on her birthday thanks to you and it seems she died in her sleep without fear and without pain thank goodness for that but oh my god cindy heard her mother suddenly break down in tears she soon recovered listen cindy call the doctor immediately then just wait for me ill tell my boss dave what has happened and ill be back with you in about an hour dont try to do anything else till i get there right ok mum i think i need a strong cup of coffee to keep me going ill wait for you cindy was a bit surprised to see her mother arrive outside the house in a car dave was so sweet said jan as she came in he gave me a lift home he was very understanding that was really good of him said cindy what shall we do first i want to go up and sit with mother for a few minutes before we do anything please wait down here i just want to be alone with her ok mum ill make you a cup of nice strong coffee while im waiting when jan came down again she looked pale and upset but she smiled bravely she looks so peaceful she said its almost as if shes just sleeping i halfexpected her to sit up and ask one of her crazy questions but im glad she went like that without suffering yes im glad too in a way but i wish i could have told her how much i loved her before she died its ok cindy im sure she knew that you had some wonderful times together and she went out on a high im sure she knew right now wheres that coffee we need to make a list of all the things to do they sat together at the kitchen table with their coffee and a notepad and started the long list of people to contact death is simple for the person who dies once its over they have nothing left to do but for their family and loved ones there are hundreds of things to be done the doctor has to come to write out the death certificate the undertaker has to come to make the arrangements for the funeral and of course all the family members and friends have to be told then there has to be a small party after the funeral the solicitor has to be called to arrange for the reading of the will and later someone would have to deal with whatever sarah had left the house her belongings the money in the bank and so on the list seemed to be endless yet these things had to be done it seems unfortunate and unfair that just when people should be left to grieve over the death of someone close to them they have to get involved in all these practical things instead as soon as theyd completed the list jan started to make the phone calls it was early evening before she had finished the funeral was arranged for the following friday she had just put the phone down after the last call when it rang she answered it hello jan here whos speaking please hello can i please speak to cindy the voice sounded foreign just a minute ill call her who shall i say it is its giovanni from brighton jan called cindy who took the phone into the lounge and spoke for a long time when she came back she was crying again oh mum sometimes people are so kind that was giovanni from the italian restaurant where i took gran for her birthday i told you about him and his dad he called to ask me out next week but as soon as i told him about gran he got very emotional he says hell tell his father he wants to know if they can come to the funeral too he says they liked sarah so much even though they only met her once he says his father will call us again later thats really sweet of them said jan i cant see why they shouldnt come there wont be that many people most of sarahs friends are dead too and the family isnt very big either oh my god family i forgot to call kate do you think she might be interested said cindy with a bitter smile i must tell her of course i must i know shes been really awful about mother but she is her daughter she has to be told ill keep it short though she picked up the phone again and dialed kates number hello kate its me jan im calling you to let you know that mother died in her sleep last night the funeral will be next friday well be sending out cards tomorrow as soon as i can get some made i hope you can all come do you think hugh and caroline and jeremy will be able to make it anyway ill send cards to you all i have to run now theres lots to do as you can imagine oh my god thats a shock i dont know what to say i no need to say anything to me you know what i think of you that hasnt changed just let me know whos coming thats all and dont bother to send flowers send some money to the alzheimers charity instead i hope jeremy will be able to come carolines in brussels i dont know if she can get away and hugh hugh will definitely not be coming were living separately now you might as well know that i see serves you both right i expect ok then thats it goodnight and jan put down the phone later that evening after the doctor had been and signed the death certificate death from natural causes and the undertaker had been in to take the body away and lay it out in his memorial chapel jan and cindy sat together and shared a bottle of good wine and some cheese they were both exhausted too tired to prepare a proper supper they agreed that cindy should go back to their house and jan would sleep there at her mothers so the long day ended at last the funeral took place the following friday as arranged it was a rainy afternoon and there were only a few people there jan and cindy of course jans boss dave he really did seem to like jan a couple of cindys friends kate and her son jeremy corrie she had insisted on coming when kate told her the news a few neighbours and giovanni and paolo from brighton jan and kate didnt speak to each other sarah had always said she didnt want to be buried in the earth she wanted to be cremated and she had told jan that she wanted her ashes to be scattered in the garden of her house where she had spent so many happy years before her husband died the crematorium felt a bit like a church but there was no religious ceremony sarah hadnt been a believer in any religion jan and cindy read some short poems and jan said a few words about her mother then as the recorded music played vaughan williams the lark ascending the coffin rolled smoothly towards the entrance of the oven disappeared inside and was swallowed by flames outside jan and cindy and kate stood and shook hands with the people who had come behind them smoke rose from a tall chimney please come back to our house for some refreshments said jan most people started to leave the crematorium but kate and jeremy waited for a moment i think wed better go said kate jeremy has to get back to cambridge and i should be getting home too ok then said jan i wasnt really expecting you to stay anyway ill let you know when the solicitor calls us for the reading of the will and she turned and walked away leaving them standing in the rain back at the house the guests were soon in conversation most of it was about sarah and how everyone had liked her even if she had become so strange in her old age they didnt stay too long and soon jan and cindy were left to clear up the plates and glasses giovanni seems like a nice young man said jan yes i like him a lot said cindy hes asked me out when all this is over what did you say said jan why yes of course im not that stupid mum of course youre not his dad was very lively too a very warm personality such a cheerful man and what about dave he seemed very worried about you is anything going on between you two come on cindy im fiftyfour years old and well past my best why should he be interested in me lets see about that said cindy with a smile the following week jan and kate met in the solicitors office the solicitor who had looked after the familys legal affairs for many years knew them both of course the will was in one of those long legal envelopes which he opened with a special silver paper knife the will wasnt a long document it must have been arranged by their father before he died sarah wouldnt have been able to do it herself although she had signed it the solicitor read it out aloud kate got the house in lewisham with all its contents jan got what was left of sarahs savings about as usual kate was the favourite daughter and jan got the leftovers jan and kate signed the documents and left without speaking to each other chapter eighteen things fall apart things come together only a few weeks after kate and hugh separated things started to go badly wrong for hugh he had moved into their small flat in london and kate hadnt spoken to him since their final argument and to make it worse jeremy and caroline had turned their backs on him too kate simply tried to get on with her life while the divorce was going through then one evening hugh called her his voice sounded strange as if hed been drinking and kate wondered how much hed had this time listen kate he said im in deep trouble everything has fallen apart clerides found out about melpa and me and took all his money out of the fund then he persuaded mazumdar to do the same when manningham found out he took his money out too the whole fund has collapsed and now the others are coming after me for the money they lent me i have nothing left even the house i had to offer it as security and now theyll take it away from us you what shouted kate you gambled with our house without telling me and now youve lost it what am i supposed to do now where am i supposed to live its all my fault i know said hugh i was a fool to borrow so much i thought it was safe but now now youre in a hole said kate in a hard voice and you dont know how to climb out of it so why come to me what do you expect me to do youve ruined my life too especially if they take the house my god i wish id never met you i cant think straight said hugh in his thick drunken voice and they may call in the police too there were some things i did look hugh i have enough to do to save what i can of my own stuff i cant get involved with yours too you made your choice now you can live with it dont bother me again understand and she put down the phone kate was a quickthinking realistic woman she realised that there was no hope of saving the house so she had all the contents packed and put into store then she and corrie moved into her mothers old house in lewisham jan only found out about this when they met in the local supermarket by chance one friday evening what are you doing here jan asked completely surprised by this unexpected meeting something happened i needed to move out of the house in marlow so ive moved into mothers place strange isnt it i never expected to find myself living here again but for once jan couldnt find any words she wanted to complain that kate couldnt just move in like that but of course she could the house was hers it wasnt jans business any more well i wouldnt have chosen to move back here but i had no choice hughs investment fund has collapsed and hes being chased by everyone who lent him money at least i have somewhere to live and actually the old house is really quite comfortable and theres plenty of space it needs to be repainted and modernised but its got lots of possibilities and the garden is still lovely yes the garden said jan i was going to contact you about that ive still got mothers ashes at home we need to arrange to scatter them in the garden thats what she wanted so when do you want to do that well i suppose now that youre there it will have to be at a time that suits you said jan well how about next weekend sunday afternoon is that ok ill need to invite a few people too cindy and giovanni her new boyfriend my boss dave corrie if shes with you what about your kids i dont think so jan but ill be there of course do you want corrie to prepare something to eat or anything that would be nice just some snacks and drinks will be enough dont go to too much trouble ok lets say four oclock on sunday afternoon then right ill tell the others and ill bring mothers ashes with me it was a perfect june day when they all gathered in the garden of sarahs house there was a light breeze jan took the heavy pot containing sarahs ashes and threw a handful in the air the breeze caught them and blew the white cloud across the grass and the flowers she handed the pot to kate who did the same then it was cindys turn they took turns until the pot was empty sarah had gone back to her garden just as she had wanted noone spoke for a while everyone was remembering sarah in their thoughts chapter nineteen forgive and forget six months after sarahs death things were finally settling down for cindy and for jan jan gave cindy some of the money from her mothers will cindy decided to use it to help pay for her training as a chiropodist so far she was doing well in her course and was expecting to qualify in about two years time after that she was hoping to open her own business she had got rid of her green hair and removed most but not quite all of the rings in various parts of her body after all the wasted years her life had suddenly improved shed found something she really liked doing shed also found someone to spend her free time with after the funeral shed started seeing a lot of giovanni they were planning to go on holiday to italy together later in the year after years of dull living with no hope of anything better jan had started living life fully again things were going well at work she was promoted and got a pay rise the money she got from sarahs will wasnt that much after shed given some to cindy but it was enough to give her some security at last she could afford to go out to eat in her favourite thai restaurants again and she could go to the cinema whenever she wanted she redecorated her house too and bought herself a small secondhand car best of all she could make new friends again and she began to see dave regularly as time passed jan began to feel that she could forgive what kate had done though she would never forget it she thought life was too short to go on hating someone forever and now that kate herself had suffered so much from her breakup with hugh and losing her home jan felt it was time to heal the wounds between them after the sunday when they scattered sarahs ashes they saw each other occasionally for coffee or lunch kate had changed a lot too she was more relaxed and less selfish so one sunday lunchtime they found themselves sitting again in jans small kitchen eating a roast chicken and drinking red wine a better bottle than the last time soon it would be christmas again and cindy had gone off to italy with giovanni they would be back for new year one evening cindy called jan from italy her voice sounded very excited mum can you guess giovannis asked me to marry him i cant say im surprised jan said laughing and what did you say i said yes of course hes lovely and i feel its the real thing this time well i hope youll be very happy together have you fixed a date yet no not yet he needs to talk to his dad first maybe the spring would be a good time or do you want to wait till after you finish your training i dont know theres so much to think about what about your love life mum has dave asked you yet well he took me out to dinner the other evening and yes he did ask me to marry him and what
