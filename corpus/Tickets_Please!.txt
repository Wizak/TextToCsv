tickets please there is in the north a singleline system of tramcars which boldly leaves the county town and plunges off into the black industrial countryside up hill and down dale through the long ugly villages of workmens houses over canals and railways past churches perched high and nobly over the smoke and shadows through dark grimy cold little marketplaces tilting away in a rush past cinemas and shops down to the hollow where the collieries are then up again past a little rural church under the ashtrees on in a bolt to the terminus the last little ugly place of industry the cold little town that shivers on the edge of the wild gloomy country beyond there the blue and creamy coloured tramcar seems to pause and purr with curious satisfaction but in a few minutesthe clock on the turret of the cooperative wholesale societys shops gives the timeaway it starts once more on the adventure again there are the reckless swoops downhill bouncing the loops again the chilly wait in the hilltop marketplace again the breathless slithering round the precipitous drop under the church again the patient halts at the loops waiting for the outcoming car so on and on for two long hours till at last the city looms beyond the fat gasworks the narrow factories draw near we are in the sordid streets of the great town once more we sidle to a standstill at our terminus abashed by the great crimson and creamcoloured city cars but still jerky jaunty somewhat daredevil pert as a bluetit out of a black colliery garden to ride on these cars is always an adventure the drivers are often men unfit for active service cripples and hunchbacks so they have the spirit of the devil in them the ride becomes a steeplechase hurrah we have leapt in a clean jump over the canal bridgesnow for the fourlane corner with a shriek and a trail of sparks we are clear again to be sure a tram often leaps the railsbut what matter it sits in a ditch till other trams come to haul it out it is quite common for a car packed with one solid mass of living people to come to a dead halt in the midst of unbroken blackness the heart of nowhere on a dark night and for the driver and the girlconductor to call all get offcars on fire instead of rushing out in a panic the passengers stolidly reply get onget on were not coming out were stopping where we are push on george so till flames actually appear the reason for this reluctance to dismount is that the nights are howlingly cold black and windswept and a car is a haven of refuge from village to village the miners travel for a change of cinema of girl of pub the trams are desperately packed who is going to risk himself in the black gulf outside to wait perhaps an hour for another tram then to see the forlorn notice depot onlybecause there is something wrong or to greet a unit of three bright cars all so tight with people that they sail past with a howl of derision trams that pass in the night this the most dangerous tramservice in england as the authorities themselves declare with pride is entirely conducted by girls and driven by rash young men or else by invalids who creep forward in terror the girls are fearless young hussies in their ugly blue uniforms skirts up to their knees shapeless old peaked caps on their heads they have all the sangfroid of an old noncommissioned officer with a tram packed with howling colliers roaring hymns downstairs and a sort of antiphony of obscenities upstairs the lasses are perfectly at their ease they pounce on the youths who try to evade their ticketmachine they push off the men at the end of their distance they are not going to be done in the eyenot they they fear nobodyand everybody fears them halloa annie halloa ted oh mind my corn miss stone its my belief youve got a heart of stone for youve trod on it again you should keep it in your pocket replies miss stone and she goes sturdily upstairs in her high boots tickets please she is peremptory suspicious and ready to hit first she can hold her own against ten thousand therefore there is a certain wild romance aboard these carsand in the sturdy bosom of annie herself the romantic time is in the morning between ten oclock and one when things are rather slack that is except marketday and saturday then annie has time to look about her then she often hops off her car and into a shop where she has spied something while her driver chats in the main road there is very good feeling between the girls and the drivers are they not companions in peril shipmates aboard this careering vessel of a tramcar for ever rocking on the waves of a hilly land then also in the easy hours the inspectors are most in evidence for some reason everybody employed in this tramservice is young there are no grey heads it would not do therefore the inspectors are of the right age and one the chief is also goodlooking see him stand on a wet gloomy morning in his long oilskin his peaked cap well down over his eyes waiting to board a car his face is ruddy his small brown moustache is weathered he has a faint impudent smile fairly tall and agile even in his waterproof he springs aboard a car and greets annie halloa annie keeping the wet out trying to there are only two people in the car inspecting is soon over then for a long and impudent chat on the footboarda good easy twelvemile chat the inspectors name is john joseph raynor always called john joseph his face sets in fury when he is addressed from a distance with this abbreviation there is considerable scandal about john joseph in halfadozen villages he flirts with the girlconductors in the morning and walks out with them in the dark night when they leave their tramcar at the depot of course the girls quit the service frequently then he flirts and walks out with a newcomer always providing she is sufficiently attractive and that she will consent to walk it is remarkable however that most of the girls are quite comely they are all young and this roving life aboard the car gives them a sailors dash and recklessness what matter how they behave when the ship is in port tomorrow they will be aboard again annie however was something of a tartar and her sharp tongue had kept john joseph at arms length for many months perhaps therefore she liked him all the more for he always came up smiling with impudence she watched him vanquish one girl then another she could tell by the movement of his mouth and eyes when he flirted with her in the morning that he had been walking out with this lass or the other the night before she could sum him up pretty well in their subtle antagonism they knew each other like old friends they were as shrewd with one another almost as man and wife but annie had always kept him fully at arms length besides she had a boy of her own the statutes fair however came in november at middleton it happened that annie had the monday night off it was a drizzling ugly night yet she dressed herself up and went to the fairground she was alone but she expected soon to find a pal of some sort the roundabouts were veering round and grinding out their music the sideshows were making as much commotion as possible in the coconut shies there were no coconuts but artificial substitutes which the lads declared were fastened into the irons there was a sad decline in brilliance and luxury none the less the ground was muddy as ever there was the same crush the press of faces lighted up by the flares and the electric lights the same smell of naphtha and fried potatoes and electricity who should be the first to greet miss annie on the showground but john joseph he had a black overcoat buttoned up to his chin and a tweed cap pulled down over his brows his face between was ruddy and smiling and hardy as ever she knew so well the way his mouth moved she was very glad to have a boy to be at the statutes without a fellow was no fun instantly like the gallant he was he took her on the dragons grimtoothed roundabout switchbacks it was not nearly so exciting as a tramcar actually but then to be seated in a shaking green dragon uplifted above the sea of bubble faces careering in a rickety fashion in the lower heavens whilst john joseph leaned over her his cigarette in his mouth was after all the right style she was a plump quick alive little creature so she was quite excited and happy john joseph made her stay on for the next round and therefore she could hardly for shame to repulse him when he put his arm round her and drew her a little nearer to him in a very warm and cuddly manner besides he was fairly discreet he kept his movement as hidden as possible she looked down and saw that his red clean hand was out of sight of the crowd and they knew each other so well so they warmed up to the fair after the dragons they went on the horses john joseph paid each time she could but be complaisant he of course sat astride on the outer horsenamed black bessand she sat sideways towards him on the inner horsenamed wildfire but of course john joseph was not going to sit discreetly on black bess holding the brass bar round they spun and heaved in the light and round he swung on his wooden steed flinging one leg across her mount and perilously tipping up and down across the space halflying back laughing at her he was perfectly happy she was afraid her hat was on one side but she was excited he threw quoits on a table and won her two large paleblue hatpins and then hearing the noise of the cinema announcing another performance they climbed the boards and went in of course during these performances pitch darkness falls from time to time when the machine goes wrong then there is a wild whooping and a loud smacking of simulated kisses in these moments john joseph drew annie towards him after all he had a wonderfully warm cosy way of holding a girl with his arm he seemed to make such a nice fit and after all it was pleasant to be so held so very comforting and cosy and nice he leaned over her and she felt his breath on her hair she knew he wanted to kiss her on the lips and after all he was so warm and she fitted in to him so softly after all she wanted him to touch her lips but the light sprang up she also started electrically and put her hat straight he left his arm lying nonchalant behind her well it was fun it was exciting to be at the statutes with john joseph when the cinema was over they went for a walk across the dark damp fields he had all the arts of lovemaking he was especially good at holding a girl when he sat with her on a stile in the black drizzling darkness he seemed to be holding her in space against his own warmth and gratification and his kisses were soft and slow and searching so annie walked out with john joseph though she kept her own boy dangling in the distance some of the tramgirls chose to be huffy but there you must take things as you find them in this life there was no mistake about it annie liked john joseph a good deal she felt so pleasant and warm in herself whenever he was near and john joseph really liked annie more than usual the soft melting way in which she could flow into a fellow as if she melted into his very bones was something rare and gratifying he fully appreciated this but with a developing acquaintance there began a developing intimacy annie wanted to consider him a person a man she wanted to take an intelligent interest in him and to have an intelligent response she did not want a mere nocturnal presence which was what he was so far and she prided herself that he could not leave her here she made a mistake john joseph intended to remain a nocturnal presence he had no idea of becoming an allround individual to her when she started to take an intelligent interest in him and his life and his character he sheered off he hated intelligent interest and he knew that the only way to stop it was to avoid it the possessive female was aroused in annie so he left her it was no use saying she was not surprised she was at first startled thrown out of her count for she had been so very sure of holding him for a while she was staggered and everything became uncertain to her then she wept with fury indignation desolation and misery then she had a spasm of despair and then when he came still impudently on to her car still familiar but letting her see by the movement of his eyes that he had gone away to somebody else for the time being and was enjoying pastures new then she determined to have her own back she had a very shrewd idea what girls john joseph had taken out she went to nora purdy nora was a tall rather pale but wellbuilt girl with beautiful yellow hair she was somewhat secretive hey said annie accosting her then softly whos john joseph on with now i dont know said nora why tha does said annie ironically lapsing into dialect tha knows as well as i do well i do then said nora it isnt me so dont bother its cissy meakin isnt it it is for all i know hasnt he got a face on him said annie i dont half like his cheek i could knock him off the footboard when he comes round me hell get dropped on one of these days said nora ay he will when somebody makes up their mind to drop it on him i should like to see him taken down a peg or two shouldnt you i shouldnt mind said nora youve got quite as much cause to as i have said annie but well drop on him one of these days my girl what dont you want to i dont mind said nora but as a matter of fact nora was much more vindictive than annie one by one annie went the round of the old flames it so happened that cissy meakin left the tramway service in quite a short time her mother made her leave then john joseph was on the qui vive he cast his eyes over his old flock and his eyes lighted on annie he thought she would be safe now besides he liked her she arranged to walk home with him on sunday night it so happened that her car would be in the depot at halfpast nine the last car would come in at tenfifteen so john joseph was to wait for her there at the depot the girls had a little waitingroom of their own it was quite rough but cosy with a fire and an oven and a mirror and table and wooden chairs the halfdozen girls who knew john joseph only too well had arranged to take service this sunday afternoon so as the cars began to come in early the girls dropped into the waitingroom and instead of hurrying off home they sat round the fire and had a cup of tea john joseph came on the car after annie at about a quarter to ten he poked his head easily into the girls waitingroom prayer meeting he asked ay said laura sharp ladies effort thats me said john joseph it was one of his favourite exclamations shut the door boy said muriel baggaley on which side of me said john joseph which tha likes said polly birken he had come in and closed the door behind him the girls moved in their circle to make a place for him near the fire he took off his greatcoat and pushed back his hat who handles the teapot he said nora silently poured him out a cup of tea want a bit o my bread and dripping said muriel baggaley to him ay alls welcome and he began to eat his piece of bread theres no place like home girls he said they all looked at him as he uttered this piece of impudence he seemed to be sunning himself in the presence of so many damsels especially if youre not afraid to go home in the dark said laura sharp me by myself i am they sat till they heard the last tram come in in a few minutes emma housely entered come on my old duck cried polly birkin it is perishing said emma holding her fingers to the fire but im afraid to go home in the dark sang laura sharp the tune having got into her mind whore you going with tonight mr raynor asked muriel baggaley coolly tonight said john joseph oh im going home by myself tonightall on my lonelyo thats me said nora purdy using his own ejaculation the girls laughed shrilly me as well nora said john joseph dont know what you mean said laura yes im toddling said he rising and reaching for his coat nay said polly were all here waiting for you weve got to be up in good time in the morning he said in the benevolent official manner they all laughed nay said muriel dont disappoint us all ill take the lot if you like he responded gallantly that you wont either said muriel twos company sevens too much of a good thing nay take one said laura fair and square all above board say which one ay cried annie speaking for the first time choose john josephlets hear thee nay he said im going home quiet tonight he frowned at the use of his double name who says said annie thas got to tae one nay how can i take one he said laughing uneasily i dont want to make enemies youd only make one said annie grimly the chosen one said laura a laugh went up oh ay who said girls exclaimed john joseph again turning as if to escape well goodnight nay youve got to take one said muriel turn your face to the wall and say which one touches you go onwe shall only just touch your backone of us go onturn your face to the wall and dont look and say which one touches you they pushed him to a wall and stood him there with his face to it behind his back they all grimaced tittering he looked so comical go on he cried youre lookingyoure looking they shouted he turned his head away and suddenly with a movement like a swift cat annie went forward and fetched him a box on the side of the head that sent his cap flying he started round but at annies signal they all flew at him slapping him pinching him pulling his hair though more in fun than in spite or anger he however saw red his blue eyes flamed with strange fear as well as fury and he butted through the girls to the door it was locked he wrenched at it roused alert the girls stood round and looked at him he faced them at bay at that moment they were rather horrifying to him as they stood in their short uniforms he became suddenly pale come on john joseph come on choose said annie what are you after open the door he said we shantnot till youve chosen said muriel chosen what he said chosen the one youre to marry she replied the girls stood back in a silent attentive group he hesitated a moment open the confounded door he said and get back to your senses he spoke with official authority youve got to choose cried the girls he hung a moment then he went suddenly red and his eyes flashed come on come on cried annie he went forward threatening she had taken off her belt and swinging it she fetched him a sharp blow over the head with the buckle end he rushed with lifted hand but immediately the other girls flew at him pulling him and pushing and beating him their blood was now up he was their sport now they were going to have their own back out of him strange wild creatures they hung on him and rushed at him to bear him down his tunic was torn right up the back nora had hold at the back of his collar and was actually strangling him luckily the buttonhole burst he struggled in a wild frenzy of fury and terror almost mad terror his tunic was torn off his back as they dragged him his shirtsleeves were torn away one arm was naked the girls simply rushed at him clenched their hands and pulled at him or they rushed at him and pushed him butted him with all their might at last he was down they rushed him kneeling on him he had neither breath nor strength to move his face was bleeding with a long scratch annie knelt on him the other girls knelt and hung on to him their faces were flushed their hair wild their eyes were all glittering strangely he lay at last quite still with face averted as an animal lies when it is defeated and at the mercy of the captor sometimes his eye glanced back at the wild faces of the girls his breast rose heavily his wrists were scratched and bleeding now then my fellow gasped annie at length now thennow at the sound of her terrifying cold triumph he suddenly started to struggle as an animal might but the girls threw themselves upon him with unnatural strength and power forcing him down yesnow then gasped annie at length and there was a dead silence in which the thud of heartbeating was to be heard it was a suspense of pure silence in every soul now you know where you are said annie the sight of his white bare arm maddened the girls he lay in a kind of trance of fear and antagonism they felt themselves filled with supernatural strength suddenly polly started to laughto giggle wildlyhelplessly and emma and muriel joined in but annie and nora and laura remained the same tense watchful with gleaming eyes he winced away from these eyes yes said annie recovering her senses a little yes you may well lie there you know what youve done dont you you know what youve done he made no sound nor sign but lay with bright averted eyes and averted bleeding face you ought to be killed thats what you ought said annie tensely polly was ceasing to laugh and giving longdrawn ohhhs and sighs as she came to herself hes got to choose she said vaguely yes he has said laura with vindictive decision do you heardo you hear said annie and with a sharp movement that made him wince he turned his face to her do you hear she repeated shaking him but he was dumb she fetched him a sharp slap on the face he started and his eyes widened do you hear she repeated what he said bewildered almost overcome youve got to choose she cried as if it were some terrible menace what he said in fear choose which of us youll have do you hear and stop your little games well settle you there was a pause again he averted his face he was cunning in his overthrow all right then he said i choose annie three cheers for annie cried laura me cried annie her face was very white her eyes like coal me then she got up pushing him away from her with a strange disgust i wouldnt touch him she said the other girls rose also he remained lying on the floor i dont want himhe can choose another said annie with the same rather bitter disgust get up said polly lifting his shoulder get up he rose slowly a strange ragged dazed creature the girls eyed him from a distance curiously furtively dangerously who wants him cried laura roughly nobody they answered with derision and they began to put themselves tidy taking down their hair and arranging it annie unlocked the door john joseph looked round for his things he picked up the tatters and did not quite know what to do with them then he found his cap and put it on and then his overcoat he rolled his ragged tunic into a bundle and he went silently out of the room into the night the girls continued in silence to dress their hair and adjust their clothing as if he had never existed
