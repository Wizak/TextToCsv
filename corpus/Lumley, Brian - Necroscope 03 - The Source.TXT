lumley necroscope the source the source by brian lumley book of the necroscope series epilogue simonov the agent lay on a patch of snow in a jumble of white boulders on the eastern crest of what had once been the perchorsk pass in the miduralskiy khrebet he gazed down through nitelite binoculars on almost two acres of curved silverygrey surface covering the floor of the ravine by the light of the moon that surface might easily be mistaken for ice but mikhail simonov knew that it was no glacier or frozen river it was a mass of metal some four hundred feet long by something less than two hundred wide along the irregular edges of its length where its gently curving dome met the rocky walls of the gorge and at both ends where the arcing metal came up flush against massive concrete barriers or dams the stuff was only six inches thick but at its centre the moulded mass was all of twentyfour inches through that was what had registered on the instruments of the american spysatellites anyway and also the fact that this was the biggest manmade accumulation of lead anywhere in the world it was like looking down on the threequartersburied leadwrapped neck of some giant bottle thought mikhail simonov a magic bottle except that in this case the cork had already been pulled and the genie flown and simonov was here to discover the nature of that very dubious fugitive he gave a quiet snort pushed his flight of fancy to the back of his mind focused his eyes and concentrated his attention on the scene below the bottom of the ravine had been a watercourse subject to severe seasonal flooding upriver above the wet dam wall an artificial lake was now full its surface flat and likewise leaden but only its surface channelled under the great roof of lead through unseen sluices the water reappeared in four great shining spouts issuing from conduits in the lower wall spray rose up from that deluge froze fell or drifted back to coat the lower ravine in snow and ice where for all the apparent volume of water only a stream now followed the ancient course under the shield of lead four great turbines lay idle bypassed by the hurtling waters bled off from the lake theyd been at rest like that for two years now since the day the russians had tested their weapon for the first and the last time despite all the ussrs technological camouflaging countermeasures that test too had been seen by the american spysatellites what exactly they saw had never been made public or even hinted at outside of higherechelon and correspondingly lowprofile government departments but it had been sufficient to jolt americas sdi or star wars concept into real being in very small very powerful and highly secretive defence circles throughout the western world there had been worried discussions about apb shields about nuclear or plasmapowered lasers even about something called a magma motor which might theoretically tap the energy of the small black hole believed by some scientists to lie at earths core simultaneously feeding upon and fuelling the planet but all such discussions had been purely conjectural certainly nothing substantial other than the evidence provided by the satellites had leaked out of russia herself nothing that is in the way of normal intelligence reporting no for the ural mountains in the region of perchorsk had been for some time far more securitysensitive than even the baikonur space centre in the days of the sputniks and it was a sensitivity which in the aftermath of that single frightful test had suddenly increased fourfold simonov shivered in his white furlined anorak carefully demisted his binoculars flattened himself more rigidly to the frozen ground between the boulders as scudding clouds parted and a nearly full moon blazed treacherously down on him it was cold in the socalled summer up here but in the late autumn it was a kind of frozen hell it was autumn now with a bit of luck simonov would escape suffering through another winter no he mentally corrected himself that would take a lot of luck a hell of a lot the scene below turned silver in the flooding moonlight but the special lenses of simonovs binoculars made automatic adjustment now he turned those lenses on the pass proper or what had been the pass until the perchorsk projekt had got underway some five years ago here on the eastern side of the ravine the pass had been eroded through the mountains flank by one of the sources of the sosva river on its way down to berezov on the western side it had been dynamited through a deep saddle falling steeply from the mountains its road roughly paralleled the course of the kama river for two hundred and fifty miles to berezniki and perm on the kirovsverdlovsk rail link in the forty years prior to the projekt the pass had been used chiefly by loggers trappers and prospectors and for the transportation of agricultural implements and produce both ways across the range in those days its narrow road had been literally carved and blasted from the solid rock and so it had remained until recently a rough and ready route through the mountains but the perchorsk projekt had brought about drastic changes with the construction of the zapadno rail link to serinskaja in the east and the extension of the railway from ukhta to vorkuta in the north the high pass had long since fallen out of favour as a route through the mountains it had only remained important to a handful of local farmers and the like whose livelihoods hardly mattered in the greater scheme of things they had simply been relocated that had taken place four and a half years ago then with all the speed ingenuity and muscle that a superpower can muster the pass had been reopened widened improved and given a twolane system of good metalled roads but not as a public highway and certainly not for the use of the farscattered local communities indeed their use of the pass had been strictly forbidden in all the project had taken almost three years to complete during which time the soviet intelligence services had leaked innocuous details of a pass in the urals which is undergoing repair and improvement that had been the official line to forestall or confuse the piecing together of the true picture as seen by the usa from space and if additional proofs of the innocence of the perchorsk projekt were required it could also be seen that gas and oil pipelines had been laid in the pass between ukhta and the ob gasfields what the russians couldnt conceal or misrepresent was the construction of dams and the movement of heavy machinery the incredibly massive lead shield built up in layers over the erstwhile bed of a powerful ravine torrent and perhaps most important the gradual buildup of troop movement into the area to a permanent military presence there had been a deal of blasting excavation and tunnelling too with many thousands of tons of rock moved out by truck or simply dumped into local ravines plus the installation of large quantities of sophisticated electrical equipment and other apparatus most of which had been seen from space and all of which had intrigued and irritated the wests intelligence and security services almost unendurably as usual the soviets were making life very difficult whatever they were up to they were doing it in an almost inaccessible steepsided ravine nine hundred feet deep which meant that a satellite had to be almost directly overhead to get anything at all conjecture in the west had gone on unabated the alternatives were many perhaps the russians were attempting to carry out a covert mining operation it could be that theyd discovered large deposits of highgrade uranium ore in the urals on the other hand maybe they were concerned with the construction of experimental nuclear installations under the very mountains themselves or could it be that they were building and making ready to test something quite new and radically different as it happened when it happened at that time just two years ago advocates of the third alternative were seen to have guessed correctly once again mikhail simonov was drawn back to the present this time by the low rumble of dieselengined transports that echoed up hollowly from the gorge to drown out the winds thin keening just as the moon slipped back behind the clouds so the headlight beams of a convoy of lumbering trucks cut a swath of white light in the darkness where they stabbed out from the gash of the pass in the deep v of the western saddle the huge squarelooking trucks were just under a mile away across the ravine and some five hundred feet below the level of simonovs vantage point but still he flattened himself more yet and squirmed back a little into his nest of gaunt boulders it was a controlled automatic almost instinctive reaction to possible danger in no way a panicked retreat simonov had been very well trained with no expense spared as the convoy came through the pass and turned its nose down the steeply descending ramp of a road cut from the face of the ravine so a battery of spotlights burst into brilliant life shining down from the sheer wall and lending the wellgritted road excellent illumination fascinated simonov listened to the great diesels snarling into low gear watched the routine of a wellorganized reception without taking the nitelites from his eyes he reached into a pocket and drew out a tiny camera snapping it into position in the lower casing of the binoculars then he pressed a button on the camera and continued watching whatever he saw would now be recorded automatically one frame every six seconds for a total of four and a half minutes fortyfive tiny stills of nearcrystal clarity not that he expected to see anything of any real importance he already knew what the trucks contained and the camera shots were simply to certify that this was indeed their destination for the satisfaction of others back in the west four trucks one of them containing all the makings of a tenfoot electrified fence two more carrying the component parts and ammo for three twinmounted armourpiercing mm katushev cannons and the fourth and last loaded with a battery of dieselpowered generators no what was being hauled wasnt the question the question was this if the russians were going to defend the perchorsk projekt who were they defending it against whoor what simonovs camera clicked away almost inaudibly his eyes took in all that was happening below he was aware that he mustnt stay here more than another ten or fifteen minutes at the most because of the high radiation count but part of his mind was already somewhere else it was back in london just two months short of two years ago shooting the arrival of the trucks had done it set simonovs mind working on that other film hed been shown by m and the americans in london a real film however short and not just stills he relaxed just a traction he was doing all that was expected of him could afford a little mental meandering and actually once youd seen that film it was difficult not to keep going back to it the film was of something that had happened just seven weeks after the perchorsk incident and had earned itself the acronym pi ii or pill but it had been one hell of a pill to swallow it had come about like this early morning of a bright midoctober day along the eastern seaboard of the usa but along the obsolete canadian dewline things have been stirring for some three hours since a pair of spysats with overlapping windows on the barents and kara seas and from arkhangelsk across the urals to igarka flashed intruder reports down across the pole to listeners in canada and the usaf bases in maine and new hampshire washington has been informed and lowkey alert status has already been notified to the missile bases in greenland and the foxe peninsula base on baffin island other dewline subscribers have been notified great britain has shown mild interest and asked for updates denmark is typically nervous iceland has shrugged and france has failed to acknowledge but now things begin to speed up a little the original spiesinthesky have lost the intruder out of their windows but at the same time its been picked up by dewline proper crossing the arctic circle on a somewhat irregular course but generally in the direction of queen elizabeth island whats more the russians have scrambled a pair of mig interceptors from their military airfield in kirovsk south of murmansk norway and sweden join denmark in an attack of the jitters the usa is hugely curious but not yet narroweyed but nevertheless an awacs reconnaissance aircraft has been diverted from routine duties to a line of interception and two fighters are scrambled up from a strip near fort fairfield maine it is now four hours since the ufo was first sighted over novaya zemlya and so far it has covered a little more than nine hundred miles having passed west of franz josef land on what now seems a beeline for ellesmere island which is where the migs draw level with it except that doesnt quite show the whole picture geographically theyve caught up with it but theyre at max headroom and the ufo is two miles higher thenapparently they see it and at the same time it sees them what happens then isnt known for a certainty for the kirovsk base has ordered radio silence but on the basis of what will be seen to happen later we can take a broad stab at it the object descends puts on speed attacks the migs probably open fire on it in the seconds before they are reduced to so much confetti their debris is lost in snow and ice some six hundred miles from the pole and a like distance short of ellesmere and now the intruder really is intruding its speed has accelerated to around three hundred and fifty miles per hour and its course is straight as an arrow the awacs has reported the migs lost from its screens presumed down but a hotline call from washington to moscow fails to produce anything but the usual ambiguities what migs what intruder the usa is a little peeved this aircraft came out of your airspace into ours it has no right being there if it sticks to its present course it will be intercepted forced to land if it fails to comply or acts in any way hostile theres a chance it will be shot down destroyed and unexpectedly good from the russians whatever it is you have on your screens it is nothing of ours we renounce it utterly do with it as you see fit far more detailed norwegian reports are now in from the hammerfest listening station the object is believed to originate from a region in the urals near labytnangi right on the arctic circle give or take a hundred miles or so if they had given or taken three hundred miles south then the reports would have been more nearly correct for the perchorsk pass was just that far away from the source theyd quoted alas in the other direction north of labytnangi lay vorkuta the ussrs most northerly missile site supplied by rail from ukhta and now the americans go from mildly irritated to extremely narroweyed just what in hell are the reds up to have they loosed some sort of experimental missile from vorkuta and lost it if so does it have a warhead how many warheads alert classifications go up two notches and moscow comes under fire in some very heated hotline exchanges still the soviets deny all knowledge however nervously better clearer reports are coming in we now have the thing on satellite on ground radar on awacs no physical human sightings as yet but everything else the spysats say it could be a dense flock of birds but what sort of birds fly in excess of three hundred mph five miles high across the arctic circle collision with birds could have taken out the migs of course butthe topsecret hightech radar sites along the older dewline say its either a large airplane ora spaceplatform fallen out of orbit also that its impossibly low on metal content namely it doesnt have any but intelligence wont admit of any aircraft two hundred and some feet long and constructed of canvas awacs says that the thing is flying in a series of spurts or jets like some vast aerial octopus and awacs is more or less right it is now one hour since the american interceptors scrambled flying at close to mach ii they have crossed the hudson bay from the belcher islands to a point about two hundred miles north of churchill in so doing theyve just overtaken the awacs and left it a few minutes behind the awacs has told them that their target is dead ahead and that hes come down to feet and now finally just like the migs before them they spot the intruder that had been the narrative the scenario that the cia and mi had set for simonov before showing him the awacs film and as the briefing officer had spoken those last three words spot the intruder so the film had started to roll all very dramatic and deservedly so spot the intruder thought simonov now the words bitter on his tongue so that he almost spat them out loud by god yes for that was the name of the game wasnt it in security intelligence spying spot the intruder and all sides playing it expertly some a little better than others right here and now he was the intruder michael j simmons alias mikhail simonov except he hadnt been spotted yet then as he redirected all of his concentration back down onto the scene in the ravine he sensed or heard something that didnt belong from somewhere behind and below him had come the chink of a dislodged pebble then lesser clatterings as the tumbling stone picked up smaller cousins on its way down the side of the mountain the last leg of the climb had been along a steep terraced ridge of rock more a scramble than a real climb and there had been plenty of loose scree and stony debris littered about it could be that in his passing hed left a pebble precariously balanced on some ledge and that a strong gust had dislodged it simonov fancied that was all there was to it but what if it was something else hed had this feeling recently a sort of uneasy halfformed suspicion that someone somehow was aware of him someone hed rather was not aware of him he supposed this was a feeling spies learned to live with maybe it was just that everything had seemed to be going so smoothly so that now hed started to invent difficulties he hoped that was all it was but just to be sure without looking back or changing his position he unzipped his anorak reached inside and came out with a blocky wickedlooking shortbarrelled automatic its stubby silencer already attached he checked the magazine and silently eased it up again into the grip and all of this done onehanded with practiced ease without pausing in the filming of the trucks in the ravine maybe the last couple of frames would be a bit offcentre no big deal simonov was satisfied with what hed got the tiny camera attached to simonovs nitelites clicked one last time and gave a warning whir signalling that the sequence was complete he undipped the camera and put it away then he wedged his binoculars securely in the base of a boulder carefully cocked his pistol squirmed aboutface and got to his knees still concealed he peered cautiously through the v formed where the tops of two rounded boulders leaned together nothing back there nothing he could see anyway steep cliffs falling away for a thousand feet with spurs extending here and there and thinlydrifted snow lying white and gleaming on all flat surfaces and way down there obscured by the night the treeline and gentling lower slopes everything motionless and monochrome in dim starshine and occasional moonlight where only the thin wind scattered little flurries of snow from the spurs and high ledges there were plenty of places where men could hide themselves of course no one knew that better than simonov himself an expert in concealment but on the other hand if hed been followed why would they want to come up here easier to wait for him below surely yet still the feeling persisted that he was not alone that feeling which had grown in him increasingly over his last two or three visits to this place this place this spawning ground for utterly alien monsters he got back down into his original position recovered the nitelites and brought them to his eyes in the ravine where the steep road hugged the face of the defile down to the towering twin walls of the dam and the curved lead surface between them a cavernous opening in the cliff blazed with light the last truck turned left off the road onto a level staging area then passed in through huge wheeled steelframed lead doors a gang of yellowclad traffic controllers flagged the truck rumblingly inside and out of sight then followed it into the blaze of illumination under the cliff other men came hurrying down the road gathering up flashing beacons the great doors had clanged shut by the time they reached them but a wicketgate thick as the door of a vault had been left open issuing a square beam of yellow light it swallowed up the men with the traffic beacons then was closed the floodlights over the pass snapped out and left stark blackness in their wake only the dammed watercourse and the great lead shield were left to reflect the starshine but all of that lead down there and these poisoned heights a little more than mildly radioactive and that thing filmed by the awacs as it did battle with the usaf jet fighters simonov couldnt suppress a small shudder which this time wasnt due to the intense cold he folded his nitelites into a flat leathercased shape which he slipped inside his anorak with the strap still round his neck then for a moment longer he just lay there his eyes staring into the enigmatic gulf below his mind superimposing on the darkness the sequence of events hed witnessed in london recorded on that flickering awacs film but even remembering it he cringed away from it bad enough that he still occasionally saw it in his dreams but could thatthatwhatever it had been could it really have come from here a monstrous mutation a gigantic hideous warrior clone conjured in some crazed geneticists incredible experiment a biological weapon outside all of mans previous experience and understanding that was what he was here to find out or rather it was what he was here to prove conclusively that indeed this was where that thing had been born or made that seething pulsing writhing snow crunched softly compacted by a stealthy footfall simonov thrust himself to his feet turning as he rose and saw a head and staring eyes outlined briefly above the low jumble of rocks his automatic was in his hand as he launched himself into a dive to the left of the boulders his right arm outstretched ready to target his weapon a man in a pure white parka was crouched behind the boulders with a gun in his hand which he even now lifted to point at simonov in the instant before simonov came down on his side in the snow he snapped off two shots the first one struck the man in the shoulder snatching him upright and the second slammed into his chest flinging him backwards and down onto the patchy snow the dull phut phut of simonovs silenced weapon had caused no echoes but hed scarcely caught his breath when there came a hoarse gasping grunt from close at hand and silver glinted in a sudden flood of moonlight the snow on simonovs lefthand side not eighteen inches away erupted in a spray of frantic activity bastard a voice snarled in russian as a massive hand reached out to grasp simonovs hair and an iceaxe came arcing down its spike impaling his gunhand through the wrist and almost nailing it to the stony ground the russian had been lying in a snowfilled depression waiting now he sprawled forward trying to hurl his bulk on top of simonov the agent saw a dark face a white bar of snarling teeth framed in a beard and a ruff of white fur and drove his left elbow into it with as much force as he could muster teeth and bone crunched and the russian gave a gurgling shriek but he didnt release his grip on simonovs hair then cursing through blood and snot the massive soviet drew back his iceaxe for a second swipe simonov tried to bring his gun to bear useless there was no feeling in his hand which flopped like a speared fish the russian hunched over him dripped blood on him changed his grip to simonovs throat and drew back his axe menacingly karl came a voice from the shadows of other boulders we want him alive how much alive karl choked the words out spitting blood but in the next moment he dropped the axe and instead drove a fist hard as iron to simonovs forehead the spy went out like a light almost gladly a third russian figure came out of the night went to his knees beside simonovs prone form he felt the unconscious mans pulse said are you all right karl if so please see to boris i think this one put a couple of bullets into him think well i was closer than you and i can assure you he did karl growled gingerly touching his broken face with trembling fingertips he went to where boris lay spreadeagled dead the man on his knees beside simonov enquired his voice low as a side of beef karl grunted dead as that one should be he pointed an accusing finger at simonov hes killed boris messed up my face you should let me twist his fucking head off hardly original karl the other tuttutted he stood up he was tall this leader but slender as a rod even in his bulky parka his face was pale and thinlipped sardonic in the moonlight but his sunken eyes were bright as dark jewels his name was chingiz khuv and he was a major but in his specialized branch of the kgb the wearing of uniforms and the use of titles and rank were to be avoided anonymity increased productivity ensured longevity khuv forgot whod said that but he agreed wholeheartedly anonymity did both of those things but at the same time one must make sure it did not detract from authority hes an enemy isnt he karl growled oh yes hes that all right but hes only one and our enemies are many i agree it would be very satisfying to squeeze his throat and who knows but that youll get your chance but not until ive squeezed his brain i need attention karl held snow tenderly to his face so does he khuv nodded at simonov and so does poor boris he went back to his hiding place in the rocks and brought out a pocket radio extending its aerial he spoke into the mouthpiece saying zero this is khuv get the rescue chopper up here at once were a kilometer upriver from the projekt on top of the eastern ridge the pilot will see my torchover zero at once comrade out came back the answer tinny and with a touch of static khuv took out a heavyduty torch and switched it on stood it upright on the ground and packed snow around its base then he unzipped simonovs anorak and began to turn out his pockets there wasnt much the nitelites spare clips for the automatic russian cigarettes the slightly crumpled photograph of a slim peasant girl sitting in a field of daisies a pencil and tiny pad of paper half a dozen loose matches an official soviet citizens id and a curved strip of rubber half an inch thick by two inches long khuv stared at the block of black rubber for long moments it had indentations that looked like teeth marks khuv nodded eh karl mumbled he had come to see what khuv was doing he spoke through a handful of bloody snow with which he staunched the wounds to his nose and lips what did you say teeth marks khuv showed him the rubber its a makeshift gumshield he informed id guess he puts it in at night to keep from grinding his teeth they got down on their knees beside simonov where karl could work on his jaws the unconscious man groaned and twitched a little but finally succumbed to the pressure of the russians huge hands karl forced his mouth wide open said theres a pencil torch in my top pocket khuv fumbled the torch out of the others pocket shone it into simonovs mouth lower left at the back second forward from the wisdom tooth there it was a capped tooth at first glance but on closer inspection a hollow tooth containing a tiny cylinder part of the enamel had worn away showing bright metal underneath cyanide karl wondered no theyve got a lot better stuff than that these days khuv answered instantaneous totally painless wed better get it out before he wakes up you never know he might just want to be a hero turn his face leftside down on the ground karl grunted he had put both simonovs and boriss guns in a huge pocket now he took them out and used the butt of simonovs weapon as a wedge between his jaws his dead comrades gun had a barrel that was long and slender this is not going to hurt me more than it hurts him karl grunted i think boris would like it that im using his gun what khuv almost shouted youd shoot it out youll ruin his face and the shock might kill him i would love to shoot it out karl answered but that isnt my intention he poised the heel of his free hand over the weapons butt khuv looked away this part of it was for such as karl khuv liked to think he stood a little above sheer animal brutality he looked out over the rim of the ridge gritted his own teeth in a sort of morbid empathy as he heard karls hammer hand come down with a smack on the butt of the gun and there said karl with some satisfaction done in fact hed got two teeth whole the one with the cylinder and its neighbour now he used a grimy finger to hook them out of simonovs bloody mouth all done karl said again and i didnt break the cylinder see the caps still secure on the top he was just about to wake up i think but that bit of additional pain should keep him under well done said khuv with a small shudder pack some snow in his mouth but not too much he inclined his head added here they come dim artificial light washed up from the gorge like the pulse of a far false dawn it brightened rapidly with it came the slicing whup whup whup of a helicopters rotors jazz simmons was falling falling falling hed been on top of a mountain and had somehow fallen off it was a very high mountain and it was taking him a long time to hit the bottom indeed hed been falling for so long that the motion now seemed like floating floating in air frogshaped freefalling like an expert parachutist waiting for the right moment to open his chute except jazz had no chute also he must have hit his face on something as he fell for his mouth was full of blood nausea and vomiting woke him up from nightmare to nightmarish reality he was falling in the next moment remembering everything the thought flashed through his mind god theyve tossed me into the ravine but he wasnt falling only floating at least that part of his dream was real and now as his brain got in gear and shock receded a little so he felt the tight grip of his harness and the downdraft of the helicopters great fan overhead he craned his neck and twisted his body and somehow managed to look up way up there a chopper its spotlights probing the depths of the ravine but directly overhead directly overhead a dead man twirled slowly on a second line a hook through his belt his arms and legs loosely dangling his dead eyes were open and each time he came round they stared into jazzs eyes from the splashes of crimson on his white parka jazz supposed it was the man hed shot then shock returned with a vengeance weightlessness and vertigo and cold blasting air and noise combining to put him down a second time the last thing he remembered as he fell into another ravine the nightblack pit of merciful oblivion was to wonder why his mouth was full of blood and what had happened to his teeth mere moments after hed passed out the helicopter lowered him to the flat top of the upper dam wall and yellowjacketed men removed him and his harness complete from his hook they took boris dudko down too a heroic son of mother russia after thattheir handling of jazz simmons wasnt too gentle but he neither knew nor cared nor did he know that he was about to experience the dream of every intelligence boss in the western world he was about to be taken inside the perchorsk projekt getting out again would be a different thing entirely debrief though lengthy the debriefing was the very gentlest affair nothing nearly so cold and clinical as simmons had imagined this sort of interrogation would be of course in his case it had to be gentle for hed been close to death when his friends had smuggled him out of the ussr that had been several weeks ago or so they told him and it seemed he was a bit of a mess even now gentle yes but on occasion irritating too especially the way his debriefing officer had insisted on calling him mike when he must surely have known that simmons had only ever answered to michael or jazz and in russia of course to mikhail but that was a very small grievance compared to his freedom and the fact that he was still alive of his time as a prisoner hed remembered very little virtually nothing security suspected hed been brainwashed told to forget but in any case they hadnt wasted too much time on that side of it the important thing had been his work what hed achieved perhaps at one time the reds had intended to keep him maybe even try to reprogramme him as a double agent but then theyd changed their minds ditched him tossed his drugged battered body into the outlet basin under the dam hed been picked up five miles downriver from perchorsk floating on his back in calm waters but gradually drifting toward falls which must surely have killed him if that had happenednothing remarkable about it a logger and sparetime prospector one mikhail simonov falls in a river is exhausted by the cold and drowns an accident which could happen to anyone he wasnt the first and wouldnt be the last the west could make up its own mind about the truth of it if they ever found out about it at all but simmons hadnt drowned sympathetic people had been out looking for him ever since his failure to return to the logging camp theyd found him cared for him given him into the hands of agents whod got him out through an escape route tried and true and jazz himself remembering only the scantiest details of it brief blurry snatches from the few occasions when hed been conscious a lucky man indeed a very lucky man his days were uncomplicated during that long period of recuperation uncomfortable but uncomplicated he would wake up to slowly increasing pain a pain which seemed to stem from his very veins as much as from any identifiable limb or organ immobile his lower half encased and in some sort of traction his left arm splinted and swathed and his head similarly wrapped waking up was like moving from some darkly surreal land to an equally weird world of grey shadows and soft external movements light came in through his bandages but it was like trying to see through inches of snow or a heavily frosted window his entire face had been very badly bruised apparently but the doctors had managed to save his eyes now he must rest them and the rest of his body too simmons had never been vain he didnt ask about his face but he did wonder about it that was only natural his dreams disturbed him most those dreams he could never quite remember except that they were deeply troubled and full of anxiety and accusation he would worry about them and puzzle over them in the period between waking and the pain starting but after that his only concern would be the pain at least theyd given him a button he could press to let them know he was awake them the angels of this peculiar hell on earth his doctor and his debriefing officer they would come shadows through the snow of his bandages the doctor would feel his pulse and cluck like a worried hen the debriefing officer would say easy now mike easy and in would go the needle it didnt put him out just took away the pain and made it easy to talk he talked not only because the do wanted him to and because he knew he must but also out of sheer gratitude thats how bad the pain could get hed been told this much that while he was badly banged about he wasnt beyond repair thered been some surgery and more to come but the worst of it was over the painkiller theyd used had been highly addictive and now they had to wean him off it but his dosage was coming down and soon hed be on pills alone by which time the pain wouldnt be nearly so bad meanwhile the do had to get everything he knew every last iota of information out of him and he had to be sure he was getting the truth the damned johnniered might have inserted stuff in there that wasnt real dontcha know with the methods they used these days they could alter a mans memory his entire perception of things the damned boundahs jazz hadnt known there were people who still talked like that and so to ensure they were digging out the gen stuff theyd started right back at the beginning before simmons had ever been recruited by the secret service indeed before hed been born simonov hadnt been such a hard name to adopt for it was his fathers name back in the mids sergei simonov had defected to the west in canada he had been a trainer with a team of upandcoming young soviet skaters a disciplinarian and cool head on the ice off it hed been quicktempered and given to hasty and illconsidered decisions afterwards in calmer mood hed often enough change his mind but there are some things you cant easily undo defection is one of them sergeis love affair with a canadian icestar fizzled out and he found himself stranded there had been offers of work in america however and total freedom was still something of a heady experience coaching an icetroupe in new york he met elizabeth fallen a british journalist in the usa on assignment and they fell in love they had a whirlwind engagement and got married she arranged work for him in london michael j simmons had been born in hampstead nine months to the day after the first meeting of his parents in a wild serbian restaurant in greenwich village seven years later on the th october a day or so after khruschev had backed out of cuba sergei walked into the russian embassy and didnt come back out at least not when anyone was watching his elderly parents had been writing to him from a village just outside moscow where theyd been having less than a grand time of it sergei had been in a mood of depression over his marriage which had been coming apart for some time his belated doubledefection was another typically hasty decision to go home and see what could be recovered from the wreckage elizabeth simmons said good riddance and i hope they send him where theres plenty of ice and it later turned out that they did just that in the autumn of the week before jazzs ninth birthday his mother got word from the governmental department responsible that sergei simonov had been shot dead after killing a guard during an attempted escape from a prison labour camp near tura on the siberian tunguska she cried a few tears for the good times and then got on with it jazz on the other hand jazz had loved his father very much that dark handsome man who used to speak to him alternately in two languages who taught him to skate and ski even as a small child and spoke so vividly of his vast homeland as to seed in him a deeprooted and abiding interest in all things russian an interest which had lasted even to this day he had spoken bitterly of the injustices of the system too but that had been in the main beyond jazzs youthful understanding now however at the age of only nine years his fathers words had come back to him had assumed real importance and significance in his mind conflicting with his thirst for knowledge the father jazz had loved and always known would return was dead and the russia sergei simonov had loved was his murderer from that time forward jazzs interest became centered not so much in the sweeping grandeur and the peoples of his fathers homeland as in its oppressions jazz had attended a private school since before he was five and his special subject requiring private tuition as well as his fathers constant guidance was of course russian by the time he was twelve it was obvious that he had a linguists grasp of the language which proved to be the case when he obtained almost per cent marks in a specially set examination he attended university and at seventeen held a first in russian by the time he was twenty hed added to this a second in mathematics a subject towards which his brilliantly clear mind had always leaned only a year later his mother died from leukaemia uninterested in an academic career he took a job as an industrial interpretertranslator after that all of his spare time was spent in winter sports which he would pursue worldwide wherever the climate and whenever the financial situation permitted there were several girlfriends none of them serious affairs then holidaying in the harz when he was twentythree jazz had met a british army major on a winter warfare course this new friend was a member of the intelligence corps serving in baor and the meeting proved to be a big turning point a year later jazz was in berlin as an nco of that same lowprofile corps but berlin and brixmis hadnt suited him and by then the secret service had its eye on him anyway and didnt want him overexposed he was field agent material and should now start to learn the real tricks of the trade his demobilization was arranged as would be the next six years of his life all greatly to michael j simmonss satisfaction from then on it had been training and training and more training he trained in surveillance close protection escape and evasion winter warfare survival weapons handling demolition and unarmed combat the only thing they couldnt give him was experience jazz had been all set to fly to moscow as a diplomatic interpreter when pill came up or went down as the cia had it his original task was reassigned and he was given operation pill the service had been setting it up ever since the soviets got the perchorsk projekt underway and local services were all well established and in full working order jazz was briefed from head to heels went out to moscow nd class as henry parsons an ordinary tourist got issued with his russian id within an hour of deplaning an intelligence agent already in the ussr would assume his parsons identity and use his return flight back to london one in one out and shake it all about as jazzs chief briefing officer had explained like the hokeycokey except there are no left feet only right ones jazz hadnt known much about the moscow end of the network hed been deliberately kept in the dark on that just in case ditto for the magnitogorsk setup which had a line on shipments by rail destined for the perchorsk projekt he hadnt quite been able to figure out why his do should feel peeved that he didnt know more about these things that was definitely the impression that came over that even though hed given as much detail as he could still the do would have liked him to have known more but the simple fact was that all of that stuff had been on a needtoknow basis and jazz hadnt needed to know as for local services hed known all about them and during the many debriefing sessions jazz had told everything back in the s khrushchev had broken up a politically suspect pocket of ukrainian jewish peasants and resettled them from an area near kiev to the eastern slopes and valleys of the upper urals maybe hed hoped the cold would kill them off there theyd been allocated land and a work quota the business logging and in winter trapping all generally to be carried out under the supervision and guidance of oldguard komsomol officials from the west siberian oil and natural gas fields it wasnt quite a forced labour camp but in the beginning it wasnt a hell of a lot better but the ukrainian dissidents were a funny lot they stuck it out filled their quotas made a going concern of it and actually settled the district their success coupled with the rapid expansion of the far more important oil and natural gas industries in the east made strict control of the jewish settlements unwieldy even unnecessary their overseers had better things to do it could plainly be seen how a previously untamed region was now productive of timber and skins making good use of natural assets and giving work to the people khrushchevs ploy had apparently worked making good conscientious russian citizens from what had been an idle pack of troublesome political pariahs he should have been so lucky in other fields anyway visits from controlling officialdom fell off in direct proportion to the schemes success in fact all the jews had wanted was a little peace to follow their own whims and ways of life the climate might change but they never would there in their logging camps at the foot of the mountains they were now more or less content at least they were not pestered and there was always more than enough left over to make the living good hard but good they had all the timber they needed to build with in the summers and burn through the winters meat aplenty all the vegetables they could grow for themselves even a growing fund of roubles from forbidden trading in furs there was a little gold in the streams for which they prospected and panned occasionally with some success the hunting and fishing were good flexible work rosters ensured a fair distribution of labour and everyone had a share in what was available of prosperity and the good things of life even the cold worked in their favour it kept busybodies out and interference to a minimum several of the settlers were of romanian stock with strong family ties in the old country their political views were not in accord with mother russias nor would they ever be not until all oppression was removed and people could work and worship in their own way and restrictions lifted so that they might emigrate at will they were jews and they were ukrainians who thought of themselves as romanians and given freedom of choice they might also have been russians but mainly they were people of the world and belonged to no one but themselves their children were brought up with the same beliefs and aspirations in short while many of the resettled families were simple peasants of no distinct political persuasion there were a good many in the new villages and camps who were anticommunist and budding even active fifthcolumnists they clung to their romanian links and contacts and similar groups in romania had wellestablished links with the west mikhail simonov fully documented as a citybred hothead and troublemaker whod been given the choice of becoming a pioneering komsomol or else had gone to just such a family the kirescus of yelizinka village for employment as a lumberjack only old man kazimir kirescu himself and his oldest son yuri knew jazzs real purpose there at the foot of the urals and they covered for him to give him as much free time as possible he was prospecting or hunting or fishing but kazimir and yuri had known that in actual fact he was spying and theyd also known what he was after his mission to discover the secret of the experimental military base down in the heart of the perchorsk ravine youre not only risking your neck youre wasting your time the old man had told jazz gruffly one night shortly after he took up lodgings with the kirescus jazz remembered that night well anna kirescu and her daughter tassi had gone off to a womens meeting in the village and yuris younger brother kaspar was in bed asleep it had been a good time for their first important talk you dont have to go there to know whats going on in that place kazimir had continued yuri and i can tell you that all right as could most of the people in these parts if theyd a mind to a weapon his great lumbering gianthearted son yuri had put in winking and nodding his massive shaggy head a weapon like no one ever saw before or ever could imagine to make the soviets strong over all other people they built it down there in the ravine and they tested it and it went wrong old kazimir had grunted his agreement spitting in the fire for good measure and for emphasis just a little over two years ago he said gazing into the heart of the flames where they roared up the sprawling cabins stone chimney but wed known something was in the offing for weeks before that wed heard the machinery running do you see the big engines that power the thing thats right yuri had taken up the story again the big turbines under the dam i remember them being installed more than four years ago before they put that lead roof on the thing even then theyd restricted all hunting and fishing in the area of the old pass but i used to go there anyway when they built that dam why the fish swarmed in that artificial lake it was worth a clout and a tellingoff if you got caught there but about the turbines hah i was stupid enough then to think maybe they were going to give us the electricity we still dont have itbut what did they need all that power for eh and hed tapped the side of his nose anyway his father continued its so still on certain nights in these parts that a shout or the bark of a dog will carry for miles so did the sound of those turbines when they first started to use them despite the fact that they were down in the ravine you could hear their whining and droning right here in the village as for the power they produced thats easy they used it for all of their mining and tunnelling for their electric drills and rockcutting tools their lights and their blasting devices oh and for their heating and their comfort too no doubt while here in yelizinka we burned logs but they must have taken thousands of tons of rock out of that ravine so that god only knows youll forgive me what sort of warrens theyve burrowed under the mountain then it had been yuris turn again and thats where they built the weapon under the mountain then came the time when they tested it my father and me wed been setting a few traps and were late getting home that night i remember it clearly it was a night much like tonight bright and clear where it was darkest in the woods we could look through the treetops and see aurora borealis shimmering like a strange pale curtain in the northern sky the humming of the turbines was the loudest it had ever been so that the air seemed to throb with it but it was a distant throbbing you understand for of course the projekt is about ten kilometres from here my father and me we were somewhere in the middle maybe four or five kilometres from the source anyway that should give you some sort of idea of the raw power they were drawing from the river at the top of grigors crest kazimir took up the thread we stopped and looked back a wash of light like the aurora was playing all along the rim of the perchorsk ravine now i was one of the first men to settle this place one of the first victims of khrushchevs scheme you might say and in all those years id seen nothing like this it wasnt nature no it was the machine the weapon then he shook his head momentarily lost for words what happened next was awesome at this point yuri had grown excited and once again took over the turbines had wound themselves up to a high pitch of whining he said suddenlyit seemed there was a great gasp or a sigh a beam of light no a tube of light like a great brilliant cylinder shot up from the ravine lit up the peaks bright as day went bounding into the sky but fast lightning is slow by comparison thats how it seemed anyway it was a pulse of light you didnt actually see it just its afterimage burning on your eyeballs and in the next moment it was gone fired like a rocket into space lightning in reverse a laser a giant searchlight no nothing like that it had been more nearly solid at that jazz had smiled but not old kazimir yuri is right hed declared it was a clear night when this happened but within the hour clouds boiled up out of nowhere and it rained warm rain then there blew a hot wind like the breath of some beast outwards from the mountains and in the morning birds came down out of the peaks and high passes to die thousands of them animals too no beam of simple light no matter how powerful can do all that and thats not all for right after theyd tested it after the bar of light shot up into the sky then there came that smell of burning of electrical burning you know ozone maybe and after that we heard their sirens sirens jazz had been especially interested from the projekt of course where else kazimir had answered their alert sirens their alarms thered been an accident a big one oh we heard rumours and during the next two or three weekshelicopters flying in and out ambulances on the new road men in radiation suits decontaminating the walls of the ravine and the word was this blowback the weapon had discharged itself into the sky all right but it had also backfired into the cavern that housed it it was like an incinerator it melted rock brought the roof down nearly took the lid off the whole place they took a lot of dead out of there over the next week or so since when it hasnt been tried again now yuri had had to have the last word he shrugged his massive shoulders they run the turbines now and then if only to keep em in trim but as my father says the weapons been quiet no more testing maybe they learned something from that first trial and maybe it was something theyd rather not know myself i reckon they know they cant control it i reckon theyre finished with it except that doesnt explain why theyre still there why they havent dismantled everything and cleared off at which jazz had nodded saying well thats one of the things im here to find out see a lot of very important very intelligent men in the west are worried about the perchorsk projekt and the more i learn about it the more i believe they have good reason to be one night when they gave jazz his pills he didnt take them he pretended to stuck them in a corner of his mouth drank his water without washing them down it was partly an act of rebellion against what amounted to physical even mental imprisonment however wellintended and partly something else he needed time to think that was the one thing he never seemed to have enough of time to think he was always either asleep or taking pills to put him to sleep in pain or dopey from the needle that killed the pain and helped him talk to the debriefing officer but never left alone to just lie there and think maybe they didnt want him to think which made him wonder why didnt they want him to think his body might be a bit bangedup but there didnt seem a deal wrong with his brain when he was alone he turned his head a little on one side and spat the pills out they left a bad taste but nothing he couldnt live with if the pain came he could always ring his bell the button was right there beside his free right hand requiring only a touch from his index finger but the pain didnt come and neither did sleep and at last jazz was able to just lie there and think better still in a little while his thinking grew far less fuzzy indeed in comparison to the mental slurry hed recently been accustomed to it became like crystal and he began to ask himself all over again those questions he had been asking but which hed never found the time to answer like where the hell were his friends hed been out of russiawhat two weeks now and the only people hed seen were a doctor a do and a nurse who grunted a little but never spoke but he did have friends in the service surely they would know he was back why hadnt they been to see him was he that bangedup did he look that bad i dont feel that bad jazz whispered to himself he moved his right arm clenched his right fist the hole through his wrist had healed and new skin had knitted over the punctures front and back it was pure luck that the point of the iceaxe had slipped between the bones and managed to miss the arteries the hand was a little stiff and out of practice that was all there was some pain but nothing he couldnt survive come to think of it there wasnt much of pain in anything right now but of course he couldnt move everything could he jazz decided hed better not try what about sight would his room be in light or darkness the snow of his bandages was thick and dark they said theyd saved his sight from what had his eyes been hanging out or something saved his sight could mean anything that hed be able to see for instance but how well suddenly for the first time since hed been there he knew real panic they might have kept something back until hed been fully debriefed so as not to discourage or distract him where theres life theres hope sort of thing how about that what if they hadnt told him everything jazz got a grip of himself gave a derisive snort huh told him everything christ they hadnt told him anything he was the one whod been doing all the talking his new clarity of mind was leading him in a frightening new direction and it was all downhill going the more he considered the possibilities the faster he went and the more frightening it got bits of a puzzle he hadnt known existed until now were starting to fall into place and the picture they made was one of a clown a puppet with his name on it michael j simmons dupe he bent his right elbow lifted his hand to his bandaged head began picking at the bandages where they covered his eyes but carefully he only needed a peephole nothing more than that a narrow gap between strips of bandage he wanted to see without being seen in a little while he believed hed succeeded it was hard to tell with any degree of certainty the snow was still there but if he narrowed his eyes to slits the light became more nearly natural it was like when he was a child hed used to lie in bed with his eyes slitted simulating the slow regular breathing of sleep his mother would come in and put the light on stand there looking at him and she was never quite sure if he was asleep or awake but now with these bandages swathing his face it should be so much easier he straightened his arm again found his button and pressed it now his nurse would know he was still awake but the principle would be the same when she came in hed be able to look at her and she wouldnt know it he hoped in a little while soft unhurried footsteps sounded jazz pressed his head back into his pillows waited in the neardarkness of his room around him the airconditioning hummed faintly the air had a mildly antiseptic smell his sheets felt somehow coarse to those parts of his body which were exposed and he thought it doesnt feel like a room in a hospital hospitals feel artificial unreal at best but this one feels like fake artificial then the door opened and the light came on jazz squinted straight up only the fact that his eyes were shuttered saved them from dazzle from the naked lightbulb where it hung on its flex from the ceiling as for that ceiling itself that was of dark grey stone pocked from blasting and patterned with folded tightlypacked strata jazzs hospital room was a manmade cave or at least it was part of one too stunned to move he lay there frozen as his nurse came to the side of his bed then fighting the anger and revulsion he felt welling inside he slowly turned his head to look at her she scarcely glanced at him merely reached down to feel his pulse she was short and fat wore her hair straight and shortcropped like a medieval knight also wore the uniform and starched cap of a nurse but not a british nurse a soviet nurse and all of jazzs worst fears were realized he felt her fingers on his wrist at once snatched his hand away she gasped took a pace to the rear and the heel of one of her square black shoes came down hard on something that crunched she stood still glanced at the floor looked hard at jazz and frowned her green eyes narrowed where they tried to penetrate the slit in his bandages maybe she saw the steely glint of his grey eyes in there anyway she gasped a second time and her hand flew to her mouth then she went down on her knees gathered up fragments of tablet came upright with fury written right across her pudgy face she glared at jazz turned on her heel and headed for the door he let her get there then called out comrade she paused instinctively whirled and thrust out her jaw glowered her hatred of the spy then rushed out and slammed the door behind her she had left the light on in her hurry to go and report all of this have about two minutes before things start to warm up jazz thought suppose id better put them to some use he looked to his left his alleged dead side and saw a deep saucer of pale yellow fluid standing on a bedside table inclining his head and stretching his neck as far as he could in that direction he inhaled deeply smelled a strong antiseptic odour how easy it was to create a hospital atmosphere rubber tiles on the floor to deaden footfalls a saucer of tcp for the tooclean smell and a constant flow of sterile temperate air simple as that the walls of jazzs room were of corrugated metal sheets bolted to vertical steel stanchions thered be laminated padding too jazz supposed to keep the room soundproofed and isolated or it could be the case that in fact this entire area was a hospital built to serve the staff of the projekt after the perchorsk incident theyd probably decided it was advisable a hospital area would be handy for periodic checkups and would probably be situated alongside a decontamination facility assuming that is that there was still an atomic pile down here back in the west they were pretty sure that there had been one anyway jazz had already spotted an excessradiation warning device on the wall at present it was green with just a tinge of pink showing in the aperture the uneven rock ceiling was maybe nine feet high on average it looked very hard stuff and there were no fractures not even small ones that jazz could see still he felt just a touch of claustrophobia something of the enormous weight of a mountain pressing down on him for by now there was no doubt at all in his mind but that that was where he was under the urals running footsteps sounded and the door was thrown open jazz lifted his head as far as restrictions would allow and stared at the people who came panting into the room two men and behind them the fat nurse hot on their heels came a third man his white smock and the hypodermic in his hand gave him away at once jazzs favourite pulsefeeler the clucking doctor well and maybe now hed have something worth clucking about mike my boy the man in front dressed in casual civilian clothes motioned the others back he approached the bed alone said and whats all this that nursies been telling us what you didnt take your pills why ever not wouldnt they go down the ingratiating voice was that of jazzs do jazz nodded stiffly thats right old boy he answered harshly they sort of stuck in my craw he lifted his right hand and tugged at his fake bandages tore them from his eyes he stared at the four where they stood frozen as if they were insects trapped in amber after a moment the doctor muttered something in russian took an impatient pace forward and gave his needle a brief squirt the second man into the room also dressed casually caught his arm and dragged him to a halt no chingiz khuv told the doctor curtly in russian cant the two of you see that he knows since hes awake aware and with all his wits about him lets keep him that way anyway i want to talk to him hes all mine now no jazz told him staring straight at him tm all mine now if you want to speak to me youd better let him dope me up its the only way im going to do any talking khuv smiled stepped right up to the bed and looked down on jazz oh youve already talked enough mr simmons he said without a trace of malice quite enough i assure you anyway i dont intend to ask you anything i intend to tell you a few things and maybe show you a few things and thats all oh said jazz oh yes really in fact im going to tell you the things you most want to know all about the perchorsk projekt what we were attempting to do here and what we actually did would you like that very much said jazz and what is it youre going to show me the place where you make your bloody monsters khuvs eyes narrowed but then he smiled again and he nodded something like that he said except theres one thing you should know right from the start we dont make them oh but you do jazz also nodded thats one thing were pretty sure about this is the source this is where it was born or spawned khuvs expression didnt change youre wrong he said but thats only to be expected for you only know half the story so far it came from here yes but it wasnt born here no it was born in a different world entirely he sat down on jazzs bed stared at him intently it strikes me youre a survivor mr simmons jazz couldnt resist a snort of derision am i going to survive this one maybe you will at that khuvs smile was very genuine now as if in anticipation of something quite delicious first we must get you up on your feet again and show you round the place and then jazz moved his head enquiringly and thenthen well see just what sort of a survivor you really are the perchorsk projekt the complex built into the base of the riven mountain at the bottom of the perchorsk ravine was vast and it wasnt without a degree of russian pride in achievement that chingiz khuv took michael j simmons on a tour of inspection but neither did khuv lack respect for jazzs considerable talent for destruction on their walkabouts the british agent was literally straitjacketed in a garment which effectively disabled him from the waist up and as if that werent enough karl vyotsky was invariably present surly bodyguard to his kgb boss blame all of this on the technologygap if you must have any sort of scapegoat at all khuv told the british agent the americans with their microchips spysatellites complicated and ohsoclever electronic listening systems i mean wheres the security if they can tapin on any phone call anywhere in the whole wide world eh and these are only a handful of the ways in which sensitive information may be obtained the art of spying takes a great many forms and encompasses some formidable one might even say terrifying talents on both sides i mean east and west alike hightech on the one hand and the supernatural on the other the supernatural jazz raised an enquiring eyebrow the perchorsk projekt looks solid enough to me and anyway im afraid i dont much believe in ghosts khuv smiled and nodded i know he said i know weve checked on that or perhaps you dont remember jazz looked blank for a moment then frowned come to think of it he did remember it had been part of his debriefing but at the time he hadnt paid it a lot of attention actually hed thought his do was pulling his leg to ask what he knew about intesp or ebranch which used extra sensory perception as a tool for espionage indeed espionage as it happened jazz had quite genuinely known nothing at all about it and he probably wouldnt have believed it even if he had if telepathy was feasible he told khuv they wouldnt have needed to send me would they there wouldnt be any more secrets quite right quite right khuv answered after a moments pause those were my feelings exactly once upon a time and as you rightly point out all of this he waved an arm expansively about is obviously solid enough all of this was the gymnasium area where for the past week jazz had been getting himself back in shape following the fortnight hed spent on his back the fact that theyd so easily emptied him of all he had known still didnt sit too well with him here as they paused a while to let karl vyotsky strip off his pullover and work out for a few minutes with the weights jazz thought hed try a little pumping of his own he had no doubt that whatever questions he put to khuv theyd be answered in a truthful straightforward manner in this respect the kgb major was entirely disarming but on the other hand why shouldnt he be open he had nothing to lose he knew that jazz wasnt going anywhere outside of this place ever hed known that right from square one thats the way they had it figured out anyway you surprise me he said complaining about american knowhow i was supposed to be about per cent proof against brainwashing but you pulled my plug and i just gurgled away no torture not even a threat and im pentatholresistant but i couldnt hold a thing back how the hell did you do that khuv glanced at him went back to watching vyotsky handling weights as if they were made of papiermвchй jazz looked at vyotsky too khuvs underling was huge seventyfive inches and a little over two hundred pounds and all of it muscle he hardly seemed to have any neck at all and his chest was like a barrel expanding out of his narrow waist his thighs were round and tight inside lightblue trousers he felt jazzs eyes on him grinned through his black beard and flexed biceps that would shame a bear youd like to work out with me british he finished his exercises and dropped the weights clanging to the floor barefisted maybe in the ring just say the word ivan jazz answered halfsmiling his voice low i still owe you for a couple of teeth remember vyotsky showed his own teeth again but not in a grin and put on his pullover khuv turned to jazz said dont push your luck with karl my friend he can give you twenty pounds and ten years of experience on top of which he has some ugly little habits when we caught you on that mountain he knocked your teeth out yes but believe me you were lucky he wanted to pull your head off and its possible he could do it with a little effort i might even have let him try except that would have been a terrible waste and weve already had enough of that around here they began to walk again passed through the gymnasium and out into a room containing a small swimming pool the pool wasnt tiled it had simply been blasted out of the bedrock along a natural fault here where the uneven veined ceiling was a little higher several of the projekts staff were swimming in the pools heated water the room echoed to the slapping sounds of flesh on plastic as two women openhanded a ball to and fro between them a thin balding man was practicing jackknives from a springboard as for your debriefing said khuv shrugging well theres hightech and theres hightech the west has its miniaturization its superb electronics and we have our bulgarian chemists jazz cut him short the tiled walkway at the side of the pool was wet and his feet were slipping he stumbled and vyotsky caught his arm in a powerful grip steadied him jazz cursed under his breath do you know how uncomfortable it is walking round in this thing he was talking about his straitjacket a necessary precaution said khuv im sorry but it really is for the best most of the people here arent armed theyre scientists not soldiers soldiers guard the approaches to the projekt certainly but their barracks are elsewhere not far away but not here there are some soldiers here as youll see but they are specialists and so if you were to get loose again his shrug you might do a lot of damage before you met up with someone like karl here at the end of the pool they passed out through another door into a gently curving corridor which jazz recognized as the perimeter that was what they called it the perimeter a metalclad rubberfloored tunnel which enclosed the entire complex about its middle level from the perimeter doors led inwards into all the projekts many areas there were still a few doors jazz hadnt been through the ones which required special security access hed seen the living areas hospital recreation rooms dining hall and some of the laboratories but not the machine itself if there was such a beast khuv had promised him however that today he was to visit the guts of the place khuv led the way jazz following with vyotsky bringing up the rear people came and went around them dressed in lab smocks overalls some with millboards and notes others carrying pieces of machinery or instruments the place could easily be some hightech factory anywhere in the world as jazz and his escort proceeded so khuv said you asked about your debriefing well youre right about our bulgarian friends they really have a knack for brewing potent stuff and of course im not just talking about their wine the pills were to cause you pain they cramp muscles heighten sensitivity the shots are part truthdrug part sedative they have the effect of making you susceptible to suggestion its not so much that you cant refuse more that youre far more likely to believe anything that we tell you your debriefing officer not only speaks very good english but hes a toprank psychologist too so dont blame yourself that you let your side down you really had no choice you thought you were home and dry and that you were only doing your duty jazz merely grunted for reply his face was void of emotion which was the way hed kept it most of the time since discovering hed been duped of course khuv continued your own british er chemists are rather clever men in their own right that capsule in your mouth for instance we werent able to analyse its contents here at the projekt hardly surprising we arent equipped with a full range of analytical facilities thats not what the perchorsk projekt is about but even so we were at least able to conclude that your little tooth capsule contained a remarkably complex substance thats why weve sent it to moscow who can say maybe theres something in it we can use eh while he spoke to jazz khuv kept glancing back at him checking him up and down as hed done so often during the course of the past few weeks he saw a man only thirty years of age upon whose shoulders his secret service masters in the west had placed an awesome weight of responsibility they obviously respected his abilities and yet for all simmonss training his physical and mental fitness still he was inexperienced then again how experienced can a field agent in the secret service be every mission was a flip of a coin heads you win and tailsyou lose your head or as the british agent himself might have it a game of russian roulette for all simmonss expertise in his many subjects still they were only theoretical skills as yet untested under battle conditions for on his very first assignment the dice had rolled against him the cylinder had clicked into position with its bullet directly under the firingpin unfortunate for michael j simmons but extremely fortunate for chingiz khuv again the kgb majors dark jewel eyes rested on simmons the englishman stood just a fraction under six feet tall maybe a halfinch less than khuv himself during the time hed spent in his role as a logger hed grown a red beard to match his unruly shock of hair that had gone now revealing a square jaw and slightly hollow cheeks hed be a little underweight too for apparently the british liked their agents lean and hungry a fat man doesnt run as fast as a thin one and he makes a much easier target for all that he was young simmonss brow was deeply lined from frowning even taking into account his present circumstances he did not seem a particularly happy man or even one whod ever been especially happy his eyes were keen grey penetrating his teeth were in good order strong square and white about his sturdy neck he wore a small plain cross on a silver chain which was his only item of jewellery he had hands which were hard for all that they were long and tapered and arms which seemed a little long giving him a sort of gangling or gawky appearance but khuv was well aware that appearances can be deceptive simmons was a skilled athlete and his brain was a fine one they reached an area of the perimeter jazz had not seen before here the coming and going of staff was far less frequent and as the three turned the curve of the long corridor so a security door had come into view blocking it entirely on the approach to this door the ceiling and walls were burned black great blisters were evident in the paintwork closer to the door the very rock of the ceiling appeared to have melted run down like wax and solidified on the cool metal of the artificial walls the rubber floor tiles had burned right through to naked metal plates which were buckled out of alignment it seemed somehow paradoxical that a russian army flamethrower stood on a shelf against the exterior wall clamped in position there in surroundings like these jazz might well have expected a fire extinguisher but a flamethrower he made a mental note to ask about it later but right now the perchorsk incident he said watching khuv for his reaction correct the russians expression didnt change he faced jazz eye to eye now we are going to take that straitjacket off you the reason is simple down in the lower levels you will need some freedom of movement i dont want you to fall and hurt yourself however should you attempt anything foolish karl has my permission indeed he has my instructions to hurt you severely also i should tell you that if you got lost down there you could well find yourself in an area of high radioactivity eventually we may get around to decontaminating all the hotspots but its unlikely why should we when we wont have cause to use those areas again and so depending on how long it took you to surrender or how long it took us to flush you out you would almost certainly jeopardize your health perhaps even fatally do you understand jazz nodded but do you really think id be stupid enough to make a run for it where to for gods sake as i explained before khuv reminded him while vyotsky unfastened the restraining straps on his straitjacket we arent too concerned that youll try to escape that would be sheer suicide and you no longer have reasons to wish to die if you ever did what we are concerned about is the damage you might do maybe even largescale sabotage and that could have very grave consequences indeed not only for everyone here but for the entire world for once jazzs expression changed he slanted his mouth into a humourless smile laughed gratingly a bit melodramatic arent we comrade i think maybe youve been watching too many decadent james bond films do you said khuv his slightly slanted eyes narrowing a fraction and becoming that much brighter do you indeed he took a key from his pocket turned to the heavy metal door it was equipped with a lock set centrally in a steel handwheel like a locking device on a bank vault as khuv went to insert his key so the wheel turned through quarter of a circle and the edges of the door cracked open khuv stepped back someone was coming through from the other side the door opened fully toward the three where they waited and a handful of technicians and two men dressed in smart civilian clothes came through one of the two was fat beaming jovial a vip visitor from moscow the other gravefaced was small and thin his face was badly scarred and the hair was absent from the left half of his face and yellowveined skull jazz had seen him before he was viktor luchov direktor of the perchorsk projekt a survivor of perchorsk incidents one and two brief greetings were exchanged between khuv and these two men and then the larger party went on its way then jazz and his escorts passed through the door and khuv locked it behind them beyond the door the complex took on an entirely different aspect by comparison the damage on the approach to this area had been superficial jazz stared and tried to make sense of the chaos he saw there the evidence of terrific heat was apparent everywhere stanchions were blackened and in places eaten halfway through the floorplates were missing entirely had been replaced with timbers the face of the exterior rock wall literally the mountain itself was black dull and lumpy like lava frozen in its course a metal chair or desk difficult to tell which and a steel cabinet projected in twisted ruin half out of a massive nodule of lava which was in turn welded to the wall and above this anomalous nodule a cylindrical shaft maybe twelve feet in diameter had been drilled through the rock upwards at an angle of fortyfive degrees from the lip of which the lava could be seen in large part to have issued jazz looked again at the dark throat of the shaft wondered how it could have been cut and where it went he reached up a hand to touch the side of the rim where the shaft opened into the corridor the rock was smooth as glass not lumpy like the volcanic flow from the shafts lipaware that khuv was watching him jazz shot him an inquisitive glance tm told that used to have a square crosssection whose sides were something less than two metres khuv informed also that it was lined with a perfect mirror of a very high density glass on impervious ceramic giving almost per cent reflectivity after what you have termed the perchorsk incident this is what remained of the shaft i suppose you might say that this is what comes of trying to pass a round peg through a square hole eh and before jazz could answer of course i wasnt here when this happened you see i have my own job michael youll forgive my familiarity with a branch of the service whose work you would find entirely unbelievable it is that ebranch of which weve already spoken jazz said nothing continued to glance all about tried to take in all he was seeing and hearing what good that would do him he couldnt say but it was all part of his training ebranch yes michael khuv went on you english have an ebranch too you know which is why we were so interested to know if you were a member of that organization if you had been he shrugged then we would have been obliged to dispose of you from the outset jazz raised his customary eyebrow oh yes said khuv casually for we couldnt allow you to transmit neither telepathically nor any other way knowledge of this place to the outside world that too could be very dangerous so much so that it might even conceivably bring about world war iii more melodramatics jazz murmured khuv sighed deeply you will understand eventually he said but first find yourself a place to sit for a while and ill tell you everything you were sent here to discover you see i actually want you to understand everything youll know why later khuv perched himself on a knob of black rock while jazz found a seat on the side of the steel cabinet where it leaned out of the lava nodule vyotsky remained standing saying nothing merely watching the projekts airconditioning whispered faintly distantly and apart from this and khuvs voice all was silent khuv spoke very softly and the effect was eerie like a whisper echoing in some deeply buried alien vault you must blame all you see here primarily on the usas sdi or star wars scenario he began of course those terms hadnt been thought of as early as that but the idea was there sure enough we knew that much from standard intelligence sources as for the perchorsk projekt it was little more than a clever theory until america started dreaming up its space defence initiative but after that it was the same old story we had to have an even better defence system as with bigger and better bombs so with defence systems if star wars could mean the loss of per cent of our nuclear capability then we had to have something which cancelled out the wests strike capability utterly perchorsk was to have been the first step the proving ground if it had worked then similar installations would have been constructed all around russias borders the satellite countries might perhaps have to fend for themselves in any future holocaust but the soviet heartland would be defended completely do you follow me so far jazz cocked his head on one side youre telling me that this he glanced here and there all about wasnt intended as a weapon right exactly khuv nodded it was to have been the opposite of a weapon a shield an impenetrable umbrella over the head of the central soviet union ah but now i see how interested you are finally we have a little animation well and should i proceed by all means said jazz at once do go on khuv settled into his story dont ask me about the mechanics of the thing im a well a policeman not a physicist franz ayvaz was the brains and driving force behind perchorsk and viktor luchov was his secondincommand ayvaz as you may already know was our top man in particle beam acceleration and various associated fields of research in his younger days hed been a leading pioneer of laser technology his credentials were impeccable and his theory on paper at least seemed to be exactly what the defence staff was looking for a dualpurpose forcefield to shut out incoming missiles and render their nuclear capacity entirely harmless thats how the perchorsk projekt was born five years ago and this is where it died three years later ayvaz died with it and luchov is still here gathering information piecing it all together and seeing if theres anything that can be salvaged as to what happened exactly what was supposed to happen was this a beam was to be generated down below in the lower levels thats where most of the hardware used to be accelerated to the limits of tolerance and excited by atomic bombardment it would be released up this shaft and emitted like an enormous laser into the ravine where the shaft emerged into the ravine a nest of mirrors would divide the beam into a fan shape which would be waved across the sky and into space it was to be a test thats all the very first of a series alas there was a failure in the motors which governed the movement of the exterior mirrors they jammed in the worst possible position at the worst possible moment also the scientists here had been under pressure their work had been hurried and performed in conditions which werent the best a full range of failsafe devices had not been incorporated do you know what happens michael if you plug the barrel of a gun load it and pull the trigger but ridiculous to ask a question like that of a man who is an expert in firearms of course you know what happens well and thats what happened here there was a colossal blowback energies sufficient to fill an arc of space covering from afghanistan to franz josef land were trapped and confined within the shaft and redirected back to their source there was a collision of awesome forces the instantaneous generation of incredible temperatures and in the immediate vicinity of the beam matter itself underwent some radical changes now of course that is my nontechnical laymans explanation you will need to talk to luchov if you want more but i guarantee you wouldnt understand him not unless theres a lot more to you than weve discovered anyway sothat was the perchorsk incident or pi as your people in the west have christened it the shambles you see here is not one hundredth part of the devastation which occurred down below where well be going in a moment and as for loss of life we paid a terrible toll for our haste michael a terrible toll but not so terrible as the toll we may still have to pay with those enigmatic words still echoing khuv abruptly stood up lets go deeper his words were clipped urgent right now two levels down where perhaps youll be able to get the feel of what it was really like jazz got to his feet and followed on and once again vyotsky formed their tail along the perimeter a little way then down wide heavybeamed wooden stairs into what could only be termed a region of sheer fantasy with one hand lightly on the rail jazz stared into the dim recesses of a great disorder a weird chaos the lighting was poor here perhaps deliberately so for certainly what little could be seen was to say the least disconcerting even frightening down through a tangle of warped plastic fused stone and blistered metal they passed where on both sides amazingly consistent smoothbored tunnels some two or three feet in diameter wound and twisted like wormholes through old timbers except they cut through solid rock and crumpled girders and the thought came to the british agent that something some vast force had attempted to bring about a certain homogeneity here had tried to make every different thing into one similar thing or had tried to deform everything beyond recognition it was not so much that the various materials had been fused by heat and fire rather that they seemed to have been foldedin like the ingredients of dough or different coloured plasticines in some monstrous childs hands it gets worse said khuv quietly leading the way lower still those strange tunnels there were not cut through the magmass thats what viktor luchov calls this jumble of matter incidentally a magmass they were eaten into it by energy shearing off from the blowback we can only guess at the extent of the damage if the installation had been built on the surface the stairs descended to a veritable bed of magmass only levelling out when they reached a vertical wall of unbroken rock like the face of a cliff here the timbers underfoot formed a walkway which turned to the right through an angle of ninety degrees and ran parallel with the foot of the looming wall of rock under the boards the floor was chaotically humped and anomalous where different materials had so flowed into each other as to become unrecognizable in their original forms and through all the congealed mass of this earthly and yet unfamiliar material ran those irregular wormhole energy channels very like the indiscriminate burrows of rockboring crustaceans in the sea but on a gigantic scale eaten jazz pondered over the word you said these holes were eaten into this stuff but by what rather shall we say converted khuv glanced at him perhaps that paints a truer picture to say that the material was converted into energy but if youll be patient i can show you a far better example we are going to the place where the pile used to be that too was eaten or converted if you prefer pile for the moment khuvs meaning didnt register in jazzs confused thoughts the atomic pile which was the projekts main source of power the russian explained the backlash ate it utterly yes and then it seems it ate itself jazz might have questioned that statement too but now looming on the left of the walkway a huge perfectly circular hole appeared in the face of the black wall of rock light issued from this tunnel where it angled steeply downward and jazz didnt need telling that this was a continuation of the shaft seen in the upper level which once and only once had carried a fearsome beam of energy to the outside world the walkway turned left into the mouth of the shaft became a stairway once again blinding white light was painful after the comparative gloom of the two levels through which the party had descended ahead and below the far end of the shaft was a white disk of glaring brilliance with its lower rim blacked out by the walkways platform jazz shielded his eyes saw a young russian soldier in uniform leaning against the curved wall the man at once came upright snapped to attention slapped the stock of his kalashnikov rifle in salute at ease said khuv we need some glasses the soldier leaned his rifle against the wall groped in a satchel slung over his shoulder he produced three pairs of tinted cellophane spectacles with cardboard rims like the glasses jazz had once been issued to view a d film for the light khuv explained though there was hardly any need it can be blinding until youre used to it he put on his glasses jazz did the same followed khuv down the stairway built through the glasssmooth cylindrical shaft from behind them came a clatter as the soldiers rifle toppled over when he went to pick it up then karl vyotskys husky threatening voice hissing idiot dolt would you like to do a month of nights no sir the young soldier gasped im sorry sir it slipped you damn well should be sorry vyotsky rasped and not only for the rifle what the hell are you here for anyway to check passes for security thats what do you know that man in front and me and the man with us oh yes sir the young soldier quavered the man in front is comrade major khuv sir and you too are an officer of the kgb the other man isisa friend of yours sir clown vyotsky hissed he is not my friend nor yours nor anyones in the whole damned place sir i now hold that rifle out in front of you vyotsky snapped arms length finger through the triggerguard finger under the backsight what the hell arms length i said now hold it and count to two hundred slowly then get back to attention and if i ever catch you slacking off again ill feed you into that white hell down there dickfirst got it yes sir following khuv toward the white glare at the end of the shaft jazz murmured sourly a disciplinarian our karl khuv glanced back shook his head not really discipline isnt his strong point but sadism is i hate to admit it but it does have its uses at the end of the shaft there was a railed landing where the stairs levelled out and turned to the left khuv paused on the landing with jazz alongside waiting for vyotsky they gazed down on a fantastic scene it was like being in a cavern but there was no way it could be mistaken for any ordinary sort of cave instead jazz saw that the rock had been hollowed out in the shape of a perfect sphere a giant bubble in the base of the mountain but a bubble at least one hundred and twenty feet in diameter the curving shinyblack wall all around was glasssmooth except for the wormholes which riddled it everywhere even in the domed ceiling the mouth of the shaft where jazz and khuv stood pointed downward at ninety degrees directly at the centre of the space which also happened to be the source of the light and that was the most fantastic thing of all for that central area was a ball of light some thirty feet across and it was apparently suspended there midway between the domed ceiling and the upward curving floor a sphere of brilliance hanging motionless within a sphere of air and the whole trick neatly buried under the foot of a mountain narrowing his eyes against the glare which was powerful even through the tinted lenses of his spectacles jazz slowly became aware that the spherical cavern contained other things a spidery web of scaffolding had been built halfway up the wall and all around the central blaze the scaffolding supported a platform of timbers which circled the weird light source reminding jazz vaguely of the ring system round saturn leading inwards from the ring a walkway proceeded right to the edge of the sphere of light externally backed up against the black wormholeriddled walls evenly spaced around the perimeter and massively supported on a framework of stanchions three twinmounted katushev cannons pointed their muzzles pointblank at the blinding centre crews were in position their sights aligned on the sphere their faces white and alienlooking with headset antennae and insect goggleeyes trained on the dazzling target between the guns and the sphere stood a tenfoothigh electrified fence with a gate where the timber walkway spanned the gap between the saturns rings and the centre there was some motion down there nervous and jumpy but not much the stench of fear was so thick in the supposedly conditioned air that jazz could almost feel it like slime on his skin he gripped the wooden rail let the entire scene print itself indelibly on his brain said what in the name of all thats he turned his head to stare at khuv i saw the arrival of those guns that night you caught me the electrified fence too i thought they were meant to defend perchorsk against attack from the outside which struck me as making no sense but from the inside christ that doesnt make much sense either i mean what is that thing and why are those men down there so desperately afraid of it and suddenly without any prompting he knew the answer before it came not all of the answer but enough suddenly everything fitted all hed seen and all khuv had told him and especially the flying monstrosity that the american fighters had burned to hell and sent crashing to earth in a ball of flame from high over the west coast of the hudson bay and speaking of flames wasnt that a fourman flamethrower squad down there on the saturnsrings platform yes it was vyotsky had come up quietly behind jazz and khuv where they stood at the rail he put a huge hand on jazzs shoulder causing him to start as to what it is british he said its some sort of gate or door and as such were not frightened of it but jazz noted how for once vyotksys tone was muted perhaps even a little awed karl is right said khuv no were not frightened of the gate itself but i defy any sane person not to fear the things that sometimes come through it the gate to they started down the final flight of wooden stairs to the saturns rings or spider web platform then moved round the central sphere until they approached the walkway leading to its coldly incandescent heart ten feet away from the gate in the electric fence khuv halted turned to jazz and said well what do you make of it he could only be talking about the glaring yet enigmatic globe which stood on the other side of the gate maybe seven paces away it was quite motionless it made no sound and yet it was menacing you said that this was where the atomic pile stood jazz answered what in midair no ok im being facetious so what you mean is that after the blowback everything within sixtyfive feet or so of the centre of thatthat whatever it is was vaporized out of existence right that would have been my explanation too khuv nodded but incorrectly as ive already pointed out conversion is the word according to viktor luchov the energy of the trapped beam was attracted by the latent energy or the energy in action in the pile you could compare it to the way a nail is drawn to a magnet in the final fusing there was no explosion perhaps there was an implosion i dont know any more about that than luchov himself but the matter which had formed the floor of this place and the pile itself along with its fuel yes and all the machinery too which had filled this area all of these things outwards from the centre to the spherical wall which now you see were eaten transformed converted men too seventeen nuclear physicists and technicians died instantly leaving no trace jazz was impressed if not by khuvs telling of the story certainly by its content and radiation he said there must have been a massive release of khuv shook his head bringing jazz to a halt in relation to what was available there was very little in the way of escaped radiation the tips of those wormholes fifteen to twenty feet into the rock some of those were hotspots we did what we could then sealed them off in the levels above there are dangerous places still but again mainly sealed off and in any case those levels are no longer in use and will never be used again you have seen something of the magmass but you have not seen all of it metal and plastic and rock were not the only materials which flowed together inseparably in that blast of alien energy michael but rock and metal and plastic do not rot you understand my meaning im sure jazz grimaced said how did theyclean the place up it must have been a nightmare it still is khuv told him thats why the lighting is muted up there acid was used it was the only way but it left moulds in the magmass which are utterly hideous to look upon pompeii must be something similar but there at least the figures are still recognizably human not elongated or twisted orreversed jazz thought about it enquired no further as to khuvs exact meaning vyotsky had been growing restless for some little time do we have to stand here like this he suddenly growled why must we make targets of ourselves jazzs dislike for the man was intense amounting to hatred hed hated him from the moment he first laid eyes on him and couldnt resist jibes whenever the opportunity for such surfaced now he sneered at the huge russian you think their fingers are likely to slip he nodded in the direction of the crew manning the closest katushev or maybe theyve a grudge against you too eh british said vyotsky taking a threatening pace closer i could happily toss you on that fence there and watch you fry youve been advised to mind your mouth but me i hope you go on pushing your luck till you push yourself right over the edge calm yourself karl khuv told him hes looking for your measure thats all and to jazz he doesnt mean that sort of target he said or rather he does but not in the way you think its simply that if anything anything at all strange comes out of that ball of light there those crews have orders to open fire immediately and destroy or try to destroy it and those orders take absolutely no account of the fact that we happen to be standing here right in the arc of fire but if it did happen vyotsky added and if what could come through did then i personally would be glad to stop a bullet khuv gave a little shiver said lets get out of here karl is quite right we are stupid to stand here tempting fate it has happened five times before and theres no guarantee it wont happen again as they turned away and headed back toward the stairs jazz asked do you have it on film i mean if its a regular occurrence not regular khuv corrected him five shall we call them emergences in two years can hardly be called frequent but i take your point oh yes michael we learned our lessons quickly after the first two encounters we fitted cameras and now there are also cameras mounted on these guns they are triggered when the weapons themselves are triggered what the gunners see the cameras capture on film anyway as for the thing your side has codenamed pill that was the first nobody here was ready for it the second one was smaller but we werent ready for that either after that the cameras were put in any chance of seeing what were talking about jazz might as well go for broke there was little or no chance of him getting out of here but still hed try to discover what he could of this mess if only on the offchance certainly said khuv without hesitation but if you prefer i can show you something far more interesting than mere films there was something about the way he said it that warned jazz to be careful but nevertheless he answered well by all means lets keep me interested vyotskys grimly sardonic chuckle sounding from behind made him wonder if hed made the right choice they went back up through the quiet but disquieting magmass levels to the perimeter and along it to the secure area which housed the projekts laboratories passing through two guarded security doors they arrived finally at a steel door bearing a stencilled scarlet skull and the stark warning caution keeper and security classified persons only jazz couldnt help but think more melodramatics but khuv and vyotsky had gone very quiet and perhaps it would be as well if he followed suit he held his tongue wondered about the word keeper keeper of what khuv had a plastic id tag which he inserted in a slot in the door the card was accepted read and given back mechanisms whirred and the door opened with a click before pushing it all the way open khuv motioned to vyotsky who turned down the lights in the anteroom as the lights dimmed jazz noticed vyotskys face it was pale and shiny with cold sweat also his adams apple bobbed noticeably there could be little doubt that the big russian was both hard and cruel but it seemed there were some things that could get to him it also appeared that jazz was about to meet one of them khuv though was cool as ever now he pushed the heavy door open and motioned jazz through it with some misgivings the british agent stepped inside the dark room vyotsky followed close behind him and khuv came last closing the door after him the darkness was almost complete only a series of small red lights the size of flashlight bulbs glowed in the ceiling revealed by their dim glow the rectangular shape of a glass case stood against one wall like a huge tropical fish tank khuvs voice came soft out of the darkness are you ready michael when you are jazz answered but even as the words left his mouth he knew he wasnt here to admire goldfish a sharp click sounded and the lights came on something moved in the tank and reared up behind jazz vyotsky made a choking sound hed seen this before had known what was in here but if anything the knowledge had only served to precipitate his instinctive reaction to it and now that jazz saw it he could readily understand why the thing was something like the moulds in the magmass which khuv had not described but jazz had pictured it was like that and yet not like that for it was alive twisting flowing it glared out through the thick glass of the tank with eyes that were sheer hell it was the size of a large dog but it was not a dog it wasnt anything jazz could have possibly imagined but a composite of most of his worst nightmares it didnt stay still long enough for him to even try to decide what it was and worst of all it didnt seem to know itself flattening itself for a moment against the glass of the tank the thing might have been a leech its underside was corrugated and shaped like a huge elongated sucker but its four hands its tail and its head were parts that might readily fit on a giant rat that was how it looked for a splitsecond then the head and hands changed underwent a swift metamorphosis became manlike an almost human face crushed itself to the glass gazing flatly almost pitifully out into the room it grimaced an expression that was part smile part scowl part snarl and then its human jaws yawned inhumanly open inside that mouth was a hell of teeth worthy of some monster piranha jazz stepped back gasping and bumped into vyotsky the big russian grasped his shoulders steadied him and in the tank the things hands sprouted hooks that scrabbled at the glass its face collapsed to a black leathery mask with a convoluted snout and huge hairy pointed ears like a great bat webs grew between its limbs and body forming wings it sprang high thudded against the tough glass ceiling of its tank flopped down on the deep sandy bed jazz was vaguely aware that someone possibly khuv he thought yes even khuv had murmured my god in that same moment the thing had elongated into a worm with a spade head rammed itself headfirst down into the sand and burrowed out of sight there was a final flurry of sand andall was still after long moments of silence jazz expelled his breath in a great sigh christ almighty he said in a small voice then all three men drew air deeply into starved lungs jazz closed his gaping mouth looked at the two russians and youre telling me this thing came out of that ball of light right khuv pale in the bright lights with eyes that were dark blots in his doughy face nodded through the gate yes he said jazz shook his head in bewilderment but how in hell did you catch it it seemed a very reasonable question as you can see khuv answered it doesnt like bright lights and for all that it can change its shape at will still it seems very primitive in its mental processes if it has any worth considering as such it could be that its all sheer animal instinct we think it probably attacked the gate on the other side it would have been night in that world and the glaringly bright sphere must have seemed like an enemy or even prey but when it burst through to our side into the hollow sphere of rock down there it was bright as day luckily for the people who were there it headed straight down one of the wormholes to escape from the light do you see and someone had his wits about him sufficiently to put the open end of a steel cabinet over the mouth of the hole when it tried to come back out it was trapped how long have you jazz found the greatest difficulty in concentrating on what he was saying found it almost impossible to take his eyes off the tank had this thing eighteen months khuv answered this was the third encounter of the too close kind jazz had finally got himself together pardon khuv stared at him blankly nothing jazz shook his head but tell me what does it eat he didnt know why hed asked that maybe it was the memory of all those teeth and khuvs talk of prey khuvs eyes narrowed not defensively but thoughtfully he opened the door switched off the lights and beckoned jazz and vyotsky to come out they went back to the perimeter and khuv led the way to his own quarters on the way jazz asked i take it it does eat khuv remained silent but vyotsky answered for him oh yes it eats it doesnt need to apparently but it does when foods on offer it eats people or anything else with good red salty guts or it would if it could its keeper feeds it on blood and offal which is pumped through a tube to it he knows exactly how much to give it too much and it gets bigger and stronger too little and it shrivels hibernates when theyve worked out a way to handle it safely then theyll try to find out what makes it tick they the specialists from moscow said vyotsky shrugging the people from karl khuv stopped him with a word and jazz thought so even though im a prisoner and for all khuvs glasnost still there are sensitive areas eh specialists said khuv yes if they can find out about it maybe theyll also discover something of its world something else was bothering jazz what about these flamethrowers i keep seeing isnt it obvious vyotsky scowled are you stupid after all british concentrated fire kills them said khuv up to now its about the only thing that does that weve discovered anyway jazz nodded things were beginning to shape up in his head im starting to see the potential he said drily and no need to tell me where your specialists come from the department for the study of chemical and biological warfare on protze prospekt right khuv made no answer his mouth had fallen aslant in a twisted smile jazz nodded his own expression was a mixture of sarcasm and revulsion and how would that be for a biological weapon eh they had reached khuvs quarters he opened the door said would you like a drink or should i let karl take you back to your cell and toss you around a little to improve your manners his voice crackled like thin ice underfoot jazz had touched a tender spot the british agent was much quicker on the uptake than khuv had given him credit for jazz looked at vyotskys grinning face said oh i think id prefer the drink every time very well but try to remember you are in no position to criticize anything you are a spy a murderer a wouldbe saboteur and remember this too you dont know everything we dont know everything weapons likelike that personally i would rather close the place down concrete it in lock the gate shut forever if thats at all feasible so would viktor luchov but the projekt was sponsored indeed it was ordered by the defence agency we dont control anything michael but are ourselves controlled now make up your mind we can be friends or i can have someone else someone a lot less sympathetic complete your briefing its up to you briefing for some reason jazz didnt like the way khuv had used the word a slip of the tongue obviously briefing didnt really apply here did it why are you being given the treatment a voice asked in the back of his mind whats in it for them he didnt have the answers and so put the question aside said ok i accept that we all do what we have to we all have our orders but just answer me one more thing and after that i wont interrupt you again khuv ushered jazz and vyotsky into his living area very well he said what is it that thing in the glass tank your intruder from another world jazz wrinkled his nose in disgust you say it has a keeper someone who looks after it feeds it studies it its just that i cant imagine what kind of a man he would be he must have nerves of steel what vyotsky gave a snort that was halfway a laugh do you think he volunteered hes a scientist a small man with thick spectacles a man dedicated to science also to the bottle jazz raised an eyebrow an alcoholic khuvs expression didnt change very soon he said after a moments pause yes im afraid he will be three hours later at about pm after jazz had had delivered to him in his cell a cup of tepid flavourless coffee and a cold meat sandwich standard evening fare and after hed consumed both he lay on his back on his metal army bed and yet again turned over in his mind all the facts khuv had given him the russian had talked almost nonstop for an hour and a half during which time the british agent had remained true to his word and had not once interrupted him once khuv was underway jazz hadnt wanted to stop him anyway partly because the russians flow of words and images had been smooth and required no deep explanation but mainly because his story had been completely fascinating and now yet again jazz recapped the perchorsk incident or pi had been the disastrous test run of franz ayvazs subatomic shield after that mess clearing up had almost been completed when pill happened which khuv referred to as encounter one but from what the kgb major had told jazz it hadnt been so much an encounter as a downright nightmare the creature which had come through the sphere of light on that occasion had beenwell it had been the monstrosity jazz had seen on the film shot by the awacs reconnaissance aircraft over the hudson bay which now he realized was like nothing so much as the big brother of the thing in the glass tank but when big brother had squeezed its bulk into this world from its own khuvs description of encounter one as he himself had heard it from people present at the time had been graphic youve seen it michael on that film you told us about you know what it was like ah but that was only after it had escaped through the shaft into the ravine and got itself airborne on the ground it had been far worse oh yes and ill tell you about it from firsthand accounts first however ill try to explain how the gate works or ill describe what happens when it works the skin of the sphere its surface as we see it is in itself a contradiction of physics as we understand that science viktor luchov has likened it to an event horizon we see things on it after and even in advance of any given event in the former case as a sort of retinal afterimage printed in the sphere and in the latter as a gradual emergence until the whatever breaks through they actually saw that thing coming but they didnt know what they were seeing remember it was the first they saw it in the sphere a gradual darkening of part of the surface up near the spheres dome the dark patch became a shape the shape a sort of misty threedimensional picture and the image in a little while reality they saw the head and face of a bat four or five feet across like a hologram but slowly oh so slowly changing it was all in slow motion a fascinating thing to witness so they thought the wrinkling of the convolute snout which perhaps took half a minute the leaning forward of the ears a flicker of motion in realtime lasting all of five seconds the baring of the needle teeth each one of them six inches long which was accomplished with the speed of a yawn now think of it they had guns there were actually a handful of soldiers down there with weapons not for any specific purpose but simply because soldiers sometimes have guns but who would think to shoot at such a thing eh after the fact maybe but at the time listen to me do we shoot off guns at pictures on a screen that was what this was like a d film also viktor luchov was there do you think he would have let them shoot at it not a chance he didnt even know what the sphere was yet butit might well be his redemption in franz ayvazs absence he had still to answer for the perchorsk incident and now out of nowhere thisphenomenon its clarity had been improving for about an hour all the misty edges had firmed up until the image had the brilliance of a tv picture people had run to fetch cameras and were actually filming it like tourists filming ancient monuments or views of outstanding beauty after all they knew it couldnt be real what a bat with a head as huge as an elephants then quite suddenly without warning the impossible happened they realized that the snout had pushed through the skin of the sphere the monster was no longer just an image on a screen it sniffed inhaled sharply several times and in the next instant the nightmare was upon them the event horizon slows things down michael but once the gate is breached then all reverts to normal but normal for that obscenity was total hell for the people face to face with it i say it sniffed a huge bat sniffing its prey and it scented them and it changed the face and head that came through the skin were those of a vast wolf you saw the thing in the tank metamorphose it was like that the very same the giant wolfs head came through and then its shoulders but pushing them forward was a leathery bats body and great bat wings unfurling as wide as the sphere itself panic there was such panic as men rarely experience in a lifetime and to make it worse the thing didnt come into this world silently but screaming ah and what a voice it had it came howling its rage at the bright lights its hunger for the blood it had scented its fear of an alien environment and it slew but while it was doing this still it continued to emerge from the sphere now the rear end of the thing was like a vast centipede stampeding through the gate and threshing everywhere it changed endlessly became a dozen different hybrids in as many moments and each and every one of them murderous it snapped cables in its blind blundering blind yes for it couldnt bear the lights and a mercy it was blind for if not the carnage would have been that much worse but as it damaged the power supply many of the lights failed and its vision improved accordingly now it picked its victims with more deliberation and devoured them whole with a deal more dexterity but now too the soldiers were shooting at it those with the nerve for it anyway they couldnt tell if their bullets hurt but the massed gunfire certainly alarmed it it headed for the darkest place it could find the dimly lighted shaft of course by now it had changed into something very like the squirting squidthing your awacs aircrew filmed vast amazingly vast it squeezed and squirted its way through the magmass levels indeed in the way its plastic body flowed it was not unlike the magmass and as it went so it put out extrusions with mouths and with eyes and withoh appendages for which there is really no description imagine a leg sprouting from its side and then the leg itself becoming a scuttling spiderthing and you may have some idea of what im talking about but finally it was out into the ravine and in its wake a trail of death and destruction filled with the screams of the dead and the dying and the empty spaces which were all that remained of those who had vanished forever for a second time the perchorsk projekt was a shambles and somewhere in the world outside that monstrosity was on the loose and rampaging and no one had the faintest idea what to do about it if we russians have faults michael they are these we tend to be too well regimented in our thinking and we are not accustomed to failure so that when things go disastrously wrong we stand stunned uncomprehending like small children waiting for mama to tell us what to do next it was like that for khrushchev when kennedy faced him down and again for the shall we say responsible authorities over that stupid affair of the korean airliner if there are any more disasters in the offing it will doubtless be the same all over again just as it was here at perchorsk eventually the military were alerted and they in turn told moscow but can you imagine the reaction what something has got loose from perchorsk in the urals what sort of something what are you talking about but at last migs were sent up from kirovsk and the rest you already know indeed you know more than i do about that part of it but at least i know why the russian fighters failed while the usaf planes succeeded weve learned that much from the otherencounters its the reason for the flamethrowers thats right the american aircraft were equipped with experimental firedevil airtoair missiles which not only explode on impact but hurl searing flames all about less bulky than napalm but ten per cent more effective that is what stopped that thing over the hudson bay fire fire and light sunlight until the american fighters contacted it the thing had flown through or under fairly dense cloud cover and the sunlight wasnt strong yet but as the sun rose so the creature descended seeking protection for itself they are cold things michael and they are things of darkness youve described what you saw on that awacs film clouds of vile gasses boiling off the creatures surface in the bright sunlight and the way its vast flattened airfoil body shrank from the sun ah yes it wasnt so much that the migs failed but that other natural forces assisted the americans in their success the thing was halfbeaten before it met the americans and their firedevils finished it off well and that was the end of encounter one now a sort of anticlimax encounter two was a wolf it came through in just the same way as the first thing but by comparison it was so small and so normal that it almost went unnoticed but not quite a soldier spotted it first put a bullet in it the moment it came limping through the gate that stopped it but not fatally it was examined but oh so cautiously and found to bea wolf it was old mangy almost blind and close to starving they saved its life caged it fed and cared for it and subjected it to every test in the book because they werent quite sure they could trust it do you see butit was a wolf in every respect a brother of the creatures which even today hunt in the great forests of these parts by the time it died nine months ago of old age the animal was quite tame and so they thought perhaps the world on the other side isnt so very different from this one after all or perhaps this gateway weve opened leads to many other worlds viktor luchov thinks that as a physical phenomenon or as a phenomenon of physics it lies somewhere between a black hole and a white hole black holes sit out in the deeps of space and gobble up worlds and not even light can escape from their fantastic gravitational attraction white holes are the theoretical melting pots that give birth to galaxies both are gateways to and from other spacetimes likewise our sphere of white light but not nearly so violent which is why luchov calls it a grey hole a gateway in both directions at this point khuv had held up a warning hand dont break the thread now michael for were doing so well you can ask your questions later and when jazz had relaxed again myself ive no interest in the holes of advanced physics theory i simply call it a monstrous threat but that aside youve seen encounter three and ive told you about it as for four that was another anticlimax but not quite so ordinary or acceptable as the wolf it was a bat order chiroptera genus desmodus strangely vampyrum is the false vampire while desmodus and diphylla are the true bloodsuckers this one had a wingspread of point seven of a metre quite a large one of its species im told but by no means a giant it was seen coming well in advance of course and no chances were taken with it as it emerged in that selfsame moment they shot it dead but just as the wolf was a true wolf so the bat was a true bat curiously the vampire bat is a creature of south or central america perhaps our grey hole was a gateway not only to other worlds but also to other parts of this world anyway i was here by this time the rest of this account is firsthand oh and i can show you film of the bats emergence if you like not that youll learn anything more than ive already told you for it is exactly as ive described it ah but the fifth encounterthat was something entirely different at this juncture jazz had noted how vyotsky behind his dark beard had gone very pale again he too had been present for that fifth encounter get it over with the big kgb man had stood up gulped down his drink started to pace the floor tell him about it or show him the film but get done with it karl doesnt like it khuvs comment was entirely superfluous his smile cold and grim but then neither do i still likes and dislikes change nothing they cant alter the facts come ill show you the film in a second small room khuv had something of a study there were bookshelves a tiny desk steel chairs a modern projector and small screen vyotsky made no attempt to join jazz and his senior officer but poured himself another drink and stayed behind in khuvs livingroom jazz knew however that that was the only way out of khuvs quarters and that only a few scant paces and a bit of flimsy door panelling separated him from the huge kgb bully now too he had seen that his coming here had not been a spontaneous occurrence khuv had prepared himself in advance all he had to do was dim the lights and roll the film and whatever jazz had expected it certainly had not been what he saw the film was in colour had a sound track was very professional in every way at one side of the screen a dark fuzzy outoffocus shadow proved to be the side of a russian soldier with a glinting kalashnikov braced against his thigh centre screen was the sphere of white light or gate as jazz now thought of it and imposed on its dazzling surface the bottom of the picture coming just inches higher than the boards of the walkway where it spanned the gap between the saturnsrings platform and the sphere was the imageof a man the camera had then zoomed in turning the entire screen white and therefore that much less dazzling with the image of the man central he strode straight ahead looking directly into the camera his movements were so painfully slow that each pace took long seconds and jazz had found himself wondering if hed ever get here but then khuv had warned see how the picture clears a sure sign that hes about to come through but if i were you i wouldnt wait for that study him now while you can and obligingly the camera had closed on the mans face the forehead was sloped and the skull shaved except for a central lock of hair like a thick black stripe on the pale almost grey flesh swept back like a mane and tied in a knot the lock bobbed at the back of the mans neck his eyes were small and close together and very startling they glared out from under thick black eyebrows that met in a tangle across the bridge of a squat or flattened nose the ears were slightly pointed and had large lobes they lay flat to the head above hollow almost gaunt cheeks the lips were red and fleshy in a mouth slanted to the left and set with a sort of permanent sneer or snarl the mans chin was pointed made to look even more so by a small black beard waxed to a point but the faces main feature was that pair of small glaring eyes jazz had looked at them again red as blood theyd gleamed in deep black orbits as if sensing jazzs needs the camera had then drawn back to show the entire man again he wore a short pelmet of cloth about his loins sandals on his feet a large ring of golden metal in his right ear his right hand was gloved in a gauntlet heavy with spikes blades and hooks an incredibly cruel murderous weapon after that jazz had only sufficient time to note the mans leanness the ripple of his finetoned muscles and his wolfs lope of a walk before he stepped out of the sphere onto the walkway and then everything had speeded up the british agent came back to the present gripped the edge of his bed and drew himself into a sitting position he swung his feet to the floor and put his back to the metal wall the wall was cool but not cold through it jazz could feel the life of the subterranean complex the nervous irregular coursing of its frightened blood it was like being below decks in a big ship where the throb of the engines comes right through the floor and walls and bulkheads and just as hed be aware of the life in a ship so he was aware of the terror in this place there were men down there in that unnatural cavern in the heart of the mountain men with guns some of them had seen for themselves and others had been shown on films like the one jazz had seen what could come through the gate they guarded little wonder the perchorsk projekt was afraid he gave a small shiver then a grim chuckle hed caught the projekts fever its symptom was this shivering even when it was warm hed seen them all doing it and now he did it too jazz deliberately gave himself a mental shake forced himself to return to the film khuv had shown him wamphyri the man came right out through the sphere onto the walkway and then everything speeded up he shuttered his red eyes against the sudden light shouted an astonished denial in a language jazz halfway understood or felt he should understand and fell into a defensive crouch then the film had suddenly come alive before the sounds had seemed muted the occasional low cough nervous conversation feet shuffling in the background and now and then the springs of weapons being eased or tested and the unmistakable metallic clatter of magazines slapped into housings but all of it seeming dull and a little out of tune like the first few minutes of a film in a cinema where your ears are still tuned to the street and havent yet grown accustomed to the new medium of wall to wall sound now however the sound was very much tied to the film khuvs voice shouting take him alive dont shoot him ill court martial the first man who pulls a trigger hes only a man cant you see go in and capture him figures in combat uniforms ran past the camera caused the cameraman and therefore the film to jiggle a little burst into view on the screen and almost blotted out the picture having been ordered not to shoot they carried their weapons awkwardly seemed not to know what to do with them jazz could understand that theyd been told that hideous death lurked in the sphere but this seemed to be just a man how many of them would it take to cow just one man with an assortment of weapons at their fingertips they must feel like men swatting midges with mallets but on the other hand some damned weird things had come out of that sphere and they knew that too the man from the sphere saw them coming straightened up his red eyes were now at least partly accustomed to the light he stood waiting for the soldiers and jazz had thought this lad has to be six and a half feet if hes an inch yes and id bet he can look after himself too and certainly he would have won his bet the walkway was maybe ten feet wide the first two soldiers approached the nearnaked man from the sphere on both sides and that was a mistake shouting at him to put his hands up in the air and come forward the fastest of the two reached him made to prod him with the snout of his kalashnikov rifle with astonishing speed the intruder came to life he batted the barrel of the gun aside with his left hand swung the weapon he wore on his right hand shatteringly against the soldiers head the left side of the soldiers head caved in and the hooks of the gauntlet caught in the broken bones of his skull the intruder held him upright for a moment flopping uselessly like a speared fish but it was all nervous reaction for the blow must have killed him instantly then the man from the gate snarled and jerked his hand back freeing it and at the same time shouldered his victim from the walkway the soldiers body toppled out of sight the second soldier paused and looked back his face bloodless where the camera caught his indecision his comrades were hot on his heels outraged eager to bring this unknown warrior down made brave by their numbers he faced the intruder again and swung his rifle buttfirst toward his face the man grinned like a wolf and ducked easily under the blow at the same time swinging his gauntlet in a deadly arc it tore out the soldiers throat in a scarlet welter and knocked him sideways he went sprawling got to his knees and the intruder brought his weapon down on top of his head caving in his fur hat skull and all then the rest of the combatsuited figures were surging all around the warrior clubbing with their rifles and kicking at him with booted feet he slipped and went down under their massed weight howling his hatred and fury the yelling of the soldiers was an uproar over which jazz had recognized khuvs voice shouting hold him down but dont kill him we want him alive alive do you hear then khuv himself had come into view advancing onto the walkway and waving his arms frantically over his head pin him down he yelled but dont beat him to a pulp we want himin one piece the final three words were an expression of khuvs astonishment his disbelief and watching the film jazz had been able to see why had understood the change in khuvs voice had almost been able to sympathize with him for the strange warrior had quite genuinely slipped when he went down possibly in blood and that was the only reason hed gone down the five or six soldiers where they crowded him hampered by their weapons and desperate not to come in range of that terrible mincingmachine he wore on his right hand werent even a match for him one by one theyd rear up and back clutching at torn throats or mangled faces two of them went flying over the rim of the walkway plunging sixtyodd feet to the basinlike magmass floor another hamstrung as he turned away was kicked almost contemptuously into empty air by the warrior who finally stood gory and unfettered and alone on the redslimed boards of the walkway and then he had seen khuv and nothing between them but four or five swift paces across the planking flamethrower squad khuvs voice was hoarse almost a whisper in the sudden awed silence of the place to me quickly he hadnt looked back dared not for a moment take his eyes off the menacing man from the sphere but the warrior had heard him speak he cocked his head on one side narrowed his red eyes at khuv perhaps he took the kgb majors words for a challenge he answered a short harshly barked sentence probably a question in a language which once again jazz had felt he should understand a question which ended in the word wamphyri he took two paces forward repeated the enigmatic vaguely familiar words of the sentence and this time the last word wamphyri was spoken with more emphasis threateningly and with something of fierce pride khuv went down on one knee and cocked an ugly longbarrelled automatic pistol he pointed it waveringly at the warrior used his free hand to beckon men urgently forward from behind him flamethrower squad he croaked there had been no spittle in his throat nor in jazzs throat by the time the film had reached this point and then the warrior had loped forward again only this time he hadnt looked like stopping and the look on his face and the way he held his deadly gauntlet at the ready spoke volumes for his intentions the clatter of booted feet sounded and figures darkened the sides of the screen where men hurried forward but khuv wasnt waiting his own orders about the use of weapons were forgotten now so much hot air he held his automatic in both trembling hands fired pointblank twice at the menacing human deathmachine from the other side his first shot took the warrior in the right shoulder under the clavicle a dark blotch blossomed there like an ugly flower in the moment that he was thrown backwards sent sprawling on the boards the second shot had apparently missed him entirely he sat up touched the hole in his slumped shoulder stared in open astonishment at the blood on his hand but pain didnt seem to have registered at all not yet when it did a second later the warriors howl wasnt a human sound at all it was something far more primal than that it came from nightdark caverns in an alien world beyond strange boundaries of space and time and it was shocking and frightening enough to match the man himself he would have hurled himself at khuv indeed he crouched down and made ready to do so but the threeman flamethrower squad was in the way the machine they handled wasnt the small manpack variety that can be carried on one mans back it was a weighty thing consisting of a fuel tank on a motorized trolley which one man controlled while another walked alongside with the flameprojector the third member of the squad held a large flexible asbestos shield fragile protection against blowback the man from the sphere wounded though he was smashed his gauntlet weapon through the asbestos shield and almost succeeded in knocking it from the keepers hands before he could withdraw the gauntlet which seemed to be stuck khuv shouted show him your fire but only show it to him dont burn him perhaps they were a little too eager a jet of flame lashed out lapped at the warriors side where he screamed his rage and terror and turned away and when the fire was snuffed out at its source still chemical flames leaped up the mans body from his side burning away his beard eyebrows and setting fire to the single lock of black hair on his head he began to blister screamed his agony and beat at the flames with his left hand then he snatched the asbestos shield from the soldier who held it and hurled it at the squad before they could recover from this he turned and staggered still smoking back toward the shiny white sphere stop him khuv shouted shoot him but in the legs dont let him go back he began firing and the man jerked and staggered as bullets smashed into the back of his naked thighs and lower legs he had almost reached his objective when a lucky shot hit him behind the right knee and knocked him down but he was close enough to the sphere to try hurling himself into it except it threw him back it was as if hed tried to dive through a brick wall and at that moment watching the film jazz had known as those who had been present had known and everyone whod seen the film since that the gate was a mantrap like the pitcher plant it allowed its victims access then denied them egress once through the gate the creatures from the other side were stuck here and jazz had wondered would it be the same for someone going through from this side except of course there was no way anyone was ever going to find out was there now he has to come quietly khuv was jubilant as the firing ceased he ran down the walkway toward the flamethrower squad stood behind them watching the pitiful antics of the man from the gate at that moment jazz had found himself feeling sorry for the weird visitor but the moment had not lasted long the man sat up shook himself dazedly reached out a hand toward the shining sphere his hand met resistance could not proceed he got to his knees turned to face his tormentors his scarlet eyes opened wide and glared his hatred at them he hissed at them spat his contempt onto the walkway even with great yellow blisters bursting and seeping their fluid all down his right side crippled and helpless still he defied them khuv stepped to the fore pointed at the gauntlet on the warriors right hand take it off he made unmistakable gestures get rid of it now the man looked at his gauntlet and incredibly struggled to his feet khuv backed away aimed his gun take that bloody thing off your hand he demanded but the man from the sphere only smiled he looked at khuvs gun at the flameprojector whose nozzle pointed directly at him and smiled a twisted smile it was a strange expression combining triumph unbearable irony even sardonic sadness or melancholy but never a sign of fear wamphyri the man thumbed his chest lifting his head in pride thenhe laid back his head and literally howled the word wamphyri as the echoes of that cry died away he thrust his face forward and glared once more at the men on the walkway and there was that in his look which said do your worst you are nothing you know nothing the gauntlet khuv cried again pointing he fired a shot in the air for emphasis aimed his gun at the warriors heart but in the next moment he inhaled sharply audibly and let his air out in a gasp standing there on the walkway swaying a little from side to side the man from the sphere had opened his jaws opened them impossibly wide a forked tongue scarlet lashed in the cavern of his mouth the gape of his jaws expanded more yet they visibly elongated making a sound like tearing sailcloth and because all else was total silence and the rest of the tableau was frozen the sight and sounds of his metamorphosis were that much more vivid jazz had held his breath as he watched and now in his cell he held it again at the very memory of what hed seen the warriors fleshy lips had rolled back stretching until they split spurting blood and revealing crimson gums and jagged dripping teeth the entire mouth had resembled nothing so much as the yawning muzzle of a rabid wolf but the rest of the face had been as bad if not worse the squat flattened nose had grown broader developed convoluted ridges like the snout of a bat whose oval nostrils were shinyblack flaring pits in dark wrinkled leather the ears previously flat to the head had sprouted patches of coarse hair growing upward and outward to form scarletveined and nervously mobile shapes like fleshy conchs and in this respect too the effect was bat like or perhaps demoniac for certainly hell was written in those outlines was limned in the nightmarish expression of that face a visage which was part bat part wolf and all horror and still the change was incomplete the eyes which before were small and deepsunken had now grown large as gorged leeches until they bulged crimson in their sockets and the teeththe teeth gave a new meaning to nightmare for growing and curving up through the lacerated ribbons of the creatures gums those bone daggers had so torn his mouth that it filled to overflowing with his own blood and his teeth snarled through the blood like the awesome fangs of some primal carnivore as for the rest of his body that had remained mercifully anthropomorphic but through all of his metamorphosis his ravaged trunk and legs had taken on the dull gleam of lead and every inch of his body had vibrated with an incredible palsy but finally finally it was done and knowing what he was doing at last the man or thing from the sphere reached out its arms and took one more stumbling step forward and with that last lurching step in khuvs direction the creature gurgled wamphyri khuv had thought the thing was human and hed scarcely had time to recover from the shock of his error his nerves legs voice all of these things almost failed him and that would have been a fatal malfunction but in the last moment he stepped back out of range and croaked burn him it god burn the whores bastard to hell that was all the man with the hose had been waiting for he needed no further urging and it required only the pressure of his forefinger on the trigger a yellow jet of flame with a searing white core roared out from the nozzle broadened enveloped the horror from the gate for long seconds the squad hosed the thing down with chemical fire and it simply stood there then the shape in the heart of the fire crumpled seemed to melt down into itself collapsed into a sitting position stop khuv covered his face with a handkerchief the roaring stream of fire continued for a second or two hissed into silence as it was shut off at source but the alien warrior continued to burn fire leaped up from him rising six or seven feet above the black oval core which was his melting head and there turned to foul stinking smoke jazz hadnt been able to smell it but still hed known how it must have stank the flames burned lower hissing and crackling and the slumped shape shrank as its juices bubbled and boiled something that might have been a long tapering arm rose up from the tarry remains in the fire undulated like a crippled cobra in the clouds of smoke began a violent shuddering which ceased when it collapsed back into the mess on the burning walkway one more burst said khuv and the squad obliged and in a very short space of time it was finished then the film had come to an end and the screen flickered with white light but jazz and khuv had continued to sit and stare at the scenes burned in their minds only after the last inch of film clattered from its freespinning reel had khuv moved reaching to switch off the projector and turn up the lights after thatit had been time for another drink and rarely in jazzs life had alcohol been more welcome while michael j simmons sat on his bunk and thought about all the things hed seen and heard gradually the heartbeat or pulse of the complex slowed and took on something of a soft regularity outside it was night and so in here it was a time for sleeping but not all of the projekts staff and supporting units slept and as for the one creature in the complex which was neither human nor anything else of mans world that hardly seemed to sleep at all so thought its keeper vasily agursky where he sat with his chin and drawn cheeks cupped in the palms of his toolarge hands gazing at encounter three through the thick glass wall of its tank agursky was a small man no more than fivethree in height slender slopeshouldered and with a large head whose dome came shiny and pointed through its uneven halo of dirtygrey down behind thick lenses his magnified eyes were lightbrown in a pale face they were redrimmed tiredly mobile under thin but expressive eyebrows thinlipped and bigeared he looked somehow gnomish in a paradoxically uncomical sort of way the red lighting of the things room was turned low so as not to frighten it down out of sight beneath the sand of its tank it knew agursky and rarely became excited in his presence while he sat observing the thing with his skinny legs astride a steel chair and his elbows on the backrest so it sprawled on the floor of its tank watching him at present it was a leechthing with a rodent face a pseudopod sprouting from a spot on its rear lefthand side moved slowly on starfish feet independently examining pebbles and lumps of crusted sand then laying them aside the pseudopods single rudimentary eye was alert and unblinking the creature was hungry and agursky unable to sleep despite the halfbottle of vodka hed consumed had decided to come down here and feed it the queer thing was this that lately hed noticed how its moods seemed to affect him when it was restless so was he likewise when it was hungry tonight despite the fact that hed eaten fairly well during the day he had felt hungry and so hed known that it must be hungry too it didnt really need to eat not that hed been able to discover but it did like to offal from the cookhouse blood of slaughtered beasts the matted hides and hooves eyes and brains and guts which men scorned all of these things were grist for its mill ground up theyd all go in through its feeder tube and the thing in the tank would devour the lot what the hell are you agursky asked the creature for what must have been the thousandth time since it came into his care frustrating to say the least for if anyone should have known the answer to his question it was agursky himself zoology and psychology were his a subjects hed been brought in specifically to study the thing and find out what made it tick but all hed discovered so far was that it ticked after hed worked with it for only a month or so other scientists supposedly better qualified had come to see it agursky had been slacking apparently but theyd looked at it studied his notes shaken their heads and gone away baffled and hed been left to get on with it but get on with what he knew the creature as intimately as any man could possibly wish to know it and still he didnt know it its blood was similar to the blood of all earths myriad animals but sufficiently dissimilar to any of them as to make it alien on the scales of intelligence it was not a higher species not in comparison with man the dolphins canines apes and yet it did have a certain sly intelligence its eyes for example were nearhypnotic every now and then agursky had to stop staring it down and look away or he was liable to go to sleep the thing had put him to sleep on several occasions and nightmares had invariably brought him gibbering awake it could be taught but resisted learning it knew for instance that when its keeper showed it a white card food was coming also that a black card meant it was in danger of receiving an electrical shock it had learned painfully that white and black cards together meant dont touch the food until the black card is taken away but to show it those cards together would produce a great fury in it when food was available it did not like being denied it or threatened through it these were a few of the things agursky had learned about the creature but he would get the uncomfortable feeling just looking at it that it had learned far more about him another thing he knew about it was this that it had a capacity for hate and he knew who it hated feeding time he told it im going to pump some vile rancid goneoff shit in there with you and youre going to slurp it up like mothers milk and honey sweet from the comb you bloody thing doubtless it would prefer a live white rat or two but the sight of that had already given agursky too many bad dreams for that was something else hed learned about the thing in the tank that while it would take dead clotted blood readily enough it in fact preferred it straight from a perforated pulsing artery namely that it was a vampire as agursky stood up and began to prepare the feeding apparatus he remembered the first time hed tried the thing with a live rat that had meant first drugging the creature in the tank and putting it well and truly to sleep a small amount of blood containing a massive dose of tranquillizing agent had seen to that after the thing had groggily retreated beneath the sand of its tank to sleep then the heavy lid had been undamped and lifted and the wriggling rat inserted three hours later the thing had regained its senses and surfaced to see what was going on the rat hadnt stood a chance oh it had fought as only a cornered rat can fight but to no avail the vampire had held it down bitten through its neck and siphoned off its living blood and it had formed a pair of fleshy needletipped tubes to do so actual siphons which it had slid into the rats severed vessels the meal had taken only a minute or two to complete and agursky had never seen the creature so avid for its food after thatoccasionally the thing would take on certain rodent characteristics which its keeper assumed it had learned from the creature it devoured nor was devoured too strong a word for it for after leeching the rats blood then the creature had consumed skin bones tail and all from this and subsequent meals of living food agursky had drawn several conclusions however unproven encounter one had been a vampire or if not vampiric certainly it had been a carnivore it had been seen to devour men whole before it fled the complex encounter two the wolf was also a predator a flesheater four was a bat but specifically a vampire bat and fivehe had declared himself to be wamphyri was there anything at all in that world beyond the gate which was not vampiric or savagely carnivorous agurskys conclusion that world was not one he would care to visit to find out at first hand another speculation or line of thought which might lead to a number of unthinkable conclusions was this that three of the five encounters the five incursions from beyond had been shapechangers creatures which were not bound to one form the thing in the tank having examined and eaten a rat could now assume an imperfect rodent identity would it also be able to emulate a man which in turn begged the question was the wamphyri warrior a man with the ability to change his shape or had he been something else which now merely imitated a man morbid thoughts and questions such as these had driven agursky to drink and thinking them again now made him wish he had a bottle with him right here right now but he didnt the sooner he could get done with this the sooner hed be able to get back to his quarters and drink himself to sleep just inside the door stood a trolley with the creatures food in a lidded container the container was hooked up to an electric pump agursky wheeled the trolley closer to the tank and plugged in to the power supply he coupled up the containers outlet to a feeder tube in the end wall of the tank turned the valves on the container and tank to the open position and started the motor the electric motor was quietly efficient with a cough and a gurgle glutinous liquids commenced to flow as he worked agursky had been aware that the thing was watching him strangely it had not turned toward the food supply but remained in the position in which hed left it only its eyes had swivelled to follow his movements agursky was puzzled dark red lumps of minced meat in a stream of semiclotted beastblood were jetting in sporadic spurts into the tank forming a foul heap of guts on the sand at that end of the things lair and still it hadnt moved agursky frowned the creature could consume half its own weight at a time and it hadnt been fed for four days could it be sick was its air supply ok and now what the hell was it doing he went back to his chair and seated himself as before with his arms folded on the backrest and his chin resting on the back of his left hand the creature stared back at him through eyes which now seemed very nearly human its face too had lost much of its rodent identity and had taken on more nearly human outlines the leechlike body sac was elongating losing its dark colour and corrugations legs were developing and arms and breasts what agursky hissed the single word from between clenched teeth what the spurious pebbleexamining member shrank was withdrawn into the main mass of the body that body was now very nearly human in shape if nothing else it was like a girl even had a girls flowing hair but on the creatures head that mass of hair was coarse and lacklustre like the false hair of a poorly made doll the breasts were lumpy and without nipples like pallid blobs of flesh stuck on a flat male chest the size too was wrong for the thing only had the mass of a large dog which even remodelled made for a very small woman with every passing second the expression on agurskys face grew that much more disgusted the creature was attempting to resemble a woman but it was making a nightmarishly horrific job of it its hands had now shaped themselves into appendages very like human hands but the nails on the tooslender fingers were bright scarlet and far too long worse its feet were also hands the creature couldnt discriminate thenthe things simpering idiot face smiled at agursky and suddenly he knew where hed seen that smile before it was the face and smile even the hair of that sexstarved hag klara orlova a spindly theoretical physicist who was fascinated by the creature and occasionally came in here to admire it it had seen her face her hands with their brightly painted nails the upper roundness of her bosom where she wore that gown of hers unbuttoned to titillate the common soldiers but it didnt know she had nipples and it hadnt seen her feet at all it had simply assumed that her feet were like her hands agursky checked himself no for that would be to grant the thing too high a level of intelligence and he had already satisfied himself that it was not especially bright this mimicking was like the mindless humanseeming cry of a parrot or the ape wearing spectacles to read a book indeed it was less than the latter for it was purely instinctive like the colour change of a chameleon or better still the chameleons colour control plus the elasticity of the octopus even while he was thinking these thoughts the thing had been ironing out certain imperfections the skin tone was more nearly correct as was the painted cupids bow of the mouth the vampires nose and dark nostrils however were still ugly and alien ridged convoluted and quivering in its natural environment its sense of smell might well be its most important tool for survival to change that organs shape would be to drastically degrade its function in any event the final image which the thing presented for all that it was still wrong still grotesque was at least something ofan attempt but an attempt at what suddenly unreasonably agursky felt fury surging in him was thisthis damned flesheating slime actually trying to seduce him damn you you thing thats it isnt it he cried jumping to his feet you know the difference between us or at least you sense it and youd like to use it you think ill be a little nicer to my plastic bloodguzzling alien little whore if think i can maybe make love to it eh by god have you got the wrong man like a playful cat the thing stretched rolled on its back thrust its pale useless breasts at him there was no navel in its belly but a little below where a navel should be was a protuberant pulsing tube of flesh that could only be the things conception of a human vulva the sexual implications turned agursky white with rage in a moment the thing was trying to seduce him he yanked a black card from the pocket of his smock showed it to the halfsmiling halfgrimacing thing you see this you motherless monstrosity howd you like to dance for uncle eh you dont like that do you but it was a bluff and the creature knew it its limpid eyes looked through the glass this way and that all around the room but agursky hadnt brought the shockbox with him he was impotent to carry out his threat the gurgling crimson mess from the feeder tube continued to pump into the tank the container was almost empty and still the thing hadnt been tempted to start feeding but now as agursky tremblingly took his seat again a stream of scarlet seepage from the pile of offal found a zigzag route to the creature and touched its side the metamorphosis which took place in it then was rapid indeed its neck twisted round at an impossible angle to allow its quasihuman face to peer at the blood spreading round its flank then the face turned back and agursky saw that the things eyes had taken on the hue of the blood it had observed hell glared out of those eyes at him the grotesque imitation face began to melt into another shape another form the mouth widened until it spanned almost the entire face opened to display a cavernous gape where crooked needlesharp teeth lined a scarlet throat as far back as agursky cared to look and a forked snakes tongue vibrated in there the tips of the fork flickering this way and that between the slimedripping lips of the thing thats more like it agursky cried feeling that hed achieved something of a victory your little plan didnt work so now lets see you as you really are contact with the raw red pulp had triggered the things hunger ripped away its mask in the face of instinctive urges it was incapable of keeping up the deception exceptfor all the time hed spent with the creature agursky had never seen anything quite like this before its food was there and the thing from beyond the gate knew it but more than just hunger and bloodlust had been triggered and again the scientist wondered is it ill is it suffering and if so from what for as if the vibration of the tongue had been only the start of it the catalyst now the things entire body was beginning to tremble the human paleness of its protoplasm was turning a slaty almost leprous colour and tufts of coarse hair were sprouting everywhere limbs retracted withering back into the main mass and the vibrations of the whole began to come in regular almost seismic spasms watching it fascinated despite himself so that he was unable to take his eyes off it agurskys lips drew back from his yellow teeth in a silent snarl of loathing god the thing resembled nothing so much as a vast diseased placenta with a head but its crimson eyes still glared at him and even as he continued to observe it so the thing curled back its forked tongue to reach far back into its own throat its spasms became retching movements until finally the creature coughed its tongue back into view balanced in the slightly upward curving fork was a quivering mistedpearl sphere about as big as a small boys marble agursky quickly stood up went to the tank crouched down and stared hard at the strange blob of matter in the creatures gaping mouth whatever it was he could see that it was alive its surface was aswim with a pearly film but agursky believed he could see rows of flickering cilia around its circumference causing the sphere to turn vertically on its own axis where it rested in the fork of the things tongue now what he started to say but at that precise moment the creature thrust its head forward and its tongue uncoiled hurling the pearly sphere directly at the scientists face agursky automatically jerked back went sprawling on his backside a ridiculous reaction for of course the creature could do him no harm while the thick glass of the tank separated them that was where the shimmering blob of matter had landed flattening itself to the glass wall and clinging there but even as agursky stood up and shakily dusted himself down so the sphere was on the move it slipped down the inner wall of the tank came to rest however briefly on the bloodslimed sand and pebbles then it resumed its spherical shape floating like a pearly bubble on the film of blood and with its myriad flickering cilia propelling it it swiftly followed the stream back to its source beneath the feeder tube then an astonishing thing like a pingpong ball riding a jet of water the spheroid climbed the last thick trickle of gore to the tubes inlet and disappeared inside frowning jaw hanging slack agursky stepped to that side of the tank the valves were still open of course andit would be wonderful to isolate this thing this parasite is that what it was some parasitic creature inhabiting the aliens body perhaps but all sorts of ideas words were going through agurskys mind he had likened the creature itself to a placenta in the moment before it coughed this thing up maybe the connection hed made there hadnt been too wild after all the creature had seemed to undergo a sort of cataplasia a reversion of its cells and tissues to a more primitive almost embryonic form placenta cataplasia embryo protoplast egg agursky turned off the valves and pump pulled the trolley close and lifted the heavy lid of the food container inside central on the bottom of the container floating on a film of blood amidst a few lumps of red gristle and unidentifiable debris the pearly sphere whirled in a blur of almost invisible cilia agursky stared at it and shook his head in bewilderment in a moment of carelessness fascinated and simply forgetting what he was dealing with here he reached into the container and gently nudged the thing with the digit finger of his right hand in the moment of contact he realized the folly of his action but it was already too late the spheroid turned blood red in a moment and ran up his hand under the cuff of his white laboratory smock agursky gave a gurgling cry rearing up and back away from the trolley he could feel the spheroid wetly mobile on his forearm moving swiftly to his upper arm his shoulder in a moment it was on his neck coming out from under his collar dancing like a maniac he cursed and slapped at the thing felt it damp against his palm and for a single instant of time believed hed crushed it but then it was on the back of his neck which was exactly where it wanted to be the vampire egg soaked like quicksilver through agurskys skin and settled on his spinal column incredible pain at once filled his body his limbs his brain out of sheer reaction like a man grasping a live cable he bounded bounded again and again he crashed into a wall lurched dizzily away from it crumpled to his knees somehow he forced himself upright again waded across the room through an ocean of pain he must do something but this hideousthis unbearable red rockets were bursting burning in his brain someone something was dripping acid on nerveendings which were as raw as if recently severed agursky screamed and as the entire world began to turn crimson saw his only possible salvation the black alarm button in its redframed glass box on the wall even as he passed out he summoned sufficient strength to throw a punch at the glass box harry keogh necroscope harry sat on the rim of the river and talked to his mother he believed he was alone and unobserved but it would make no difference anyway no one would object to a crazy hermit sitting on a riverbank talking to himself he suspected that a handful of locals thought of him that way as an eccentric recluse someone to be regarded warily but mainly harmless he suspected it and didnt much care one way or the other in their position hed probably feel the same way about it indeed he sometimes wished he was in their position normal commonorgarden everyday people homo sapiens with normal lives to lead but he wasnt in their position he was in his and it could hardly be described as normal he was a necroscope and as far as he knew he was the only necroscope in the world there should be at least one other like him his son but harry jnr was no longer in the world or if he was harry didnt know where harry looked down between his knees and dangling legs at his own face mirrored on the surface of the water he watched its blank expression turn to a cynical scowl his own face indeed for to complicate matters it wasnt his face at all or it was now but it had been the face of alec kyle onetime head of british ebranch and yet harry also seemed to see himself the harry keogh hed once been superimposed over the strangers face making up a composite mask which wasnt really strange at all not any longer but it had taken him eight long years to get used to it eight years of waking up in the mornings of looking in the mirror and thinking jesus whos this until in the end the question had been merely academic hed known who it was himself in mind if not in body harry his mothers suddenly anxious voice broke in on his mental paradox you know you really shouldnt worry any more about things like that that side of your life is over done with you were called to do a job and you did it you did more than any other man could possibly have done and for all that there have beenwell changes you know that youre still you but in another mans body he answered wryly alec was dead harry she made the point bluntly for there was no other way to make it he was worse than dead for there was nothing left of his mind at all not even of his soul and anyway you had no choice harrys thoughts spurred by his mothers words carried him back back to that time eight years ago alec kyle had been on a mission to romania to destroy the remains of a human vampire in the ground there thibor ferenczy had been dead but hed left part of himself in the earth to pollute it and to pollute anyone who went near it kyle had succeeded burned the thing and was on the point of returning to england when soviet espers had picked him up flown in secrecy to russia to the chateau bronnitsy the then hq of soviet ebranch hed been subjected to a particularly horrific method of brainwashing his mind had been electronically drained his brain literally emptied of knowledge all knowledge it wasnt merely a question of hot white lights the rubber hose truthdrugs and the like the very contents of his mind had been forcibly needlessly extracted like a good tooth and thrown away and in the process soviet telepaths had stolen the bits that were useful to them all the secrets of their enemies the british espers when theyd finished with kyle hed been alive been kept alive for the time being but his brain had been completely vacant dead taken off lifesupport his body too would die and that had been the intention of his tormentors to let him die and have his corpse dumped in west berlin there wouldnt be a pathologist in the whole wide world who could state with any certainty what had killed him that was to have been the scenario exceptwhile alec kyle had been a husk an empty mind in a living body the then harry keogh had been mind alone incorporeal a bodiless inhabitant of the mobius continuum harry had searched for kyle found him and the rest had been almost beyond his control nature abhors a vacuum whether in the physical or metaphysical worlds the normal universe had no use for an incorporeal being and kyles brain had been an aching void thus harrys mind had become one with kyles body since thena great deal had happened since then harry forced the scowl from his face stared harder at his image in the calm river water his hair was russetbrown plentiful and naturally wavy but in the last eight years a lot of the lustre had disappeared and streaks of grey had become very noticeable it would not be too long before the grey overtook and ruled the brown and harry not yet thirty his eyes too were honeybrown very wide very intelligent and very innocent even now for all hed seen experienced and learned innocent it could be argued that certain murderers have the same look but in harry the innocence was mainly genuine he had not asked to be what he was or to be called upon to do the things hed done his teeth were strong not quite white a little uneven they were set in a mouth which was unusually sensitive but could also be cruel caustic he had a high brow which now and then hed search for freckles the old harry used to have freckles but no longer as for the rest of harrys body it had been wellfleshed maybe even a little overweight once with its height however that hadnt mattered a great deal not to alec kyle whose job with ebranch had been in large part sedentary but it had mattered to harry hed trained his new body down got it to a peak of condition it wasnt bad for a fortyyearold body but better if it was only thirty like harry himself youre at odds with yourself again harry said his mother whats bothering you son is it brenda still and little harry no use denying it he gruffly answered with something of an irritable shrug you never met him did you hed have been able to talk to you too you know buti still cant get over the way he did it its one thing to lose somebody or even two somebodies but quite another to be left wondering why he could have told me where he was taking her could have explained his reasons after all it wasnt my fault she was like she was was it maybe it was i dont know any more his mother had heard all of this before she knew what he meant intimately understood his otherwise vague words and expressions even his tone of voice for while he didnt need to he usually spoke out loud to her he didnt need to because he was a necroscope and also because she was dead and had been since harry was an infant she was down there where shed been for more than twentyseven years in the mud and the weeds of the river murdered all that time ago by harrys stepfather yes and now that same traitor was down there with her put there by harry but hed stopped speaking to anybody long ago why not look at it from their point of view his mother said reasonably brenda had been through an awful lot for a small village girl maybe she simplywell wanted to get away from it all for a while anyway for eight years there was a brittle edge to harrys voice but having made the break his mother hurriedly went on at her diplomatic best she found she was happier and he could see she was happier and so they didnt come back after alls said and done your main concern was for their happiness wasnt it harry and youd be the first to admit that you werent the man shed married well not exactly oh and he could picture her hand flying to her mouth even though he knew she no longer had either of those things alas shed stumbled over her own argument speaking not only her mind but harrys too i mean its all right he stifled her i know what you mean and youre right as far as you go but because she had tried to be diplomatic she hadnt gone far enough and harry knew that too what had happened back then eight years ago was this in the mobius continuum harry had discovered by chance the elements of an insidious plot which was unfolding in the mundane world the vampire thibor ferenczy had set in motion a gradual metamorphosis in a child as yet unborn he had physically defiled an innocent unsuspecting mothertobe causing something of himself to attach and cling to her foetal child now that child was grown to a youth yulian bodescu and as he had developed so his potential for evil had outstripped his human and humane side to achieve a monstrous vampire dominance the task of the british ebranch had been twofold to seek out and destroy whatever remained of lingering vampire influences in the ussr and her satellites and so ensure that the bodescu situation could never arise again also to destroy yulian bodescu himself through whom thibor had determined to terrorize the world anew but bodescu had discovered the covert workings of ebranch specifically their plot and determination to put him down and had turned his awesome emerging vampire powers and cold cruel fury upon them his principal adversary in the branch had been the incorporeal harry keogh who at that time was trapped in the psyche of his own infant son kill harry jnr and bodescu would also rid himself of harry after thatthe remaining members of ebranch could be tracked down and picked off one by one at the vampires discretion this was a scheme monstrous enough in itself but the true horror of the situation would lie in the aftermath of such a bloodbath for then there would be no stopping bodescu who could create almost at will an army of undead followers which would spread like a dark plague across the face of the entire earth and this was a very real possibility for while bodescu had become one of the wamphyri he did not have their selfdiscipline they were essentially territorial they had their cold pride they were solitary and cautious and usually firmly in control of their own destinies most of all they were jealous of their powers deviously protective of their wamphyri nature and history aware and appreciative of human skills and ingenuity only let mankind become aware that they were real and not merely creatures of myth and legend and men would strive to hunt them down and destroy them forever but yulian bodescu was selftaught he had had no wamphyri instruction he was none of the things which had made them what they were and possessed none of their dubious qualities he was only a vampire and he was insane brenda and her monthsold infant son harry jnr were living in a garret flat in hartlepool on the northeast coast of england when matters finally came to a head leaving a trail of bloodshed and destruction behind him bodescu evaded ebranchs attempts at entrapment fled his home in devon and travelled north having inherited his mentors expertise in hideous necromancy he could examine the desecrated corpses of his victims and read in their brains and blood and guts all of their innermost secrets this was his intention in respect of the two harrys father and son to murder them and steal the secrets of the necroscope and so discover the nature and properties of the metaphysical mobius continuum ebranch closing on the devon house to destroy it missed their main quarry but discovered unthinkable horror there bodescus aunt uncle and cousin had been tortured and vampirized his huge black dog was something more than a mere dog a semiplastic thing inhabited the earth under the extensive cellars and bodescus mother was quite out of her mind from the unbearable knowledge of what yulian had become the house and all who dwelled in it were put to the torch ebranch had men in hartlepool psychically talented people who were keeping a low profile in and around the edwardian building which housed brendas flat the local police and special branch had also been informed that the woman and child in the garret rooms were possible targets for an escaped lunatic their presence hardly deterred the vampire he invaded the building killed all who stood before him mercilessly and with dreadful efficiency and finally reached his objective but where the incorporeal harry keogh himself had been impotent his infant son was anything but his fathers freakish powers had come down to him he could talk to the dead could even call them up from their graves in the cemetery across the road from the house harry snr had considered himself trapped in the babys psyche but this had not been the case the infant had held him there for one reason only to explore harrys mind and learn from it physically he was a baby apparently helpless but mentally harry jnrs talents were already vaster far than anything his father possessed or ever dreamed of achieving and his potential was enormous all the theory was there in the childs mind and only practical application experience was missing but not for long brenda attempting to protect her infant son from the incredible nightmare which was yulian bodescu had been tossed aside by the vampire unconscious she had not seen the final confrontation thinking back on that scene in the flat now harry remembered it as vividly as if it were yesterday the two harrys had looked out through the infants eyes into the face of terror itself the face of yulian bodescu crouched over the babys cot the leering malignancy of his eyes spoke all too clearly of his intentions finished harry had thought all done and it ends like this no another voice not his own had spoken in his mind no it doesnt through you ive learned what i had to learn i dont need you that way any more but i do still need you as a father so go save yourself it could only have been one person speaking to him doing it now for the first time when there was no longer any time to question the hows and whys of it thenharry had felt the childs restraints falling from him like broken chains leaving him free again free to will his incorporeal mind into the safety of the mobious continuum he could have gone right there and then leaving his son to face whatever was coming he could have gone but he couldnt bodescus jaws had yawned open like a pit revealing a snakes tongue flickering behind gleaming dagger teeth go little harry had said again with more urgency youre my son harry had cried damn you i cant go i cant leave you to this leave me to this it had been as if the infant couldnt follow his reasoning but then he had and said but did you think i was going to stay here the beasts taloned hands were reaching for the child in his cot little harry had seen the lust in the monsters eyes he turned his small round head this way and that seeking a mobius door a door had appeared floating up out of his pillows it was easy instinct in his genes it had been there all along his control over his mind was awesome over his body much less certain but hed been able to manage this much bunching inexpert muscles hed curled himself up rolled into and through the mobius door the vampires hands and jaws had closed on thin air after that it had been all up for yulian bodescu harry had not called up the dead from the local graveyard but his son had for the dead had learned to love this child who talked to them who had talked to them even from the womb they loved him even as they loved and trusted his father and if harry jnr was in trouble that was all the incentive they needed to move limbs stiffened by death to will back into pseudolife tissues and sinews long turned to leather and ravaged by the worm they had pinned the vampire down staked him out between their own yawning graves lopped his harshly screaming head from his body and burned him to ashes and harry snr no longer imprisoned but once more master of the mobius continuum had watched them do it and instructed them when they faltered laterharry had discovered that his infant son had not only saved his own life but also removed his unconscious mother from danger the child had used mobius or zollnerist metaphysics to move both himself and brenda to a place of safety indeed to the safest possible place ebranch hq in london and harry had been left to pursue his own destiny and inhabit the shell of the oncealec kyle this he had done and in the process destroyed the kgbs new toy the soviet espionage centre at the chateau bronnitsy after thatit should have been a time for relaxation a time to pause and take stock make adjustments realign lives but the staff of ebranch jubilant over their triple success the elimination of yulian bodescu the termination of residual vampire sources abroad and the destruction of russias kgbcorrupted esper corps hadnt fully appreciated the stresses harry and his family had suffered now that the job was done they wanted the entire thing pegged out mapped recorded studied and more fully understood and the only man who understood all of it was harry for a month he gave them what they wanted even considered taking on the job of director of ebranch but over that same period of time it had become increasingly apparent that all was not well with brenda as harrys mother had so recently pointed out there was hardly any mystery that anyone could attach to that indeed brendas breakdown was only to have been expected might even have been anticipated after all shed only recently become a mother and was still recovering from an uncomfortable confinement and difficult birth indeed for a little while the doctors had thought theyd lost her add to this the fact of her husbands talent which she had known and which had preyed on her mind for months the fact that her infant child seemed to possess similar and even more frightening powers so that even in the midst of ebranch men who were themselves espendowed he was looked upon as something of a freak the fact that harry was now a different person a person who was harry with all of his past his memories and mannerisms but living in a total strangers body the fact of the absolute terror she had endured through that night face to face with the monster yulian bodescu whose like she couldnt possibly have imagined even in her worst nightmares little wonder the poor girls mind had started to give way under the strain on top of all of which she hated london and couldnt return to hartlepool her old flat was poison to her now where monstrous memories dwelled and gradully as her mental connections with the real world were eroded so her visits to various specialists and psychiatric clinics increased until one morning she and the baby theyd gone harry said it out loud they werent there they werent anywhere that ive been able to discover and what gets to me most is that there was no warning no hint he simply up and took hersomewhere and you know he never spoke to me after that first time in the flat when yulian bodescu almost had us he never once spoke to me he could have hed look at me in that way babies have and i knew he could have spoken to me but he never did harry sighed shrugged so maybe he blamed me too maybe they both did and who can say they werent right to blame me if i hadnt been the way i was oh his mother was angry now she didnt like the tone of selfpity which had started to creep into harrys voice where was all that quiet strength hed used to have if you hadnt been what you were and boris dragosani still alive in russia and yulian bodescu spreading heavenonlyknows what evil through the world and the myriad dead cast off and forgotten lost and lonely thinking their dead thoughts forever in the cold earth and never knowing that they werent really alone at all but youve changed all that harry and theres no way back hah if you werent what you are indeed he nodded to himself thinking that of course she was right then picked up a pebble and tossed it in the water so that its ripples shivered his image into ribbons still he said as his face slowly reformed id like to know where they went id like to be sure theyre ok are you certain ma that you havent heard anything from the dead harry theres not one of us who doesnt want to help believe me if brenda and little harry werewith us youd be the first to know of it wherever they are theyre alive son you can rely on that he frowned and tiredly rubbed at his forehead you know ma i cant figure it out if anyone could find them it has to be me and i havent even found a trace of them when they disappeared i got those people at ebranch on it they couldnt find them a couple of them even approached me cautiously with the idea and with a little sensitivity you understand that maybe brenda and the baby were dead by the time i handed the job over to darcy clarke six months later everyone seemed sure they were dead now ebranch has people who could find anybody anywhere spotters who can pick up psychic emanations on the other side of the world but they couldnt find my son and little harrys talent was far and away greater than mine but your people they say theyre alive that they have to be alive because they dont number amongst the dead and i know that none of you would ever lie to me so i think to myself if theyre not dead and theyre not here where i can find them then where the hell are they thats whats eating away at me he could sense her nod feel how sad she was for him i know son i know and as for physically searching for them he went on as if he hadnt heard her is there anywhere in this world where i didnt look but if ebranch couldnt find them what chance did i stand harrys mother had heard all of this before it was his obsession now his one passion in life he was like a gambler hooked on roulette whose one dream is to find the system where none exists hed spent almost five years searching and nearly three more planning the various stages of the search to no avail she had tried to help him every step of the way but so far it had been a long bitterly disappointing road harry stood up dusted a little soil from his trousers im going back to the house now ma im tired i feel like ive been tired for a long time i think i could use a good long rest sometimes i think it would be good if i could just stop thinkingabout them anyway she knew what he meant that hed reached the end of the road that there was nowhere else he could look thats right he said turning away from the riverbank nowhere else to look and not much purpose to it anyway not much purpose to anything any more head down he bumped into someone who at once took his arm to steady him at first harry didnt recognize the man but recognition quickly followed darcy darcy clarke harry began to smile only to feel the smile turning sour on his face oh yes darcy clarke he said more slowly this time and you wouldnt be here if you didnt want something i thought id already made it clear to you people im through with all of that clarke studied his face a face hed known well from the old days when it had belonged to someone else there were more lines than there used to be and there was also something more of character not that alec kyle had been without character but harrys had gradually imprinted itself on the flesh also there was weariness in that face and signs that thered been a lot of pain too harry clarke said did i hear you telling yourself just now that theres no purpose to anything is that how youre feeling harry glanced at him sharply how long were you spying on me clarke was taken aback i was standing there by the wall he said i wasnt spying harry buti didnt want to disturb you thats all i mean he nodded toward the river this is where your mother is isnt it harry suddenly felt defensive he looked away then looked back and nodded he had nothing to fear from this man yes he said shes here it was my mother i was talking to without thinking clarke glanced quickly all about you were talking to then he looked once more at the quiet flowing river and his expression changed in a lowered voice he said of course id almost forgotten had you harry was quick off the mark you mean that isnt what you came to see me about then he relented a little ok come on back to the house we can talk as we go as they made their way through brittle gorse and wild bramble clarke unobtrusively studied the necroscope not only did harry seem a little vacant abstracted but his style in general seemed to have suffered he wore an opennecked shirt under a baggy grey pullover thin grey trousers scuffed shoes on his feet it was the attire of someone who didnt much care youll catch your death of cold clarke told him with genuine concern the ebranch head forced a smile didnt anyone tell you well soon be into november they walked along the riverbank toward the large victorian house brooding there behind its high stone garden wall the house had once belonged to harrys mother then to his stepfather and now it had come down naturally to harry times not something i worry about a lot harry eventually answered when i feel its getting colder ill put more clothes on but it doesnt matter much right said clarke there doesnt seem to be much purpose to it or to anything which means you havent found them yet im sorry harry now it was harrys turn to study clarke the head of ebranch had been chosen for that job because after harry he was the obvious candidate clarkes talent guaranteed continuity he was what they called a deflector the opposite of accidentprone he could walk through a minefield and come out of it unscathed and if he did step on one it would turn out to be a dud his talent protected him and that was all it did but it would ensure that hed always be there that nothing and no one would ever take him out as two heads before him had been taken out darcy clarke would die one day for sure all men do but it would be old age that got him but to look at clarke without knowing thisno one would ever have guessed he was in charge of anything and certainly not the most secret branch of the secret service harry thought hes probably the most perfectly nondescript man middleheight mouseyhaired with something of a slight stoop and a tiny paunch but not overweight either he was just about middlerange in every way and in another five or six years hed be just about middleaged too pale hazel eyes stared back at harry from a face much given to laughter which harry suspected hadnt laughed for quite some little time despite the fact that clarke was well wrappedup in dufflecoat and scarf still he looked cold but not so much physically as spiritually thats right the necroscope finally answered i havent found them and thats sort of killed off my drive is that why youre here darcy to supply me with a new purpose a new direction something like that clarke nodded i certainly hope so anyway they passed through a door in the wall into harrys unkempt back garden which lay gloomy in the shade of gables and dormers where the paint was flaking and high windows looked down like frowning eyes in a haughty face everything had been running wild in that garden for years brambles and nettles grew dense crowding the path so that the two men took care where they stepped along the crazypaving to a cobbled patio area beyond which sliding glass doors stood open on harrys study the room looked dim dusty foreboding clarke found himself hesitating on the threshold enter of your own free will darcy said harry and clarke cast him a sharp glance clarkes talent however told him that all was well there was nothing to drive him away from the place no sudden urgency to depart the necroscope smiled if wanly a joke he said tastes are like attitudes given a different perspective they change clarke stepped inside home said harry following him and sliding the doors shut in their frames dont you think it suits me clarke didnt answer but he thought well your taste was never what i would have called flamboyant certainly the place suits your talent harry waved clarke into a cane chair seated himself behind a blocky oak desk dark with age clarke looked all about and tried to draw the room into focus its gloom was unnatural the room was meant to be airy but harry had put up curtains shutting out most of the light except through the glass doors finally clarke could keep it back no longer a bit funereal isnt it he said harry nodded his agreement it was my stepfathers room he said shukshin the murdering bastard he tried to kill me you know he was a spotter but different to the others he didnt just smell espers out he hated them indeed he wished he couldnt smell them out the very feel of them made his skin crawl drove him to rage drove him in the end to kill my mother too and to have a go at me clarke nodded i know as much about you as any man harry hes in the river isnt he shukshin so if it bothers you why the hell do you go on living here harry looked away for a moment yes hes in the river he said where he tried to put me an eye for an eye and the fact that he lived here doesnt bother me my mothers here too remember ive only a handful of enemies among the dead the rest of them are my friends and theyre good friends they dont make any demands the dead he fell silent for a moment then continued anyway shukshin served his purpose if it hadnt been for him i might never have gone to ebranch and i mightnt be here now talking to you i might be out there somewhere writing the stories of dead men clarke like harrys mother felt and was disturbed by his gloomy introspection you dont write any more they werent my stories anyway like everything else they were a means to an end no i dont write any more i dont do much of anything abruptly he changed the subject i dont love her you know eh brenda harry shrugged maybe i love the little fellow but not his mother see i remember what it was like when i did love her of course i do because havent changed but the physical me is different ive a new chemistry entirely it would never have worked brenda and me no thats not whats wrong with me that isnt what gets to me its not knowing where they are knowing that theyre there but not knowing where thats what does it there were enough changes in my life at that time without them going off too especially him and you know for a while i was part of him that little chap however unwillingly unwittingly i taught him much of what he knows he got it from my mind and im interested to know what use hes made of it but at the same time i realize that if they hadnt gone she and i would have been finished long ago anyway even if shed recovered fully and sometimes i think maybe its best they did go away and not only for her sake but his too all of this had flooded out of harry poured out of him without pause clarke was pleased he believed he glimpsed a crack in the wall maybe harry was discovering that sometimes it was good to talk to the living too without knowing where hed gone you thought maybe it was the best thing for him whys that he said harry sat up straighter and when he spoke his voice was cold again what would his life have been like with ebranch he said what would he be doing now aged nine years old eh little harry keogh jnr necroscope and explorer of the mobius continuum is that what you think clarke kept his voice even what you think of us it could be that harry was right but clarke liked to see it differently hed have led whatever life he wanted to lead he said this isnt the ussr harry he wouldnt have been forced to do anything have we tried to tie you down have you been coerced threatened made to work for us theres no doubt about it but that youd be our most valuable asset but eight years ago when you said enough is enoughdid we try to stop you from walking we asked you to stay thats all no one applied any pressure but he would have grown up with you harry had thought it all out many many times before hed have been imprinted maybe he could see it coming and just wanted his freedom eh clarke shook himself physically shrugged off the mood the other had begun to impose upon him hed done part of what he came to do hed got harry keogh talking about his problems now he must get him talking and thinking about far greater problems and one in particular harry he said very deliberately we stopped looking for brenda and the child six years ago wed have stopped even sooner except we believed we had a duty to you even though youd made it plain you no longer had one to us the fact is that we really believed they were dead otherwise wed have been able to find them but that was then and this is now and things have changed things had changed slowly clarkes words sank in harry felt the blood drain from his face his scalp tingled they had believed they were dead but things had changed harry leaned forward across the desk almost straining toward clarke staring at him from eyes which had opened very wide youve foundsome sort of clue clarke held up placating hands imploring restraint he gave a halfshrug we may have stumbled across a parallel case he said or it may be something else entirely you see we dont have the means to check it out only you can do that harry harrys eyes narrowed he felt he was being led on that he was a donkey whod been shown a carrot but he didnt let it anger him if ebranch did have somethingeven a carrot would be better than the weeds hed been chewing on he stood up came round the desk began pacing the floor at last he stood still faced clarke where he sat then youd better tell me all about it he said not that im promising anything clarke nodded neither am i he said he glanced with disapproval all about the room can we have some light in here and some air its like being in the middle of a bloody fog again harry frowned had clarke got the upper hand as quickly and as easily as that but he opened the glass doors and threw back the curtains anyway then talk he said sitting down carefully again behind his desk the room was brighter now and clarke felt he could breathe he filled his lungs leaned back and put his hands on his knees theres a place in the ural mountains called perchorsk he said thats where it all started mobius trippers darcy clarke got as far as pill the mysterious object shot down over the hudson bay but without yet explaining its nature when harry stopped him so far the necroscope complained while all of this has been very interesting i dont see how its got much to do with me or with brenda and harry jnr clarke said but you will you see its not the sort of thing i can just tell you part of or only the bits youre going to be interested in if you dont see the whole picture then the rest of it will be doubly difficult to understand anyway if you do decide youd like in on this youll need to know it all ill be coming to the things youll find interesting later harry nodded all right but lets go through to the kitchen could you use a coffee instant im afraid ive no patience with the real thing coffee would be fine said clarke and dont worry about your instant anything has to be good after the gallons of stuff i drink out of that machine at hq and following harry through the dim corridors of the old house he smiled for all the necroscopes apparently negative response clarke could see that in fact he was starting to unwind in the kitchen clarke waited until harry brought the coffee to the large wooden kitchen table and seated himself then started to take up the story again as i was saying they shot this thing down over the hudson bay now wait said harry ok i accept that youre going to tell it your own way that being the case id better know the bits round the edges too like how your lot got interested in perchorsk in the first place actually by accident clarke answered we dont automatically get called in on everything you know were still very much the silent partner as it were when it comes to the countrys security no more than halfadozen of her majestys lads in whitehall and one lady of course know that we even exist and thats how we prefer to keep it as always it makes funding difficult not to mention the acquisition of new technology toys but we get by gadgets and ghosts thats always been the way of it were a meeting point but only just between superscience and the socalled supernatural and thats how were likely to stay for quite some little time but since the bodescu affair things have been relatively quiet our psychics get called in a lot to help the police indeed theyre relying up on us more and more all the time we find stolen gold art treasures arms caches we even supplied a warning about that mess at brighton and a couple of our lads were actually on their way down there when it happened but by and large were still very much lowkey so we dont tell everything and alas we dont get told everything even the people who do know about us have difficulty seeing how computerized probability patterns can work alongside precognition weve come a long way but lets face it telepathy isnt nearly as accurate as the telephone isnt it harrys sort with the dead was one hundred per cent accurate not if the other side knows youre listening in no but it is more secret harry pointed out and clarke sensed the acid in his tone so how did you accidentally learn about perchorsk we got to know about it because our comrades at perchorsk didnt want us to ill explain do you remember ken layard the locator of course i remember him harry answered well it was as simple as that ken was checking up on a bit of russian military activity in the urals covert troop movements and whatnot and he met with resistance there were opposed minds there soviet espers who were deliberately smothering the place in mental smog now a degree of animation showed in harrys pale face especially in his eyes which seemed to brighten appreciably so his old friends the russian espers had regrouped had they he nodded grimly soviet ebranch is back in business eh obviously said clarke oh weve known about them for some time but after what you did to the chateau bronnitsy theyve not been taking any chances theyve been even more lowkey than we are they have two centres now one in moscow right next door to the biological research laboratories on protze prospekt and the other in mogocha near the chinese border mainly keeping a wary eye on the yellow peril and this lot at perchorsk harry reminded him a small section clarke nodded established there purely to keep us out as far as we can tell anyway but what on earth can the soviets be doing there that rates so high on their security list eh after pill we decided wed better find out the mi branches owed us favours we learned that they were trying to put one of their agents a man called michael j simmons in there and so we well we sort of hitched a lift you got to him harry raised an eyebrow how and more to the point since hes one of ours anyway why quite simply because we didnt want him to know clarke seemed surprised that harry hadnt fathomed it for himself what with soviet espers crawling all over the place we should openly establish a telepathic link with him or something no we couldnt do that for their psychics would be onto him in a flash so we sort of bugged him instead and since he was in the dark about it we decided not to tell his bosses at mis either lets face it you cant talk about what you dont know about now can you harry gave a snort no of course not he said and after all why should the left hand tell the right one what its doing eh they wouldnt have believed us anyway clarke shrugged off the others sarcasm they only understand one sort of bugging they couldnt possibly have understood ours we borrowed something belonging to simmons for a little while thats all and gave it to one of our new lads david chung to work on a chinaman again the raised eyebrow chinese yes but a cockney actually clarke chuckled born and raised in london hes a locator and scryer and damned good at it so we took a cross simmons wears and gave it to chung simmons thought hed mislaid it and we arranged for him to find it again meanwhile david chung had developed a sympathetic link with the cross so that he would know where it was at any given time and even be able to see or scry through it like using a crystal ball it worked too for a while anyway oh harrys interest was waning again he never had thought much of espionage and had considered espionage the lowest of all its many forms yet another reason why hed left ebranch deep down inside he thought of espers who used their talents that way as psychic voyeurs on the other hand he knew it was better that they worked for the common good than against it as for his own talent that was different the dead didnt consider him a peeping tom but a friend and they respected him as such the other thing we did clarke continued was this we convinced simmonss bosses that he shouldnt have a dcap a what harry wrinkled his nose that sounds like some sort of family planning tackle to me ah sorry said clarke you werent with us long enough to learn about that sort of thing were you a dcapsuie is a quick way out of trouble a man can find himself in a situation where its a lot better to be dead when hes suffering under torture for instance or when he knows that one wrong answer will compromise a lot of good friends simmonss mission was that kind of job we have our sleepers in redland as you know just as they have theirs over here your stepfather was one of them well simmons would be working through a group of sleepers whod been activated if he was caughtmaybe he wouldnt want to jeopardize them the initiative to use his death capsule would be simmonss own of course the capsule goes inside a tooth all a man has to do is bite down hard on it and harry pulled a face as if there arent enough of the dead already clarke felt he was losing harry that he was driving him further from the fold he speeded up anyway we convinced his bosses that they should give him a fake dcap a capsule containing complex but harmless chemicals knockout drops at the worst harry frowned then why give him one at all incentive said clarke he wouldnt know it was a fake it would be there as a reminder to watch his step god the minds of you people harry felt genuine disgust and clarke actually agreed he nodded glumly you havent heard the worst of it we told them that our prognosticators had given him a high success rating he was going to come back with the goods except yes harry narrowed his eyes well the fact is wed given him no chance at all we knew he was going to be picked up harry jumped up slammed his fist down on the table so hard that he made it jump in that case it was criminal even to let them send him he shouted hed get picked up spill the beans under pressure drop the people whod helped him right in it to say nothing of himself what the hells been happening in ebranch over the last eight years im damned sure sir keenan gormley wouldnt have stood for any of this in his day clarke was dead white in the face the corner of his mouth twitched but he remained seated oh yes he would have harry this time he really would have clarke made an effort to relax said anyway it isnt as black as ive painted it see chung is so good that hed know the minute simmons was taken he did know and as soon as he said so we passed it on as far as were aware mis has alerted all simmonss contacts over there and theyve taken action to cover their tracks or even get the hell out of it harry sat down again but he was still coldly furious ive just about had it with this he said i can see now that youve got yourself in a hole and youve come to ask me to dig you out well if thats the case then the rest of what you have to tell me had better be good becausefrankly this whole mess pisses me off ok lets recap even knowing simmons would get picked up you fixed him up with a dummy dcap and let him get himself sent on an impossible mission also wait said clarke you still havent got it right as far as we were concerned that was his mission to get picked up we knew he was going to be anyway his expression was as cold as harrys but without the others fury i cant see this improving said harry in a little while in fact it gets worse and worse and all of this to get a man inside the perchorsk projekt so that your scryer chung could spy through him butdidnt it dawn on you that the soviet espers would pick chung up too his esp eventually they would yes clarke nodded even though chung would use his talent in the shortest possible bursts theyd crack him eventually and in fact we believe they have except wed hoped that by that time wed know exactly what was going on in there wed have proof one way or the other about what the soviets were making or breeding down there breeding harrys mouth slowly formed an o and now his tone was very much quieter what the hell are you trying to tell me darcy the thing they shot down over the hudson bay clarke said very slowly and very clearly was one hellish thing harry cant you guess harry felt his scalp tingling again youd better tell me he said clarke nodded and stood up he put his knuckles on the tabletop and leaned forward you remember that thing yulian bodescu grew and kept in his cellar well thats what it was harry but big enough to make bodescus creature look tiny by comparison and now you know why we need you you see it was the biggest bloodiest vampire anybody could possibly imagine and it came out of perchorsk after a long long moment harry keogh said if this were someones idea of a joke it would be just too gross to no joke harry clarke cut in down at hq we have film of the thing shot from an awacs before the fighters got it and burned it out of the sky if it wasnt a vampire or at least made of the stuff of vampires then im in the wrong business but our people who survived that raid on bodescus place harkley house in devon theyre a lot more qualified than i am and they all say that it was exactly like that which to my mind means theres only one thing it could possibly be you think the russians may be experimenting making them designing them as weapons it was plain that the necroscope found it incredible didnt that lunatic gerenko have exactly that in mind before youdealt with him clarke was persistent harry shook his head i didnt kill gerenko he said faethor ferenczy did it for me he fingered his chin glanced again at clarke and said but youve made your point harry put his head down clasped his hands behind him walked slowly back through the brooding house to his study clarke followed him trying to contain himself and not show his impatience but time was wasting and he desperately needed keoghs help it was midafternoon and streamers of late autumn sunlight were filtering in through the windows highlighting the thin layer of dust that lay everywhere harry seemed to notice it for the first time he trailed his finger along a dusty shelf then paused to consider the accumulation of dark gritty fluff on his fingertip finally he turned to clarke and said so really there was no parallel case after all that was just to make sure id listen to you hear you out clarke shook his head harry if theres one person in the world i would never lie to youre it because i know you hate it and because we need you theres a parallel case right enough you see i remembered how you put it that time eight years ago when your wife and child disappeared before you quit ebranch you said theyre not dead and yet theyre not here so where are they i remembered it because it seems the same thing has happened again someone has disappeared in the same way harry frowned made a stab at it simmons do you mean jazz simmons has disappeared yes in the same way clarke answered they caught him something less than a month ago and he was taken into perchorsk after that contact was difficult very nearly impossible david chung reckoned it was because the complex is at the foot of a ravine the sheer bulk of matter blocks the psychic view because its protected by a dense lead shield which has the same effect and mainly because there are soviet espers mindblocking the place even so chung was able to get through on occasion what he has seen or scried in there isnt reassuring go on said harry his interest waxing again well clarke continued and immediately paused and sighed this isnt easy harry i mean even chung found it difficult to explain and im only repeating him buthes seen something in a glass tank he says he cant describe it better than that because it never seems to be the same no dont ask me he quickly held up his hands shook his head personally i havent the foggiest idea or if i have an idea then i dont much care to voice it go ahead said harry voice it i dont have to clarke shook his head im sure you know what i mean harry nodded ok is there anything else only this chung says he sensed fear that the complex was full of dread living in terror everyone in the place was desperately afraid of something he said but again we dont know what so that was how things stood until just three days ago then yes then no more contact and not just soviet static either literally no contact simmonss cross and presumably simmons himself were well no longer there no longer anywhere in fact dead harrys face was grim but clarke shook his head no he said and thats what i meant when i called it a parallel case its so like your wife and child chung himself cant explain it he says he knows the cross still exists that it hasnt been broken up or melted down or in any other way destroyed and he believes that simmons still has it but he doesnt know where it is it defies his talent to find it and hes angry about it and frustrated in fact his feelings are probably a lot like yours hes come up against something he doesnt understand and cant figure out and hes blaming himself he even started to lose faith in his scrying but weve tested that and its ok harry nodded and said i can understand the way he must feel thats exactly what its like he knows that the cross is still extant and simmons still alive but he doesnt know where they are right clarke nodded but he does know where the cross isnt it isnt on this earth not according to david chung anyway lines of concentration etched themselves in harrys brow he turned his back on clarke and stared out of a window of course he said i can very quickly discover if simmons is dead or not quite simply i can check with the dead if an englishman called michael jazz simmons has died recently in the upper urals theyll be able to tell me inwhy in no time at all its not that i doubt your man chung is good not if you say he is but id like to be sure so go ahead ask them clarke answered but he couldnt suppress a shiver at the matteroffact way the necroscope talked about it harry turned to face his visitor and smiled a strange wan smile his brown eyes had turned dark and very bright but even as clarke looked at them their colour seemed to lighten i just did ask them he said theyll let me know as soon as they have the answer that answer wasnt long in coming maybe half an hour during which time harry sat deep in his own thoughts while the man from ebranch paced the floor of the study to and fro the suns light began to fade and an old clock ticked dustily in a corner then hes not with the dead harry breathed the words like a sigh clarke said nothing he held his breath and strained his ears to hear the dead speaking to harry and dreaded to hear them but there was nothing nothing to hear or see or feel but clarke knew that harry keogh had indeed received his message from beyond the grave clarke waited harry got up from behind his desk came and stood close well he said it looks like im recruited again again clarke spoke to cover the feeling of relief he felt must be emanating from his every pore in tangible streams harry nodded last time it was sir keenan gormley who came to get me and this time its you maybe you should take warning from that clarke knew what he meant gormley had been eviscerated by boris dragosani the soviet necromancer dragosani had gutted him to steal his secrets no clarke shook his head that doesnt really apply not to me my talents a coward called serfpreservation first sign of anything nasty and whether i want to or not my legs turn me aboutface and run me the hell out of there anyway ill take my chances will you the question meant something whats on your mind i left stuff of mine at ebranch harry said clothes shaving kit various bits and pieces are they still there clarke nodded your room hasnt been touched except to clean it we always hoped youd come back then i wont need to bring anything from here with me im ready when you are he closed the door to the patio clarke stood up ive two rail tickets here edinburgh to london i came from the station by taxi so well need to call a and he paused harry wasnt moving and his smile was a little crooked even devious clarke said er is there something you said youd take your chances harry reminded him yes butwhat sort of chances are we talking about here its been a long time harry told him since i went anywhere by car or boat or train darcy that way wastes a lot of time the shortest distance between two points is an equation a mobius equation clarkes eyes went wide and his gasp was quite audible now wait a minute harry i you came here knowing that when youd told me your story i wouldnt be able to refuse harry cut him off no risk to you or to ebranch your talent takes care of you and the branch looks after its own but plenty of trouble for harry keogh where im going wherever im going im sure therell be times i wish i hadnt listened to you so you see i really am taking my chances im trusting you trusting to luck and to my talents so how about you wheres your faith darcy you want to take me to londonyour way along the mobius strip yes through the mobius continuum thats perverse harry clarke grimaced he still wasnt convinced that the other meant it the thought of the mobius continuum fascinated him but it frightened him too its like forcing a scared kid to take a ride on a figureofeight like bribing him to do it with an offer he cant refuse its worse than that harry told him the kid has vertigo but i dont have but you will harry promised clarke blinked his eyes rapidly is it safe i mean i dont know anything about this thing you do harry shrugged but if it isnt safe your talent will intervene wont it you know for a man whos protected as you are you dont seem to have much faith in yourself thats my paradox clarke admitted its true i still switch off all the power before ill even change a lightbulb ok you win how do we go about it andare you sure you know the way there to hq i mean clarke was starting to panic and how do you know you can still do it anyway see i its like riding a bike harry grinned or swimming once you can do it you can always do it the only difference is that its almost impossible to teach i had the best teacher in the world mobius himself and it still took me oh a long time so i wont even try to explain mobius doors are everywhere but they need fixing for a second before they can be used i know the equations that fix them theni could push you through one clarke backed away but it was purely an instinctive reaction it wasnt his talent working for him lets dance said harry what clarke looked this way and that as if he searched for an escape route here harry told him take my hand thats right now put your arm round my waist see its easy they began to waltz clarke taking mincing steps in the small study harry letting him lead and conjuring flickering mobius symbols on the screen of his mind one twothree one twothree he conjured a door said do you come here often it was the closest harry had come to humour for a long time clarke thought it would be a good idea to respond in the same vein only in the mating he breathlessly began to answer and harry waltzed the pair of them through the otherwise invisible mobius door sseason clarke husked and oh jesus beyond the metaphysical mobius door lay darkness the primal darkness itself which existed before the universe began it was a place of absolute negativity not even a parallel plane of existence because nothing existed here not under normal conditions anyway if there was ever a place where darkness lay upon the face of the deep this was it it could well be the place from which god commanded let there be light causing the physical universe to split off from this metaphysical void for indeed the mobius continuum was without form and void to say that clarke was staggered would be to severely understate his emotion indeed the way he felt was almost a new emotion designed to fit a new experience even harry keogh had not felt like this when he first entered the mobius continuum for he had understood it instinctively had imagined and conjured it whereas clarke had been thrust into it there was no air but neither was there any time so that clarke didnt need to breathe and because there was no time there was likewise no space there was an absence of both of these essential ingredients of any universe of matter but clarke did not rupture and fly apart because there was simply nowhere to fly to he might have screamed would have except he held harry keoghs hand which was his single anchor on sanity and being and humanity he couldnt see harry for there was no light but he could feel the pressure of his hand and for the moment that was all he could feel in this awesome noeveryplace and yet perhaps because he had a weird psychic talent of his own clarke was not without an understanding of the place he knew it was real because harry made use of it and also because he was here and he knew that on this occasion at least he need not fear it for his talent had not prevented him being here and so even in the confusion of his nearpanic he was able to explore his feelings about it at least able to conjecture upon it lacking space it was literally nowhere but by the same token lacking time it was everywhere and when it was both core and boundary the interior and the exterior from here one might go anywhere if one knew the route or go nowhere forever which would be clarkes fate if harry keogh deserted him and to be lost here would mean lost forever for in this timeless spaceless nonenvironment nothing ever aged or changed except by force of will and there was no will here unless it were brought here by someone who strayed into this place or someone who came here and knew how to manipulate it someone like harry keogh harry was only a man and yet the things he could achieve through the mobius continuum were amazing and if a superman or god should come here again clarke thought of the god who had wrought a great change out of a formless void and willed a universe and the thought also occurred to clarke harry we shouldnt be here this isnt our placehis unspoken words dinned like gongs in his brain deafeningly loud and apparently in harrys too take it easy said the necroscope no need to shout here of course not for in the total absence of everything else even thoughts had extraordinary mass were not meant to be here clarke insisted and harry im scared witless for gods sake dont let go of me of course not came the answer and no need to feel afraid harrys mental voice was calm but i can feel and understand what its like for you still cant you also feel the magic of it doesnt it thrill you to your soul and as his panic began to subside clarke had to admit that it did slowly the tension went out of him and he began a gradual relaxation in another moment he believed he could sense matterless forces working on him feela pull like the wash of a tide he said not a pull a push harry corrected him the mobius continuum doesnt want us were like motes in its immaterial eyes it would expel us if it could but we wont be here that long if we stayed still for long enough it would try to eject us or maybe ingest us there are a million million doors it could push us through any one of them could be fatal to us i fear in one way or another or we could simply be subsumed made to conform which in this place means eradicated i discovered long ago that you either master the mobius continuum or it masters you but of course that would mean us standing still for an awfully long time forever by mundane terms harrys statement didnt improve clarkes anxiety how long are we staying here he wanted to know hell how long have we been here a minute or a mile harry answered to both of your questions a lightyear or a second listen im sorry we wont be here long but to me when im here questions like that dont have much meaning this is a different continuum the old constants dont apply this place is the dna of space and time the buildingblocks of physical reality butits difficult stuff darcy ive had lots of time to think about it and even i dont have all the answers all of them hah i have only a handful but the things i can do here i do them well and now i want to show you something wait said clarke its just dawned on me what were doing here is telepathy so this is how it feels for the telepaths back at hq not exactly harry answered even the best of them arent as good as this in the mobius continuum he explained thoughts have matter weight thats because they are in fact physical things in an immaterial place consider a tiny meteorite in space which can punch a hole through the skin of a spaceprobe theres something of a similarity issue a thought here and it goes on forever just as light and matter go on forever in our universe a star is born and we see it blink into life billions of years later because thats how long it took its light to reach us thats what thought is like here long after were gone our thoughts will still exist here but youre right to a degree about telepathy i mean perhaps telepaths have a way of tapping in a mental system which they themselves dont understand to the mobius continuum and harry chuckled theres a thought for you but if thats the case how about seers eh what about your prognosticators clarke didnt immediately grasp his meaning im sorry well if the telepaths are using the mobius continuum however unconsciously what of the forecasters are they also tapping in to scry into the future clarke was apprehensive again of course he said id forgotten that you can see into the future cant you something of it harry answered in fact i can go there in my incorporeal days i could even manifest myself in past and future time but now that i have a body again thats beyond me so far anyway but i can still follow past and future timestreams so long as i stick to the mobius continuum and i can see youve guessed it yes thats what i want to show you the future and the past harry i dont know if im ready for this i were not actually going there harry calmed him well just take a peek thats all and before clarke could protest he opened a door on future time clarke stood with harry on the threshold of the futuretime door and his mind was almost paralysed by the wonder and awe of it all was a chaos of millions no billions of lines of pure blue light etched against an otherwise impenetrable background eternity of black velvet it was like some incredible meteor shower where all of the meteors raced away from him into unimaginable deeps of space except their trails didnt dim but remained brilliantly printed on the sky printed in fact on time and the most awesome thing was this that one of these twining twisting streamers of blue light issued outwards from himself extending or extruding from him and plummeting away into the future beside clarke harry produced another blue thread it ribboned out of him and shot away on its own neon course into tomorrow what are they clarkes question was a whisper in the metaphysical mobius ether harry was also moved by the sight the lifethreads of humanity he answered thats all of mankind of which these two here yours and mine make up the smallest possible fraction this one of mine used to be alec kyles but at the end it had grown very dim almost to the point of expiring right now though its one of the brightest and suddenly clarke found himself completely unafraid even when harry said only pass through this door and youd follow your lifethread to its conclusion i can do it and return indeed i have done it but not to the very end thats something i dont want to know about id like to think there isnt an end that man goes on forever he closed the door opened another and this time he didnt have to say anything it was the door to the past to the very beginning of human life on earth the myriad blue lifethreads were there as before but this time instead of expanding into the distance they contracted and narrowed down targeting on a faraway dazzling blue origin before harry could close that door too clarke let the scene sear itself into his memory if from this time forward he got nothing else out of life this adventure in the mobius continuum was something he wanted to remember to his dying day but finally the door on the past was closed there was sudden swift motion and were home said harry through the gate a fourth and final door was opened and clarke felt himself urged through it but the abrupt sensation of speed in motion had alarmed and shaken him and as yet he hadnt recovered harry he said the thought trembling like a leaf in the immaterial void of the mobius continuum harry except the second time it was his voice he heard not just his thoughts he stood with harry keogh in his office at ebranch hq in london stood there for a moment stumbled and reeled the real physical world of gravity light all human sensation and especially sound most definitely sound impressed itself forcefully on clarkes unprepared person it was signingoff time for most of the staff many had already left but the duty officer and a handful of others were still here and of course the security system was in operation as always sleepers had started to go off all over the topfloor complex as soon as clarke and keogh appeared quietly at first but gradually increasing in pitch and frequency until they would soon become unbearable a monitor screen in the wall close to clarkes desk stuttered into life and printed up mr darcy clarke is not available at present this is a secure area please identify yourself in your normal speaking voice or leave immediately if you fail to but clarke had already regained partial control of himself darcy clarke he said im back and in case the machine hadnt recognized his shaky voice not waiting for it to print up its cold mechanical threats he staggered to his desk keyboard and punched in the current security override the screen cleared printed up do not forget to reset before you leave and switched itself and the alarms off clarke flopped into his chair in time to give a great start as the intercom began to buzz insistently he pressed the receive button and a breathless duty officers voice said either theres someone in there or this is a malfunction a second voice behind the first growled youd better believe theres somebody in there one of the espers obviously harry keogh pulled a wry face and nodded this place was no great loss he said none at all clarke pressed the command button and held it down clarke here he said talking to the entire hq im back and ive brought harry with me or hes brought me but dont all rush ill see the duty officer please and thatll be all for now then he looked at harry sorry but you cant just well arrive in a place like this without people noticing harry smiled his understanding but there was something of his strangeness in that smile too before they gang up on us he said tell me how long did you say it was since jazz simmons disappeared i mean when did david chung first notice his absence three days ago in clarke glanced at his watch just six hours time around midnight why do you ask harry shrugged i have to have some place to start he said and what was his address here in london clarke gave him the address by which time the duty officer was knocking at the door the door was locked and clarke had the key he got up unsteadily crossed the room to let in a tall gangling nervouslooking man in a lightweight grey suit the duty officer had a gun in his hand which he returned to its shoulderholster as soon as he saw his boss standing there fred said clarke closing and locking the door against other curious faces where they peered along the corridor i dont believe youve ever met harry keogh harry this is fred madison he but here he noticed the look of astonishment on madisons face fred he said and then they both looked back into the room which apart from themselves was quite empty clarke took out a handkerchief and dabbed at his brow and in the next moment madison was steadying him where he suddenly slumped against the wall clarke looked slightly unwell im alright its ok he said propping himself up as for harry he glanced again all around the office shook his head darcy said madison well maybe youll get to meet him some other time hehe never was desperately fond of this place something less than four days earlier inside the perchorsk projekt chingiz khuv karl vyotsky and the project director viktor luchov stood at the hospital bedside of vasily agursky agursky had been here for four days during which time his doctors had recognized certain symptoms and had started to wean him off alcohol more than that already they believed they had succeeded it had been remarkably easy all considered but from the moment agursky had been freed from the responsibility of tending the thing in the tank so his dependency on local vodka and cheap slivovitz had fallen off he had asked for a drink only once when he regained consciousness on the first day since when hed not mentioned alcohol and seemed hardly the worse for the lack of it youre feeling better then vasily luchov sat on the edge of agurskys bed as well as can be expected the patient replied i had been on the verge of a breakdown for some time i think it was the work of course work vyotsky seemed unconvinced the thing about work any kind of work is that it produces results on the strength of that its rather difficult to see how you could be exhausted comrade his bearded face scowled down on the man in the bed come now karl khuv tuttutted you know well enough that there are different sorts of work exerting different pressures would you have liked to be the keeper of that thing i hardly think so and comrade agurskys condition was not strictly exhaustion or if it was then it was nervous exhaustion brought on by proximity to the creature luchov who carried maximum responsibility in the perchorsk complex and therefore wielded maximum authority looked up at vyotsky and frowned physically luchov would not have made half of the kgb man but in the projekts pecking order he stood head and shoulders over him even over khuv the contempt he felt for the bully was obvious in his tone of voice when he said to khuv you are absolutely correct major anyone who thinks vasily agurskys duties were light should try them and see do i see a volunteer here perhaps is your man telling us hed make a better job of it kgb major and projekt direktor looked in unison pointedly at vyotsky khuv smiled his dark deceptive smile but luchovs scarred face showed no emotion at all and certainly not amusement evidence of his annoyance was apparent however in the throbbing of the veins on the hairless left half of his seared skull the quickening of his pulse was a sure sign that he disapproved of someone or something in this case karl vyotsky well then said khuv who had been at odds recently with his underlings boorishness and bad temper perhaps i was wrong and you would like the job after all karl vyotsky swallowed his pride khuv was just perverse enough to let it happen i he said i mean i no no agursky himself saved vyotsky from further embarrassment he propped himself up on his pillows it is quite out of the question that anyone else takes over my job and ridiculous even to suggest that an unqualified person should assume such duties this is not stated in any way to slight you personally comrade he glanced indifferently at vyotsky but there are qualifications and there are qualifications now that ive overcome two problems my breakdown and my absurdobsession for i refuse to call it an addiction with drink the third will not be difficult i promise you given the same amount of time as ive already spent that creature will give up its secrets to me be sure i know that so far my results have not been promising but from now on take it easy vasily luchov put a hand on his shoulder stemming an outburst which was quite out of character for the hitherto retiring agursky obviously he was not yet fully recovered for all his doctors assurances that he was fit enough to be up and about again his nerves were still on the mend but my work is important agursky protested we have to know what lies beyond that gate and this creature may carry the answers i cant find them if im to be kept on my back in here another day wont hurt luchov stood up and ill also see to it that from now on you have an assistant it cant be good for a man to have to deal with a creature like that on his own some of us he glanced meaningfully at vyotsky would have broken long ago im sure another day then agursky lay down again but then i really must get back to my work believe me what lies between me and that creature has now become a very personal thing and i wont give in until ive beaten it get your rest then luchov told him and come and see me when youre up and about ill look forward to that agurskys visitors left the ward and at last he was on his own now he could stop acting he smiled a sly and yet bitter smile a smile composed in part of success in that hed deceived everyone whod seen him and partly of his terror of the unknown and the fact that he was now on his own which died on his face as quickly as it was born it was replaced by a nervous anxiety which showed in his pale trembling lips and in the tic that jerked the flesh at the corner of his mouth he had fooled his doctors and visitors yes but there was no fooling himself his doctors had examined him thoroughly and found nothing except a little stress and maybe physical weariness not even vyotskys exhaustion and yet agursky knew that there was a lot more than that wrong with him the thing in the tank had put something into him something which had hidden itself away for now but wheels were turning and time ticking away and the question was how long would it remain hidden how long did he have to find the answer and reverse the process whatever that process was and if he couldnt find the answer what would it do to him physically while it lived and grew in him what would it be like when it finally surfaced so far no one knew about it but him and from now on he must watch himself closely must know before anyone else knew ifif anything strange were to happen because if they knew first if they discovered that he nurtured within himself something from beyond that gate if they even suspected it agursky began to shudder uncontrollably gritted his teeth and clenched his fists in a spasm of absolute terror they burned those things from the gate hosed them down with fire until they were little heaps of congealed glue and would they burn him too ifif what would he be like after those slowly turning inner wheels had turned full circle that was the worst of it not knowing out on the perimeter and having separated from luchov who had gone his own way khuv and vyotsky were making for their own place of duty with the projekts esper squad when one of the latter came panting to meet them he was a fat and especially oily man called paul savinkov who prior to perchorsk had worked in the embassies in moscow an unnatural predilection for male junior members of foreign embassy staff had made him something of a risk in that employment his transfer to perchorsk had been swift he was still trying to ooze his way out of the place primarily by doing his very best to keep khuv happy he was sure he could convince his kgb watchdog that there were places where his talent could be far more effectively and productively employed his talent was telepathy in which he was occasionally very proficient savinkovs fat shiny babyface was worried now as he bumped into khuv and vyotsky in the sweeping outer corridor ah comrades the very men i seek i was on my way to reporthe paused to lean against the wall and catch his breath what is it paul said khuv i was on duty keeping an eye so to speak on simmons ten minutes ago they tried to get through to him i cannot be mistaken a strong telepathic probe was aimed directly at him i sensed it and managed to scramble it certainly i interfered with it and when i could no longer detect it then i came to find you of course i left two of the squad there in my place in case there should be a recurrence oh and on my way here i was given this to relay to you he handed khuv a message from communications centre khuv glanced at it and his forehead at once wrinkled into a frown he read it again his dark eyes darting over the printed page damn he said softly which from him meant more than any explosion and to vyotsky come karl i think we should go at once and talk to mr simmons also i intend to bring our plans for him forward a little doubtless youll be sad to learn that from tonight youll no longer be able to taunt him for he wont be here he tucked the message from comcen into his pocket dismissing the fawning savinkov with a wave of his hand vyotsky almost had to jog to keep up with khuv when his boss now diverted and made for simmonss cell what is it major he said where did that message come from and what was in it this telepathic sending weve just had reported to us khuv mused almost as if he hadnt heard the others questions it isnt the first as youre aware he strode urgently ahead with vyotsky close at heel most of them have been merely inquisitive the work of various groups of foreign seers or scryers trying to discover whats going on here but they were very weak because the alien espers cant precisely pinpoint our location that is they have no definite point of focus and also because were protected by the ravine our own psychics have been able to break them up or block them easily enough ah but if a foreign power could actually get an espendowed agent inside this place then it might be a different story entirely but simmons isnt talented that way vyotsky protested we are certain of that beyond any reasonable doubt thats entirely true khuv growled his answer but i believe theyve found a way to use him anyway in fact this message in my pocket confirms it he chuckled grimly like a man who has just lost a piece in a game of chess it can only be the british for theyre the most advanced in this game the people in their ebranch are a clever lot they always have been and extremely dangerous as our espers learned to their cost at the chateau bronnitsy i dont follow you vyotsky scowled through his beard simmons didnt worm his way in here we caught him and he certainly wasnt coming quietly right again khuv nodded sharply we caught him and we brought him here but believe me we can no longer afford to keep him here thats why he must go tonight they had arrived at simmonss cell outside the door an armed uniformed soldier lounged coming to attention as khuv and vyotsky approached him in a cell next door to the prisoners a pair of espers in plainclothes sat at a table wrapped in their own thoughts and mental pursuits khuv went in and spoke to them briefly you two i suppose savinkov has told you whats happened that calls for extra security be alert as never before in fact i want the entire squad all of you savinkov included on the job from now on full time these measures wont be in force for long probably only a matter of hours but until i say otherwise thats how i want it pass it on and make sure the rosters are adjusted accordingly he rejoined vyotsky and the soldier on duty let them into jazzs cell the british agent was sprawled on his bunk hands behind his head he sat up as they entered rubbed his eyes and yawned visitors he said displaying his accustomed sarcasm well well just as i was beginning to think you two had forgotten all about me to what do i owe the honour khuv smiled coldly why were here to talk to you about your dcap michael among other things your very interesting very ingenious dcap jazz fingered the left side of his face his lower jaw and worked it from side to side sorry but im afraid youve already got it he said a little ruefully and the tooth next door too but were healing nicely thanks vyotsky advanced menacingly i can very quickly stop you from healing nicely british he growled i can fix bits of you so theyll never heal again khuv restrained him with an impatient sigh karl sometimes youre a bore he said and you know well enough that we need mr simmons fit and alert or our little experiment wont be worth carrying out he looked pointedly at the prisoner jazz sat up straighter on his bed experiment he tried to smile enquiringly and failed miserably what sort of experiment and whats all this about my dcap lets deal with that first khuv answered our people in moscow have analysed its contents very complex but completely harmless drugs they would have put you to sleep for a few hours thats all he watched the others reaction very closely jazz frowned displayed open disbelief thats ridiculous he finally replied not that im the sort whod ever have used it at least i dont think so but those capsules are lethal his eyes narrowed what are you up to comrade some silly scheme to lure me over to your side again khuvs smile no for im afraid weve no use for you michael certainly not now that youve seen the inside of the perchorsk projekt but dont be so scornful of the possibility i dont see that our side could be any worse than yours after all they havent treated you too well so far now have they i dont know what youre talking about jazz shook his head stopped acting the comedian why dont you tell me why youre really here but i have khuv answered part of it anyway as for what im talking about im telling you that your people expected you to be caught they couldnt be sure what sort of reception youd get however and they had to be sure that you wouldnt kill yourself too soon jazzs frown deepened too soon for what before they could use you of course the frown stayed what youre saying feels like its making sense even though i know it cant be making any sense said jazz that is if what youre saying is true your confusion is understandable khuv nodded and very reassuring it tells me you werent a party to it your dcap was meant to fool you ensure youd play out your part to the full just as it was meant to fool us it was designed to slow us down as much as possible i would guess your espers british ebranch rigged the whole thing and sooner or later they would also find a way to get through to you if they had the time but they havent not any more ebranch esp jazz threw up his hands ive already told you i dont know anything about that sort of thing i dont even believe in that sort of thing khuv sat down on a chair beside jazzs bed said then lets talk about something you do believe in his voice was very quiet very dangerous now you believe in that spacetime gate down in the magmass bowels of this place dont you i can accept the evidence of my own five senses yes jazz answered then accept this also tonight you go through that gate jazz was stunned i what khuv stood up it was my intention all along but i wanted to be sure you were one hundred per cent recovered from your injuries before using you another three or four days at most he shrugged but now weve had to bring it forward whether you believe in that sort of thing or not the worlds ebranches are very real i am the appointed monitor and watchdog over just such a group of psychics and several of my espers have been deployed here with me your people in the west are trying to use you as a mirror on our work here so far they have not been successful tonight we will ensure that they never are jazz jumped to his feet stepped toward khuv vyotsky put himself in the way said come on then british try me jazz backed off a pace he would dearly love to try the big russian but in his own time his own place to khuv he said you force me through that damned gate and youre no more than a murderer no khuv shook his head i am a patriot devoted to my countrys welfare you are the murderer michael have you forgotten boris dudko the man you killed on top of the ravine he tried to kill me jazz protested he did not khuv shook his head but if he had tried at least he would have had the right and here khuv feigned outrage what an enemy agent engaged in espionage deep inside a peaceful countrys borders of course he had the right and we also have the right to take your life thats against every convention jazz knew he had no argument but anything was worth the shot on this occasion khuv answered evenly there are no conventions we must dispose of you surely you can see that and in any case it will not be murder wont it jazz flopped down again on his bed well you can call it an experiment if you want to but i call it murder jesus youve seen what comes through that sphere or gate or whatever what chance will one man have in the world they come from a very small one khuv answered but better than none at all jazz thought about it tried to imagine what it would be like tried to get his suddenly whirling thoughts into order a man alone he finally said in a place like that and i dont even know what like that means khuv nodded sobering isnt it butnot necessarily a man alone jazz stared at him someones going in with me sadly no khuv smiled shall we say instead that someone three someones have already gone jazz shook his head i cant keep up with you he admitted the first was a convicted thief and murderer a local man he was given a choice execution or the gate not much of a choice really i suppose we equipped him as well equip you and sent him through he had a radio but never used it or if he did the gate was a barrier but it was worth a try it would have been something of a novelty to receive radio transmissions from another universe eh he also had food concentrates weapons a compass and most important a great desire to live his equipment was all of the very highest quality and there was plenty of it far more than ive mentioned here you shall have no less maybe even more its al a question of what you can carry or what youre willing to carry anyway after a fortnight we wrote him off if there was a way back he didnt find it or maybe something found him first i say weve written him off but of course he may still be alive on the other side after all we dont know what its like there next we tried an esper ah yes one of our very own elite his name was perhaps still is ernst kopeler a man with the astonishing power to see something of the future what a waste you are thinking to send such a man through the gate alas kopeler could never see eye to eye with our way of life twice he tried to how do you say it defect thats how you say it yes but we call it vile treachery the fool with a talent like his he expected freedom too his real reasons in the end were most ironic he had apparently looked into his own future and had found it monstrous unbearable jazz considered that he knew he was going through the gate he said khuv shrugged possibly but how do the spanish say it que sera sera men cannot avoid their tomorrows michael the sun sets and it rises again for all of us except me eh jazz gave a snort of selfderision what about your third er volunteer another traitor khuv nodded perhaps she was yes but we cant be sure she jazz found it hard to believe are you telling me you actually sent a woman through there i am telling you exactly that khuv answered and a very beautiful woman at that a great pity her name was or is zek foener zek is short for zekintha her father was an east german her mother a greek in her time she had been the most proficient esper of them all butsomething happened we cant be certain what changed her but she lost her talent or so she said and she kept saying it for all of the six years she spent in a mental institution where she was troublesome to a fault then she spent two more years in a forced labour camp in siberia where espers kept an eye on her they swore that she was still a telepath and she as vehemently denied it all very annoying and a terrible waste she had been a brilliant telepath now she was a dissident refused to conform demanded the right to emigrate to greece in short she had become a problem in far too many ways so you got rid of her jazzs tone was scornful khuv ignored the acid in the others eyes we told her go through the gate use your telepathy to tell us what its like on the other side for weve people here who will hear you be sure and if youre successful and after youve done all of these things to our satisfaction then well bring you back jazz stared coldly at khuv said but you didnt know how to bring her back again khuvs shrug no but she didnt know that he said so we are talking about murder after all jazz nodded well if youd do that to one of your own i cant see how i can expect any better you people arehell youre shit vyotsky grunted a warning or a challenge came forward with his huge hands reaching khuv laid a hand on his arm stopped him my patience is also used up karl but what does it matter save your energy anyway were all through here believe me im just as sick of mr simmons as you are but i still want him to go through the gate in one piece they went to the door khuv knocked and it was opened for them but on the point of leaving suddenly the kgb major said ah but i had almost forgotten by all means show michael your dirty pictures karl if we are shit then by all means lets behave like shit khuv went out through the door disappeared without looking back vyotsky turned and looked at jazz grinned and produced a small manila envelope from his pocket remember your friends at the logging camp the kirescus as soon as we caught you your friends in the west tipped them off wed had our suspicions about them for some time and we were watching them when they made a run for it i cant imagine where they thought they could run to anna kirescu will go to a forced labour camp and the boy kaspar to an orphanage yuri put up a fight and had to be shot fatally naturally that leaves only two of them kazimir and his daughter tassi what about them jazz stood up he could almost feel himself leaning in vyotskys direction god how he wanted the bully why we have them of course there are so many things they can tell us about their contacts here in russia and in the old country but since theyre a bit unsophisticated our methods for extracting information neednt be so devious we can allow ourselves to be moredirect do you follow me jazz took a short pace forward his emotions and temper were on the boil he knew that if he took another step hed have to go all the way hurl himself at vyotsky which was probably what the kgb thug hoped hed do an old man and a girl he grated the words out are you saying youd torture them vyotsky licked his rough fleshy lips flipped the envelope across the cell accurately onto jazzs bed theres torture and theres torture he said his voice husky with inner lust for example these photographs will be torture for you i mean you and your little tassi quite enjoyed each other didnt you jazz felt the blood draining from his face he looked at the envelope then back to vyotsky he was torn two ways what the hell he said see vyotsky drawled the major knows how i enjoy taunting you so he said it would be ok if we had a little photographic session me and the girl i hope you like them very artistic i think jazz flew at him vyotsky stepped backward through the door and slammed it in jazzs face inside the cell jazz skidded to a halt he glared at the door his breathing ragged in his chest and throat at that moment he could have happily performed an operation on vyotskys intestines with a rusty penknife and no anaesthetic but the photographs jazz stepped to the bed and took five small pictures from their envelope the first was a little crumpled jazz knew it well tassi sitting in a field of daisies shed once given the picture to him the next photograph showed hernaked manacled to a steel wall her hands were chained over her head her legs spread wide the girls eyes were squeezed tightly shut and vyotsky towered beside her grinning weighing her left breast in the palm of his hand the third picture was worse and jazz didnt even look at the others he screwed them into a tight ball and hurled them away from him and then he curled up on his bed and concentrated on pictures of his own they centered on vyotskys intestines again but this time there was no penknife just jazzs fingernails outside the cell door vyotsky stood for a moment with his ear to the cold steel nothing absolute silence and vyotsky thought his blood must be water he banged on the door michael he called out khuv says that tonight after were rid of you then i can amuse myself with her for an hour or two life has its little moments eh thought maybe youd like to tell me how she likes it no still silence the grin slipped from vyotskys face he scowled and walked away curled up tightly on his bed jazz simmons gave a low moan where he bit his lip until it bled his blood wasnt water but liquid fire over the space of the next five or six hours jazz had a good many visitors they came to his cell with various pieces of equipment whose functions were all minutely explained and demonstrated he was even allowed to handle take to pieces and reassemble them and he worked hard at it for they were survival but the tiny flamethrower came minus its gallon of fuel and instead of the small caliber submachine gun he got only a handbook the young soldier who turned up later that evening with the handbook also brought with him an ammunition box halffull of condemned rounds and rusting magazines this was so jazz could practice magazine loading in a combat situation the faster you can load a magazine the longer you live jazz had fumbled the first load then concentrated speeded up and succeeded in loading a second magazine in very quick time the young soldier had been impressed but after that hed yawned and lost interest jazz had continued to load and unload magazines for another halfhour what are you in for the soldier had asked eventually you mean why am i a prisoner espionage said jazz he saw little or no reason to hide the fact not now me the youth thumbed himself in the chest itll be mutiny if i dont get some sleep soon there was a practice alert at the barracks last night and ive been on duty ever since im dead on my feet he frowned did you say espionage spying jazz nodded he tossed the old magazines and a handful of discoloured brassjacketed shells into the ammobox and slammed the lid then fastened its hasps then he dusted his hands on his trousers and stood up there i think i can manage that well enough now not much good though knowing how to load a magazine the soldier grinned if you dont have a gun jazz had grinned back youre right he said are you going to bring me one hah the youth had laughed out loud mutiny is one thing but madness is something else again bring you a gun not me friend youll get that later now was the later that the soldier had been talking about am in the outside world but inside the subterranean perchorsk complex the hour was of no real consequence things didnt change a great deal down here day or night not on a normal night anyway but tonight was different below the nightmare magmass levels in the core of the place michael jazz simmons stood on the saturnsrings platform and allowed himself to be kittedup in his gear in any case he didnt have much choice about it but he still hadnt been given the fuel tank for his miniflamethrower and he was still minus his smg that was in the very capable hands of karl vyotsky who cradled the lightweight weapon like a baby in his great arms vyotsky was to be jazzs escort along the walkway at last the agent had everything he could carry and still move with a degree of efficiency he had refused a parka and a huge woodsmans knife which must have weighed all of three pounds but hed taken a small razorhoned hatchet which would serve both as a weapon and as a most useful tool finally khuv had stepped forward through the circle of people whod been attending to jazz said well michael this is it if i thought you would accept them now would be the time to offer you my best wishes oh jazz looked him up and down personally i wouldnt offer you shit comrade the corners of khuvs mouth turned down very well he said so be hard and stay hard michael who knows but that that way you might even survive but if you do find a way to come back through well be waiting and then ill look forward to hearing all about it eventually you know well be obliged to put an army through there any advance knowledge would be a big help he nodded to vyotsky lets go british the big russian prodded him with the business end of the smg jazz moved inwards across the planking glanced back once shrugged and faced the sphere dark glasses protected his eyes from something of its glare but even so the very plainness of the spheres surface was a pain in itself it was like looking at a dead channel on a live tv screen now the saturnsrings platform was left behind and jazz went forward along the neck of the walkway scorched timbers underfoot told him that this was where the warrior had died and it seemed he heard again that creatures cry wamphyri then they had reached the sphere jazz came to a halt put out a hand his fingers passed easily into the white light there was no resistance until he withdrew his hand again but then he felt a weird viscosity felt the sphere tugging at him it didnt like to let go not even from the first moment of penetration he pulled his hand free but not without a little effort hold it said vyotsky from right behind him dont be too eager british youll need these he hung a cylindrical aluminium bottle on jazzs harness at the rear the fuel for his flamethrower then he said turn around jazz obeyed him vyotsky grinned at him and said youre very pale british feels queer does it a little jazz answered truthfully now that it was inevitable it did feel a little queer it would be a lot worse except he wasnt concentrating on his feelings but something else entirely vyotsky searched his face for a moment said huh i dont know if youre a hero or just plain stupid whichever this is yours he removed the magazine from the smg and handed the weapon to jazz then chuckling he said wouldnt you like this too british he shook the magazine in his hand until it rattled a lot handier right now than the ones you have in your pack eh the others drawn face was all concentration showing no emotion whatever and suddenly vyotsky thought somethings wrong here he stopped grinning took a single backward step jazzs right hand snatched at a pocket of his onepiece combat suit came out holding a rusty but serviceable magazine in a single fastflowing movement he slapped the magazine into its housing and cocked the weapon stand still he snapped at vyotsky vyotsky froze jazz closed the distance between stuck the muzzle of his gun up under the russians chin and he grated funny but youre looking a bit pale ivan is something bothering you khuv came running from the saturnsrings platform hold your fire he yelled not to jazz but to the soldiers on the perimeter where all weapons were aimed at the british agent khuv skidded to a halt a good ten feet away michael he panted whats on your mind isnt it obvious jazz was almost enjoying this ivan the terrible here is coming with me he took a firm grip on vyotskys beard pushed the smg up harder under the russians chin backed toward the sphere vyotsky was white as death no he gurgled but he didnt dare to struggle not and risk the englishman putting too great a pressure on that trigger oh yes you are ivan or you die right here jazz told him me ive nothing to lose he could feel the outer skin of the gate tugging at him khuv came closer and jazz was struck with an even better scenario you too major he said or i shoot right through this bastard and into you khuv was fast he was in motion on the instant jazzs words registered falling flat to the walkway and screaming fire firefire jazz tumbled backwards into the sphere yanking the stumbling vyotsky after him and it was white in there it was pure white a solid white background against which jazz and vyotsky formed the only imperfections they rolled on a solidseeming floor made invisible because it too was pure white shots were screaming overhead in a deafening barrage of rumbling thunder which ceased in another moment as khuvs voice slowed down to an almost unrecognizable drone howled as if from an infinity away cease fire cease fire now that they were inside the sphere and he was safe he didnt want any further harm to befall them jazz stood up looked back through a thin film of milk outside all motion seemed slowed down almost to a standstill it was a twoway effect khuv was halfway to his feet one arm and hand raised high overhead as he signalled the ceasefire jazz waved at him then turned and pointed his gun at vyotsky where he sprawled terrified up you get ivan he said and his voice came out sounding perfectly normal lets move it shall we vyotsky looked around came to his senses his shoulders slumped he slowly got to his feet said fuck you british and made a dive toward khuv or attempted to useless for from now on this was a oneway trip he hit against an invisible barrier slid to his knees clawing at thin air and as the truth dawned on him then he did what jazz expected him to do he started screaming for help jazz watched him grovelling there for a moment then said suit yourself ivan stay here and scream and gibber and in the end die vyotskys head turned swiftly die jazz nodded of starvation or exhaustion then he turned his back on the view beyond the gate of khuv against a backdrop of magmass walls and slowmotion soldiery and started forward into what looked and felt like an aching white immensity from behind him vyotsky snarled but why why what good am i to you here none at all jazz called back but youd have been even less good to tassi beyond the gate major chingiz khuv of the kgb faced his underling karl vyotsky across a distance of no more than ten feet and through a fine white milky film so thin it was almost invisible yet they were worlds apart khuv could take two or three paces forward reach out and shake vyotsky by the hand he could do it but dared not for in his present condition vyotsky might just hold on and while the major couldnt drag vyotsky out of there vyotsky was certainly capable of dragging him in they could still converse however albeit laboriously karl khuv called out theres no way you can get back right now and you cant just go on kneeling there like a lost waif or you can but it wont do you any good oh we can feed you of course we can simply by pushing food through to you simmons was quite wrong about that it was something he hadnt thought out thats all but he was right when he said youll die you will eventually karl how long that will be depends on how long youve got before encounter six do you follow me khuv waited for vyotskys reply communicating through the gate was a frustrating business but eventually vyotsky nodded and got to his feet just doing that took him all of two minutes and more and meanwhile the figure of the british agent was dwindling into the distance ohsoslowly vanishing from sight then vyotskys face and mouth began to work grotesquely and his words came in a dull distant slowmotion booming khuv made him out to say what do you suggest simply this that we kit you out exactly like simmons give you all we can of equipment and concentrated food then at least youll have the same chance he has eventually the answer came back no chance is that what you mean a slim chance khuv insisted you wont know unless you try it he called forward an nco from the squad of soldiers at his rear issued sharp rapid orders the man went off at a run now karl listen khuv continued is there anything you can think of that might be useful to you other than what simmons has again vyotskys slow nod and at last a motorcycle khuvs jaw fell open they had no idea what the terrain would be like he said so and so if i cant ride it then ill ditch the bloody thing vyotsky answered for gods sake is it too much if i could fly a helicopter id ask for that instead khuv issued more instructions but all of this taking time and simmons now a dot on the white horizon gradually drawing away like an ant across the face of a sand dune the equipment began to arrive and a trolley to carry it the trolley was loaded and pushed into the sphere and vyotsky commenced the endless business of kittingup he was working as fast as he could but to khuv and the other observers it was like watching the progress of a snail the paradox was this that it was just as bad for vyotsky he felt that he was the one moving at speed and they were the flies stuck in treacle while to them even the droplets of sweat falling from his brow took seconds to strike the invisible floor where he stood at last his motorcycle arrived a heavy military model but in good working order with about two hundred and fifty miles of fuel in her belly the bike was put on its stand on a second trolley and wheeled through on the other side vyotsky began the incredibly slow process of mounting the machine kickstarting its engine into life but whatever might be wrong with time in there the rest of the physical spectrum seemed in order the bike coughed made a noise like great hammers on oak where the beat of each piston was a distinct individual sound and vyotsky lifted his feet off the ground and slowly ohsoslowly but still a great deal faster than simmons so vyotsky and his machine dwindled into the white distance and finally disappeared from view two empty trolleys were all that was left after vyotsky had gone khuv continued to watch the sphere until his eyes began to hurt then he turned and crossed the walkway to the saturnsrings platform and started up the wooden stairs to the shaft through the magmass there on the landing at the mouth of the shaft viktor luchov was waiting for him khuv came to a halt said direktor luchov i notice you distanced yourself from this experiment indeed you were conspicuous by your absence his tone was neutral or if anything even a little defensive as i shall continue to absent myself from suchacts luchov answered you are the kgb here major and i am a scientist you call it an experiment and i call it an execution two executions it would seem i thought it would be over by now else id not have been here but unfortunately i was in time to see that lout vyotsky take his departure a brutal man yes and yet now i pity him and how will you explain this to your superiors in moscow eh khuvs nostrils flared a little and he grew slightly paler but his voice remained even as he replied my reporting procedures are my business direktor you are right you are a scientist and i am kgb but you will note that when i say scientist i do not make it sound like pigswill i would advise caution how you emphasize your use of the term kgb does the fact that i am able to perform certain thankless tasks better than you make me any less useful i should have thought the very opposite and can you truthfully tell me that as a scientist you are not fascinated by the opportunity we have here you perform these tasks better than me because i would not perform them luchov almost shouted my god ii direktor khuv raised an eyebrow the line of his mouth was tight thin and ugly now some people never learn luchov stormed man have you forgotten the trials at nuremberg dont you know were still bringing people to justice for he saw the look on khuvs face and stopped you compare me with nazi war criminals khuv was now deathly white that man luchov pointed a trembling finger at the sphere was one of our own yes he was khuv snapped he was also psychotically brutal devious insubordinate and dangerous to the point of being a downright liability but havent you wondered why i never reprimanded him you think you know it all dont you direktor well you dont do you know who vyotsky worked for before me he was a bodyguard to yuri andropov himself and we still dont know exactly how he died but its a fact they didnt get on and that andropov intended to demote him oh yes you can believe it karl vyotsky was implicated very well and now ill tell you why he was sent here ii dont think thats necessary luchov grasped the landings handrail to steady himself all of the blood had drained from his face until he was as white as khuv i think i already know khuv lowered his voice ill tell you anyway he whispered but for his misadventure tonight karl vyotsky was to have been our next volunteer so dont cry for him direktor he had only a month left anyway luchov gazed aghast at khuv where he turned away and climbed the steps through the shaft and he didnt know he said of course not khuv answered without looking back if you were in my shoes would you have told him jazz plodded on no use hurrying and wasting energy needlessly and it wasnt as if anyone or thing was going to sneak up on him not here but certainly he must try to conserve his strength he didnt know how far he had to go another mile or ten or a hundred he felt like a man crossing a vast lake of salt whom the sun had already blinded yes it was like that as if he marched blindly endlessly under a blazing sun but one which held no heat only light he sweated yes but purely from his efforts and not from any external source of heat it was neither hot nor cold in this white tunnel between the worlds the temperature seemed constant and was no problem one might actually live here except one couldnt possibly live here no one could ever really live here not in a place where he was the only reality and everything else waswhite twice hed taken a swig from his water bottle replacing lost moisture and twice hed thought to himself is this all there is this emptiness what if it doesnt go anywhere but then where had the bat and the wolf come from and the magmass creatures and the warrior no it had to go somewhere he had also paused to take the rusty magazine off his smg and throw it away and fit a good one from his packs if he had to use the weapon the last thing he wanted to happen was for a duff round to jam itself in the breach it was then just after hed fitted the new magazine that he learned something else about this weird gate place fastening the straps of his pack hed looked up and discovered that he didnt know which direction was which he had a compass on his wrist but it was a little late for that he should have checked it immediately after entering the sphere hed looked at it anyway and seen the hand circling aimlessly just as lost as he was and then again hed looked all about him slowly turning in a full circle or what he believed was a full circle but he couldnt even be sure of that it was all the same everywhere he looked whiteness stretching as far as the eye could see in every direction even a white floor and a white sky making no distinction anywhere no horizon nothing but himself himself and gravity and thank god for gravity for without the sensation that there was something solid underneath him he knew he would have very quickly gone mad with itat least he knew which way was up then hed looked back over his shoulder had he really come from over there or from over there difficult to tell how did he know he was still heading in the right direction what the hell was direction in this godforsaken place but when hed tried to move off again there had been resistance a wall of invisible foam that pushed him back with a force equal to that which he mustered against it to the right it wasnt so bad but still difficult and to the left likewise there was only one way to go which meant that that had to be the right way that was why he hadnt noticed it before because hed automatically chosen or been guided along the path of least resistance and after that thered been more plodding more sweating until now time for another swig at his bottle staring ahead and as he pulled at the bottle and let the water cool his mouth jazz suddenly realized that things were no longer pure white that came as a shock so that he almost choked on his water now what the hell there in the distancemountains silhouettes of crags a darkblue sky andstars it was like looking through a seafret better like looking down a tunnel at a misty morning or at a scene faintly etched on a white silk screen but how far away jazz plodded on more eagerly now and at the same time somewhat more apprehensively the scene came closer growing brighter as the stars blinked out and were replaced by weak beams of sunlight seeming to strike through the mountains to the right of the pictures frame and that was when jazz heard the sound at first he associated it with the emerging scene but then he realized that it came from behind him and no sooner that than he recognized it for what it really was a motorcycle he turned and looked back karl vyotsky rode with the sling of his smg across his right shoulder the gun itself hanging under his arm muzzle forward as yet he couldnt see the distant scene that jazz had spotted but he could see jazz the big russian gritted his teeth into a snarling grin guided the bike with his left hand and his knees and took the handgrip of the gun in his right fist he laid his index finger along the triggerguard turned up the throttle and felt the bike surge forward british he grunted to himself your times up kiss it all goodbye for a moment jazz was stunned a motorcycle and here hed been knocking himself out walking it the problem was how to turn vyotskys advantage into a disadvantage but as hed walked so jazz had been giving the gates weird physics a thought or two now he believed he had the answer ok ivan he murmured to himself so lets see if youre as smart as you think you are vyotsky rode closer revved up until sixty showed on his clock and the bike throbbed under him the ride was smooth as silk but even so aiming the smg would not be easy it would be literally hit or miss but he did have the element of surprise or if not surprise shock at least what must the englishman be thinking now he wondered to see this powerful machine bearing down on him hes a little less than half a mile away jazz was thinking thirty seconds he got down on one knee turned his body sideon so as to decrease his target silhouette turned his gun in vyotskys direction not that he intended to shoot at him just make him a little nervous a quartermile to go and vyotskys face a mask of hatred where he thundered to the attack butsuddenly his quarry had grown smaller hed gone down on one knee and at the same time vyotsky saw the scene on the other side of the gate for a moment it threw him but then he returned his concentration to what he was doing namely hunting down this british bastard to the death he began to move his knees shift his bodyweight give the bike something of a slow wobble and at the same time he commenced firing single shots in jazzs direction one hundred and fifty yards and jazz held his fire he hadnt even released the safetycatch hadnt cocked the weapon it seemed obvious that the crazy russian intended to run him down vyotsky was relying on jazz losing his nerve and making a run for it trying to get out of the way but jazz had some ideas of his own finally he clicked off the safetycatch cocked the weapon resighted andwaited for if he was correct it would be useless to fire anyway fifty yards and vyotsky firing on automatic a stream of lead that buzzed and plucked at the air all about jazz too close for comfort and at the last possible moment he hurled himself to one side vyotskys bike careened by him its rider threw it into a steep banking turn the bike stood on its nose and hurled him out of the saddle then machine and rider were somersaulting in different directions and jazz walked carefully forward toward them and toward the scene looming on the other side of the gate miraculously vyotsky came to the end of his skidding and tumbling and found himself virtually unharmed the ground here was obviously different he had bruises and one sleeve of his combat suit was torn where hed put his elbow through it but that was all he climbed shakily to his feet stared unbelievingly at the englishman maybe fifteen paces away where he walked toward him hello there ivan jazz called out i see you got here the easy way vyotsky grabbed up his weapon checked it was undamaged aimed at his oncoming enemy why was the stupid bastard grinning like that because of the accident hed found it amusing the bike must have blown a tyre or something but simmons he must have blown his mind he wasnt even defending himself he merely cradled his gun in his arms came forward at a casual stroll british youre dead said vyotsky he deliberately lowered his aim to chew up the others thighs groin and belly and squeezed the trigger the weapon was on automatic it fired three stuttering shots before vyotskys finger was jerked from the trigger which happened when the gun slammed into his chest and sent him crashing backwards to sprawl on the floor vyotsky felt as if his chest had caved in as if his ribs were broken possibly one or two of them were lying there hugging himself gritting his teeth and murmuring ah ah from the pain he looked at jazz in the distance between them three bullets were plainly visible lying on the floor the smg had fired them insofar as theyd escaped from its barrel but only just and that had resulted in three mighty mulekicks coming in rapid succession blows which even the huge russians bulk hadnt been fully able to absorb vyotsky made an effort to reach the smoking gun where it lay but that was in jazzs direction which was the wrong way he tried harder and of course failed the smg was all of fifteen inches beyond his straining fingertips hardly a great distance but it might as well have been a mile or not there at all the motorcycle too lay in the wrong direction jazz reached the bike hauled it upright stood astride the front wheel and wrenched the handlebars back into position from where theyd been knocked slightly askew he ignored vyotskys groaning then he wheeled the bike forward and picked up the russians gun and at last he spoke sound and light are the only things that seem to work in both directions here he said we can hear each other talk to each other and even though youre ahead of me toward the other end of the gate i mean your words get back to me likewise your picture for i can see you but while were standing like this nothing solid can ever come from you to me reverse our positions and sure enough id be dead except that isnt the case so theres no way you could have harmed me ivan no bullets no sticks or stones nothing these three rounds he kicked the three spent projectiles aside they fired the gun if you werent so burnedup with hate youd have worked it out for yourself it all sank in and finally vyotsky scowled and nodded then still holding his chest he sat up so get it over with he said what are you waiting for jazz looked at the other and grimaced god what a wanker you are hasnt it dawned on you yet that we may be the only human beings this side of earth you and me not that im much for male companionship but i cant see myself killing off half the human population just for the fun of it last time that happened it was cain and abel vyotsky was finding it hard to follow jazzs logic he wasnt even sure it was logic what are you saying he said im saying that against my better judgement im giving you your life jazz told him see im not the sort of murderous lunatic that you appear to be yesterday in my cell if id had you then in this position things might be different and your own fault because you worked me up to it but im damned if i can kill you here and now vyotsky tried to sneer managed only a wince lilylivered chickenshit son of a he jerked himself to his feet jazz lowered his own smg and put a single round between vyotskys feet it whupped where it ricochetted off the ground sticks and stones he reminded cant hurt my bones but names can certainly do yours a hell of a lot of damage he got on the bike and kicked it into life youre leaving me here without my gun vyotsky was suddenly alarmed then you might as well kill me after all youll find your gun waiting for you when you come through the gate jazz told him but remember this if i ever catch you on my trail again itll be a story with a different ending i dont know how big that world is up front but from here at least it looks big enough for the two of us its your decision so thats all from me comrade heres hoping i wont be seeing you he put the bike in gear and rolled forward past vyotsky upped the gear and picked up a little speed looked back once briefly the big russian was watching him go it was hard to say what sort of an expression he was wearing jazz sighed climbed through the remaining gears and headed for the sunlit scene ahead but in the back of his mind something kept telling him hed made a bad mistake another mistake was this failing to recognize where the gate ended and the strange world beyond it began jazz had been riding only three or four minutes had kept his speed even at maybe twenty twentyfive miles per hour when without warning he breached the spheres outer skin for it was a sphere on this side too he realized as he tumbled in midair the trouble was that on this side the sphere seemed parked in the throat of what looked like a crater and the craters rim was three feet higher than the surrounding terrain the bike fell jazz too managing somehow to kick himself free of the rotating machine and both of them collided jarringly with hard earth and scattered rocks winded jazz lay there for a moment and let his senses stop reeling then he sat up and looked all about and then he knew how lucky hed been the dazzling white sphere was perhaps thirty feet across and all around its perimeter penetrating the earth and the crater walls alike to a radius of maybe seventy feet magmass wormholes gaped everywhere jazz had landed between two such holes and he knew it was only a matter of good fortune that hed not been pitched headlong down the throat of either one of them their walls were glass smooth and very nearly perpendicular and their depth entirely conjectural once in it would be one hell of a job to climb out again jazz glanced at the sphere turned his face away before the dazzle blinded him a giant illuminated golf ball plopped down in wet mortar and left to dry out thats what it looked like but who in hell drove it here jazz muttered to himself and why didnt he shout fore he stood up and checked himself over finding only bumps and bruises then he went to the bike and examined it for damage its front forks were badly twisted and the wheel jammed immovably between them if he had a spanner and could get the wheel off then he might be able to straighten the forks one at a time using brute strength buthe had no spanner sowhat about tools in general he released catches on the bikes seat and tilted it backthe tool compartment underneath was empty now the machine was doomed to lie here until it rusted so much for transport now jazz gave a thought to karl vyotsky the russian was maybe oneandahalf to two miles behind him forty minutes at the outside even weighed down with equipment the last thing jazz wanted was still to be here when vyotsky arrived but he must do one more thing before he moved off he had a small pocket radio a walkietalkie that khuv had insisted he bring with him now he switched it on and spoke briefly into the mouthpiece comrade bastard major khuv this is simmons im through to the other side and im not going to tell you a bloody thing about how i got here or what its like how does that grab you no answer not even static or perhaps the very faintest fardistant hiss and crackle nothing that remotely constituted an answer anyway jazz hadnt really expected anything if the others hadnt been able to get through why should he be different but hello this is simmons he tried again anyone out there still nothing the radio for all that it weighed only a pound was now dead weight useless to him balls he said into the mouthpiece and pitched it into one of the magmass holes where it slid from view and nownow it was time to take a deep breath and really have a good look at where hed landed jazz was glad then that hed dealt with things in their correct order of priority for the fact was he could have just stood and gaped at the world on this side of the perchorsk gate for a very very long time it was in part familiar and fascinating in part strange and frightening but it was all fantastic the eye was quite baffled by contrasts which might well be compared to a surreal landscape except that they were all too real jazz dealt first with the familiar things these were the mountains the trees the pass that lay like the void of a missing tooth in stone fangs that reared up from scree bases and forested slopes through the treeline to gaunt vertical buttresses of grey stone that seemed to go up forever in awe of their grandeur jazz was drawn by the mountains away from the sphere maybe a hundred yards and there he paused and put up a hand to his eyes to guard them from lingering sphereglare and he stared at the marching mountains again even if he had not known he was in an alien world he might have guessed that these were not earths mountains he had skied on the slopes of earths mountains and they had not been like these rather than born of some vast geological heaving they seemed to have been weathered into being and while this could scarcely be called a rare feature in jazzs own world still he had never imagined it on a scale such as this an incredible feat even for an alien nature to have sculpted a fortress range of planetspanning mountains right out of the virgin rock so high jagged sheer and dramatically awesome why only take away the trees under the timberline and these could well be the mountains of the moon the mighty range ran east to west in both directions as far as the eye could see its peaks marched away to far horizons and merged with them passing into purple indigo and velvet distances and disappearing at the very rim of the world and apart from this pass where in ages past the mountains had cracked open their march seemed entirely unbroken now with the sphere behind him jazz stared at the sun or what he could see of it those weak beams he had seen when he was passing through the gate which came from the right of the picture to give light to this land had been filtered through the pass from the rim of the distant sun but that was all it was a rim there at the other side of the pass a blister of red light was rising and shooting its feeble rays through the wall of the mountains but it was the sun or a sun however weakly it shone its light felt good on jazzs face and hands where he shielded his wondering eyes as for what lay beyond the mountains on that far as yet unseen sunlit side impossible to tell but on this side to the west there was only the wooded flank of the mountain range and at the foot of the range a plain stretching northwards turning blue then dark blue into the apparently featureless distance directly to the north to the far north beyond the dome of the sphere all was darkness where stars glittered in unknown constellations like diamonds in the vaulted jet of the skies and under those stars dimly reflective and reflecting too the farflung beams of the blistersun the surface of what might be a sullen ocean or more likely a sheet of glacial ice a chill wind was now blowing from the north which was gradually eating its way through jazzs clothing to his bones he shivered and knew that north was a very inhospitable place and instinctively he began to pick his way across the plain of rocks and boulders toward the pass in the mountains butthis was strange if the mountains ran east and west and the icelands were north then the sun was due south and still that blister of light and warmth hadnt moved a sun lying far to the south apparently motionless there jazz shook his head in puzzlement and now finally he paused to let his gaze turn eastward which was where anything real or vaguely familiar came to an abrupt end and the unreal or at best surreal took over for if jazz had wondered at the seismic or corrosive forces of nature which had created the mountains what was he to make of the spindly towers of mistwreathed rock standing to the east fantastically carven milehigh aeries that soared like alien skyscrapers up from the boulder plain in the shadow of the rearing mountains all the time hed been here jazz had been aware of these structures and yet hed managed to keep his eyes averted another sign perhaps that his choice of direction the pass and through the pass was a good one possibly these columns or stacks had been fretted from the mountains to be left standing there like weird frozen sentinels as the mountains themselves melted from around them certainly they were a natural feature for it was impossible to conceive of any creatures aspiring or even requiring to build them and yet at the same time there was that about them which hinted of more than natures handiwork especially in the towers and turrets and flying buttresses of their crowns which looked for all the world likecastles but no that could only be his imagination at work his need to people this place with creatures like himself it was a trick of the spectral light a mirage of the twining mists which wreathed those great menhirs a visual and mental distortion conjured of distance and dreams men had not built these megaliths or if they had then they were not men as michael j simmons understood them sowhat sort of men wamphyri flight of fancy it might well be but again in his minds eye jazz saw the warrior burning on the walkway and heard his voice raised in savage pride and defiance wamphyri milehigh castles the aeries of the wamphyri jazz gave a snort of grim amusement at his own imaginings butthe idea had taken hold of his mind and for the moment was fixed there suddenly a mood was on him he felt as lonely more lonely than hed ever felt in his life and the thought struck him anew that he was alone and totally friendless in a world whose denizenss animals jazz hadnt seen a one he looked at the sky no birds flew there not even a lone kite on the lookout for an evening meal was it evening it felt like it indeed it felt like the evening not only of a place but of an entire world a world where it was always evening with the sun so low in the sky that was possible on this side of the mountains anyway and on the other sidemorning always morning reverie had taken hold out of phase with jazzs character from which he must forcibly free himself he gave a sigh shook himself set out with more purpose toward the opening of the pass and the blistersun beyond it the pass didnt lie level but climbed toward the crest of a saddle and so jazz too must climb he found the extra effort strangely exhilarating also it kept him warm and was something he could concentrate on along the way grew coarse grasses and stunted shrubs even the occasional pine and above the scree the steep slopes were dense with tall trees just here the place was so like parts of the world he knew thatbut it wasnt the world he knew it was alien and hed had proof enough that it housed creatures whose natures were lethal twentyfive minutes or so later pausing to lean against a great boulder jazz turned and looked back the sphere was now a little less than two miles behind and below him and he had actually entered the mouth of the v where it lay like a slash through the mountain range but back there on the rocklittered plainthe sphere was like a brilliant egg halfburied in its magmass nest and a dark speck moved like a microbe against its glare it could only be vyotsky a moment more and jazz nodded sourly oh yes that was vyotsky all right the crack of a single ringing shot came echoing up to jazz bouncing itself from wall to wall of the pass the russian had found his gun where jazz had left it for him now he was telling this alien world that he was here so look out he was saying a man is here and one to be reckoned with if you know whats good for you dont try fooling around with karl vyotsky like a superstitious peasant whistling in the dark or maybe he was just saying simmons its not over yet this is just to warn you keep looking back and jazz promised himself that he would down beside the sphere vyotsky quit cursing laid aside his gun and turned to the bike he saw the seat laid back on its hinges and his face twisted into a grin tucked loosely into a pocket of one of his packs he had a small bag of tools it was the last thing theyd given him on the other side and hed been in such a hurry that he hadnt stored his tools away under the seat then the sneering grin slid from his face and he breathed a sigh of relief hed not once thought of those tools since simmons took the bike off him if he had then for sure hed have thrown them away somewhere in the last couple of miles now he unhooked a small kidneypack from his back harness got the tools out and loosened the front wheel he stood on one of the forks with his foot wedged under the wheel bent his back and hauled on the other fork onehanded until he could feel it giving then slid the wheel free now it was only a question of straightening the forks he picked up the front end of the bike halfdragged halfwheeled it over to a pair of large boulders where they leaned together if he could jam the twisted forks into the gap between the boulders and apply the right amount of leverage in the right direction he upended the bike and got the forks in position began to exert leverage and froze he stopped panting from his exertions stopped breathing too what the hell was that vyotsky raced for his gun grabbed it up and cocked it looked wildly all about no one nothing but hed heard something he could have sworn hed heard something he went warily back to the bike and there it was again the big russians skin prickled broke out in gooseflesh now what a tiny voice a tinny metallic calling a cry for help he listened hard and yet again he heard the sound but it wasnt a whisper just a tiny distant voice a human voice and it came from one of the magmass wormholes that wasnt all vyotsky recognized the voice zek foeners voice breathless and yet full of desperate hope eager to communicate with someone with anyone human in this entirely alien world he flung himself facedown beside the wormhole peered over its rim the smooth shaft was perfectly circular about three feet in diameter curving sharply inward toward the buried base of the sphere and so out of sight but just where the shaft disappeared from viewthere lay a small radio like the one vyotsky carried in his own pocket obviously it had been simmonss and hed discarded it every time foeners voice came so a little red monitor light flickered on and off on the control panel it warned of reception that light it advised its operator to turn up the volume hello zek foeners voice came again hello oh please answer is anyone there i heard you speaking buti was asleep i thought i was dreaming please please if theres anyone out there please say again who you are and where you are hello hello zek foener vyotsky breathed licking his lips as he pictured her ah but a different woman now from the acidtongued bitch whod spurned his advances at perchorsk this world had seen to that it had changed her now she craved companionship any sort vyotsky took out his own radio switched it on and yanked up the aerial there were only two channels he systematically transmitted on both of them and this was his message zek foener this is karl vyotsky im sure youll remember me weve discovered a way to neutralize the oneway drag effect of the gate ive been sent to seek out any survivors of throughgate experiments and bring them back find me zek and you find your way out of here do you hear me as he finished speaking so the red light on his set began to flicker and blink she was answering but he couldnt hear her he turned up the volume and got broken crackling static he shook the set glared at it its plastic casing was cracked and the miniature control panel in the top was badly dented it must have got damaged when he was flung from the bike also its proximity to simmonss discarded radio was jamming reception on that set too shit he hissed from between clenched teeth he set the broken radio aside and lowered his head one arm and shoulder into the wormhole he gripped its rim with his free hand and hooked one foot round a knob of rock and he stretched himself down and around inching his fingers toward simmonss radio its antenna was fully extended formed a slender flexible halfhoop of telescoping metal sections where it had somehow jammed against the sides of the shaft to halt the radios descent vyotskys straining fingers touched the antenna dislodged it damn the set went clattering out of sight into unknown depths below vyotsky snatched himself viciously up and out of the hole and jumped to his feet of all the bloody luck he picked up his own set again said zek i cant hear you i know youre out there and you can probably hear me but i cant hear you if you get my message youll most likely want to start looking for me right now im at the sphere but i wont be staying here anyway ill be keeping my eyes peeled for you zek it looks like im your one hope hows that for a novel situation the red light on his set started flickering again a brief unintelligible morse message that wasnt intended to be understood he couldnt tell if she was pleading with him or screaming her defiance but sooner or later she would have to search him out hed been lying when he said he was her one chance but of course she couldnt know that she might suspect it but still she couldnt afford to ignore him vyotsky grinned however nervously at least there was one thing in this damned world he could appreciate and would appreciate still grinning he switched his radio off zek two hours after setting out from the sphere two lonely shadowy hours with only the grunts and groans of his own exertions for company jazz simmons paused for his first real break and found a seat on a tall flattopped boulder which gave him good vantage over the terrain all around he took hard biscuits from his pack and two cubes of dense black chocolate designed for sucking not biting wash these down with a sip of water and then hed be on his way again but now while he sat here easing his deceptively gangly but powerful frame and catching a breather there was time to look around a little and consider his position his position that was a laugh it certainly wasnt an enviable position alone in a strange land with hardtack food sufficient to last a week enough weaponry to start world war iii and so far nothing to shoot at blast or burn not that he was complaining about that but again the thought occurred where were they where in hell were this worlds denizens and when he did eventually find them or they found him what would they be like which was to assume of course that there were others here unlike those he already knew about which was to hope so anyway it was as if his private thoughts were an invocation two things occurred simultaneously first a rim of bright halfmoon rising in the west and turning the sky in that quarter a goldtinged indigo showed itself over the peaks on the opposite side of the gorge and secondsecond there sounded a far almost anguished howl a reverberating sustained note echoing up to the moon and down again picked up by kindred throats and passed mournfully on up the pass into the beckoning distance there could be no mistaking cries like that wolves and jazz remembered what hed been told about encounter two that one had been lame blind harmless these werent nothing that sounded like that could possibly be in anything other than extremely good health which didnt bode too well for his own jazz finished eating washed the gritty chocolate from the back of his throat adjusted his pack and got down from his rock time he was on his way again but he paused then froze in his tracks stared directly ahead and up and up before the light from the blistersun however feeble had kept the canyon walls in silhouette theyd presented only a black flanking frame to jazzs eyes with the main picture lying directly ahead that picture had been the false horizon at the head of the saddle the screelittered way to it and the thin arc of bright yellow light beyond which jazz noted had moved gradually from west to east until now it was lying in the very corner of his picture when during the last two or three miles hed turned his gaze away from the sun for a moment turned his face to the flank and looked up then as theyd grown accustomed his eyes had been able to spy the dark forested heights and above them the sharp silver gleam of snow but in fact hed had little time for sightseeing mainly his attention had been glued to the nonexistent trail picking a way through rocks and fallen jumble always choosing the easiest way ahead it had scarcely dawned on him that as he progressed so indeed there had been something of a trail in his own world hed have expected one and so in this world it had failed to make an impression until now but here the gorge was a great deal narrower where two hours earlier at the mouth of the pass the distance between walls had been something more than a mile maybe even a mile and a half here it had narrowed down to less than two hundred yards almost a bottleneck at the foot of steep canyon walls the crest of the saddle as he judged it was only a quartermile ahead now when at last hed be able to look down and spy something of the world on the sunlit side of the range what had caused him to freeze was this the moon rising swiftly over the western side of the gorge now shone its silveryyellow light down on the eastern wall jazz was close to that side of the gorge so that the previously silhouetted face seemed to tower almost directly overhead but no longer in silhouette no longer a vertical soaring jut of black rock the mighty cliff of the canyon had taken on a different aspect entirely picked out now by the moon in sharp detail jazz saw a castle built into the vertiginous heights a castle yes and no way he could be mistaken on this occasion where once a wide ledge had scarred the cliffs face now the walls of a fortress rose up fantastically to meet the massy overhang of natural stone high overhead a castle an outpost a grimly foreboding keep guarding the pass and jazz knew hed hit upon its purpose here at the first throw a keep guarding the pass craning his neck he took in its awesome moonlit bleakness the gaunt soullessness of its warlike features there were battlements with massive merlons and gaping embrasures and where towers and turrets were supported by flying buttresses there yawned the mouths of menacing corbels stone arches formed into steps joined parts of the architecture which were otherwise inaccessible where the natural rock of the cliff bulged or jutted and generally obstructed flights of stone stairs rose steeply between the many levels carved deep into the otherwise sheer rock window holes gloomed like dark eyes in the moonyellowed stone frowning down on jazz where he crouched in the shadows and gazed and wondered the structure started maybe fifty feet up the cliff face halfway to the top of a lone projecting stack in the chimney between cliff and pillar stone steps were visible zigzagging upwards to the mouth of a domed cave presumably the cave was extensive with its own passageways to the castle proper higher still the fortifications themselves spread outward across the face of the cliff like some strange stone fungus covering natures bastions with the lesser but more purposeful works ofmen jazz could only suppose so but whoever had built this aerie they were not here now no figures moved in the battlements or on the stairways no lights shone in the windows balconies or turrets no smoke curled from the tall chimneys moulded to the face of the cliff the place was deserted maybe that maybe was because jazz was sure as hed ever been that hooded eyes were upon him studying him where he in turn held his breath and studied the clifffashioned castle the lower part of the stack where it stood mainly free of the canyons wall was still in shadows which gradually drew back as the moon rose higher still jazz was glad of that moon for the sun was now plainly declining when he crossed the crest of the saddle then perhaps hed catch up a little with the sun earn himself maybe an hour or so more of its dim light but here in the lee of the great grim castle for the present the moon was his only champion he moved swiftly forward going at a lope because of the imagined eyes sticking to the shadows of boulders where possible and crossing the moonlit gaps between at speed and presently he came to the base of the stack of weathered rock where it leaned outward a little from the cliff or at least he came to the great wall which surrounded that base the wall was of massive blocks it stood maybe twelve feet high and was crowned with merlons and embrasures the mouths of dragons formed spouts for corbel chutes but the carven dragons were not earths dragons jazz swiftly silently skirted the wall came to a gate of huge timbers studded with iron and painted with a fearsome crest the dragon again with the face and wings of a bat and the body of a wolf he was reminded of nothing so much as the magmass thing in the tank back at perchorsk but this dragon was split down the middle with the menacing darkness of a courtyard for the great gates stood open a little inwards as if in invitation if so then jazz ignored it he hurried on toward the waning sun desiring only to put as much distance as possible between himself and this place while there was still light enough to do so minutes later he began to breathe more easily reached the crest and was at once bathed in warm wan sunlight shielding his eyes against the sudden light however hazy he turned to look back a quartermile away the castle had merged once more into the face of the cliff jazz knew it was there for hed seen it had even felt it but stone was stone and the uneven cliff face was a good disguise and jazz realized how glad he was to have come past that place unscathed maybe there was no one or nothing there after all but still he was glad he took a deep breath issued it in a long drawnout sigh and gave a massive start something moved close by in the shadow of fallen boulders where they humped darkly on his left and a cold female voice speaking russian said well karl vyotsky its your choice talk or die right here and right now jazzs finger had been on the trigger of his smg ever since the castle even before the womans voice had started speaking hed turned and sprayed the darkness where she was hiding she was dead now or would be if the weapon had been cocked jazz was glad it wasnt sometimes with his speed and accuracy it was as well to take precautions on this occasion his precaution had been to leave the gun safe it was good practice for his nerves thats all shooting at shadows was a sure sign that a man was cracking up lady he said his voice tense zek foener im not karl vyotsky if i was youd probably be on your way to an alien heaven right now eyes peered at jazz from the darkness but not a womans eyes they were triangular and yellow and much too close to the ground a wolf grey huge hungrylooking stepped cautiously into view its red tongue lolled between incisors nearly an inch and a half long and now jazz cocked his weapon the action made a typical chching sound hold it came the womans voice again hes my friend and until now maybe even now the only friend i have there came a scuffing of stones and she stepped out of the shadows the wolf went to heel on her right and a little to her rear she had a gun like jazzs which shook in her hands where she pointed it at him ill say it again he said just in case you werent listening im not karl vyotsky her gun was still shaking violently now jazz looked at it said hell youd probably miss me anyway the man on the radio she said before vyotsky ii recognize your voice eh then jazz understood oh yes that was me i was trying to give khuv a hard time but i doubt if he could hear me it was khuv sent me through the gate just like he did it to you only he didnt lie to me about it im michael j simmons a british agent i dont know how you feel about that butit looks like were in the same boat you can call me jazz all my friends do andwould you mind not pointing that thing at me she sobbed a great racking gulp of a sob and flew into his arms he could feel her straining not to but she had to her gun went clattering to the stony earth and her arms tightened round him british she sobbed against his neck i dont care if youre japanese african or an arab as for my gun its jammed it has been for days and im out of bullets anyway if it was working and i had the ammunition id probably have shot myself long ago ii easy said jazz easy the sunsiders are after me she continued to sob to give me to the wamphyri and vyotsky said theres a way back home and he what jazz held her close youve spoken to vyotsky thats impos and he checked himself the antenna of a radio was sticking out of her top pocket vyotskys a liar he said forget it there isnt a way back hes just looking for a chum thats all oh god her fingers were biting into his shoulders oh god jazz tightened his grip on her stroked her face felt her tears hot in the crook of his neck he smelled her too and it wasnt exactly flowers it was sweat and fear and more than a little dirt too he pushed her away to arms length and looked at her even in this deceptive light she looked good a little haggard but good and very human she couldnt know it but he was just as desperately pleased to see her zek he said maybe we should find ourselves a nice safe place where we can talk and exchange notes eh i think you can probably save me a hell of a lot of time and effort theres the cave where i rested she told him a little breathlessly its about eight miles back i was asleep when i heard your voice on my radio i thought i was dreaming by the time i realized i wasnt it was too late youd gone so i headed for the sphere which was where i was going anyway and i kept calling every ten minutes or so then i got vyotsky she gave a small shudder ok jazz quickly told her its all right now or about as right as it can be tell me all about it on our way to this cave of yours right he stooped to pick up her gun and the great wolf went into a crouch screwed its face into a ferocious mask and snarled a warning she patted the animal almost absently on its great head where its ears lay flat to the long skull said its all right wolf hes a friend wolf jazz couldnt help smiling however tightly thats original he was given to me by lardis she said lardis is the leader of a traveller pack sunsiders of course wolf was to be my protection and he has been we got to be friends very quickly but hes not much of a pet theres too much of the wild in him think of him in a friendly way like a big dog mean really think of him that way as your friend and he wont be any trouble she turned and began to lead the way down from the crest toward the misty orb of the sun sitting apparently motionless over the southern mouth of the pass is that a theory or a fact jazz asked her about wolf i mean its a fact she answered simply then as quickly as shed started off she paused and grabbed his arm are you sure we cant get back through the sphere her voice had a pleading quality i told you jazz answered trying not to sound too harsh vyotskys a liar amongst a lot of other things do you think hed still be here if he knew a way out when they put me through the gate i dragged vyotsky with me thats the only reason hes here i figured if it was bad enough for me it was good enough for him khuv and vyotsky those people areits hard to find a word for them without being offensive be offensive she said bitterly theyre bastards tell me said jazz following her as she started off again why were you heading for the sphere in the first place she glanced at him briefly when youve been here as long as i have you wont need to ask i came in that way and its the only gate i know i keep dreaming about being able to get out that way i wake up thinking its changed that the poles have reversed and the flow lies in the other direction so i was going there to try it at sunup of course which is now one chance and only one and if i didnt make it through then i wouldnt be making it back to sunside either jazz frowned reversed poles and all that is that scientific stuff is it supposed to mean something she shook her head just my fantasy she said but it was worth one last shot they walked in silence for a while with the great wolf loping between them there were a million questions jazz wanted to ask but he didnt want to exhaust her eventually he said where the hell is everybody where are the animals birds i mean its natures way that where there are trees there are animals to chew on them also i saw things at perchorsk that made me think my coming here would be like rolling a snowball into hell and yet i havent seen you wouldnt she cut him short not on starside not at sunup now were down toward sunside youll start to see animals and birds on the other side of the range youll see plenty of them but not on starside believe me michael er jazz you really wouldnt want to see anything of what lives on starside she shivered hugged her elbows starside and sunside he mused the pole is back there the mountains run east to west and the sun is south yes she nodded her head thats the way it is always she stumbled said oh and went to one knee jazz reached out and caught her elbow stopped her from toppling over this time wolf made no protest jazz helped zek to her feet guided her to a flat rock he shrugged a pack from his shoulder took out a twentyfourhour manpack food for one man for one day then he dumped the pack onto the rock and made zek sit on it youre weak from hunger he said pulling the ring on a tiny can of concentrated fruit juice he took a sip at the juice to clean his mouth handed her the can and said finish it she did with relish wolf stood close by wagging his tail for all the world like a lowslung alsatian his great tongue was beaded with saliva jazz broke a cube off a block of russian chocolate concentrate and tossed it before it could hit the ground wolfs jaws closed on it crunchingly its mainly my feet zek said jazz looked at them she wore rough leather sandals but he could see caked blood between the toes where they projected the mist had cleared from the sun a little and now jazz could take in the rest of her true colours were still difficult but outlines shadows and silhouettes made readable contrasts her onepiece was ragged at the elbows and knees patched at the backside she carried only a slim roll hooked to her harness a sleepingbag jazz correctly supposed theyre no kind of footgear for this terrain he said i know it now zek answered but id forgotten sunside is bad enough but this pass is worse and starside is sheer hell i had boots when i came here like you they dont last your feet harden quickly youll see but some of these pebbles and rocks are sharp as knives he gave her chocolate which she almost snatched maybe we should rest right here he said safe enough with the sun on us she answered but id prefer to keep moving since we cant use the sphere and we cant stay starside its best we get back to sunside as soon as we can her tone was ominous any special reason jazz was sure he wouldnt like the answer lots of them she told him and they all live back there she nodded back the way theyd come do you feel like telling me about them jazz unhooked one of his kidneypacks he knew it contained among other things a very basic firstaid kit he took out gauze bandages a tube of ointment plasters and as zek talked he kneeled and carefully slipped the sandals off her feet began to work on her wounds them she echoed him making the word sound sour and again a shudder ran through her the wamphyri do you mean oh theyre the main problem its true but there are other things on starside almost as bad did you see agurskys pet the thing in the tank at perchorsk jazz looked up nodded i saw it telling you exactly what i saw would be a different matter he tore off a strip of gauze soaked it in water from his flask gently wiped away the caked blood from her toes she sighed her appreciation as he squeezed ointment from its tube and rubbed it into the splits under her toes and the pads of her feet that thing you saw was what happens when a vampire egg gets into a species of local fauna she told him she said it as simply as that her voice quite neutral jazz stopped working on her feet looked her straight in the eye slowly nodded a vampire egg eh that is what you said isnt it she stared at him obstinately until he had to look away ok a vampire egg he shrugged began wrapping her feet in gauze so youre telling me that the wamphyri are oviparous theyre egglayers right she shook her head changed her mind and nodded yes and no she said the wamphyri are what happens when a vampire egg gets into a man or a woman jazz put her sandals on theyd been a little loose tending to cause burns and blisters now they were tighter stopping the feet from sliding about too much is that better he asked he thought about what shed just told him decided to let her tell it all in her own time her own way that feels good she said thanks she stood up helped him get his packs hooked up and they set off toward the sun again listen he said when they were underway why dont i just listen and let you tell me everything thats happened to you while youve been here all youve seen learned everything you know so far as i can tell weve got plenty of time on our hands visions good and we dont seem in any sort of immediate danger the suns up ahead and we have some good moonlight have we zek answered jazz craned his neck looked at the moon it had crossed the pass and already its rim touched the eastern peaks a few more minutes and it would be gone the planetary rotation period is incredibly slow she began to explain but on the other hand the moons orbit is closer and much faster a day here is about a week on earth oh and incidentally this place is earth thats what they call it it isnt our earth of course not but its theirs i thought it was strange at first but then i thought what else would they call it anyway this planet rotates westward very slowly and its poles are not quite lined up on the sun so its like the planet has a wobble the sun is seen to revolve west to east anticlockwise if you like in a slow small circle now im not an astronomer or a space scientist of any sort so dont ask me the whys and wherefores but how it works out is like this on sunside we get a morning of about twentyfive hours duration a day of maybe seventyfive hours duration an evening of twentyfive hours and a night of about forty midday or thereabouts is sunup and all of the night is sundown jazz looked up again saw the moon halved now by the sharp rim of the mountains even as he watched its glow lessened as it prepared to slip from sight im no astronomer either he said but still its very plain we have something of a fastmoving moon up there thats right she answered it has a rapid spin too and unlike the old moon shows both its face and its backside jazz nodded not shy eh she snorted in some ways you remind me of another englishman i once knew she said he seemed sort of naive too and yet in reality he was anything but naive oh jazz looked at her who was this lucky man he wasnt that lucky she said tilting her head a little jazz looked at her in profile in the last rays of moonlight decided he liked her a lot so who was he he asked again he was a member maybe even the head of your british ebranch she answered his name was harry keogh and he had a special talent i have a talent too but his wasdifferent i dont even know if you could call it esp thats how different it was jazz remembered what khuv had told him about her that sort of stuff was so much baloney as far as he was concerned but best not to let her see his scepticism oh yes thats right he said youre a mentalist right you read minds so what was this keoghs talent eh he was a necroscope she said her voice suddenly cold a what he could talk to the dead she said and coming to a sudden angry halt she drew apart from jazz he looked at her stubborn badtempered stance and at the great wolf standing between them staring yelloweyed from one to the other did i do something you thought something she snapped you thought what a load of christ said jazz because that was exactly what hed thought listen she said do you know how many years ive been hiding the truth of my telepathy knowing i was better than anything else they had but not wanting to work for them not daring to work for them because i knew if i did then sooner or later id come up against harry keogh again ive suffered for my telepathy jazz and yet now here where it doesnt matter much any more the moment i admit the truth of it show me he said cutting her off ok i can see how we wont get anywhere if weve no faith in each other but we wont get far by lying or misleading each other either if you say you can do it i have to accept it right certainly i know there are those who do believe you have this talent but isnt there any way you can show me you have to admit zek it would have been easy just now to take a guess at what i was thinking not only about your telepathy but also about this keogh bloke about what you say he can do dont tell me you havent met up with scepticism before not with a gift most people would consider supernatural youre tempting me her eyes flashed fire humouring me taunting me get thee behind me satan oh its godlike this talent of yours is it jazz couldnt quite conceal his sneer well if youre that good how come you didnt know who it was coming up the pass if telepathy and esp in general are real why didnt khuv know id hidden away a magazine for my smg which is how i came to get the chance to drag that goon vyotsky in here with me wolf gave a low whine and his ears went flat youre annoying him zek said and youre annoying me too also youve missed my point big macho man i say im a telepath and you say prove it the next thing youre asking me to prove im a woman jazz nodded pulled a sour face you rate yourself pretty damned high dont you god knows what sort of men youre used to but i all right she snapped watch she looked at wolf the merest glance then turned and tossed her head walked on toward the sun she went maybe a hundred yards and jazz and the wolf stood still watching her then she stopped and looked back now im not going to say anything she called out so see what you think of what happens next jazz frowned thought what the but in the next moment wolf showed him what the the huge creature loped closer took the sleeve of jazzs onepiece in his great jaws but gently began to tug jazz in zeks direction jazz stumbled to keep up and the faster he went the faster wolf ran until both of them were flying full tilt toward the girl where she waited only then did the wolf let go when both of them drew level with her well she said as jazz came to a panting stumbling halt he sucked the hole in his jaw where two teeth had once been put up a hand and scratched his nose well he started i youre thinking im an animal trainer she cut in but if you say it out loud thats it we go our separate ways ive survived so far without you and i can keep right on doing it wolf went and stood beside her two to one jazz grinned however ruefully and since ive always believed in the democratic processok theres no option but to believe you youre a telepath they carried on walking but slightly more apart now so why didnt you know it was me coming up the pass how come you challenged me as vyotsky you saw the castle back there the keep yes thats why jazz glanced back the cliffhugging castle must be miles back by now but it was empty deserted maybe and maybe not the wamphyri want me badly theyre not stupid anything but they know i came in through the sphere the gate and theyve surely guessed that sooner or later id try to get out again that way at least i credit them with that much intelligence it would have been easy for them during the last sundown during any one of many sundowns to put a creature in there therell be plenty of rooms and corners in there that the sun never touches jazz shook his head held up a restraining hand even if i understood all you just said which i dont still i wouldnt know what it has to do with me he said in this world she answered youre careful how you use esp the wamphyri have it in many diverse forms and so to a lesser degree do most of the animals only the true men are without it you mean if the wamphyri left something in that castle back there a creature it would have heard your thoughts again jazz was close to incredulous it might have heard my directed thoughts yes she nodded but thats he stilled his tongue before it could offend her wolf can hear them she said simply and me jazz gave a snort does that make me an idiot or something because i cant hear them no she shook her head not an idiot just a true man youre not an esper listen when i came up this way i heard your thoughts distant and strange and a little confused but i didnt dare concentrate on you and check out your identity in case that allowed something else to pick out and identify me now that were in the light of the sun the pressures off but the closer i got to starside the more careful i had to be and because i couldnt be sure you werent vyotsky so i challenged you you said hed probably have killed me maybe he would and maybe not but then hed have had to kill wolf too which wouldnt be so easy and if he had killed me then he really would be on his own it was a chance i had to take this time jazz accepted all she told him he had to start somewhere and it seemed the best way to go listen he said even though i like to think im fairly quick on the uptake still theres a lot youll need to explain about what youve already told me but before that theres one thing id better know right now do i need to guard my thoughts here in the sunlight no on starside yes all the time but with a bit of luck well never see starside again ok jazz nodded now lets get to more immediate things wheres this cave you told me about i really think we should restup and at the same time i can do a better job on your feet also you look like you could use a more substantial meal she smiled at him the first time shed done it jazz wished he could see her in good old downtoearth daylight ill tell you something she said i long ago learned not to listen in on peoples thoughts they can be nice ill grant you but when theyre not nice they can be very unpleasant indeed we sometimes think things we could never express in words me too among espers it was a general rule that we observe each others privacy but ive been lonely a long time for a mind i could relate to i mean a mind from my own world so while ive been hearing you talking well ive been hearing other things too when ive grown used to you then ill make an effort not to intrude im trying even now buti cant help scanning you jazz frowned so what was i thinking he said i mean i only said we should restup but you meant i should restup me zek foener thats nice of you and if i really needed it id accept but youve come quite a long way yourself and anyway id prefer to keep moving until were right out of the pass another four miles or so and were out of it but as you can see the sun is just about to touch the eastern wall its a slow process but in something less than an hour and a half the pass will be in darkness again on sunside its still sunup for oh twentyfive hours yet and the evening is just as long after thatthen well be holed up somewhere she shivered jazz knew nothing about esp but he did read people very well youre a hell of a brave woman he said and then he wondered why for passing compliments was something he wasnt good at and didnt usually do but he knew hed meant it so did she but she didnt agree with him no im not she said seriously i think i maybe used to be but now im a dreadful coward youll find out why soon enough before then jazz said youd better fill me in on more immediate hazards assuming they are immediate you said something about the sunsiders travellers being after you and something about the wamphyri being desperate to get hold of you now whats all that about sunsiders she gasped but not in answer she stiffened to a halt glanced wildly all about especially in the shadows cast by the eastern cliffs her hand went to her brow stroked it with trembling fingers wolfs hackles rose he laid back his ears and offered a low throaty growl jazz took his smg off safe it was already cocked he checked that the magazine was firmly seated in its housing zek he husked arlek she whispered and thats what comes of holding back on my telepathy for your sake jazz i but she had no time for anything else for by then they were in the thick of it castles travellers the projekt something more than an hour earlier keeping alert for bats karl vyotsky rode his motorcycle across the boulderstrewn plain toward the towering fantastically carved stacks standing like weird sentinels in the east it had been his first instinct to make for the pass and the thin sliver of sun hed seen on the horizon in the high wide v of the canyon but halfway to the mouth of the pass the sun had gone down leaving only its rays to form a fan of pink spokes on the southern sky the mountain range reaching east and west as far as the eyes could see was black in silhouette now highlighted with patches and slices of gleaming gold where the moons beams lit on reflective features but the sky over the mountains was indigo shot with fading shafts of yellow and since night was obviously falling on this world vyotsky preferred the open ground under the moon to the inky blackness of the pass he had no way of knowing that on the other side of the range the daylight would last for the equivalent of two of his old days and so with his headlight blazing he had turned back and headed for the stacks instead and as his eyes had grown accustomed to the moonlight and as the miles sped by under his now slightly eccentric wheels so he had gazed at those enigmatic aeries some nine or ten miles east with something more than casual curiosity were those lights he could see in the topmost towers if so and if there were people up there what sort of people would they be while he had been pondering that then hed seen the bats but not the tiny flyingmice creatures of earth three of them each a metre across wingtip to wingtip had swooped on him causing him to swerve and almost unseating him the beat of their membrane wings had been a soft rapid whupwhupwhup stirring the air with its throbbing they seemed of the same species as encounter four desmodus the vampire vyotsky didnt know what had attracted them possibly it had been the roar of his engine which was loud and strange in the otherwise eerie silence of this place but when one of the bats cut across his headlight beam the creatures flight had immediately become erratic even frenzied shooting aloft on the instant its alarmed highpitched sonar trill had echoed weirdly down to vyotsky to be answered with nervous queries from its two travelling companions that had given the russian a notion how to be rid of them possibly they were harmless merely curious vampires or not they werent likely to attack a man not while he was active and mobile but he had his time cut out controlling his machine over this rugged terrain there were fissures in the dry pulverized earth of the plain and rocks and boulders scattered everywhere he needed to concentrate on where he was going not on what this trio of huge bats were up to and so hed stopped the bike taken a powerful handtorch from one of his packs and waited until the bats had come close again the one already blinded kept its distance patrolling on high but after a little while the others had moved in closer as they circled about him then darted at him headon so vyotsky had aimed his torch and pressed its button to bathe them in dazzling light confusion the two had crashed into each other fallen in a tangle they separated on the ground scuttling flopping crying their vibrating cries of alarm then one had managed to flap back aloft but the other wasnt so lucky vyotskys smg almost chopped the thing in half splashed its blood on nearby rocks and when the stuttering echoes of his weapons voice had died away the two survivors had gone hed given several loud blasts on the bikes horn then to speed them on their way that had been twenty minutes ago and he hadnt been bothered since hed been aware that small shadows flitted apace with him high overhead but nothing had come within swatting distance he was glad of that for one thing was certain he mustnt expend any more ammunition killing bats like the englishman michael simmons he knew that there were far worse things than bats in this world by now too one other thing was certain hed been right about the lights atop the no longer distant aeries the closest of these was perhaps five miles away with others dotted irregularly over the plain behind it fading into the distance and seeming to get smaller and hazier even in the bright light of the moon their bases were piled with scree fortified with walls and earthworks in the striated stony stem of the closest one lights flickered and flared intermittently smoke smudged the dark blue sky obscuring the pale stars where it issued from various chimneys lesser structures clung to precipitous faces where ledges had permitted precarious construction work but the great stone buildings that crowned these massive stacks could only be described accurately in one word castles who had built them how and why these things remained to be discovered but vyotsky felt certain they were the works of men warlike men the kind of men the big russian could do business with he hoped strong men certainly and again his eyes were lifted to the crest of that closest tower to the great ominous structure wrought bleak and frowning to scan the land about like some brooding watchtower in a little while returning his gaze to the hazardous way ahead vyotsky found himself obliged to apply his brakes a low wall of piled boulders had seemed to grow out of the littered surface stretching left far out onto the plain and right to extend itself into the very foothills of the mountains the wall was maybe five feet high and a little less than that through its base manmade of course it wasa boundary the russian turned his bike south and riding up into the foothills he searched for a break in the wall but ahead the wall rose up to meet with a steeply inclined escarpment of smooth rock which vyotsky knew his machine couldnt climb and even if it could he wouldnt frustrated he turned about pausing a while to stare thoughtfully at the nearest stack from this high vantage point his view was that much better seated here on his bike for a moment he found himself calculating the dimensions of these mighty columns at its base this one would be maybe two hundred metres through tapering down to about half of that as it rose all of a kilometer and a half to its turretclad crest basically the tower was well a stone stack natural as any of the grand canyons grotesque outcrops its awesomeness lay mainly in its size and the structures built upon it but as his eyes travelled up the tremendous skyscraping height of the thing so he noticed what he took to be activity of some sort in the darkness of a huge cavern close to the top he narrowed his eyes in an attempt to bring the activity into focus now what wasthat stuffed into the bottom of his main backpack packed in haste when he hadnt been thinking too clearly vyotsky knew there were binoculars all well and good but he didnt want to waste the time necessary to retrieve them now but staring at the stack with its many gravitydefying structures its watchtower castle and now this bustling activity in the something launched itself outwards from the high cavern vyotskys spine prickled and his fleshy lips drew back from teeth which were still sore from the battering simmonss elbow had given them he drew breath in a gasp straining his eyes to make out what it was that floated now like a black boiling cloud forming an airfoil as it circled slowly about the great stack and lost a little height and in the next moment all of the blood drained from the russians face as it dawned on him just what this flying thing might be namely the twin of encounter one an alien dragon in the sky of an alien land vyotsky was paralysed with dread but only for a moment now was not the time to go into shock he switched off his engine and keeping to the lee of the wall let his bike freewheel and carry him down from the foothills back to the plain there he found a massive outcrop of rock and parked the bike in its shadow the moon which seemed to be moving across the sky remarkably quickly was now almost directly overhead making concealment difficult in what little shadow there was the russian fumbled to unhook his packs loaded his smg with a fresh magazine and stuffed a spare into a pocket of his onepiece then he primed his small flamethrower and even though he was faithless thought christ and a lot of good this will be against that that had meanwhile circled the titan stack a second and third time and was now less than a thousand feet high suddenly it veered sharply toward the plain then seemed to expand rapidly as it came swooping in a series of glides and dips directly toward vyotskys hiding place and he knew then that it was no use pretending any longer no use hoping that the flight of this thing was merely coincidental to his being here the creature knew he was here it was looking for him it passed overhead a little to the north laying a huge shadow on the plain like a vast swiftly flowing inkblot and vyotsky was able to look up at it and measure its size he saw with only a minimum of relief that it wasnt nearly as huge or terrifying as the murderous thing which had halfwrecked perchorsk fifty feet long with wings spanning a distance something greater than that it formed a shape similar to the great mantas of earth with a long trailing tail for balance unlike the manta however there were huge lidless eyes on its underside peering in as many different directions as could be imagined then the thing banked left and came swooping back dropped lower still in a controlled stall finally set down in a fanning of fleshy wings that churned up a cloud of dust which for a little while obscured it it landed no more than thirty or forty metres away as the dust settled vyotsky saw it lolling there turning what was best described as a head this way and that in a manner which could only be called vacant or at best aimless vacant yes and vacated for now the russian saw the things harness and the empty saddle of ornately carved leather upon its back but mainly he saw the man who stood on the ground beside the thing staring in the direction of his hiding place saw enough of him at least to know that he wasnt a man not entirely for just such a man as this had burned to death on the walkway in perchorsks core a wamphyri warrior he stared hard apparently right at vyotsky then began to turn in a slow circle before he turned away vyotsky saw the glint of his red eyes like small fires burning in his face but more than the warriors face the russian was concerned with concerned about the gauntletlike weapon he wore on his right hand he knew the damage that weapon could do but not to karl vyotsky not this time the big russian remained quiet as a mouse in the shadows he didnt move didnt breathe didnt blink an eye the warrior completed his circling turn then looked up and gazed for a moment at the castle on the stack he spread his legs put his hands on his hips cocked his head sharply on one side and he whistled a highpitched penetrating whistle that was more a throbbing on the eardrums than a real sound down from the sky fell a pair of familiar shapes they circled the warrior once then headed straight for vyotsky where he crouched in the shadows of leaning boulders it was so unexpected that the big russian was caught offbalance one of the bats almost struck vyotsky with a pulsing wing so that he must duck to avoid it the short barrel of his smg clattered against stone and he knew his cover was broken the warrior faced him again whistled to call off the bats came striding forward there was no uncertainty now none he knew where his quarry was hiding his red eyes burned and he grinned a strange sardonic grin he tossed back his forelock from the side to the back of his head he held himself proudly chin high shoulders pulled sharply back vyotsky let him get as close as twenty paces then stepped out into view onto the stony plain in the yellow light of the halfmoon he pointed his weapon called out halt hold it right there my friend or it ends for you right here but his voice was shaky and the warrior seemed to know it he simply swerved to change his angle of approach came headon as before vyotsky didnt want to kill him he had to try and live here not die in some vendetta for the death of this heathen brave the russian would prefer to deal not fight not with an entire world against him he put his weapon on single shot fired a round over the advancing warriors head the bullet plucked at the warriors forelock it passed so close he stopped looked up sniffed at the air and vyotsky called out look lets talk he held up his free hand palm open toward the warrior lowered his smg to point it at the stony ground it was the best way he could think of to signal peace but at the same time his thumb switched the weapon to rapid fire the next time he pulled the trigger it would be for real the warrior put his hand up to touch his forelock he brought it down again sniffed suspiciously at his fingers with his squat almost swinish snout then his eyes widened and went as round as bloodhued coins he snarled something vyotsky halfrecognized which he made out or guessed to be what you dare threaten then the warriors right arm rose up toward his right shoulder in a sort of salute his gauntlet was clenched but at the apex of the salute it sprang open and showed an arrangement of blades hooks claws he went into a crouch affected a combat stance made as if to hurl himself at vyotsky but the big russian wasnt waiting over a distance of only six or seven paces he couldnt possibly miss he squeezed the trigger opened up hosed the warrior across the body with a stream of lethal lead or should have but the kgb man wasnt having much luck with his gun of all times to have a defective round the weapon fired three or four shots and jammed it had been vyotskys intention to stitch the warrior one way across his body right to left and rising then the other way coming back down a simple wave of the smg should suffice pouring maybe fifteen to twenty rounds at him half of which should find their target but the gun had released only three or four shots none of them aimed the first had sliced a groove along the warriors left side laying open the flesh there as if hed been slashed with a jagged toothed saw the next had pierced his shoulder under the right collar bone at the joint with his arm the rest two shots at most had missed entirely but the two hits had been like hammer blows which would have stopped any soldier of earth this wasnt earth however and the target wasnt just a man thrown back and spun around by the force of the impact to his shoulder hed gone sprawling flatout in the dust where in the next moment hed sat up and looked groggily all about vyotsky cursing loudly snatched the magazine from his gun recocked the weapon and glanced into the chamber a cartridge struck but not fired was stuck in the breach he shook the smg to try to dislodge the jammed defective round no good it would have to be carefully prised loose and by now the warrior was back on his feet vyotsky hooked the gun to his belt to keep it out of the way unhooked the nozzle of his flamethrower he struck ignition and threw off the safetycatch as the wounded warrior again stumbled toward him he made one last attempt for peace and adopted the same pose as before showing the warrior his open palm perhaps the other considered it an insult whichever all vyotsky got for an answer was a snarl of rage then even though the warrior had been shot through his right shoulder still he lifted his gauntlet flexed its terrible tools and showed them to his opponent enough is enough the russian growled he let the other come to within three or four paces aimed the nozzle of his flamethrower and squeezed the firing stud the small licking blue flame at its tip became a searing lance of roaring heat lashed out and torched the warrior all down the lefthand side of his body burning he screamed his shock and terror and bounded away bounded again then threw himself down and rolled in dust and pebbles finally extinguished the flames smoking he staggered to his feet went careening back toward his weird mount but now that vyotsky had started this hed decided it should be finished he advanced after the smoking warrior aimed his hose a second time and froze the wamphyri warrior was calling to his mount harsh agonized orders which it heard and obeyed the bulk of its grey body seemed to shrivel while its wings extended into huge sails it beat them upon the air flattening out even as it lifted off thrust aloft on what seemed to vyotsky a nest of vast pink worms that uncoiled like springs to give it lift it was like a huge sheet of lumpy leprous canvas in the air its worm boosters retracted into it and it came gliding overhead with its manta tail extended lashing from side to side as its body took back a little bulk and the wings commenced to beat so the eyes along its belly reformed all of them ogling in various directions then they spied and fastened on the russian vyotsky backed off the flying creature fell toward him its fishlike shadow overtook him black as ink its rubbery underside opened up into a great mouth or pouch lined with barbs vyotsky stumbled began to fall with a rush of air that carried an unbelievable stench the thing was on him a flap of flesh scooped him up cartilage hooks caught in his clothing and cold clammy darkness compressed him his finger was still on the stud of the flamethrower but he darent squeeze it do that here inside the creature and hed only succeed in frying himself there was air to breathe but it was fetid vile the whole experience was a livid living claustrophobic nightmare that went on and on and the creatures gasses worked on him like an anaesthetic hardly knowing he was losing consciousness vyotsky blacked out for jazz simmons in the thick of it meant about five seconds in which to make up his mind it was what might have been if zek foener hadnt been there to advise him hed made his mind up in two seconds and as shadows began separating from the main shadow of the cliff was on the point of turning decision to action when she cautioned him with jazz dont shoot what he was incredulous the shadows were men who came loping to surround the pair dont shoot do you know these people i know they wont harm us she breathed that were more valuable to them alive than dead and that if you fire a single shot youll not live to hear its echoes therell be a halfdozen arrows and spears lined up on you right now probably on me too jazz put up his gun but slowly grudgingly this is whats called faith in your friends he growled without humour and he looked at the wary crouching gang of men who surrounded them one of them finally straightened up stuck his chin out addressed zek he spoke in a harsh gabble a dialect or tongue which for all the world jazz felt he should recognize and zek answered in a tongue he did recognize recognition at least if nothing more it was a very basic somewhat disjointed romanian ho arlek nunescu she said and tear down the mountains and let the sun melt the castles of the wamphyri but whats this do you waylay and molest fellow travellers now that jazz knew the tongue he could more readily concentrate on understanding it his knowledge of the romantic languages was slight but not entirely without value some of it came from his father a little less from his later academic studies the rest he supposed from instinct but hed always had a thing for languages anyway the man arlek indeed all of these men ringing them in and others where they now came out of hiding were gypsies that was jazzs first impression that they were romany it was stamped into them and just as recognizable as it would be in the world now left behind on the other side of the gate darkhaired jingling lean and swarthy they wore their hair long and greased and their clothes loosely and with something of style and flair the one thing about them that struck a wrong chord was the fact that several of them carried crossbows and others were armed with sharpened hardwood staves apart from that jazz had seen the like of these people in countries all over the world the old world anyway gypsies tinkers wandering metalworkers musicians andfortunetellers tear down the mountains aye arlek answered her greeting now speaking more slowly thoughtfully you know the things to say zekintha because you steal them from the minds of the travellers but weve been saying tear down the mountains as long as men remember which is a very long time and theyre still standing and while the mountains are there the wamphyri remain in their castles and so we wander all our lives because to remain in one place is to die i have read the future zekintha and if we shelter you youll bring down disaster on lardis and his band but if we give you into the hands of the wamphyri hah her tone was scornful youre brave with lardis lidesci away in the west seeking a new camp for you where the wamphyri wont raid and how will you explain this to him when he returns how will you tell him you plotted to give me away what youd give away a woman to appease your greatest enemies and make them stronger the act of a coward arlek arlek took a deep breath he drew himself up took a pace toward her and raised his hand as if to strike a dark flush had made his face darker yet jazz lowered the muzzle of his weapon until it touched arleks shoulder pointing into his left ear dont he warned in the mans own tongue from what ive seen of you i dont much care for you arlek but if you make me kill you ill die too he hoped the words hed used made sense apparently they did arlek backed off called forward two of his men they approached jazz and he showed them his teeth in a cold grin showed them the gun too let them have it zek said i was thinking about it he answered out of the corner of his mouth you know what i mean she said please give them the gun does your telepathy let you walk naked in lions dens he asked her one of the gypsies had taken hold of the barrel of the smg the others hand closed on jazzs wrist their eyes were deep dark alert jazz was aware that crossbow bolts were trained on him but still he asked well its your show zek we cant go back to starside she quickly answered him and the travellers guard the way to sunside even if we got out of this got away from them theyd find us again eventually so give them the gun were safe for now at least against my better judgement he growled but really i suppose theres nothing else for it he released the magazine and slipped it into his pocket handed over the gun arlek smiled crookedly that too he pointed at jazzs pocket and the rest of yourbelongings hearing the language spoken using it was inspirational jazzs talent for tongues searched out and found him a few words youre asking too much traveller he said im a free man like you more free for i make no deals with the wamphyri so that i may live arlek was taken aback to zek he said does he read the thoughts in mens heads too i hear only my own thoughts jazz spoke first and i speak my own words dont talk about me talk to me arlek faced him squarely very well he said give us your weapons your variousthings we take them so that you may not use them against us you are a stranger from zekinthas world so much is obvious from your dress and your weapons therefore why should we trust you why should anyone trust you zek cut in as arleks men began taking jazzs equipment you betray your own leader while hes away seeking safe places to give them their due some of the travellers shuffled their feet and looked a little shamefaced but arlek turned on zek and snarled betrayal you speak to me of betrayal the moment lardiss backs turned you run off where to zekintha your own world even though youve said theres no way back there to find yourself a champion maybe this man perhaps or to give yourself to the wamphyri and so become a power in the world i would give you to them aye but only in trade for the safety of the travellers not for my own glory glory zek scoffed infamy more like why you he was lost for words jazz had meanwhile been stripped of his packs his weapons but not of his pride strangely now that he was down to his combat suit he felt safer he knew he wouldnt be shot for fear of the havoc he might wreak with his awesome weapons at least he could stand man to man now even if he couldnt understand all of arleks words and even though many that he could understand rang true still he didnt like arleks tone of voice when he spoke to zek like that he caught the gypsys shoulder spun him round face to face youre good at making loud noises at women he said arlek looked at jazzs hand bunching his jacket and his eyes opened wide youve a lot to learn free man he hissed and he lashed out at jazzs face with his clenched fist his reaction had been telegraphed jazz ducked his blow easily it was like fighting with a clumsy untrained schoolboy no one in arleks world had ever heard of unarmed combat judo karate jazz struck him with two near simultaneous blows and stretched him out and for his troubles he in turn was stretched out from the side one of the gypsies had smacked him on the side of the head with the butt of his own gun passing out he heard zek cry dont kill him dont harm him in any way he may be the one answer to all your troubles the only man who can bring you peace then for a moment he felt her cool slender fingers on his burning face and after thatthere was only the cold creeping darkness andrei roborov and nikolai rublev were lesser kgb lights both of them had been seconded to chingiz khuv at the perchorsk projekt known as a punishment posting for overzealousness in their work namely western journalists had snapped them beatingup on a pair of blackmarket muscovites the criminals in the case had been an aged manandwife team selling farm produce from their garden in the suburbs in short roborov and rublev were thugs and on this occasion they were thugs in serious trouble khuv had sent them to talk to kazimir kirescu it was to be their last opportunity to interrogate the old man before he went on a course of truthdrugs it would be best if he could be persuaded to volunteer the required information for the drugs werent too good for a mans heart the older the man the worse their effect khuv had wanted information before kirescu died for afterwards it would be too late this might seem perfectly obvious but to members of the soviet ebranch things were rarely as obvious as they seemed in the old days when a person died without releasing his information then they would have called in the necromancer boris dragosani but dragosani was no more as it happened neither was kazimir kirescu approaching the old mans cell to see how his men were making out khuv was in time to discover the two just making their exit both wore the clear plastic capes or ponchos of the professional torturer but rublevs cape was spattered with blood too much blood his rubber gloves too where he stripped them from shaking hands his face was deathly white which khuv knew was sometimes the reaction with this sort of man when hed done a job too well or enjoyed it too much or when he feared the consequences of a gross error as the two turned from locking the door khuv met them face to face his eyes narrowed as they took in rublevs shaken condition and the condition of his protective clothing nikolai he said nikolai comrade major the other blurted his fat lower lip beginning to tremble i khuv shoved him aside open that door he snapped at roborov have you sent for help roborov backed off a pace shook his long angular head too late for that comrade major he turned and opened up the door anyway khuv stepped inside the cell took a long hard look came out again his dark eyes blazed their fury he grabbed the two by the fronts of their smocks shook them unresistingly stupid stupid he gasped his rage at them that was nothing less than butchery andrei roborov was so thin as to be almost skeletal his cadaverous face was always pale but never more so than now there was no fat on him to shake and so he simply rocked to and fro under khuvs assault rapidly blinking his large green expressionless eyes and opening and closing his mouth when khuv had first met him hed thought this man has the eyes of a fish probably its soul too nikolai rublev on the other hand was very much overweight his features were pink and almost babylike and even the mildest reproof could bring him to the point of tears on the other hand his fists were huge and hard as iron and khuv knew that his tears were usually tears of suppressed fury or rage his rages when he threw them were quite spectacular but he had more sense than to rage at a superior officer especially one like chingiz khuv finally khuv let go of them turned abruptly away and clenched his fists over his shoulder without looking at them he said fetch a trolley take him to the mortuaryno take him to your own quarters and make sure hes covered up on the way he can wait there for disposal but whatever you do dont let anyone see him likelike that especially not viktor luchov do you understand oh yes comrade major khuv rublev gasped it seemed he was off the hook still khuv looked the other way then both of you will prepare and sign the usual accidental death reports and get them in to me and youll make sure theyre corroborative in every detail yes comrade of course the two answered as one man well then move khuv shouted they collided with each other then made off down the corridor khuv let them get so far before calling after them you two they skidded to a halt nikolai for gods sake get out of that cape khuv hissed and neither one of you is to go near the girl kirescus daughter do you hear me ill personally skin whichever one of you so much as thinks about her now get out of my sight they disappeared in short order khuv was still standing there trembling with fury when vasily agursky came hurrying from the direction of the laboratories he saw khuv and sidled toward him i was told youd be seeing to the prisoners he said khuv nodded seeing to them yes he answered what can i do for you ive just been to see direktor luchov he has returned me to full duty im on my way to see the creature my first visit in a week if you would care to accompany me major khuv right now that was the last thing khuv would care to do he glanced at his watch as it happens im headed that way he said anything to get agursky away from here before roborov and rublev returned with their surgical trolley good agursky beamed if we can walk together perhaps i can ask for your help in a certain matter in the strictest confidence you may be able to make a significant contribution to my to our understanding of that creature from beyond the gate khuv glanced at the strange little scientist out of the corner of his eye there seemed something different about him it was hard to put a finger on it but some change had occurred in him i can make a contribution khuv raised an eyebrow in connection with the creature vasily do you mind if i call you vasily im here to protect the projekt from shall we say outside interference as a policeman a spycatcher an investigator as any and all of these things i already make my contribution as for any other aspect of work at the projekt i have no control over the staff as such no official knowledge of any facet of the scientific work that goes on here i control my own handful of men yes and i protect the specialists from moscow and kiev but outside of these routine duties it is difficult to see how i can be of any assistance to you in your work agursky was not put off on the contrary his voice was suddenly eager comrade theres a certain experiment i would like to try now any theoretical work i perform with the creature is my concern entirely of course but theres something i need which is quite beyond everyday requirements again khuv glanced at him glanced down on him because beside the tall kgb major agursky seemed almost a dwarf his bald pate coming through its crown of dirtygrey fluff made him seem very gnomelike but his redrimmed eyes made huge by his spectacles put him in a much less comical perspective he was like some strange devious bottleimp given the guise of a man devious that was the word khuv had searched for to describe the change in agursky there was now something sly about the little man something furtive khuv put his mental meanderings aside uttered a none too patient sigh he had never much cared for the little scientist and now cared for him even less vasily he said has the projekt no procurement officer is there no quartermaster a great deal may hinge upon our understanding of that beast im sure that whatever you require for your work can be obtained through the proper channels indeed i would say you have an absolute priority all you have to do is the proper channels agursky cut in nodding exactly exactly but that is just precisely the problem comrade major the channels are perhaps too proper khuv was taken aback your requirement is improper unusual do you mean then why on earth dont you ask direktor luchov about it youve just been to see him havent you i should think viktor luchov can lay his hands on just about any no agursky caught his elbow and drew khuv to a halt that is exactly my problem he would not definitely not sanction this requirement khuv stared at him there were beads of sweat on the mans upper lip his eyes unblinking burned on khuv through the thick lenses of his spectacles and the kgb major thought a requirement luchov wouldnt sanction he noticed that agurskys hand was trembling where it gripped his elbow it was suddenly very easy to jump to the wrong conclusion khuv broke abruptly away from the other brushed at the sleeve of his jacket drily said but i thought you were off the bottle vasily the break was a little too sudden for you was it and now your supplies have run out and you require a restock he nodded his mock understanding i should have thought that the soldiers could easily fill your needs from the barracks at ukhta or perhaps its more urgent than that eh major said agursky his expression unchanging the last thing i need is alcohol in any case i assume that you are joking for ive already made it clear that this has to do with the creature indeed it has to do with fathoming the very nature of the creature now i repeat the projekt cannot legitimately fill my requirement and certainly luchov would never sanction it but you are an officer of the kgb you have contacts with the local police authority over them you handle traitors and criminals in short you are in a position the ideal position to assist me and if my theory works out you would have the satisfaction of knowing that you were in part responsible for the breakthrough khuvs eyes narrowed the little man was wily full of surprises not his usual self at all just what is this theory of yours vasily and youd better tell me about your requirement too as to the first i cant tell you you would probably consider it preposterous and im not even sure of it myself but as for the second and without further pause he told khuv what his requirement was deal with the devil when jazz simmons regained consciousness he saw that he was where hed fallen except now his hands were tied behind him zek who hadnt been trussed was busy moistening his brow and lips with a watersoaked rag she sighed her relief as he came to arlek sat close by on a flat stone watching her at her ministrations others of the clan or tribe moved in shadows which had lengthened a little murmuring with low background voices as jazz struggled to sit up so arlek came across and stood over him he fingered a lump under his ear where jazz had hit him displayed a right eye rapidly turning black and closing i never saw anyone fight like you he stiffly complimented his captive i didnt even see you strike me jazz grunted propped himself against a boulder and brought his knees up a little that was the idea he said theres a lot more i could show you too like how to fight the wamphyri thats what my weapons were for to keep me alive in a world where things like the wamphyri rule where the hell do men stand in the scale of things on this world anyway why bargain with the wamphyri or bow and scrape to them when you can fight them despite his painful face arlek laughed out loud other travellers heard him came forward he quickly repeated what jazz had said fight the wamphyri indeed we are only lucky they spend so much time fighting with each other but defy them hah you dont know what youre saying they dont fight with sunsiders they just make slaves of them have you seen a warrior of course not else youd not be here thats why were travellers because to remain in one place is to be at their mercy you dont fight the wamphyri my stupid friend you just stay out of their way for as long as you can he turned away walked off with his followers over his shoulder he called back talk with the woman its high time she told you something about this world youve come to at least then youll have some understanding of why im giving you both of you to shaithis of the wamphyri wolf loped out of the shadows licked jazzs face jazz scowled at the animal where were you when zek and me were fighting eh when you were fighting she corrected him wolf wasnt in it why should i risk his life i told him to be still hes just back from seeing his brothers the travellers have three or four of them all raised from cubs funny jazz said after a moment but you struck me as a woman whod bite and scratch a lot he didnt mean it as a reproach but it was and he regretted it immediately i would she said if there was any point but id look silly trying to bite a dozen travellers and their wolves now wouldnt i my first concern was for you jazz sighed i suppose i went off halfcocked didnt i but i thought you said wed be safe we might have been she said but while youve been lying there arleks had word from a runner that lardis lidesci is on his way back from the west arlek knows lardis wont give me to the wamphyri and so hell do it himself now therell be a price to pay when lardis hears about it but arleks got this group on his side and believes that in the end lardis will have to go along with him or split the tribe in any case by the time lardis gets here it will be too late jazz said can you touch me behind my ear just here ow that feels tender its soft she said and he thought he detected a catch in her voice god i thought you were dead she squeezed cold water onto the back of his head let it soak into the place where his hair was matted with blood he looked beyond her to the south to where the sun had gone down a little more crept a little more to the east a stray beam lit her face let him see her clearly and really close up for the first time she was a bit grimy but under the dirt she was very beautiful too shed be in her early thirties only a few years older than jazz himself maybe fivenine slim blonde and blueeyed her hair shone in the beam of sunlight it looked golden and bounced on her shoulders when she moved her combat suit tattered as it was getting to be fitted her figure like a glove it seemed to accentuate her delicate curves right here and now jazz supposed any woman would have looked good to him but he couldnt think of one hed rather have here or rather not have here this was no place for any woman so whats happening now he asked when the cold water had taken some of the sting out of his neck and head arlek tracked me using the talents of an old man jasef karis zek told him it wasnt too hard there was really only one place i could head for through the pass to the sphere to see if i could make it back home anyway jasefs like me a telepath you told me the wild animals here had a degree of esp jazz reminded her but you didnt say anything about the people id got the impression that only the wamphyri had these talents generally thats true she answered jasefs father was taken prisoner in a wamphyri raid this was a long time ago you understand he escaped from them and came back over the mountains he swore that he hadnt been changed in any way hed escaped before the lord belath could make a mindless zombie of him his wife took him back of course and they had a child jasef but then it was discovered that jasefs father had lied he had been changed by the lord belath but hed made his escape before the change could commence in him the truth finally came out when he became uncontrollable became in fact a thing the travellers knew how to deal with it they staked it out cut it in pieces and burned it and afterwards they kept a close watch on jasef and his mother but they were ok jasefs telepathy is something come down to him from his father or from the thing that lord belath put into him jazzs head swam partly from the throbbing pain where hed been clubbed but mainly from trying to take in all that zek was telling him stop he said lets concentrate on the important stuff tell me what else ill need to know about this planet draw me a map i can keep in my head first the planet then its peoples very well she nodded but first youd better know how we stand old jasef and one or two men have gone on into the pass to see if theres a watcher a guardian creature in the keep back there if there is jasef will send a telepathic message through it to its master the lord shaithis the message will be that arlek holds us captive and that hell use us to strike a bargain with shaithis in return for us shaithis will promise not to raid on lardis lidescis tribe of travellers if its a deal then well be handed over from what arlek was saying about the wamphyri jazz said im surprised theyll even be interested in making a deal if theyre so much to be feared they can just take us anyway if they could find us she answered and only at night they can only raid when the suns down below the rim of the world also there are some eighteen to twenty wamphyri lords and one lady theyre territorial they vie with each other they scheme against each other all the time and go to war at every opportunity its their nature wed be ace cards to any one of them except the lady karen i know for i was hers once and she let me go jazz tucked that last away for later why are we so important he wanted to know because we are magicians she said we have powers weapons skills they dont understand even more so than the travellers we understand metals and mechanisms what jazz was lost again magicians im a telepath she shrugged to be espendowed and a true man or a woman is a rare thing also were not of this world we come from the mysterious helllands and when i first arrived here i had awesome weapons so did you but im not esptalented jazz reminded her what use will i be to them she looked away not a lot which means youll have to bluff your way ill have to what if in fact we go to the lord shaithis youll need to tell him youcan read the future something like that something its hard to disprove great said jazz dully like arlek you mean he said hed read the future of the tribe she faced him again shook her head arleks a charlatan a cheap trick fortuneteller like many of earths gypsies our earth i mean thats why hes so much against me because he knows my talents real ok said jazz now lets put our earth right out of our minds and tell me some more about this earth its topography for example so simple you wont believe it she answered ive already described the planet in relation to its sun and moon very well now heres that map you asked for this is a world much the same size as earth as near as i can make out this mountain range lies slightly more south than north points east and west thats using the compass earthstyle the wamphyri cant stand sunlight just like the old legends of home say too much sunlight is fatal to vampires and they are vampires sunside of the mountains thats where the travellers live they are human beings as youve seen they live close to the mountain range for the water it gives them and for the forests and game sunup they live in easily erected homes at night they find caves and go as deep as possible the mountains are riddled with fissures and caverns ten miles or so south of the mountains there are no travellers theres nothing there for them to live on just desert there are scattered nomad tribes of aborigines at high sunup they occasionally trade with the travellers ive seen them and theyre barely human several steps down from australias bushmen i dont know how they live out there but they do one hundred miles out from the mountains and even they cant live theres nothing there at all just scorched earth despite his discomfort jazz was finding all of this fascinating what about east and west he said she nodded just coming to it these mountains are about two and a half thousand miles east to west this pass lies something like six hundred miles from the western extent of the range beyond the mountains west are swamps likewise to the far east no one knows their extent why the hell dont the travellers live close to the swamps jazz was puzzled if there are no mountains there then theres no protection from the sun which means there cant be any wamphyri right she said the wamphyri live only in their castles right here behind these mountains but the travellers cant go too far east or west because the swamps are vampire breeding grounds they are the source of vampirism just as this world is the source of earths legends jazz tried to take that in shook his head youve lost me yet again he admitted no wamphyri there and yet vampires breed in the swamps maybe you werent listening to me earlier she said i can understand that its like arlek said youve a lot to learn and only so much time in which to learn it i told you that the wamphyri are what happens when a vampire egg gets into a man or woman well the true vampires live in the swamps they breed there every now and then theres an upsurge they break out and infest the local animals and theyd do the same to men too if there were any there the wamphyri go back to a time when men were infested now they do their own infesting she shuddered the wamphyri are men but changed by the vampires in them jazz took a deep breath said whoah lets get back to topography nothing more to tell she answered starside are the wamphyri castles and the wamphyri themselves north of them lie the icelands one or two polartype creatures live there but thats all theyre legendary anyway for no living traveller ever saw one oh and at the foot of the mountains on starside between the castles and the peaks thats where the troglodytes live theyre subterranean subhuman too they call themselves szgany or trogs and hold the wamphyri as gods i saw specimens mothballed in the lady karens storehouses theyre almost prehistoric she paused for breath finally said thats it the planet and its peoples in one theres only one thing ive left out that i can think of at the moment anyway because im not sure of it myself but you can be certain its something monstrous monstrous jazz repeated her most of what ive heard is that lets have it anyway and then ive got some more questions for you well she frowned theres supposed to be something called arbiteri ingertos westweich thats from a wamphyri phrase and it means him in his western garden jazz tried it for himself she smiled a halfsmile slowly nodded arlek was wrong about you she said and so was i you do learn fast its thedwellerinhisgardeninthewest same difference jazz shrugged and then it was his turn to frown but that sounds sort of placid to me hardly monstrous thats as it may be she answered but the wamphyri fear it or him or whatever mightily now ive told you how theyre forever squabbling warring with each other well in one circumstance to one extent theyre entirely united all the wamphyri theyd give a lot to be rid of the dweller hes legended to be a fabulous magician whose home is said to lie in a green valley somewhere in the central peaks to the west i say legended but that might give the wrong impression in fact its a very recent legend maybe as little as a dozen earth years thats when the stories started apparently since then hes been said to have lived there marked out his own territory guards it jealously and deals ruthlessly with wouldbe invaders even the wamphyri especially the wamphyri as far as is known the wamphyri tell horror stories about him you wouldnt believe which considering their nature is really saying something as she finished speaking so there was movement northward in the pass arlek and his men sprang immediately alert they called forward their wolves took up their arms jazz saw that they had torches smeared in a black tarry liquid ready for lighting others stood ready with flints arlek hurried over hauled jazz to his feet this could be jasef he said hoarsely and it could be something else the sun is almost down to zek jazz said are those flints of theirs reliable theres a book of matches in my top pocket and cigarettes too seems they didnt want them only the heavy stuff hed spoken in russian and arlek hadnt caught his meaning the gypsy turned his leathery face enquiringly in zeks direction she sneered at him said something that jazz didnt catch then she unbuttoned jazzs pocket took out the matches she showed them to arlek struck one it flared at once and the gypsy cursed gave a great start struck it aside out of her hand the look on his face was one of shock total disbelief zek quickly snarled something at him and this time jazz caught the word coward he wished she wouldnt be so free with that word not with arlek then very slowly and deliberately as if she talked to a dull child she hissed for the torches you fool in case this is not jasef he gawped at her blinked his brown eyes nervously but finally he nodded his understanding in any case it was jasef an old man with a staff assisted by two younger gypsies came hobbling gratefully into the last few feeble rays of sunlight he made his way straight to arlek said there was a watcher a trog but the trogs master the lord shaithis had given him the power to speak over great distances he saw the man this one jazz come through the pass and he reported it to shaithis shaithis would have come at once but the sun yes yes get on with it arlek snapped jasef shrugged his frail shoulders i did not speak to this szgany trog face to face you understand worse things might have been lurking in the keep i stayed outside and spoke to him in my head in the manner of the wamphyri of course thats understood arlek was almost beside himself i gave the trog your message and he passed it on to his wamphyri lord then he told me to return to you what arlek was obviously dumbfounded is that all again jasef could only offer his shrug he said tell arlek of the travellers that my lord shaithis will speak to him in person i have no idea what he meant old fool arlek muttered he turned away from jasef and zeks radio crackled where its aerial projected an inch or two from her pocket its tiny red monitor light began to blink and flicker arlek gasped and leaped backwards a full pace pointed at the radio and stared roundeyed as zek produced it more of your foul magic he halfaccused we should have destroyed all of your things long ago and you with them instead of letting lardis give them back to you zek had been startled too but only for a moment now she said i got them back because there was no harm in them and they were useless to you also because they were mine unlike you lardis isnt a thief ive told the travellers many times that this thing is for communicating over great distances havent i but because there was no one to talk to it wouldnt work its a machine not magic well now there is someone to talk to and he wants to communicate and to jazz in a lower tone i think i know what this means he nodded said those ace cards you mentioned right she answered i think the lord shaithis already has one or if not an ace certainly a joker hes got karl vyotsky then she spoke into the radio unknown callsign this is zek foener send your message over her radio crackled again and a oncefamiliar voice shaky a little urgent and breathless but fairly coherent said you can throw out the radio procedure zek this is karl vyotsky do you have arlek of the travellers with you he sounded like he wasnt too sure of what he was saying as if he simply relayed the requirements of some other jazz said let me speak to him and zek held the radio to his face who wants to know comrade he asked and after a moments silence in a tone which was suddenly pleading listen british were on different sides i know but if you foul me up now its all over for me my radio is acting up sometimes it receives and other times it doesnt right now i have excellent elevation you wouldnt believe the elevation i have but still i dont trust this radio so dont waste any time with games i cant believe youd let me live once just to kill me now so if this arlek is with you please put him on tell him shaithis of the wamphyri wants to talk to him arlek had heard his name spoken twice and shaithiss name several times the conversation obviously concerned himself and the wamphyri lord he held out a hand for the radio said give it to me if jazz had held the radio he would have thrown it down stamped on it and wrecked it no communications no deal zek might well have had the same idea but she wasnt quick enough arlek snatched the radio from her fumbled with it for a moment and finally a little awkwardly said i am arlek the radio crackled some more and in a little while a new male voice said arlek of the travellers of the tribe of lardis lidesci it is shaithis of the wamphyri who speaks to you how is it you have the power and not lardis have you replaced him as leader of the tribe the voice was the darkest most menacing jazz had ever heard but at the same time while there was something inhuman about it it was definitely the voice of a man deep and rumbling with controlled strength forming each word perfectly and with unswervable authority the owner of that voice knew that whoever he spoke to that person was an inferior arlek had quickly mastered the radio lardis is away he said he may return and he may not even if he does still there are travellers with me who are dissatisfied with his leadership the futures are not at all clear many things are possible shaithis got straight to the point my watcher has told me you have the woman who was the lady karens thoughtthief the woman zekintha from the helllands also you have a man from the helllands who is a magician and bears strange weapons these things your watcher tells you are true arlek answered more at ease now and is it also true that you desire to come to some agreement with me in respect of this man and woman that is also true give me your word that in future you will not raid on the socalled tribe of lardis and in turn ill hand over to you these magicians from the helllands the radio was silent and it appeared that shaithis was considering arleks proposition at last he said and their weapons also their belongings yes arlek answered all except an axe which belonged to the man this i claim for myself even so the benefits for the wamphyri lord shaithis will be great strange weapons to aid you in your wars devices such as this communicator which you apparently understand well enough and their magic to use as you will shaithis seemed swayed hmm you know that i am only one lord and there are others of the wamphyri i can only speak for myself but you are the greatest of the wamphyri arlek was sure of himself now i do not ask for your protection merely that if the occasion should arise then that youd obstruct the other lords in their raids there are many travellers and we are after all only one small tribe you would not raid upon us and you would ensure if it please you that the raids of your fellow lords were made that much more difficult to accomplish shaithiss voice sank deeper yet i recognize no fellow lords arlek only enemies as for placing obstructions in their way i do that already i always will then you would perhaps do it more diligently arlek pressed and he repeated we are a small tribe lord shaithis i make no request in respect of travellers of any other ilk zek tried to snatch the radio from him but he turned his back on her two of his men grabbed her arms held her still blackhearted treacherous she was lost for words very well said shaithis now tell me how will you give the two to me i shall bind them securely arlek answered and leave them here in this place we are some little way beyond the keep in the pass their weapons will be left close to hand yes arlek squared back his shoulders flared his nostrils even in his treachery his dark eyes were bright it was all going according to plan the wamphyri were a curse but with the curse lifted even partly liftedit would not be long before lardis lidesci would be usurped then do it now arlek of the travellers bind them leave them there and begone shaithis conies let me not find you there upon my arrival the pass is in any case mineafter dark they lay there alone in darkness with only the sound of their own breathing to the south arlek and his band moved off it appeared that wolf had gone with them as the sounds of their hurried departure echoed back jazz said i still think that beast of yours didnt make much of a guard dog be quiet she said and that was all she lay very still jazz turned his head stared north up the pass only the cold gleam of starlight that way he strained his ears nothing as yet why be quiet he finally whispered i was trying to get through to wolf she answered he would have attacked them at any time and been killed for it i held him back hes been a good friend and companion to me and it wasnt the time now is the time for what youve seen his teeth theyre sharp as chisels ive called to him if he heard me and if hes not too involved with the other wolves hell return were bound with leather but given a little time jazz rolled over to face her well at least we should have plenty of that i saw the wamphyri castles on the stacks they were miles away and then theres the length of the pass too she shook her head jazz even now its almost too late as she spoke wolf came loping tongue lolling behind him the southern gap of the pass was lit with a fastfading golden haze too late jazz repeated her you mean because the suns down that wasnt my meaning she answered and anyway it isnt down a mile south of here the pass rises briefly to a shallow crest then dips sharply and turns a little toward the east from there its a steep steady slope down to sunside the suns just over our horizon thats all on sunside there are still many hours of light left butshaithis will be here very soon he has transport jazz was puzzled halfflippant yes he has zek answeredjazz i cant turn facedown theres a large rock sticking in me but if you can manage it then ill tell wolf to chew on your bindings youre crediting old lupus here with a deal of intelligence jazz was sceptical a mindpicture is worth a thousand words she said oh jazz said he struggled to turn facedown but before you do she said breathlessly will you kiss me she wormed herself fractionally closer what he stopped struggling only if you want to of course she said butyou might never get another chance he craned forward kissed her as best he could out of air finally they broke apart are you reading my thoughts he said no good but now i know what you taste like the sooner wolf gets to work on these bindings the better he rolled over onto his face trussed like a chicken his legs were bent at the knees feet uppermost his wrists were tied behind his back and tied again to his feet wolf at once began tugging at jazzs leather bindings no dammit jazz spat out dirt dont pull chew and in a little while wolf was doing just that jazz could see his packs gun zeks too lying only paces away the weapons had a metallic sheen in the dark i notice arlek took my compo he said compo the hardtack the food she was silent i mean he did tell shaithis hed leave everything except my hatchet quietly she said but he knew shaithis would have no use for the food jazz tried to turn his face her way oh but he eats doesnt and he paused he could see her eyes unblinking in the dark shadow of her face the lord shaithis of the wamphyri he grunted of course hes a vampire right jazz she said hope springs eternal but maybe i should tell you something of how it could be i mean if were taken i think maybe you should he said something small black chittering flitted close by came closer in dips and swoops then darted off again then another and more until the air seemed full of them jazz had frozen into stone stopped breathing but zek said bats but just bats ordinary bats not wamphyri familiars the wamphyri use the real things for that the big ones desmodus the vampire a thong parted behind jazzs back and very quickly another jazz flexed his wrists and felt a little give in his bindings wolf carried on chewing you were going to tell me about shaithiss transport jazz reminded zek no she said i wasnt her tone of voice told him not to ask any more but in any case he didnt need to as the last thong parted and his straining wrists flew apart he straightened his aching legs rolled over onto his back and looked up his eyes were drawn to an ominous stirring overhead level with the high walls of the pass a black blot several of them shut out the stars as they began to descend what the hell jazz whispered theyre here zek breathed quickly jazz oh be quick wolf loped anxiously to and fro whining while jazz got his cramped fingers to work on the thongs binding his feet at last they were free he turned to zek rolled her unceremoniously facedown across his knees went frantically to work on her knots as each one came undone he kept glancing up at the heights a little north of their position the descending blots were falling like flat stones dropped in still water sliding from side to side settling like autumn leaves on a deathly still early september morning three of them their true outlines were now distinguishable huge diamondshaped where opposing points of the diamonds merged into heads and tails they sideslipped this way and that settling silently down toward the bed of the pass zeks hands were almost free jazz left them and turned his attention to her feet it was his thought to pick her up throw her over his shoulder and run but he faced the truth his legs were still badly cramped and the darkness was now almost complete hed only be able to stumble at best with wolf bringing up a pitifully inadequate rear guard three dull thumps in close succession announced the fact that the flying things had settled to earth jazzs fingers were fully alive now deft where they hastened to free zeks feet she was panting plainly terrified its ok he kept whispering just one more knot to go down the pass maybe a hundred metres away three anomalous shapes lay humped against a horizon of stars with spatulate heads swaying at the ends of long necks the last knot came loose and as zek came struggling to her feet staggering a little so wolfs tail went down between his legs he gave a whining coughing little bark and began to back off toward the south jazzs arm was round zeks waist supporting her he said move your arms stamp your feet and get the blood pumping she didnt answer but stared with saucer eyes beyond him in the direction of the grounded flying creatures he sensed more than felt the shudder going through her moving from her head down through all her body an entirely involuntary thing almost like a dog shaking off water except jazz suspected that this was something which wouldnt shake off and he turned to follow her gaze three figures stood not ten paces away they were in silhouette but that hardly detracted from their awesome aura of presence it radiated from them in almost tangible waves a force warning of their nearinvulnerability they had all the advantages they could see in the dark were strong beyond the wildest dreams of most earthly musclemen and they were armed and not only with physical weapons but also with the powers of the wamphyri jazz didnt yet know about the latter but zek did try to avoid looking at their eyes she hissed her warning the three were or had been men so much was plain but they were big men and even silhouetted against a backdrop of stars and black nodding skybeasts jazz could see what sort of men in his mind a recurring picture of a man like these dying in an inferno of heat and flame screamed his fury and his defiance even now wamphyri the one in the middle would be shaithis jazz reckoned thered be close to eighty inches of him standing almost a full head taller than the two who flanked him he stood straight cloaked with his hair falling onto his shoulders the proportions of his head were wrong as he looked with quick curious glances from side to side and showed his face in profile jazz saw the length of his skull and jaws his convoluted snout the alert mobility of his conchlike ears it was a composite face humanbatwolf the two beside him were nearnaked their bodies were pale in starlight muscular easyflowing as liquid they wore topknots with tails dangling and on their right handsthose were silhouettes jazz would know anywhere the weapongloves of the wamphyri but so sure of themselves they stood arms akimbo almost uncaring staring at jazz and zek with their red eyes almost as if they considered the antics of insects not bound shaithis said in that unmistakable rumbling voice of his so either arlek is a fool or you are extremely clever but i see your broken thongs and so i would say that you are clever your magic of course my magic now jazz and zek backed off a stumbling pace or two the three moved after them marginally more rapid but in no great hurry gradually closing with them shaithiss lieutenants moved in the manner of men with paces swift and sure but their master seemed to flow forward as if carried on the strength of his own will his eyes were huge crimson seemed to burn with some weird internal light of their own it was hard to avoid looking into those eyes jazz thought they might well be the gates of hell but tell a moth not to investigate the candles flame zeks elbow struck him sharply in the ribs dont look at their eyes she said again run jazz if you can im all cramped ill only slow you down wolf came from nowhere snarling his outrage and probably his terror too as he loped from the shadows under the eastern cliff he leaped at shaithiss lieutenant on that flank the man turned casually toward him struck him aside lefthanded as jazz might strike aside a small yapping dog wolf backed off whined and the man hed attacked showed him his gauntlet come on then little wolf he taunted the animal come let gustan pat you on your sleek grey head get back wolf zek cried stand still shaithis commanded pointing at jazz and zek i will not chase what is mine come to heel now or be punished punished severely jazzs heel kicked metal blued steel his smg his packs were there too he fell to one knee grabbed up the gun the three who opposed him saw the weapon in his hand and came to a halt they stood stock still glaring with their red eyes what shaithiss voice was dangerously low do you threaten your master jazz faced the three where he kneeled he groped blindly in a pack then another he found what he was looking for slapped home a magazine into its housing shaithis came flowing forward i said threaten you jazz cocked his gun damn right i do but the man on shaithiss right flank had come swiftly forward in a crouch his sandalled foot came down on jazzs right wrist pinning it to the ground jazz deliberately threw himself flat tried to kick the man away but this was no novice avoiding jazzs kicks and still pinning his arm and weapon he came to his knees caught jazzs face in a massive left hand effortlessly bent his head back and showed him his raised gauntlet he unclenched his fist and hooks knives gleaming sickles coldly reflected the starlight then the man smiled and raised his eyebrows in mocking query glancing questioningly at jazzs hand on the pistolgrip of the smg the guns muzzle was sticking in dirt jazz darent pull the trigger he opened his hand and let go of the weapon and the man who held him lifted him up from the ground by his crushed face jazz could do nothing he felt that if shaithiss lieutenant wanted to he could just tear the flesh right off his skull like peeling an orange zek sprang at the man on shaithiss left gustan where he now stepped forward bullies she cried beating at him with her fists bastards vampires gustan swept her up in one arm grinned at her ran his free left hand over her body pinching here and there you should let me have this one a little while lord shaithis he grunted knock some sense into her and teach her the meaning of obedience shaithis turned on him at once shell be in thrall to me and no other watch your tongue gustan theres room in the pens for another warbeast if thats your fancy gustan shrank back i meant only be quiet shaithis cut him short he came forward sniffed at zek and nodded his head yes theres magic in this one but remember she escaped from the bitch karen watch her carefully gustan now he gazed at jazz as for you again he thrust his convoluted snout forward seemed to use it like some monstrous bloodhound and his eyes narrowed to scarlet slits hes a great magician zek cried she hung dangling in gustans arms indeed shaithis glanced at her and what pray is his talent for i sense nothing of magic in him ii read the future jazz gasped from a crushed oshaped mouth shaithis smiled a terrible smile good for i have certainly read yours and he nodded to the man who held jazz aloft wait zek cried its true i tell you youll lose a powerful ally if you kill him an ally shaithis seemed amused a servant perhaps he stroked his chin but very well let us test this talent put him down jazz was lowered until he stood on straining tiptoes shaithis studied him closely cocked his head on one side thought of a suitable test now tell me he finally said what you read in my future helllander jazz knew he was finished but there was still zek to consider ill tell you this much he answered harm this woman in any way one hair of her head and youll burn in hell the sun shall surely rise on you shaithis of the wamphyri that is not fortunetelling but wishful thinking shaithis snapped do you think to lay a curse on me what i am not to harm a hair of her head this head do you mean he reached out and grasped zeks blonde hair bunched it in a knot tightened his grip until she cried out and the sun at once rose in the pass through the mountains and lit the place with its burning lancing rays before the man who held jazz screamed in terror and hurled him away like a rag doll the englishman thought an entirely frivolous thought now thats what i call magic lardis lidesci thrown down jazz at once scrambled toward his gun and no one made the least effort to stop him the reason was simple shaithis and his two were moving back toward their mounts scuttling like upright cockroaches where they threaded their way through scattered rocks and boulders always seeking shade and refuge from the fatal blazing light and where and whenever that light fell upon them then they screamed aloud as if scalded covering their heads in their nearblind blundering panic flight but one of them gustan still carried zek who writhed like a snake in his grasp beating at his head with her tiny hands gustan was jazzs first target he snatched up his smg from the hard ground tilted its barrel downward and shook it a few tiny pebbles and a trickle of dust fell from the barrel and jazz prayed there was nothing bigger lodged in there then he was down on one knee seeking out gustans fleeting doublesilhouette finding it and aiming and at last squeezing the trigger the gun responded with a chattering diatribe of loud lead obscenities all hurled at gustans lower legs shaithiss lieutenant went down as if poleaxed raising a cloud of dust where he screamed and flopped in the shadows of a low pile of rocks and in the next moment zek came scrambling free of him jazz couldnt fire again for fear of hitting her keep to one side he hoarsely yelled give me a clear line of fire she heard him threw herself to one side a target at once presented itself moving frantically in a sweeping beam of light jazz fixed the vampire in the sights of his mind even as the light swept on and again he fired screams and curses came echoing back jazz hoped it was shaithis himself hed hit but doubted it the silhouette hadnt had his bulk on the other hand he could still feel the bruises on his face where shaithiss second man had picked him up that one would do nicely thank you the thing these creatures would have to learn was this dont mess with magicians from the helllands zek came creeping from the shadows at the base of the cliffs its me she cried as he jerked his body in her direction dont shoot wolf had met her halfway was whining and prancing about her like a great puppy get behind me jazz warned waving the girl and the wolf aside get me another magazine from my packs quick the searchlight beams from the high wall of cliffs to the south continued to play lancing down and throwing discs of reflected sunlight onto the canyon floor reflected yes jazz nodded to himself from mirrors and thank god for whoevers aiming them and now a pair of beams converged on shaithis himself where the wamphyri lord had almost reached the flank of the nearest flyer it was the opportunity jazz had waited for he could have taken zek by the hand and fled south with her but hed hoped for a shot at shaithis now his target sprang to the side of his mount and twin beams of light followed him beating at the brilliant beams where they fell on him almost as if he beat at flames but obviously with no effect whatever shaithis leaped to catch his beasts harness and draw himself up into the ornate saddle and that was where jazz caught him hed held about a third of his magazine in reserve maybe a dozen rounds just for this he opened up aiming carefully and squeezing off single shots praying that at least one would find its target shaithis in the act of climbing into the saddle suddenly jerked and fell back but still clung to the harness jazz cursed the inaccuracy of his shortrange weapon took still more careful aim his next shot must have missed shaithis but hit the flyer in a delicate spot for the great beast threw back its head and gave a weird cry then commenced lashing its tail frenziedly a moment more of this before a nest of hideous worms seemed to uncoil from the creatures belly thrusting its bulk aloft and still shaithis clung there even managing to haul himself safely into the saddle by then the other flyers were airborne too and jazz was astonished to see that they both had riders gustan at least should be crippled or should he for now jazz remembered encounter five bullets hadnt stopped him either theyd merely inconvenienced him likewise apparently with shaithis and his lieutenants zek came from behind slapped a fresh magazine into jazzs waiting hand he loaded up looked for his targets glanced skyward at the wide ribbon of stars riding high over the rearing walls of the pass and found all three targets sweeping down on him jazz get down oh get down zek was screaming she and wolf went scrambling on their bellies into a tangle of jagged rocks but jazz saw that the aerial beasts would be upon him before he could follow suit he couldnt dodge them but he might be able to turn them aside again he went to one knee and with the three flying creatures and their riders swooping upon him from only thirty metres away he opened fire in a steady sleeting arc of lead shaithis was in the centre and that was where jazz concentrated his fire he laced the three creatures and attempted to lace their riders left to right and then back again to shaithis how he could miss at this range if he missed was beyond his understanding but when the beasts and their wamphyri masters were almost on top of him he began to believe he had in fact missed until the last moment for as the firingpin on jazzs weapon slammed home on thin air and the gun fell silent and even as he made to hurl himself flat behind the nearest boulder then at last he saw the effect of his fire the three beasts were bleeding dark red ichor from rows of black holes in the forward parts of their bodies and their riders rocked to and fro in their saddles apparently holding themselves upright by willpower alone then a great lip of flesh opened in the belly of shaithiss mount as it swooped on jazz a trapdoor gash whose scalloped lower rim scraped across the top of the boulder shielding him and gouged at the dry pebbly earth behind him for a moment all was darkness and he smelled the powerful animal stench of the thing but then its shadow lifted from him by then too the unknown wielders of mirrorweapons had found their targets again and the flying beasts were bathed in lancing beams of searing light and the light did actually sear them for wherever the rays struck them clouds of loathsome evaporation billowed outwards from the shrinking flesh of the beasts like water boiling on dryice in the rarefied air of high altitudes that was the end of it reeling in their saddles the wamphyri admitted defeat dragged their bellowing straining mounts sky ward wheeled in great arcs and went racing northward to the darkness and the shadows when the pulsating throb of their leathery wings had faded into distance there was only the silence and the pounding of jazzs heart in his chest zek he called out breathlessly in a little while are you ok she came out of hiding nervously dusting herself down in a spotlight beam of bright light where it found the three man woman and wolf and held steady on them im all right she said but her voice was very trembly jazz put his gun down and reached for her where she stumbled into his arms he held her loosely at first then fiercely as much for his own comfort as for hers the encounter with the wamphyri had shaken him badly this was his natural reaction to it so he told himself anyway zek clung to him briefly then freed herself and shielded her eyes against the light playing on them from the western heights of the pass were in full view she said wasting no time jazz went to his packs found another loaded magazine for his gun he fitted it to his smg then seated himself and broke open small cardboard boxes of ammunition to start reloading the empty magazines this was his training surfacing while he worked he asked i take it weve been rescued by friends as if in answer there came a shout which echoed down to them from the heights zekintha is it you is all well the voice was anxious taut as the skin on a drumhead lardis lidesci she breathed and to jazz yes weve been rescued ive nothing to fear from lardis except lardis himself he fancies me a little thats all but you can be sure hes a good man then she cupped her hands to her mouth and called back lardis were all right come back along the pass his voice came echoing again in a moment youre not safe there hes telling us jazz grunted he finished loading up his packs said help me on with this kit as they began to make their way south again they could see several mirrors glinting on the western wall where the setting sun still turned the crags to the colour of molten gold the glittering flashes of light were descending and every so often tiny human figures were glimpsed silhouetted against the sky from the bed of the pass ahead came the distant jingle of gypsy movements and at last the panting of runners where they converged on jazz zek and wolf fleeting shadows became the outlines of men in traveller garb their faces anxious not men of arleks party but faces which were new to jazz zek knew them however she breathed her relief and said oh yes were safe enough now oh thought jazz and am i safe too what will your lardis lidesci think of me i wonder from a distance of a mile and more to the south shrill screams came echoing cut off as they reached a crescendo of terror then silence reigned and distant flames leaped up burning orange and yellow tiredly pacing it out beside zek with lardiss runners on the flanks urging them to greater speed and wolf loping in the shadows jazz said now what do you reckon all that was about zeks face was very pale i would guess lardis has dealt with arlek she quietly answered dealt with him she nodded arlek was ambitious thats no crime in itself but he was also a traitor and a coward he sought to make deals with the wamphyri at the expense of others at their total expense lardis has warned him before on several occasions now he wont have to warn him again you mean hes killed him jazz nodded pretty rough justice around here its a rough world around here she said arleks screams lingered in jazzs mind how would lardis have done it zek looked away the punishment would fit the crime she finally answered i think that maybe arlek died the death of a vampire a stake through the heart beheaded burned oh jazz took that in nodded again you mean just to be absolutely sure right her answer contained no trace of humour thats right she said to be absolutely sure vampires are hard things to kill jazz he shook his head thought god youre a cool one no im not she clasped his hand tightly very tightly in her own its just that ive been here longer than you thats all lardis lidesci wasnt what jazz had expected he was maybe fiveeight tall longhaired gangling in the arms as jazz himself but built like a rhino as opposed to jazzs cat he was young too younger by three or four years than jazz and in sharp contrast to his squat shape he seemed surprisingly agile this agility of lardiss wasnt only physical his intelligence was patent in every brown wrinkle of his face which was expressive and had more than its share of laughterlines open and frank lardiss round face framed in dark flowing hair had slanted bushy eyebrows a flattened nose and a wide mouth full of strong if uneven teeth his brown eyes held nothing of malice indeed they were usually smiling but they could also turn very thoughtful on the earth jazz and zek had left behind hed have made a professional wrestler certainly he looked like one among his people here in this vampireruled environment beyond the gate he was a natural leader and the great majority of his fivehundredstrong tribe rallied behind him all the way arlek had been a rare exception which proved the value of lardiss rule and arlek was no more since taking on the job of leader from his father five years ago when the elder lidesci had grown crippled with some arthritic disease lardis had succeeded in keeping his travellers free and secure from the everpresent wamphyri threat so that the tribe had grown and expanded absorbing other smaller gypsy groups into itself not nearly as large or strong as many of the eastern tribes still lardiss people had a record for safety which was the envy of all the travellers namely that since he became leader the wamphyri had not once ravaged successfully amongst them there were several reasons for this one of these stemmed from that fundamental difference between lardis and arlek which was so strong that it had now resulted in the latters permanent removal lardis did not believe that the wamphyri were the natural lords and masters of this sphere or that the time must come when a devastating raid would decimate his tribe he would not give in to the wamphyri would not placate them in any way other traveller tribes had tried this in the past were trying it even now and it had never worked gorgan lidesci lardiss father still talked of the fate of his first tribe when he himself had been a mere boy in those days for a time there had been a measure of peace among the wamphyri this had enabled the vampire lords to consolidate their forces and commence raiding far more effectively and in overwhelming numbers gorgans tribe a large one and governed by a council of elders had attempted to make a deal with the wamphyri to come to a mutually satisfactory arrangement with them before each sundown a raiding party would go out from gorgans people to make captives of men and women of lesser traveller groups since such minor groups might be as small as two or threefamily units ranging up to the strength of small tribes of perhaps forty adults and since they were scattered all along the sunside flank of the mountains there was little difficulty in obtaining before each sundown a tithe of about a hundred people these were kept imprisoned through the long nights so that in the event of a wamphyri raid they could be offered in appeasement the belief among the elderly leaders of gorgans tribe was simply this that so long as the wamphyri could find readymade tribute they would not have need to glut themselves on the tithepaying people of the tribe they would not bite as it were the hands that fed them for some years and through many nights this scenario held true there were times when the wamphyri came and others when they failed to find gorgans tribe on which fortunate occasions at sunup the prisoners would be set free to fend for and feed themselves and continue their lives as of old or until the next time they were taken prisoner perhaps before the next sundown and when the wamphyri did come why then there were offerings to be made and the wamphyri lords their warriors and undead soldiers would collect their tithe of one hundred travellers and depart in short the wamphyri became like taxcollectors and true to the scenario they did no harm to those who paid this regular human tribute with the result that the people of gorgans tribe grew weak fat and increasingly careless they lost their urge to travel and so avoid wamphyri incursions they used regular routes wateringholes and harbouring areas and their treks along the sunside flank of the mountains fell into ever more foreseeable patterns contrary to the very nature of travellers there was no longer any mystery to their movements in short they no longer bothered to hide themselves and thus were easily found now there were far fewer nights of peace and rest when more and more often the wamphyri would come and carry off their human tribute but what did that matter the tribe itself was safe wasnt it safe yes until the brief alliance of a handful of wamphyri lords had fallen apart until they had quarrelled and split up and each faction of the former alliance determined to build up its individual forces refill its storehouses define once more its old territorial boundaries and become strong again in the former wamphyri traditions for when armies build for war and in the case of the wamphyri not against a mutual enemy but internecine each vampire lord against his neighbours then they take and use whatever resources are available with never a thought for conservation and the natural resources of the wamphyri had ever been the flesh and blood of travellers in a single night of terror and madness one sundown the space of time between the suns setting and its rising again a matter of only forty hours gorgans tribe was decimated the wamphyri had come first shaithis to demand the usual tribute which he took then lesk the glut finally lascula longtooth more might have come belath and volse and the others except that by then there was nothing left to take or if they did come then the survivors of gorgans tribe were no longer in their customary holes waiting for them for after shaithis when the lords lesk and lascula found no tribute they had simply killed the council of elders out of hand and proceeded to herd off the flower of the tribe itself at which the handful of survivors maybe fifty old ones and a hundred children had fled for whichever sanctuaries they could discover and not many of those in a land where the people of gorgans tribe were universally loathed from which time forward the tribe had been no more and the youth gorgan had vowed never to put his faith in any deals with the treacherous wamphyri lardis in his turn was of the same mind let other tribal leaders do what they would go their own ways and good luck to them his people would never submit to the wamphyri nor would they prey on brother and sister travellers for dubious personal benefits and the wellbeing of vile inhuman starside overloads as to how lardiss convictions worked in his favour there were still tribes who operated one tithe system or another using either captive travellers stolen from other groups to placate the wamphyri or even drawing lots and sacrificing members of their own nomad communities such travellers who had adopted or accepted this servile existence were generally of large easternflank tribes numbering more than a thousand strong their size protected them from any retaliatory attacks which previous victims might possibly dream up andor allowed them to make the required periodic sacrificial cull without appreciably diminishing the strength of the tribe they dwelled east of the pass because the game was more plentiful there and survival in one sense that much easier lardis knew this and kept his people west of the pass it was a little harder to make a living but it was also that much safer when it was sunup he kept lookouts in the southern extremes of the pass to warn of travellers moving west and supply intelligence reports of their strengths persuasions and any possible dangers to his own people springing from their presence or route of passage lardis did not as a matter of course make war on travellers who kowtowed to the wamphyri but preferred to keep out of their way in the event that they should war on him however he was always ready his men even many of his younger women were welltrained formidable fighters they were skilled in ambush entrapment handtohand combat and in the use of all manner of weaponry on the few occasions when outsiders had attempted to raid on him then theyd been severely chastised so that in the five years of his leadership the legend had spread abroad that he was not a man to fool with he would accept small groups into the tribe for its own good but would not amalgamate with larger bodies his motto was this to be mediumsized is to be safe not large enough to stir too much wamphyri interest mobile enough to confuse them and just a trifle too vicious to tempt raiding parties from wamphyrisupplicants up until now at least these integers had made for a remarkably effective equation but lardiss scepticism with regard to wamphyri superiority and his disgust at the mere thought of appeasement were not the only reasons for his success oh he knew well enough the purely physical and tactical superiority of the vampire lords their strengths and cruelties the awesome horror of their warbeasts the silent speedy efficiency of their familiar spies the great bats and the mobility of their flying creatures but he also knew and made use of their weaknesses they could only raid at night usually in the lull before one or other of the interminable vampire wars to supply their war effort or replenish a depleted capability as the case may be and they invariably completed their raids with dispatch they didnt like to spend too much time sunside for while they were away they could never be sure what their starside enemies were up to aeries were wont to become occupied while their rightful masters were raiding abroad lardis knew too that the wamphyri rarely raided west of the pass most of the tribes and especially those which were wamphyrisupplicants dwelled east so why should the wamphyri waste time chasing their prey in the west when it was openly on offer in the east for the fact of it was that for all their muchvaunted pride and arrogance the wamphyri tended toward laziness if they werent warring with each other or raiding then they were scheming for war indulging themselves or asleep that was a weakness too for the great part lardis lidesci went without sleep and at sundown he took his rest in the briefest snatches another wamphyri weakness was this that while it was hard to kill them they could and did die eventually and lardis knew how to do it but there was death and there was death at the hands of another vampire that was thinkable wamphyri pride would allow however grudgingly for that possibility but at the hands of some lowly traveller never where was the glory in that who would record that what sort of way was that for a life to blink out lardis had killed no actual lord but he had twice dealt with aspirants to that final level of vampire power they had been the sons and lieutenants of lesk the glut whod thought to come against him in the hour immediately before sunup when hed be unwary and emerging from his cave sanctuary except lardis didnt know the meaning of the word unwary put a hardwood bolt through a vampire behead him burn his corpsehe was dead but lardis had made an example of lesks lads staked out the sun had found them and steamed them away slowly and with a great deal of shrieking aye let other traveller leaders balk at the difficulties involved in the slaying of vampires but not lardis the wamphyri had come to know his name perhaps even to respect it being able to live for centuries nearimmortal it was generally deemed unwise to go up against travellers like lardis who could and would given the chance so rapidly and cruelly shorten ones span to nothing then there was the wamphyri fear of silver which metal was a poison to their systems acting upon them like lead acts on men lardis had discovered a small mine of that rare metal in the western foothills and now his arrows were tipped with it also he smeared his weapons in the juice of the kneblasch root whose garlic stink would bring about a partial paralysis in any vampire causing endless vomiting and a general nervous disorder lasting for days if a kneblasch treated blade cut wamphyri flesh then the infected member must be shed and another grown in its place it wasnt so much that these things were secret or known only in the tribe of lardis indeed all travellers had been aware of these facts immemorially but rather that lardis dared use them in the defence of his people the wamphyri had forbidden to all travellers the use of bronze mirrors silver and kneblasch on penalty of dire torture and death but lardis cared not a jot he was already a marked man and a man can die only once these were some of the things then that influenced lardis in the way he ruled his tribe and did his best to keep them secure west of the pass through the mountains but there was one other element beyond lardiss control which nevertheless figured high in his favour confirming his commonsense measures it was this that somewhere in those western peaks in a small fertile valley lived the one whom the wamphyri feared and had named thedwellerinhisgardeninthewest the dweller legend was the main reason lardis had been away this time ostensibly he had been seeking new routes and harbour areas for the tribe but in reality he had been trying to locate the dweller hed reasoned that what was bad for the wamphyri must be good for the tribe of lardis the traveller also rumours had been spreading for some years now that the dweller offered sanctuary to anyone with spit enough to dare seek him out for lardis himself sanctuary wasnt the hook though certainly it would be a wonderful thing to find a safe permanent home for the tribe but if the dweller had power to defy the wamphyrithat in itself were sufficient reason to seek him out lardis would learn from him and with his new knowledge carry the fight right back to the very keeps of his vampire enemies he had sought for him and found him now he was back from that quest and back barely in time to save the helllander woman zekintha from arleks treachery zekinthaand the newcomer whose fighting skills arleks dupes had mentioned in something approaching awe on a onetoone basis and without the intervention of his followers arlek hadnt stood a chance against jazz well if there was one thing lardis lidesci liked it was a good fair fighter or even a good dirty one lardis saw them coming across the canyons floor stepped forward to meet them he clasped zek in his great arms kissed her right ear tear down the mountains he greeted her and im glad youre safe zekintha only just she answered breathlessly all credit to this one and she nodded at jazz weary now and climbing out of his gear as if he unhitched an anchor jazz returned her nod then looked all about in the canyons hushed twilight men and wolves moved here and there in the shadows of the cliffs their jingling and low talk seeming very normal and pleasant to jazzs ears but central in a jumble of boulders which lay towards the western wall burned a great fire emitting roiling black smoke which climbed into a nearperpendicular column in the still air arleks funeral pyre he supposed some hundred or more yards to the south the pass turned a little eastward and there commenced a steady descent toward the unseen foothills of sunside the rays of the slowly declining sun blazing full through that last stretch of pass beat on the western wall of the canyon and lit its crags and outcrops coming down from those heights agile as goats a halfdozen male travellers bore mirrors like shields in their capable hands always directing the suns beams into those gloomy deeps of the gorge which lay to the north jazz frowned as the first of the mirrorbearers came closer the mans great oval mirror was of glass surely did the travellers have that sort of technology at their disposal lardis watched jazz strip down to his combat suit then approached him smilingly with outstretched right hand jazz tried to take his hand found himself clasping his forearm instead lardis likewise clasped his it was a traveller greeting a helllander lardis nodded how are you called michael simmons jazz answered jazz to my friends again lardiss nod then ill call you jazz for now but i need time to make up my mind about you ive heard rumours about helllanders like yourself some take sides with the wamphyri working for them as wizards as youve seen jazz told him im not one of them and in any case i dont think any er helllander would side with the wamphyri of his own free will lardis took jazz aside guided him toward a spot where a party of men sat forlornly on broken boulders heads hanging low around them stood a guard composed of lardiss men the ones who were seated had been arleks followers jazz recognized several faces as jazz and lardis approached the captives hung their heads lower still lardis scowled at them said arlek would have given you to the wamphyri lord shaithis but he was a great coward and he coveted the leadership of the tribe youve seen the fire burning there jazz nodded zek told me what youd do he said zek lardiss smile faded a little did you know her before did you come to seek her out and take her back i came because i had no choice jazz answered not because of zek i had heard something of her wed never met not until now back in our own world our people arenot friends but here youre both helllanders strangers in a strange world it draws you together lardiss assessment was fairly accurate jazz shrugged i suppose it does he looked straight into lardiss face will you make zek an issue lardiss expression didnt change no he said shes a free woman i have no time for small things the tribe is my main concern i have had thoughts about zekintha butshe would be too much of a distraction anyway i fancy shed rather be friend and adviser than wife also shes a helllander a man shouldnt get too close to something he doesnt understand jazz smiled the place you call the helllands is very large with many people of diverse cultures its a strange place but hardly the hell you seem to imagine it to be lardis raised his eyebrows thought about what jazz had said zekintha says much the same thing he said shes told me a great deal about it weapons greater than all the wamphyri warbeasts put together a continent of black people dying in their thousands of disease and starvation wars in every corner of your world men against men machines that think and run and fly all filled with fire and smoke and a terrible roaring it sounds close enough to hell to me jazz laughed out loud put it that way and you could be right he said he had kept his smg whose strap he now adjusted where it crossed his shoulder lardis glanced at the weapon said yourgun the same as zekinthas i saw her kill a bear with it the bear had more holes than a fishing net now it is broken but she still carries it it can be repaired jazz told him ill do it as soon as i have the time but your people understand metal it surprises me no one has tried to fix it because theyre afraid of it lardis admitted me too theyre noisy things these guns jazz nodded his agreement but noise doesnt kill the wamphyri he said lardis grasped upon that became excited as a child i heard the chattering of it echoing up the pass did you really strike at shaithis at close range too jazz smiled wryly for all the good it did i put a good many holes in their flyers and a few in them too i think but it didnt stop them better than nothing lardis slapped his shoulder their wounds will take time to heal give the vampires in them something to do keep them out of mischief a while then he grew thoughtful again these men he scowled at the seated group of unfortunates were arleks followers if theyd had their way youd be vampirefodder by now with your gun you could kill them all as easy as that he snapped his fingers zek had followed on behind she heard what lardis said and her eyes went very wide the men lardis had been speaking about had also heard him they straightened up where they sat their faces suddenly gaunt and full of apprehension jazz looked at them remembered how a few of them had seemed ill at ease with some of arleks ideas and actions arlek made fools of them he answered lardis great fools and you werent here to set it right he was a coward as youve said he needed others to lend his opinions strength these are the ones who were foolish enough to listen to him obviously they wish they hadnt but you punish traitors not fools lardis glanced at zek grinned it might have been me speaking he said and she relaxed and took a deep breath on the other hand lardis continued one of these men struck you from behind dont you feel any anger toward that one jazz touched the tender bump behind his ear some he admitted but not enough to want to kill him i could teach him a lesson perhaps he wondered what lardis was after obviously hed heard how jazz had dispatched arlek maybe he wanted to see his fighting skills at first hand it would be a bonus for the tribe to have a man who could teach them or at least introduce superior fighting skills you want to teach him a lesson lardis grinned jazz had guessed right now lardis walked among the seated men pushing them left and right off their boulder seats roughly away from him as he poured his silent scorn on them which one of you struck him he demanded a young man muscular nervouslooking slowly stood up lardis pointed to an area of flat ground fairly clear of rocks over there he growled wait jazz came forward lets at least make it a match he doesnt stand a chance on his own does he have a friend a close friend lardis raised his expressive eyebrows shrugged he scowled at the youth well do you unlikely i should think another young man burlier craggier less apprehensive got to his feet as he joined the first on the open ground jazz thought deal with you first out loud he said that should do it he made sure his smg was on safe and handed it to lardis who accepted it gingerly and held it awkwardly jazz approached his two opponents whenever youre ready he said casually unless you havent the guts for it in which case you can get down on your knees and kiss my boots the last was a deliberate ploy to goad them into speedy action cause them to lose their selfcontrol which it did they looked at each other their chests filled out and they charged like young bulls and almost as wildly jazz had determined to put on a show for lardis he avoided the rush of the man whod clubbed him delivered a slicing rabbit punch to his neck as he flew past not sufficient to put him out of the fight not yet but just hard enough to send him dazed and sprawling to the hard ground the second man sturdier and a shade more wary swerved his body and threw himself into a dive rolling to knock jazzs feet out from under him the plan failed as jazz leaped high avoiding his tumbling body then stepped in close as the clever one sprang to his feet he offered a feint telegraphing a blow to his opponents face the other saw it coming snatched the top half of his body back out of harms way which left his lower half not only exposed but proffered jazz kicked him smartly in the groin but again not hard enough to cripple him sufficient only to make him curl up and drop like a stone the first one groggy but game was back on his feet hed picked up a jagged rock now commenced circling jazz while looking for an opening jazz was longlegged and knew that in certain circumstances the reach of his legs was greater than that of his arms and in any case this was no boxing match he halfturned from the man with the rock who at once stepped forward but as jazz turned away so he bent his body sharply forward and downward from the waist lifting and lashing out with his right foot the move was so fast and so alien to any of the others previous fighting experience that he seemed hardly aware of its offensive character at all but suddenly his arm was numb and the rock had been kicked from his grasp still in fluid motion jazz straightened up continued his turn through its natural circle and sliced the other stifffingered across the adams apple and again he pulled his punch then he fell into a defensive crouch looking to see what damage hed done and finally he relaxed straightened up stepped back and folded his arms both opponents were on the ground one clutching his groin and groaning rocking himself to and fro and the other choking sucking at the air massaging his throat theyd recover soon enough but it would be a long time before theyd forget for a moment there was a stunned silence then lardis began clapping his hands in spontaneous applause many of the men with him followed suit but not arleks exgang they sat very quietly looking anywhere except at jazz to them he offered well is there anyone else would like to try me but there were no takers i leave their punishment to you jazz lardis shouted what shall be done with them youve shamed them enough jazz answered arlek had his warnings which he failed to heed hes paid for that now these men have been warned if its my choice then i say leave it at that good lardis barked his agreement men at once stepped forward to help their two fallen colleagues to their feet one of them was a mirrorbearer he carefully laid his mirror down as he stooped to assist the man with the bruised throat jazz glanced at the large oval mirror where it lay facedown then looked again then pounced on it what he gasped what in all the zek had been moving toward him now she came flying jazz what is it lardis he called out ignoring her for the moment lardis where did you get these mirrors and suddenly quite out of character his voice had a breathless unbelieving quality lardis came over he was grinning ear to ear my new weapons he answered with something of pride i went to seek out the dweller and found him as a sign of our friendship he gave me these fortunate for you that he did jazz picked up the mirror stared incredulously at its backing fortunate indeed he finally got the words out maybe in more ways than you know he licked his lips looked at zek for her confirmation that his eyes werent playing games with him she looked at what he held in his suddenly trembling hands and her jaw dropped my god she said very faintly for the mirror was unmistakably backed with chipboard to which some traveller had attached leather straps what was more it bore a manufacturers label carrying the embossed legend made in the ddr kurt gemmler und sohn gummerstr east berlin taschenka harrys quest the trek begins taschenka tassi kirescu was nineteen small and slim completely unpolitical and very frightened her skin was a little darker than that of the rest of her family her eyes were large and very slightly tilted in an oval face her hair was black and shiny to match her eyes and she wore it in braids tassis father kazimir whom she hadnt seen since the night they were arrested had used to explain jokingly that she was a throwback theres mongol blood in you girl hed told her his eyes sparkling blood of the great khans who came this way all of those hundreds of years ago either thator i dont know your mother as well as i think i do following which anna tassis mother would invariably sputter furiously and chase him with whatever she could lay her hands on that of course had been in the good times all of a few weeks ago which now felt like several centuries tassi had known nothing of mikhail simonovs real reason for coming to yelizinka in the ural foothills the story shed heard was that he was a city boy whod been something of a wild one that hed always been getting himself into one sort of trouble or another until finally hed been sent logging as a punishment a penance guaranteed to cool him off well places didnt come much cooler than yelizinka not in the winter anyway but tassi wasnt at all sure that mikhails blood had been cooled by it in fact theyd very quickly become lovers in a strange sort of way strange because hed always been quick to warn her that it couldnt last and that therefore she mustnt fall in love with him strange too in that shed felt exactly the same way about it hed serve his time here and wipe his record clean and then hed move on probably back to the city moscow and she would find herself a husband from the logging communities around the attraction had been the loneliness shed felt in him and a contradictory bowstring tension lying just beneath the surface of him for his part once in a dreamy faraway moment hed told her that she was the only real thing in his life right now that sometimes he felt the entire world and his place in it were just an enormous fantasy and now shed been told that he was a foreign spy which to tassi had seemed like the greatest possible fantasy at first but that had been before they took her down into the perchorsk projekt since theneverything had turned into a real fantasy a horror story a living nightmare her father had been incarcerated in the cell next door to hers and she knew he had been tortured on a number of occasions shed heard it all coming right through the sheetsteel walls the hoarse terrified panting the sharp slapping sounds his anguished cries for mercy but thered been precious little of that last then three days ago thered been one especially bad session in the middle of it at its height the old man had screamedand then hed stopped screaming abruptly since when tassi had heard nothing from him at all she couldnt even bear to think what might have happened she hoped the silence meant that her father was now in a hospital somewhere recovering she prayed thats what it meant anyway almost as bad had been major khuvs questioning the kgb major had not once laid a hand on her but shed had the suspicion that if he did he would hurt her terribly the awful thing was that she didnt have didnt know anything to tell him if she had then fear on its own would have obliged her to tell it or if not fear certainly the desire to stop them hurting her father and then there had been the beast vyotsky tassi hadnt stood so much in fear of that one as in horror of him and she had sensed had known instinctively that he enjoyed her horror feeding upon it like a ghoul on rotting flesh there had been little or nothing sexual about his treatment of her that time when hed had her photographed naked with him it had all been done for effect partly to shame her underline her vulnerability and make her feel the lowest of the low partly to show her the power of her tormentor that he could strip her naked leer at her and paw her body while she was incapable of lifting a ringer to stop him but mainly to aid him in the mental torture of someone else the sadist vyotsky had told her that the photographs were for the benefit of the british spy michael simmons whom she had known as mikhail simonov to drive the poor bastard out of his mind plainly the idea had delighted vyotsky he thinks hes so cool hah hed said if this doesnt get him boiling then nothing will the kgb bully was quite mad tassi was sure even though he hadnt been back to torment her for quite some time now still she would freeze whenever she heard someone approaching the door of her cell and if the footsteps should pausethen her breathing would go ragged at once and her poor heart begin beating that much faster it had started to beat that way just a little while ago but on this occasion her visitor was only vyotskys superior officer major khuv only major khuv tassi thought as the suave kgb officer entered her cell that was a laugh but she wasnt even close to laughing as he cuffed her wrist to his own then told her taschenka my dear i want to show you something its something i feel you really ought to see before i question you again at any great length youll understand why soon enough stumbling along behind him she made no effort to even guess where he was taking her essentially a peasant girl to her the projekt was a maze a nightmare labyrinth of steel and concrete her claustrophobia had so disoriented her that she was lost from the first step she took across the threshold of her cell tassi khuv murmured leading her on through the almost deserted dimly lit night corridors i want you to think very carefully much more carefully than youve been thinking so far and if theres anything at all you can tell me about the subversive activities of your brother your father the people of yelizinka in general and in particular about the underground antisoviet organization to which any or all of them belongedi mean this really is going to be your last chance tassi major she gasped the word out sir i know nothing of any of these things if my father was what you say he was oh he was khuv glanced at her and nodded gravely you may be sure thathe was it was the way he said the last word its ominous emphasis and in a moment it had tassis free hand flying to her mouth whatwhat have you done to him her question was the merest whisper they had arrived at a door bearing a legend familiar to khuv but one which tassi had never seen before she only glanced at it it said something about a keeper and security classified persons only using his plastic id tag and as the doors mechanisms were activated khuv turned to tassi and answered her question done to him to your father me i have done nothing he did it all himself with his refusal to cooperate a very stubborn man kazimir kirescu the door opened with a click khuv held it open a crack called out vasily is all in order oh yes major came back an unctuous reply all ready khuv smiled at tassi the smile of a shark on its attack run my dear he said shoving the door open wide and leading her into the room of the creature im going to show you something unpleasant and tell you something even more unpleasant and finally suggest the most unpleasant thing of all following which you shall have the rest of the night and all day tomorrow to think about where you stand but no more time than that the room was in neardarkness to which the ceiling lights added only an eerie red glow tassi could make out the figure of a small man in a white smock and the shape of a large oblong box or tank covered with a white sheet the tank must be of glass for a small white light in the wall behind it shone right through casting on the sheet a milky ghostly outline the silhouette of something that flopped sluggishly inside the tank come closer khuv drew tassi toward the tank dont be afraid its perfectly safe it cant hurt you not yet standing beside the kgb major unconsciously clutching his arm in her innocence as she stared wideeyed at the weird silhouette on the sheet tassi heard him say to the scientist in the white smock very well vasily lets see what we have here vasily agursky tugged at one corner of the sheet and it began to slide slowly from the tank letting a little more of the subdued light shine through then the slide accelerated and the sheet whispered to the floor the thing in the tank had its back to the three feeling their eyes upon it it glanced over one hunched shoulder tassi looked at it stared at it in disbelief shuddered and clung to khuv that much more fiercely he patted her hand almost absentmindedly in a fashion which in other circumstances might almost have seemed fatherly except this was not her father but the man who had let karl vyotsky terrorize her well tassi he said his voice very low very sinister and what do you think of that she didnt know what to think of it and later she would give anything to be able to forget it entirely but for now the shape of the thing was vaguely manlike though even in this poor light it was quite obviously not a man it appeared to be feeding using taloned hands to tear its food and stuff strips of raw red meat into its mouth its face was mainly hidden but tassi could see the way its jaws worked and the baleful glare of the very human eye that peered back over its shoulder hunched down crouching or squatting there on the sandy floor of its tank the thing might have been an ape but its leprous skin was corrugated and its feet gripped the floor with too many hooked skeletal digits an appendage like a tail which was not a tail lay coiled behind it tassi gasped as she saw that this extraneous member too was equipped with a rudimentary lidless almost vacant eye the thing was entirely freakish and as for what it fed upon tassi gave a massive start jumped back from the tank the creature had snatched up more food from the floor of its glass cell and a human arm had suddenly flopped into view dangling from its terrible hands as tassis eyes bulged in horror so the thing commenced munching on the dismembered arms hand and fingers steady my dear said khuv quietly as the girl moaned and reeled beside him butbutits eating aa a man khuv finished it for her or whats left of one indeed it is yes oh it will eat any sort of meat but it appears to like human flesh the best and to agursky vasily do you have something for tassi the strange little scientist came forward pressed something several somethings into her hand a wallet a ring an id card and however familiar these things were for a long moment her mind wouldnt recognize them refused to make the final terrible connection then she felt dizzy and put her free hand on the glass wall of the tank to steady herself and her eyes went from the items in her hand to the thing where it crouched horrified but at the same time fascinated she stared and stared at it were these men trying to tell her thatthat this creature was eating her father agursky had gone to one side of the room where suddenly he switched up the lighting everything sprang into sharp almost dazzling definition the creature threw its food to one side and turned snarling toward khuv and tassi where they both shrank instinctively back and that was when she fainted and would have fallen to the floor if her wrist hadnt been cuffed to the majors and if he hadnt turned quickly to catch up her sagging body in his arms for the thing in the glass tank wasoh it was something hellish yes nightmarish but the greater nightmare was this that however monstrous and warped however altered and alien that things caricature of a face was when it had snarled at her still shed recognized it as the face of her father jazz simmonss georgian terrace bachelor flat in hampstead was colourful cluttered and when harry keogh had first moved in a little over twentyfour hours ago it had been bitterly cold and the telephone was off hed had ebranch clear it for him to use the place as his base and hed warned them not to come bothering him he had darcy clarkes word that he could play the entire game his way without interference his way had been to attempt to absorb something of the atmosphere of the place first maybe he could get to know simmons by understanding how hed lived his tastes likes and dislikes and his routine not his work routine his private routine harry didnt believe that a man was what he did professionally he believed a man was what he thought privately the first thing that had impressed itself upon him was the clutter privately jazz simmons had been a very untidy man maybe it was his way of relaxing when youre trained to a knifeedge you have to have a place where you can sheathe yourself now and then or else you might cut yourself this had been jazzs unwinding place the clutter consisted of books and magazines dropped any and everywhere more off the bookshelves than on them spythrillers lay alongside piles of foreign language publications most of the latter being russian there was also beside jazzs bed a dusty footthick stack of pravdos topped by a copy of the latest playboy harry had had to smile hardly the most compatible meeting of ideologies also in the bedroom were dustfree framed photographs of jazzs father and mother on the wall a lifesize marilyn monroe poster a cabinet standing close to the window containing cups won in various ski events and again affixed to the wall a battered pair of bright yellow skis and sticks which must be of some special significance a recessed cupboard in a narrow passageway had showered harry with an accumulation of skiing requisites and beside jazzs video cassette recorder were haphazardly stacked films of all the main winter athletics for the last five years while jazz hadnt been available to participate still he hadnt been willing to miss out entirely there were photographs of girls too quite a pile of them in one corner of a bedroom drawer a scrapbook contained a photographic record of jazzs military term perhaps significantly a second album carefully wrapped in an old pullover consisted of faded letters to jazz from his father harry had let the feel of all of these things sink in hed slept in jazzs bed used his kitchen and bathroom even his dressinggown he discovered several phone numbers of old girlfriends called them and asked about jazz discovered them to be a mixed bunch with little in common except their obvious intelligence and the fact that one and all they thought jazz was a very nice guy harry was starting to think so too and where before michael j simmons had been merely a means to an end hopefully to the discovery of harrys family now he had become something of an issue in his own right in short the horizon of harrys obsession was expanding beyond purely personal interests at this stage too harry had felt that he now must get a little closer to simmons himself or if not the real man then at least his metaphysical echo simmons no longer existed in this universe but he had once existed in the past in harrys incorporeal days he had been able to travel into the past and immaterialize there hed been able to manifest a ghostly semblance of himself on the bygone event screen now embodied and fully corporeal once more this was no longer possible it would create unthinkable paradoxes perhaps even damage the structure of time itself he could still travel in time but while doing so he must never attempt to leave the metaphysical mobius continuum for the real world not that this was a necessity to achieve his aim on this occasion timetravel itself should suffice and so he entered the mobius continuum found a pasttime door and journeyed back a little way less than two years into the past in doing so harry had altered his position in time but not in space he still occupied jazz simmonss flat and so when as he judged it he had journeyed far enough and reversed his direction to head once more for the future he knew beyond a reasonable doubt that the strong blue lifethread which travelled parallel to his own must be that of simmons for after all hed picked it up in simmonss flat and following that lifethread into the future he also knew that he was now about to prove one way or the other any similarity between simmonss transference and those of his wife and son the proof wasnt long in coming and temporaneously it agreed exactly with the time darcy clarke had specified in defining simmonss exit point although he expected it still harry didnt see it coming just an eyeballsearing blaze of white light following whichhe journeyed on alone jazz simmons had gone elsewhere the same elsewhere presumably as harry jnr and brenda before him harry didnt need to go back and play it all over again hed seen the same thing plenty of times before and it was always the same there was nothing new here the only difference being that simmons had gone in a single white instantaneous blaze while the departure of harry jnr and his mother had been accompanied by twin bombbursts as for what those terminal flares signified harry was at a complete loss he only knew that before the white dazzle blue lifethreads raced for the future and that after it those lifethreads no longer existed not in this universe anyway which led to his next line of enquiry mobius himself august ferdinand mobius a german mathematician and astronomer lay in his grave in a leipzig cemetery his dust was there anyway which to harry keogh necroscope was one and the same thing harry had been to see mobius before to discover the secret of the mobius continuum in life mobius had invented it and in death hed gone on to develop his theories into precise sciences albeit sciences no living person would ever comprehend none that is except harry keogh himself and harrys son of course the last time harry was here hed come by rather more conventional means by air to berlin then through checkpoint charlie to the east as a tourist but mundane as his arrival had been his exit from leipzig had been along an entirely different route through a mobius door that had been harrys first experience of the mobius continuum since when hed become an expert in his own right but there had been far more than that to harrys visit and even now he might not have discovered the correct mental formulae but for the spur hed received at that time harry had been on the wanted list of the soviet ebranch the emerging vampire boris dragosani a member of that branch had wanted to take harry alive if possible and draw from him the secret of his weird talents dragosani was a necromancer who ripped the private thoughts of the dead out of their ravaged bodies who read their secrets in brain fluids and torn ligaments in ruptured organs and eviscerated guts it would be so much easier if he could simply talk to the dead like harry they might not respect him as they did harry but the threat of defilement should suffice to open them up if notwell there was always the other way dragosani had issued a detention warrant ordering the east german grenzpolizei to pick harry up on trumpedup charges they had tried and out of necessity harry had solved the final equation of mobiuss metaphysical spacetime dimension with which he could summon doors on the entire spacetime universe barely in time harry had used one of these doors ironically perhaps it had floated into view across the face of mobiuss headstone from then on harrys invasion of the soviet ebranch and the destruction of dragosani had been an inexorable process in the course of which his own body had been destroyed and abandoned as once more he escaped to the mobius continuum there as an incorporeal being a bodiless mind and soul eventually he had discovered and entered into the drained shell of alec kyle this had been an almost involuntary event kyles body a living vacuum had seemed to reach out and suck harry in but it had given him a place among men again and ended what was otherwise an interminable existence in the matterless mobius continuum and now harry was back in leipzig standing by mobiuss grave as before almost nine years had passed since last he was here but he hadnt forgotten those events which terminated his first visit and so on this occasion hed come by night a moon hung low over the citys skyline and the stars were very bright between streamers of fastfleeing cloud the night wind moaning through the headstones sent wrinkled leaves scurrying like mice and harry felt a chill in his bones which was born partly of the natural cold of a november night and partly of his feeling of alienation here in this place but the cemetery gates were closed for the night the lights in the city subdued and apart from the scrape of leaves all was silence he sought mobius out and found him and as before the great mathematician was busy with his formulae and his calculations tables of planetary mass and motion the weights of the sun and her satellite worlds in their careening round were balanced against orbital velocities and gravitic forces formulae so complex that even harrys intuitive grasp found their purpose elusive together with simultaneous equations whose answers filled themselves in even as he watched all of these figures and configurations beat on harrys awareness like the everchanging results of an ongoing process on the screen of some vast computer and harry saw that the problem was so complex and so close to completion that he let it go on undisturbed by his presence to the end at which time the screen went blank and mobius sighed it was a strange thing even now to hear the sigh of a dead man sir said harry are you available now eh said mobius in that moment before he recognized harrys thoughts then is that you harry he continued eagerly i thought there was someone here you very nearly put me off just then and i was working on something which is very important i know harry nodded i saw it but i didnt want to disturb you those are very wonderful discoveries oh mobius seemed surprised you could understand my working then very well and what have i discovered harry drew back a little hesitating he was in the presence of genius and he knew it mobius had been a great mathematician all his life and after that life he had continued his work unabated where harrys mathematical skills were intuitive mobius had worked hard to achieve his results no quantum leaps for him but dogged trial and error and an unwavering allconsuming passion for his subject it seemed somehow improper for harry to have come here at this time spying on the man in his triumph not at all mobius tuttutted him what a man who can impose his physical being on the metaphysical universe and use it at will spying on me i consider you a colleague harry an equal and truth be told you couldnt have come visiting at a more opportune time now come on tell me what ive been doing what is it that ive proved with my numbers eh harry shrugged very well he said youve shown that instead of the nine planets we believed to exist in the solar system there are in fact eleven both of the new worlds are small but true planets for all that one occupies a position exactly behind jupiter with the same rotation period so that its always occluded and the others a nonreflector and lies about as far out again as pluto from the sun good mobius applauded him and their moons eh harry was taken by surprise i read only the problem youd set yourself and the answers to the problem as you arrived at them there were slight deviations percentages of error i suppose but he paused but but harry could almost picture mobius raising his eyebrows all the clues were there in the equations harry no very well ill tell you the inner world has no moon but the percentage of error as you call it for the outer world was just too big to be ignored i have checked it and it indicates an almost spherical nickeliron moon three kilometres in diameter orbiting the parent at a distance of twentyfour thousand planetary circumferences now that is what we call a calculation of course i shall prove it by going there and seeing it for myself harry shook his head in defeat offered a wry grimace youre too good for me he said you always will be and after a moment do you want me to let this leak out as it were i could do that easily enough with just sufficient information to set the entire astronomical fraternity jumping it could be done anonymously by an amateur you understand on the solemn promise that when the calculations are shown to be correct then one of the two worlds should be named mobius mobius was stunned could you really do that harry im sure i could find a way my boygod mobius was overjoyed at the prospect harry how i wish i could shake your hand you can do rather more than that harry told him growing serious in a moment you remember the last time i came to see you i had a problem well now i have an even bigger one lets have it then said the other at once and harry told him of his quest for his wife and son he finished by explaining and so you see its no longer simply a question of my family but i also have the british agent michael simmons to consider mobius seemed nonplussed and youve come to me for help well obviously you have but for the life of me i cant see what i can do i mean if theyre not here these three people if they have physically ceased to exist in this universe then how can i or anyone else suggest where or how to find them the universe is the universe harry its very name defines it it is the all if theyre not in it then theyre not anywhere that was my line of reasoning too harry admitted until recently but you and me why dont we both contradict that very fact eh hows that the mobius continuum harry answered by way of explanation you yourself admit that its a purely metaphysical plane not of this universe step into the mobius continuum and you step out of the three mundane dimensions the mobius continuum not only transcends the three dimensions of mundane space but time also and runs parallel to all of them and what of a black hole what of it well isnt a black hole an exit from this universe thats how theyve always been explained to me a focus of gravity so great that space and time themselves are drawn into the whorl and if they are exits from the here and now then where the hell do they lead to another part of the universe mobius answered that seems the only likely explanation to me mind you i havent really looked at black holes yet i have them scheduled though are you missing the point or deliberately avoiding it harry wanted to know this is my question if a black hole goes somewhere emerging maybe lightyears away what of the space in between where is the material which is drawn into the hole between its disappearing and its reappearing you see to me this all seems very much like our mobius continuum go on mobius was fascinated ok said harry lets look at it this way first we have thelets call it the mundane universe and well say it looks like this he showed mobius a mental diagram why the bends the mathematician was immediately curious because without them it would just be a pair of straight lines harry told him the bends give it definition make it look like something like a ribbon for the purpose of the exercise why not for all i know it could be a circle or maybe a sphere but this way we can envisage a past and a future too very well mobius conceded now in this diagram of the universe harry went on we cant go from a to b without crossing the edge we can go up the ribbon from a to the edge then down to b or down to the edge and up it makes no difference the edge represents the distance between a and b right agreed said the other now this is how i see the mobius continuum said harry and he continued its the ribbon universe we know with the halftwist of your mobius strip now has turned through ninety degrees to become forever which means that a and b are now on the same plane we no longer have to cross the edge we can go from one to the other instantaneously now go on said mobius again but much more thoughtfully previously weve thought of it like this said harry likelike putting on a pair of sevenleague boots and striding to our destinations in seconds covering distances that should take hours in minutes but ive checked it out and its not like that in fact we go there instantaneously accordingly to earthtime anyway its not simply that we go there faster but that the space in between actually disappears after a little while mobius said i think i understand what you want to know is this if for us the space between a and b reduces to zero if it disappears exactly harry cut in where does it go to but its an illusion mobius cried its still there its we who have disappeared into the mobius continuum as you insist upon calling it now were getting somewhere harry took a deep breath you see the way i see it the mobius continuum is nomansland its limbo its the middle ground between universes universes plural it has doors to the past the future and to every point in present time using it we can go everywhere and when or at least i can because i still have a lifethread to follow but the point im trying to make is this i believe there may be other doors which we havent found yet we dont have the equations for them and i believe that one of those doors when i find it will lead you to your wife and son and to michael j simmons yes mobius nodded and gave it some thought other doors he mused then grant me this that i know more about the mobius dimension than you do that i have had one hundred and twenty years to examine it more thoroughly than you could ever hope to that i discovered it and have used it to go places you can never go not in your lifetime oh said harry oh mobius raised his eyebrows again oh and can you go to the centre of a star in betelgeuse to measure its temperature can you visit the moons of jupiter or sit in the middle of that planets monumental tornado which we call the red spot can you journey to the bottom of the marianas trench and every other deep on earth to calculate the mass of water in this world no you cant but i can and have now grant me this that i know the mobius continuum better than you do when the point was made like that there seemed little use in arguing it harry could only agree but i think youre going to tell me something i dont want to hear he said you know i am mobius told him there are no other doors we havent discovered harry not in the mobius continuum other universes which seems to me something of a contradiction in itself i cant say and in any case youre talking to the wrong man for i only deal in the threedimensional worlds we know but of one thing im sure you wont find your way into any parallel world through the mobius continuum he fell silent as harrys disappointment swelled like a physical thing until it hung heavy over mobiuss grave like a blanket of fog sir harry finally said i thank you for your time ive already wasted far too much of it not at all mobius answered time is only important to the living i have more than enough of time i just wish i was able to help youve helped harry was grateful if only to settle a point ive argued with myself time and time again you see i know harry jnr and his mother are alive and i know that he can use the mobius continuum maybe even better than we can hes alive but not in this universe so he must be in some other theres no way round that i thought hed gone there wherever along the strip youve assured me that he hasnt sothere has to be some other route i already have a clue where to start looking for it exceptfrom here on in my work becomes that much more dangerous thats all and now wait said mobius ive been considering your diagrams can i show you one for a change by all means very well heres your ribbon universe again and a parallel universe of a similar construction as you can see mobius continued ive joined them by use of a black hole harry guessed no for were talking about survivability nothing of solid matter and shape can enter that sort of awful maw and retain any sort of integrity no matter what you are when you enter a black hole you come out if you come out gaseous atomic pure energy which cancels out white holes too harry was growing gloomier by the minute but not grey ones said mobius grey holes harry frowned yes i see it now mobius mused almost to himself grey holes without the disruptive gravity of black holes and lacking the awesome radiation of white ones gateways pure and simple between universes entropy radiators perhaps inescapable once entered into there would have to be more than one if a traveller intended to make the return journey anyway harry waited and in a little while weird equations began flickering once more on that amazing computer screen which mobius called his mind they came faster and faster calculi in endless streams which left harry dizzy as he tried to grasp their meaning for seconds merging into minutes the mental display continued only to be shut off suddenly leaving the screen blank and in a little while longer it ispossible said mobius it could occur in nature and might even be duplicated by man except of course that men would have no use for it it would be a byproduct of some other experimentation an accident but if i knew how if i could translate your math into engineering youre saying i could manufacture this well gateway harry was clutching at straws you hardly mobius chuckled but a team of scientists with enormous resources and a limitless energy supply yes harry thought of the experiments at perchorsk and his excitement was now obvious thats the confirmation i needed he said and now i have to be on my way it was good to talk to you again mobius told him take care harry i will harry promised and hugging his overcoat close to him harry conjured a mobius door and took his departure leaves blew skitteringly between the graves and along the pathways one such leaf taken by surprise as it leaned against harrys shoe suddenly went tumbling across the empty flags where a moment ago hed been standing but now under the highflying moon and cold glittering stars the leipzig graveyard was quite quite empty some three days prior to harrys visit to mobius jazz simmons journeyed west with zek lardis and his travellers journeyed in the golden glow of the slowly setting sun hed been pleased to be relieved of his kit all except his gun and two full magazines and knew that even though he was dogtired he could now hold out until the travellers made camp by this time too hed had the opportunity to get a good close look at zek in the extended evening light of sunside and he hadnt been disappointed she had somehow found the time to snatch a wash in a fastflowing stream which had served to greatly enhance her fresh natural beauty now she looked good enough to eat and jazz felt hungry enough too except that would be one hell of a waste zek had wrapped her sore feet in soft rags and now walked on grass and loamy earth instead of stone and for all that she too was tired her step seemed lighter and most of the worry lines had lifted from her face while shed cleaned herself up jazz had used the time to study the travellers his original opinion seemed confirmed they were gypsies romany and speaking in an antique romance tongue too it was hard not to deduce connections with the world he had left behind maybe zek would be able to explain some of the similarities he determined to ask her some time yet another question to add to a lengthening list he was surprised how quickly hed come to rely on her and he was annoyed to find himself thinking about her when he should be concentrating on his education many of the male travellers wore rings in the lobes of their left ears gold by the look of it to match the bands on their fingers no lack of that precious metal here apparently it decorated in yellow bands the hauling poles of their travois studded their leather jackets and stitched the seams of their coarseweave trousers was even used to stud the leather soles of their sandals but silver was far less in evidence jazz had seen arrows and the bolts of crossbows tipped with it but never a sign of the stuff used for decoration in this world he would in time discover it was far more precious than gold not least for its effect on vampires but the travellers puzzled jazz he found strange basic anomalies in them beyond his understanding for example it seemed to him that in many ways their world was very nearly primal and yet the travellers themselves were anything but primitive though hed not yet seen an actual gypsy caravan here he knew that they existed hed observed a small boy of four or five years sitting on a loaded jouncing travois playing with a rough wooden model between its shafts a pair of creatures like overgrown shaggy sheep also carved of wood strained in their tiny harnesses of leather so they had the wheel these people and beasts of burden even though none were in evidence here they could work metals and with their use of the crossbow their weaponry could hardly be considered crude indeed in almost every respect it was seen that theirs was a sophisticated culture but on the other hand it was hard to see how in this environment theyd achieved any degree of culture at all as for the tribe jazz had expected to see so far there were no more than sixty travellers in all arleks party and lardiss companions plus a handful of family groups which had been waiting in a stand of trees to join up with lardis at the sunside exit from the pass and head west with him through the foothills and all of these people going on foot with the exception of one old woman who lay in a pile of furs upon a travois and two or three young children who travelled in a similar fashion jazz had studied their faces taking note of the way theyd every so often turn their heads and stare suspiciously at the sun floating over the southern horizon zek had told jazz that true night was a good fortyfive hours away but still there was an unspoken anxiety a straining in the faces of the travellers and jazz believed he knew why it was that they silently willed themselves westward desiring only to put distance between themselves and the pass before sundown and because they knew this world while jazz was a newcomer he found himself growing anxious along with them and adding his will to theirs keeping his fear to himself hed asked zek where is everyone i mean dont tell me this is the entire tribe no shed told him shaking her damp hair about her shoulders only a fraction of it traveller tribes dont go about en masse its what lardis calls survival there are two more large encampments up ahead one about forty miles from here the other twentyfive miles beyond that at the first sanctuary the sanctuary is a cavern system in a huge outcrop of rock the entire tribe can disappear inside it spread out make themselves thin on the ground hard for the wamphyri to winkle them out thats where were heading we hole up there for the long night seventy miles he frowned at her before dark he glanced at the sun again so low in the sky youre joking sundown is still a long way off she reminded him yet again you can stare at the sun till you go blind but you wont see it dip much its a slow process well thank goodness for that he said nodding his relief lardis intends to cover fifteen miles between breaks she went on but hes tired too probably more than we are the first break will be soon for he knows we all need to get some sleep the wolves will keep watch the break will be of three hours duration no more than that so for every six hours travel we get a threehour break nine hours to cover fifteen miles it sounds easy but in fact its backbreaking theyre used to it but it will probably cripple you until youre into the swing of it anyway even as she finished speaking lardis called a halt he was up front but his bull voice carried back to them eat drink he advised then sleep the travellers trudged to a halt zek and jazz with them she unrolled her sleepingbag told jazz get yourself a blanket of furs from one of the travois they carry spares someone will come round with bread water a little meat then she flattened a patch of bracken shook out her bed on top of it and climbed in she pulled the zipper halfway shut from bottom to top jazz lit her a cigarette and went to find himself a blanket when he too lay down close by food had already been brought for them while they ate he admitted im excited as a kid ill never get to sleep my brains far too active theres so much to take in youll sleep she answered maybe you should tell me a story he said lying back your story the story of my life she gave him a wan smile no just the bit youve lived since you came here not very romantic i know but the more i learn about this place the better as lardis might say its a matter of survival now that we know about this dweller who apparently has a season ticket to berlin survival seems so much more desirable or more correctly more feasible youre right she said making herself more comfortable there have been times when ive just about given up hope but now im glad i didnt you want to hear my story all right then jazz this is how it was for me she began to talk low evenvoiced and as she got into the story so she fell into the dramatic colourful style of the travellers and of the wamphyri themselves for that matter being a telepath their manner and modes of expression had impressed themselves upon her that much more quickly until now they were second nature jazz listened let her words flow conjured from them the feel and the fear of her story zeks story i came through the gate kittedup just like you zek commenced her tale but i wasnt as big or as strong as you are i couldnt carry as much and i was dogtired it was night on starside when i arrived which is to say i didnt stand a chance but of course i didnt know what my chances were not then or i might simply have put a bullet through my brain and that would have been the end of that i came through the gate climbed down from the crater rim saw what was waiting for me and nothing i could do but face it for there was no way back oh you can believe that before i climbed down i threw myself at the sphere in a last desperate attempt to escape but it just stood there pouring out its white light implacable and impenetrable as a dome of luminous rock but if the sight of them waiting there had scared me my exit from the gate had not been without its own effect upon them they didnt know what to make of me in fact they werent waiting for me at all they were there at the gate on business of their own but i didnt find that out until later the whole thing is a blur in my mind now like a bad dream gradually fading its hard to describe how it was how it felt but ill try youve seen the flying beasts that the wamphyri use but you havent seen their warrior creatures or if you have then you havent seen them up close now im not talking about such as shaithiss lieutenants gustan and that other one they were extravellers vampirized by shaithis and given a little rank and authority they had not received eggs as far as im aware and could never aspire to anything greater than service to their lord they were vampires of course of a sort all the changelings of the wamphyri are but gustan and the others are still men too she paused and sighed jazz this will be difficult vampires aretheir lifecycles are fantastically complex maybe id better try to clarify what i know of their systems before i carry on their biological systems i mean vampires the basic creatures are born in the swamps east and west of the mountains their source their genesis is conjectural there are perhaps parent creatures motherthings buried there in the quag never seeing the light of day these mothers would be pure and simple egglayers now ive talked to the travellers and to the lady karen wamphyri herself and no one knows any more than ive told you about the basic vampire one thing you can guarantee though they dont emerge from their swamps during sunup when they do spawn then the first task of each and every one of them is find a host which they pursue with the same instinct as a duck taking to water it isnt in their nature to live by themselves indeed if they cant find a host they quickly desiccate and die you could say theyre like cuckoos whobut no thats a poor analogy like tapeworms maybe or better still like liver flukes so theyre parasitic yes but thats where any similarity ends anyway i said their lifecycle was complex well so it is but when you think about it so are many of the lifecycles of the creatures in our own world the liver fluke is a good example living in the intestines of cows pigs and sheep dropping their eggs in the animals dung to be picked up on the feet and in the sores or openings of other animals including men and once they take hold on the liver then the animal is finished the organ is reduced to so much gorgonzola and if the beast dies in a field to be eaten by pigsor if it is slaughtered and eaten by ignorant menyou can see how the cycle is continued so the vampire is something like that its a parasite anyway but as i said thats the only similarity the big difference is this the tapeworm and liver fluke gradually destroy their hosts reduce them to nothing kill them off in so doing they kill themselves off too because without a living host they themselves cant live but the vampires instinct is different it doesnt kill its host but grows with him makes him more powerful changes his nature it learns from him relieves him of physical weaknesses increases his strength it encompasses his mind and character and subverts them sexless in itself the vampire adopts the sex of its host adopts all of his vices his passions men are passionate creatures jazz but with a vampire in them theres nothing to temper them men are warlike and as wamphyri they bathe ecstatically in the blood of their enemies men are devious which makes the wamphyri the most devious creatures of all but all of that is only one part of the cycle one facet now ive explained how with a vampire in him a man is mentally corrupted but then theres the purely physical side vampire flesh is different it is a protoplasm compatible with all flesh with the flesh of men and beasts and almost anything which lives and as the vampire grows in its host so it is able to change that host to its own ends physically change him and the wamphyri are masters of metamorphosis i will explain suppose a freshly emerged swamp vampire was fortunate enough to take a wolf as its host it would gain the wolfs cunning its fierceness all its predator instincts and it would amplify them there are legends of wolves like that here on sunside its the same legend as the one we knew back on our earth which we called the legend of the werewolf the silver bullet jazz and the full moon to seduce men for food the vampireridden wolf will imitate men it will go upon two legs contort its features into manlike features stalk its prey by night and when it bites the vampires bite is virulent it is an absolute contamination more certain than rabies ah but where rabies kills the vampires bite does not it might if the vampire desires to kill but on occasion the victim lives and if at the time of the attack the vampire puts into the victim part of its own being its own protoplasmic flesh then that victim is vampirized but lets say that the attack is fatal that the vampire drinks the victims blood drains him dry and leaves him a corpse again in this case even though the victim is dead that which was inserted which was traded for his blood is not dead in about seventy hours occasionally less the transformation is made the metamorphosis complete again as in the myths of earth after three days the vampire emerges undead to spread its contamination abroad anyway ive strayed from the point i was trying to explain what a wamphyri warrior creature is well picture one of their flying beasts magnified in bulk by a factor of ten imagine such a creature with a dozen armoured necks and heads all equipped with mouths full of unbelievable teeth teeth like rows of scythes imagine these things having a like number of arms or tentacles all terminating in murderous claws and pincers or fitted with huge versions of the wamphyri battlegauntlets get all of that formed in your minds eye and you are looking at a warrior creature they are vampires but utterly mindless with one and only one loyalty to whichever lord created them ah but i see the question in your eyes jazz youre thinking whichever lord created them from what but havent i told you that they are masters of metamorphosis their creatures all of their creatures which take the place of machines in their society were once men dont ask me the hows of it i dont have all the answers and i dont think i could bear to know them what i do know ill pass on to you as time allows but right now youve asked me what it was like for me when i first came here and im telling you that the first things i saw two of them were wamphyri warrior creatures i saw them first before anything else in the same way you would notice a pair of cockroaches among ants one because ants are tolerable while cockroaches are not and two because cockroaches are that much bigger and so much more ugly two of them out there on that rockstrewn plain under the moon and stars and i couldnt believe their size that they were fighting things was obvious take a look at a picture of tyrannosaurus rex in a book of prehistoric animals and you dont need to be told he was a warrior these creatures were like that with their weaponry armourplated in all their utter hideousness they couldnt be anything else it was only when i saw that they were quiescent controlled that i dared to take my eyes off them then having observed the cockroaches as it were i looked at the ants seen in contrast beside the warrior creatures and flying beasts thats what the wamphyri looked like ants but they were the masters and the monstrous giants their obedient slaves try to picture it out on the boulder plain these two mountains of armourclad flesh closer a halfdozen flyers all craning their necks and swaying their heads to and fro and closer still a few paces away from the shining dome of the gate the wamphyri themselves come here to punish one of their own a transgressor against the lady karens laws i saw them stared at them in a mixture of awe and morbid fascination and they stared back at me for they were here to thrust someone into the gate and the last thing theyd expected was that some other should come out of it there was karen herself and four subordinates lieutenants if you like and one other who was ugly as sin and draped in chains of gold now gold is a soft metal as you know jazz and easily broken but not when its links are thick as your fingers there was more gold in those chains than ive ever seen in my life in any one place in one mass and yet this corlis who was decked in them wore them like tinsel corlis that was his name he was huge a brute and stark naked except for the gold no gauntlet on this ones hand for he was in shame but though he stood there naked unweaponed still his red eyes burned furiously and unrepentant the four who surrounded him were big men too but smaller by a head than their prisoner they carried long sheaths of leather strapped to their backs and in their hands slender swords the sword as id learn later is a shameful weapon only their evil gauntlets are considered honourable and fitting tools for handtohand combat also these swords were tipped in silver and all four of them were pointed at corlis who stood there panting his head lifted high engorged with rage behind their prisoner and shielded from him by the four who guarded him stood the lady karen transfixed sighting me her red mouth had fallen open now ill tell you something jazz something which no woman should ever admit which i hadnt admitted not even to myself until that moment women are envious creatures and the goodlooking ones more so than others but now i admit it because i know its true except i didnt know how true until i saw this karen her hair was copper burnished almost ablaze it reflected the white light of the dome like a halo over her head bounced like fine spun gold on her shoulders competed with the polished bangles she wore on her arms gold rings on a slender golden chain around her neck supported the sheath of soft white leather which she wore like a glove and on her feet sandals of pale leather stitched in gold over her shoulders a long cloak of black fur skilfully shorn from the wings of great bats shimmering with a weave of fine golden stitches and about her waist a wide black leather belt buckled with her crest a snarling wolfs head and supporting on one rounded hip her gauntlet a woman an incredibly beautiful woman or she would have been if not for her scarlet eyes who or whatever these people were she was one of them indeed she was the mistress of this group their lady and before too long id know what they called themselves wamphyri she came forward around the group standing there and approached me where i crouched by the crater wall with the halfsphere of the gate at my back closeup she was even more beautiful her body had the sinuous motion of a gypsy dancer and yet seemed so unaffected as to be innocent her face heartshaped with a lock of that fiery hair coiled on her brow could have been angelic but her red eyes made it the face of a demon her mouth was full curved in a perfect bow the colour of her lips like blood was accentuated by her pale slightly hollow cheeks only her nose marred looks which were otherwise entirely otherworldly it was a fraction tilted stubby with nostrils just a little too round and dark and perhaps her ears halfhidden in her hair which showed whorls like pale exotic conches but golden rings dangled from their lobes and all in all and for all her weirdness and contrasting colours still there was the look of the gypsy about her i could hear the jingle of her movements even when there was none to hear helllander she said in a tongue i wouldnt have known without my talent to rely on languages are easy when youre a telepath but what i couldnt recognize in her spoken words i read in her mind and she knew it at once her pale hand crimsonnailed flickered toward me pointed accused thoughtstealer then she narrowed those bloodhued eyes of hers and when next she spoke her tone was thoughtful a woman from the helllands i have heard of men wizards coming through the portal but never a woman perhaps it is an omen i could make good use of a thoughtstealer she nodded came to a sudden decision give yourself up to me and all your secrets and ill protect you she said refuse me andgo your own way without my protection but behind her as she spoke i could see the leers and the lusting stamped clearly on the faces of her henchmen i thought quickly for my life if i didnt go with her wherever then where could i go was there anywhere to go orif i didnt go with her then where would i be taken im zekintha i told her and i accept your protection then you may call me the lady karen she tossed her head setting her hair ablaze where it bounced now stand aside a little way weve business here and to her aides bring the dog corlis forward karens men shoved their prisoner to the fore even chained he might have turned on them but their silvertipped weapons pressed him close they took off his chains and as the last of these was being removed it was the moment hed been waiting for knotting that last length of chain about one great fist corlis whirled flailed sent his warders dancing back before they could gather their thoughts hed released the heavy chain sent it crashing into them in another moment he laughed a mad reckless laugh and leaped for the lady karen to snatch her up if im to be a victim of the portal karen then so are you he cried so in the same way you brought karl vyotsky here jazz corlis had determined to take the lady karen out of here now clutching karen to him corlis had almost reached the shallow crater wall her men were after him like hounds but he had the advantage it seemed that my one hope in this strange world was about to be removed from it but corlis hadnt reckoned with me as he dodged karens retainers and the mouths of magmass holes so he came close to where i crouched karen was kicking and biting him but it made little difference she was wamphyri but she was a woman too finally with the lady tucked under one arm corlis saw his chance and bounded straight for natural steps of stone where they climbed the crater wall he was now within three or four short paces of the gate but as he lumbered past me so i reached out my leg and braced itit was as simple as that he tripped karen went flying free almost fell into one of the gaping magmass wormholes corlis got up on one knee glaring his hatred and frustration at me i was almost within reach of him his arms reached for me and i backed away but god jazz those hellish arms kept reaching they stretched like rubber straining after me and i could hear the tearing of muscles and ligaments his face god his face it opened like a hinged steel trap with rows of needle teeth that were visibly growing and curving out of his jaws i dont know what he was becoming something utterly invincible im sure but i wasnt about to give in to him not to that my smg was in my hands had been there all the time but im not a soldier jazz and i had never killed against this however i had no other choice i cocked the gun and squeezed the trigger well as you know bullets dont kill them but they do make a mess of them the stream of fire i turned on corlis was almost a solid wall of lead it turned his trunk scarlet punched holes in his chest and hideous face blew him back away from me and sent him sprawling flopping like a wet rag and amidst the chattering madness of my weapon everything else seemed frozen in the relative quiet of starside that gunfire must have sounded like the laughter of hell and only when the magazine was empty did the noise abate allowing its echoes to come thundering back from the hills stunning the effect but then the tableau unfroze urged on by karen where she came to her feet her men leaped toward corlis he sat up i couldnt believe it but he did already the holes were healing in his body his bloody face sealing itself he saw them bearing down on him with their silvertipped swords and looked wildly all about there a magmass hole he stood up all lopsided crouched sprang went sprawling toward its dark mouth in midair one of karens retainers caught him a sword flashed silver corliss head sprang free his trunk crashed forward spurting blood from its severed neck corliss dive took his twitching body down the magmass wormhole and out of sight but his head lay grimacing gnashing its evil teeth where it had fallen karen gave a cry of disgust stepped forward and kicked the vomiting thing into another hole whatever corlis had done it must have been very bad scarlet stains were all that remained of him karen looked at me looked at the smoking gun in my hands her red eyes were wide now making her face seem paler still as well as the gun she was aware of the rest of my kit she couldnt keep her gaze from straying to my packs the nozzle of the flamethrower hooked to my belt the sigil on the lefthand breast pocket of my combat suit the latter finally impressed itself upon her and she stepped closer peering at the crest it was a hammer and sickle of course crossed with the bayonet of an infantry unit some small soldier had sacrificed his suit for me but it signified much more than that to the lady she pointed stretched herself tall perhaps in outrage and spat words in my face they came much too fast to be anything but a gabble i read them in her mind is that your banner the curved knife the hammer and the stake do you mock me i mock no one i answered this badge is merely be quiet and she added also beware for if your weapon so much as snaps at me then ill feed you as a tidbit to my warrior creatures and she pointed to the anomalous monstrosities on the rockstrewn plain my gun was empty and i didnt dare try to reload in a moment of inspiration i held it out offering it to karen she at once shrank a little back from it then she scowled knocked the gun aside reached out and hooked her scarlet fingernails into the stitching of my pocket she tore the offending blazon from me and tossed it away there she said and do you denounce these signs i do i answered she nodded became calm very well she said but be thankful im in your debt you can tell me why you wore that that insult later and she turned from me and made a motion to her men who hurried down onto the plain and mountedup on their flyers karen made to move after them but i stood still uncertain of what i should do she saw my indecision said come theyre waiting for us she took me to one of the nodding lolling creatures it had been corliss i thought for upon its back where the neck stuck out a cage of metal was bound in position climb up and get in karen told me but i couldnt i backed away shook my head my fear seemed to give her a lot more confidence not that i thought she needed any she laughed then ride with me we went to the next unoccupied beast beneath its harness it wore a purple blanket huge as a carpet the harness itself was of black leather with golden trappings and the saddle at the base of the flyers neck was huge soft and sumptuous the thing lowered its neck and karen grasped nodules and harness drew herself easily aloft and into the saddle i could scarcely bring myself to touch that alien flesh she reached down grasped my fevered hand in her own cool one and with her help i mountedup behind her if you get dizzy cling to me she said and then we flew to her aerie i cant say more than that about the flight for my eyes were closed most of the way and i did cling to her for there was nothing else to cling to the aerie was a horrible place itjazz zek leaned across and looked at him in his mouth the cork tip of a cigarette stuck straight up in the air even as she smiled her soft slow smile a puff of wind blew half an inch of cold ash loose onto his chest which began to rise and fall in a steady rhythm and he had said he wouldnt be able to sleep well it was better that he get his rest better that she get some too but she wondered how much of what shed said had gone in as it happened most of it had and jazzs opinion of her hadnt changed she was a hell of a woman the next fifteen miles werent so easy and jazz began to understand what zek had meant by backbreaking after what hed been through prior to and since leaving perchorsk far behind something a little less than three hours of sleep hadnt seemed a great deal not in the way of preparation for this anyway the trail had been rough winding up into higher foothills where tumbled scree made the going a veritable obstacle course it had soon started to rain a deluge which eventually petered out just as lardis called for the second break here there were dry shallow caves under broken ledges of rock into which most of the travellers dispersed themselves jazz and zek likewise peering out from their cramped refuge while the sky cleared and the low unshakable sun began to aim its wan but still warming rays into their faces again from this vantage point as the air cleared and the sun sucked up and steamed away a swirling ground mist jazz was able to see why lardis had chosen such a difficult route down below a forest stretched deep and wide away out onto the sunside plain crisscrossed with rivers tumbling from the mountains the deep dark green of the woods told of an almost impenetrable rankness up here the rivers were still streams easily forded but down below they tumbled through gulleys joined up finally broadened into wide watercourses winding through the forest good for hunting and fishing certainly but no good at all for trekking the choice had been as easy as that a difficult route or an impossible one and of course the foothills did command a view of all the land around a factor much to lardiss liking this time jazz told zek i believe ill sleep you did last time she reminded him are you beginning to feel the strain beginning to feel it he managed a grin im looking for a muscle that doesnt ache and yet the travellers have these damned cumbersome travois to lug around and i dont hear them complaining i suppose its like you said ill get used to it but id hate to think what it would be like for anyone who was unfit or maybe an older person stranded here i wasnt so fit she reflected but ive had more time to get myself broken in i suppose in a way i was lucky that the lady karen got me first and then that she waswell a lady or as much of a one as her condition would allow her to be her condition she has dramal doombodys egg zek nodded the wamphyri lord dramal was doomed from the day he took a leper which was how he came to be named that way ill explain leprosy is also part of the travellers lot they are prone to it passed on inherited or simply contracted from another leper dont ask me i dont know anything about the disease but when its symptoms start to show in a traveller then hes kicked out it happens now and then his tribe simply abandons him or her dramal in his youth five hundred years ago took a female leper she had the disease but it hadnt started to show yet the vampire lord found her comely he cohabited with her in his aerie too late he discovered her curse jazz was puzzled yet again you mean she passed it on to him but im amazed that any of these terrible creatures have survived at all quite apart from the fact that they continually war with each other they drink the blood of travellers have sex with traveller women generally leave themselves wide open to all sorts of diseases and yet zek answered in their own way theyre scrupulous the true wamphyri lord or lady is anyway scrupulous jazz was taken aback are you serious she looked at him stared unblinking into his eyes cockroaches are also scrupulous in their way but all in all the wamphyri arechoosy yes their retainers their henchmen generally travellers whove been changed vampirized but not given an egg like those two you saw with shaithis theyre not so fussy but as for leaving themselves wide open to diseases that might be true if they were wholly human but as youve seen theyre not once a man is vampirized his body becomes invulnerable to disease thats why they live so long even the aging process is defeated but not invulnerable to leprosy is that what youre saying apparently anyway this woman of dramals died in the tower where he locked her then the disease came out in him of course his vampire flesh fought it when limbs withered down they were regenerated and when flesh wasted away it was replenished but dramal couldnt win the vampire in him was itself infected as the disease got a hold all of dramals energies went into combatting it holding it at bay his aerie was shunned by the wamphyri and even in times of truce he had no visitors he held his own people in thrall of course but as he weakened even they began to whisper and plot against him they were afraid of catching the disease now all of this took time almost five hundred years of gradual deterioration but just a few years ago dramal began to fear that the end was in sight that one of the great undead was about to die or that he would soon become so weak that his retainers would rise up against him stake and behead him and burn his remains to ashes then they would flee the aerie which was now generally considered a pesthole he determined that before they could do that he must deposit his egg but not with one of the treacherous gang who now surrounded him with the egg would go his power of course and the aerie would pass into the hands of his successor so he took karen sisclu from an eastern traveller tribe and made her one of the wamphyri and before he died transferred all of his power to her in better times he would most certainly have passed on his egg through the sex act but he no longer had the strength for that he had expended all in teaching karen the ways of the wamphyri the secrets of the aerie and in passing on his sigils and the loyalty of his various beasts and so he merely kissed her that was sufficient during that monstrous kiss his egg passed into her jazz couldnt suppress a small shiver he grimaced and said god what a world this is but tell me by her condition do you mean the fact that shes now wamphyri or is it worse than that i mean does she have dramals leprosy too no not that zek answered but its possible shes in an even worse fix if you can imagine that you see wamphyri legends have it that the first true mother was a human female whose vampire produced more than the normal single egg indeed the eggs were produced almost endlessly until the vampire itself and its female host were drained until there was nothing left of them they gave birth to vampires until the effort withered them to lifeless husks and this was how dramal had determined to repay the others of the wamphyri for their scorn their naming him doombody and for his isolation but mainly for the sheer evil of it he would cause to be brought into this world a hundred vampire eggs all of which would find hosts in the denizens of his aerie why even the flying beasts and warrior creatures would be wamphyri which would mean the debasement of the entire hagridden race do you understand jazz nodded but a little uncertainly i think so he hoped that karen would become a mother that her vampire would produce the same endless stream of eggs but how could he be sure maybe he couldnt she shrugged maybe he merely hoped it would be so but he told karen it would be and she poor damned doomed creature that she is she believes it and the wamphyri do have strange powers perhaps in some way he has engineered it anyway hes gone now into corruption and so she waits and the vampire in her slowly matures exceptsome mature more quickly than others in some it is a matter of days in others many years if her vampire is a mother then shell suffer the same fate as that first mother of legend zek paused and on impulse reached across and touched jazzs face before she could withdraw her hand he kissed her fingers this too was on impulse she smiled at him and shook her head i know what youre thinking she said and i certainly dont have to read your mind its a grasshopper mind anyway from such a very dire subject to dalliance in one move then she grew serious again but youre right jazz this is a very terrible world and were not out of it yet by a long shot we should both save our strength ive noticed he told her that youve been sticking pretty close to me maybe its as well i cant read your mind she laughed there are a lot of unattached male travellers jazz she said now to them and to lardis too it will seem ive made up my mind whether i have or not this way i wont have to keep fending them off but dont make me keep fending you off too for im not sure how well id succeed he gave a mock sigh grunted promises promises then he grinned ok you win and anyway i ache enough already at the end of the next leg of their journey the sun appeared to have moved some degrees eastward at the same time sinking appreciably lower in the sky or maybe it was just that the travellers had come down out of the foothills so lowering their horizon whichever jazz noticed a definite urgency a heightened awareness in lardis and his people the pass through the mountains was still only a few miles to the east and the suns descent seemed that much more obvious yes and shaithis of the wamphyri had a score to settle so the sooner the tribe reached its cavern sanctuary the better following a fairly welldefined trail down out of the foothills the going had been quick and surprisingly easy a little less than twenty miles had been covered in the time allowed for only half of that and lardis was well pleased he called camp on the westward bank of a river at the edge of the great forested region told his people they could have four hours of rest he sent out hunters too into the thighlength savanna grass after whichever birds and animals lived there then he found himself a spot on the riverbank and cast a line there and sat in the long twilight with his back to the bank fishing and making his plans meanwhile his men had found signs left by runners which corroborated previously arranged liaison points for both the next traveller group only five miles ahead and the primary encampment some twenty to twentyfive miles beyond that as lardis got his hook into a large catfish and hauled it ashore he was well satisfied things seemed to be working out exactly to schedule as for jazz and zek while she bathed in the river he worked on her smg clearing the blockage and oiling the parts getting the weapon back into serviceable order in the event of another confrontation two guns would be better than one also jazz had called for the rest of his equipment to be brought to him he wanted at least one member of this gypsy band he travelled with preferably lardis himself to understand the workings of various items specifically the flamethrower when his gear arrived jazz found to his surprise that no one seemed to have tampered with his packs since hed repacked them and maybe that was just as well in the bottom of one pack there was a small nest of six deadly russian fragmentation grenades about the same size as hen eggs they reminded jazz of foilcovered chocolate easter eggs in the compartmented sawdustpacked tray of their wooden box if anyone had tampered with thosejazz supposed hed have heard about it long before now lardis on his way to the campfire with the huge catfish jerking spasmodically where it lay across his shoulder nodded to zek and jazz on the riverbank and called out let me just rid myself of this then ill be back to see these tricks of yours they watched his burly figure out of sight over the rim of the bank then turned back to what they were doing while zek finished drying her hair jazz tested her gun one last time he drew back its cocking piece sharply and was rewarded by the clean clear very familiar chching of metal parts engaging then he squeezed the trigger and the breechblock flew forward slapped firmly home jazz nodded his satisfaction put the gun on safe and slotted a full magazine into its housing he handed the weapon to zek and said there and now youre a power in the world again i still have six full mags and ammo to refill four of them thats five apiece hardly an armoury but a sight better than nothing he picked up a grenade and weighed it in his hand it had a twistaction ringpull pin packed with high explosive on detonating the shell would break down into two hundred curved metal splinters each one scything outwards from the blast at the speed of a bullet devastating even the most powerful vampire lord wouldnt stand a chance against one of these at the very least hed be maimed and at best decapitated jazz would have used them back in the pass that time except he hadnt been sure what arleks lot had done with the grenades and anyway his smg had been more immediate zek dragged his thoughts back to the here and now with do you want me to tell you about the lady karens aerie jazz stood up said yes while i bathe im starting to smell like you did the first time we met shouldnt look if i were you its gruesome in here he stripped down to his shorts took a dive into the water then he swam back close to the bank and started washing himself ok he said lets hear about these vampire castles ive a feeling it wont be pleasant but whatever you consider to be worth the telling and so she continued with her story karens aerie harry at perchorsk first of all let me explain that no human being could ever adequately describe an aerie of the wamphyri i dont think our language or any language of the old world has the right words for it or if there are such words then the description would become so repetitious so laced with grislysounding adjectives that the entire exercise would soon become a bore thats why ill tell it as i saw it like describing a picture or series of pictures without putting too much emphasis on the grotesque anomalies and abnormalities of thebut there do you see what i mean the lady karens aerie had belonged to dramal doombody and so it has to be fairly representative of all the aeries or castles if you wish where they sit atop those fantastic stacks so lets begin with the stacks themselves as far as i was able to tell theyre natural weathered out from the mountains in their slow retreat why the stacks should remain while the earth around them crumbledim no geologist maybe they were once the cores of a series of volcanoes choked with a basalt magma which was tougher than the surrounding cones the craters have long gone but these titan plugs remain thats theory of course and anyway it doesnt matter the stacks are real and since time immemorial the wamphyri have built their aeries on them but just looking at a stack from a distance you dont see the entire picture by that i mean that you dont see the actual stack its there inside the shell but what you see is that shell which through the ages the wamphyri have built around the inner core sothe next question has to be what is this artificial skin made of well i think the best way to answer that would be to liken a stack to coral on a submarine shelf the stone is there and the living coral forms a skin on it and the skin dies and itself becomes stone so on the submarine shelf the skin is dead coral and on the stacksits dead flesh when an aerie requires repairs or extensions the wamphyri breed cartilage creatures whose sole function is to bridge a gap form a section of wall roof over a new hall or causeway which is to say their living bodies form the building or repair materials except i said breed and thats the wrong word they dont really breed anything they merely change what already is they take out of storage a troglodyte perhaps or punish a vampirized henchman who has been remiss in some way or maybe steal a traveller or two from sunside all human or subhuman flesh is the same to the wamphyri they can take it change it mould it to their individual needs these cartilage things lock themselves in position wherever theyre required die and eventually fossilize there being of vampiric origin having been vampirized they take a long time to die maybe they dont die as we understand it but simply age and becomefixed so what im saying is this when you walk through an aerie as often as not youre surrounded by the fused polished bones and the hard leathery hides of what were once men and if you look closely enough which is something you very quickly learn not to do then you start to recognize the shapes of altered ribcages thigh bones spinal columns and evenbut i think you get the picture the wamphyri can stand extremes of cold thats not to say they prefer it simply that they seem inured except when under siege they do heat their stacks with a complicated sort of central heating gasses are burned in the base of the stack and the hot air is channelled through pipes great hollow bones usually to every level other pipes carry the gas itself which may then be burned as required there are two sources for these gasses each aerie has its refuse pit refuse to a wamphyri lord can be anything from bodily wastes to wasted bodies you know what vampires feed on well theyre not obliged to and they do vary their diets with vegetable fibers various oils even fruits which are gathered during sundown on sunside they have vast storehouses of foods such as these not to mention larders of suspended troglodytes and travellers in this instance lets consider their usual fare if a person is eaten and it is not desired that he or she becomes a vampire then the remains of the meal go to the refuse pit along with all other garbage consider that a stack or aerie may house a thousand or more creatures and you get something of an idea of the contents of a refuse pit gasses are of course generated in large volumes these are the gasses which are usually burned close to their source in the bowels of the stack wamphyri conduits are leaky systems at best and if gasses such as these were allowed to escapethe atmosphere in the rest of the aerie would be quite intolerable also to be found in the lower levels are the stables of the gasbeasts these are what their name describes them to be living gas bladders as mindless as the cartilage creatures their single function is the production of gas they are fed on coarse grasses and a little grain obviously the gas these beasts produce is close to methane i dont think i need to explain further than that water now i said that in their way the wamphyri are scrupulous the lady karen bathed frequently as often as i myself i watched her bathing and it was as if she tried to scrub the taint out of herself which of course she never could but she didnt stop trying oh she talked hard to her retainers but what was she inside but a poor frightened girl at least she had been anyway youll appreciate that water does not rise as readily as gas in our world it has to be pumped uphill or rammed under pressure or else it arrives by aqueduct from a source higher still the aeries have their catchment areas inwardsloping skins on all levels channelling rain water into great barrels with overflow systems into other barrels in the event of a great downpour wells at the foot of the stacks are filled to brimming when all reservoirs are filled then the skins are allowed to hang loose like flags in fact theyre woven with the various wamphyri sigils and so act as their banners as well but the rains are infrequent and if an aerie were under siege this system alone would be unreliable thats why theres a backup youll understand the meaning of capillary attraction the way sap rises through a stem or water between sheets of glass the wamphyri use capillary attraction to lift water from their wells to the tops of their aeries the tubes through which the water passes are quite literally capillaries those same narrow tubes which connect veins and arteries real capillaries jazz whose owners lie in placid heaps of pseudolife in secret rooms high in the aeries secret because the wamphyri will not tolerate their creatures except in their proper places they know the difference between acceptable and unacceptable you see and the proper place for a thing whose veins hang down inside pipes through half a mile or more of stack is obviously at the top of such a stack and so because theyre unseemly the wamphyri hide them away i stumbled across just such a room and its inhabitants in the lady karens aerie thats all i can remember of it that i found it and then that someone found me and took me out of there i had fainted my mind hasnt retained anything of the episode except the fact that it happened and this was only retained as a warning i suppose in case i should forget totally and wander back that way again needless to say i never did wander back that way again also to be found in the lower regions the pens of the warriors the warrior creatures are kept like lions in a roman amphitheatre close to starvation or they would be except for one thing like the wamphyri they dont need to eat when they do eat their food is invariably meat preferably living they are pure carnivores created to tear maim kill and devour their reward in battle is to be allowed to glut themselves they fly into battle launching themselves from the stacks and squirting through the sky like giant squids but if theyre victorious they soon become far too bulky to fly back again to their aerie and so return across the boulder plains as best they can apart from battle proper the wamphyri also use them during sundown for the rounding up of travellers then too if they are successful theyre allowed the occasional titbit but enough about them just pray god if youre a believer that you never see one and especially that you never see one in battle flying beasts are stationed at various levels youve seen them and know what they look like they arent especially dangerous not on their own grounded theyre clumsy stupid aloft they are graceful in their own alien sort of way for control they are linked closely with their masters by telepathy it has to be that way when the wamphyri ride them to battle they are the skyfloating commandposts of their masters one other thing about the wamphyri in battle they have their own codes of combat their own warped i values and ideas about valour chivalry and such can you imagine that but each one of them changes these values to suit himself to his own advantage if ever it gets down to handtohand combat one against one the single weapon deemed allowable by highranking aerie masters the lords and their aides or lieutenants is the wargauntlet somewhere in the east in a small gypsy settlement those hideous weapons are made to order for the wamphyri all metal things are made for them they have no understanding of metalworking or more correctly they have a general dislike for metals silver is a poison iron despised only gold is relatively acceptable so ive covered a few points helped to give you something of a picture of wamphyri life and how their aeries operate its all too complicated for me to be more specific than that now if you still want to hear it ill go on and tell you about my own experiences in the lady karens aerie jazz had finished bathing and now climbed out of the river he felt a lot easier relaxed the water had washed away most of his coiledspring tension he squeegeed the water from his body with the hard edges of his hands shivered a little in the ohsogradually fading rays of the sun where it sat over the horizons edge as he began to dress and before zek could continue her story they spotted lardis returning across the rim of the riverbank jazz had disassembled most of his combatsuit harness leaving only the belt and upper crossstraps with their various attachments as lardis arrived and cast a speculative eye over the several items of gear where they lay spread out so zek gave jazz a helping hand to get himself kittedup again he preferred to sleep fullyrigged or at the very least in skeleton order so that he could wake up ready for any eventuality finally taking out a cigarette and lighting it jazz turned to the gypsy leader in time to see him twist and yank the pin from a fragmentation grenade jazz drew air in a gasp threw zek aside and down leaped toward lardis the other had not yet seen the consternation on jazzs face he frowned at the grenade in his left hand and the pin in his right jazz snatched the grenade away from him hed been counting in his head one two three he hurled the grenade out over the river four five it made a small splash and immediately made a much larger one the detonation thundered but most of the razorsharp shrapnel was lost in the river some fragments whistled where they slashed the air overhead a fountain of water rose up sprayed out fell back the echoes of the detonation came back from the foothills and the water of the river slapped in wavelets against the bank dozens of stunned or dead fish were already floating to the surface lardis closed his mouth looked at the firingpin in his hand hurled it violently away eh he said then what jazz scowled at him said pretty effective fishing his sarcasm was lost on lardis eh oh yes i suppose it is the squat bemused man turned away went to climb the riverbank and calm his people where they came running indeed it is he finally emphatically agreed but i think i prefer to do it my way he glanced at jazzs weaponry laid out on the riverbank er show me these interesting things of yours some other time right now ive much to do jazz and zek watched him walk away as jazz packed his kit again and settled down comfortably where he intended to sleep zek continued her story i had my own room in karens aerie she and i shared the topmost level literally acres of rooms all of them enormous where we were the only human creatures remember the wamphyri are human its the vampire in each one of them which makes him alien and karens vampire had yet to gain total ascendancy so we were the only people up there but there was a warrior it was a small one of its sort which is to say it was about as big as an armoured personnel carrier and just as deadly it guarded the stairwell to the next lower level that was how well karen trusted her aides then there were the waterdrawing creatures which ive already mentioned and that was all nothing and no one else every so often karen would hold audience shed call her lieutenants up from below all seven of them none of them having an egg and apportion the aeries duties or check on orders already issued then theyd make their reports warn of any deviations in the balance which the aerie maintained detail their recommendations and so forth it was like a military ogroup in a way with karen as the cinc and she carried it off very well these were the only occasions when i saw karens men without their gauntlets her warrior had orders direct from her mind to savage anyone who attempted to enter her level wearing a gauntlet but dont be misled by anything ive said about her dont in any way make the error of believing she was vulnerable for she wasnt not physically anyway she was wamphyri the real thing and her lieutenants knew it she looked and for the moment perhaps still thought like a young woman yes but that was only the shell within her she had a vampire and its strengths were hers growing stronger every day if she appeared weak it was simply that she didnt want her underlings to test her didnt want to have to punish them as shed been obliged to punish corlis for that might mean calling again upon the monster within her for its assistance and she was dedicated to her stance which was to hold it at bay let it gain true ascendancy just onceshe believed it would dominate her always and eventually it will of course for that is the nature of the vampire karen is doomed to change to metamorphosis to the gradual deterioration of what she was into what she must become i remember that toward the end of my captivity there in her aerie i asked her what corlis could have done that shed wished to banish him to the helllands perhaps because i was the only one she could talk to without worrying about their motives she told me all about it corlis had been the biggest of karens men both in size and in the aeries pecking order he was also surly a troublemaker the wamphyri equivalent of a male chauvinist whatever in spades even as a traveller hed been a brute but that had been forty years ago then he had been taken in a raid since when hed served dramal doombody if served is the right word for it god knows why dramal suffered him but the ways of the wamphyri are never easy to figure out maybe at one time dramal intended that corlis should have his egg but thats pure guesswork of course let me explain corlis like this he wasnt true wamphyri but if ever a man should have been then he was that man and he knew it most men would shrink from the idea but not corlis he wanted an egg and the power it would bring he wanted to be master of the aerie a wamphyri lord he would like nothing better than to ride to war on the back of a flying beast and command his warriors in their terrifying aerial battles but while he and the others called themselves wamphyri they knew that in fact they were merely the undead servants of their true vampire mistress and that was the great thorn in corliss side he had asked the lady karen that she make him the aeries warlord to which shed replied that she had no need of a warlord for there was no war he had demanded rank and position above his fellows only to be told he had no right to such honours there was room for only one master in an aerie and in this aerie that one was the lady karen herself then corlis had offered himself as karens consort and protector at which shed lost her temper and told him shed rather sleep with a warrior as for his protection he should worry about protecting himself especially if he intended to continue his current campaign of mischief and annoyance but corlis wasnt to be put off lightly hed argued heatedly that the other wamphyri lords were plotting for war that now that dramal was dead the aerie was vulnerable and that karen a mere woman could never hope to achieve any sort of effective command of her army in battle she should choose her champion now without delay and the champion she chose had better be him at that karen had ordered him out of her presence corlis and the other six with him four of them had made to obey her but the others they had sided with corlis and warning off the four who remained halfloyal to her corlis and his two had surrounded her where she sat upon her throne of office which had once been dramal doombodys bonethrone made of the curved fossilized jaw of a vast cartilage creature from under his jacket one of these traitors produced a stake of wood forbidden in every aerie since time immemorial and sprang at her the second produced chains of iron to bind her as for corlis he stood arms akimbo and watched his plan was this to stake karen through her vampire heart and then when she lay helpless to threaten her with decapitation and fire this threat he hoped would drive her vampire to produce its egg for even immature vampires will do this when true death seems imminent the egg would be his for he intended to be in such a position as to leave no alternative host namely fused sexually with his victim but karen had divined his purpose being wamphyri shed been gifted with an element of telepathic talent now in her hour of need that talent worked for her not only in reading corliss intentions but also to call her warrior creature from its vigil at the top of the stairwell the creature came and swiftly corlis and his two now held karen down she was not wearing her gauntlet but still she put up a fight she wouldnt lie still long enough for the one with the chains to bind her her nails opened up corliss face she kicked the one with the stake repeatedly in the groin and the four who were halffaithful were torn two ways they danced here and there undecided not knowing what to do for best but then when they saw karens warrior comingah but then they knew what to do for best two of them leaped on the one with the stake and dragged him away the enraged warrior took him from them and that was the end of him he had no egg he was just flesh however vampirized the warriors know how to deal with mere flesh the other two moreorlessfaithful ones fell on corlis where he tried in vain to rape karen and finally they pinned him down that left the lady herself to deal with the one who had tried to chain her unlike corlis this one was small and karens full vampire fury had been roused she dragged him screaming to her throne and drove his face down on the jagged cartilage finial which formed the grip at the end of an arm rest the finial was the eyetooth of the creature whose massive jaw formed the throne it entered the traitors mouth and came out at the base of his skull so that he kneeled there and flopped about like a speared fish he was taken to the refuse pit and corlis of course was taken to the gate zek looked at jazz where he lay awake and listening but she saw that he was bleareyed and close to the edge of sleep im tired too she said lets sleep now and ill finish up on the next leg of our journey well be spending the long night in the caves i should think you can ask me any questions then and by then too youll know just about as much as i do jazz nodded youre doing a great job he said watching her lie back in her sleepingbag then he stifled a yawn said zek yes she turned her head and looked at him her face a strange mixture of mystique and ingenue if and when this is ever finished i think maybe you and i she shook her head cutting him short were drawn to each other because were all we have she said in the caves we can be together if thats what you want but dont think im being generous for i want it too just dont make me any promises about if and when ok we dont know if and we certainly dont known when going home should we ever be so fortunate will be like stepping out of darkness into light we might see each other very differently lets leave it at that he smiled yawned again and nodded a hell of a woman ok but ive always been an optimist zek take my word for it well make it she lay back closed her eyes said well heres to optimism and to the conclusion of a troublefree trek and to the dweller and oh the future the future yes she agreed ill drink to that god knows it has to be better than the past from leipzig harry keogh returned direct to ebranch hq in london he materialized in the armoury a room not much bigger than a cupboard took a mm browning automatic and three full magazines and was out of the place almost before the alarms could start up then back to jazz simmonss flat where he donned a black shirt pullover and slacks and finally to bonnyrigg near edinburgh to visit his mother this last wasnt absolutely necesary for once harry had communicated with a dead person he could usually speak to that person again even over great distances but whenever possible it seemed only polite and much more private and personal to go to them in their final resting places or the places where they had died ma he said the moment after emerging onto the riverbank above the place where the water gurgled dark and deep ma its harry harry she answered at once im so glad youve come i was just about to start looking for you oh is there something ma you asked about people dying in the upper urals jazz simmons for a moment harry felt like the ground had been ripped out from under him if simmons was dead after all here in this world it rubbished all of harrys and mobiuss theories and it left brenda and harry jnr strandedwherever but who his mother seemed taken by surprise but only for a moment oh no not him we couldnt find him this is someone else someone who knew him someone who knew jazz simmons at perchorsk relief flooded through harry who are you talking about ma a different voice spoke in harrys head a voice that was new to him she means me harry kazimir kirescu i knew jazz yes and now im paying for it oh i dont blame him but someone is to blame several people soif you can help me son then ill be very glad indeed to help you help you harry stood on a riverbank in scotland and talked to a dead person two and a half thousand miles away and it seemed perfectly natural to him but how can i help you kazimir youre dead after all ah but its how died and its where am now you want revenge through me thats part of it yes but mainly i wantto be still harry frowned often the dead were more vague than the living maybe id better come and see you i mean this is sort of impersonal is it safe where you are its never safe here harry kazimir told him and where i am its always horrible i can tell you this much im in a room at the perchorsk projekt and at the moment im alone at least there are no people with me butdo you have a strong stomach harry how are your nerves harry smiled briefly oh my stomachs strong enough kazimir and i think my nerves will hold up then the smile slipped from his face what was the others situation he wondered then come by all means said the old man only dont say i didnt warn you harry grew cautious it had been his intention to visit perchorsk anyway that was why he had come to see his mother so that with the aid of her friends she could guide him there but nowjust tell me this he said if i come right now will my life be endangered no nothing like that ive been told you can come and go as you wish and in any case were not likely to be disturbed though there is always that possibility butim with something that isnt pleasant the old mans mental voice was full of shudders ill come said harry just keep talking to me and ill home in on you he conjured a mobius door and followed kazimirs thoughts to their source at perchorsk it was an hour after midnight the room of the thing was in darkness where only the red ceiling lights gave any illumination harry emerged from the mobius continuum there stared all about in the redtinged gloom and felt the sinister heart of the place throbbing through the floor under his feet then he saw the tank and the shape inside it but for the moment he couldnt quite see what that shape was me said kazimir kirescu my resting place except it doesnt rest doesnt rest harry repeated him but softly there were dimmer switches on the wall a nest of them harry reached for them went to turn up the lights they came up slowly oh my god said harry in a shaky whisper kazimir thats what ate me the other answered in a voice horrified as harrys own thats where i am i dont mind being dead so much harry but i would like to lie still harry moved uncertainly across the room toward the creature in the tank it seemed slug or snaillike its corrugated foot or lower body pulsated where it adhered to the glass wall atop its lolling neck sat an almost human head with the face of an old man flaccid arms hung down bonelessly from rubbery shoulders and several rudimentary eyes gazed wetly vacantly from where they opened like suckers in the things dark skin its normal eyes those in the old mans face moved to compensate for the languid lolling of the head remained firmly fixed upon harry but they were only normal in that they occupied a face other than that they were uniformly scarlet my face said kazimir with a sob but not my eyes harry and dead or alive no man should be part of this thing and then while harry continued to stare at the monstrosity kazimir told him all he knew about the perchorsk projekt and of the events leading to his current predicament fifteen minutes later and a mere fifty yards away major chingiz khuv kgb came awake sat up jerkily in his bed he was hot feverish hed been dreaming nightmaring but the dreams were quickly receding in the face of reality reality as khuv was well aware was often far more nightmarish than any dream especially here in perchorsk but it was as if the unremembered dreams were premonitory khuvs nerves were already jangling to the buzzing of his doorbell he got up threw on a dressinggown and went to the door it was paul savinkov puffing and panting from his exertions his fat hands fluttering what is it paul khuv brushed sleep from the corners of his eyes were not sure major butnik slepak and i khuv came fully awake on the instant savinkov and slepak were both espsensitives they could detect and recognize foreign telepathic sendings psychic emanations anything of a paranormal nature and in the event of espionage they were adept at intercepting and scrambling alien probes what is it paul khuv demanded this time are they spying on us again savinkov gulped it could be worse than that he said we thinkwe think something is here khuvs jaw dropped you think something is he grabbed the others arm something from the gate do you mean savinkov shook his head his fat face was shiny eyes very bright no not from the gate those things that come through the gate they leave a slimy trail in the mind theyre alien to this world i mean this thing we can sense here it isnt that sort of alien it might even be a man nik slepak thinks so but it he whatever has no right to be here two things were sure of whatever it is its powerful and it is here where khuv threw back the top half of his dressinggown thrust his left arm through the leather loop of a shoulderholster hanging from a peg inside the door the holster contained khuvs kgbissue automatic belting his dressinggown savagely about his waist he shoved savinkov ahead of him down the exterior corridor where he shouted now what are you deaf as well as queer has slepak also been struck dumb we dont know where major the fat esper gasped weve got our locator on it leo grenzel as he stuttered his apologies so slepak and grenzel came hurrying round the bend of the corridor they saw khuv and savinkov hurried to meet them well said khuv to grenzel a small sharpfeatured east german encounter three grenzel whispered his eyes were an incredibly deep grey and very large in his small face never larger than right now khuv frowned at him the thing in the glass tank what about it thats where he is grenzel nodded his face was pale strangely serene like the mask of a sleepwalker his talent affected him that way khuv turned sharply to savinkov you hurry get vasily agursky savinkov made off down the corridor i said hurry khuv called after him meet us in the room of the creature and make sure youre both armed harry had listened to kazimirs grim tale he now knew about the fate of the old mans family especially tassi he knew a little about chingiz khuv too about his espers and handful of kgb thugs but he still didnt know the projekts secret which lay in the heart of the place kazimir had not been privy to that had no knowledge of it thisthing said harry do you know what it is no only that its horrible kazimir answered in harrys mind its a vampire harry told him at least i think it is and you dont know how it got here was it perhaps made here know nothing about it harry nodded chewed his lip about your daughter do you know where she is show me a plan of this place in your mind or as much as you know of it kazimir was glad to cooperate said she was in the cell next to mine again harrys nod and kazimir you have my word that if i can find her ill take her out of this more than that if i can find her mother ill reunite them in a safe place the old mans mental sigh of relief was almost audible if you can do that then its enough dont worry about me but i do kazimir this thing isnt you you were dead when itwhen youyou were already dead i feel part of it im being absorbed by it harry chewed harder on his lip hed seen the rooms equipment he had a plan but wasnt sure if it would work what if i could kill this thing you cant die twice kazimir destroy it and ill be free im sure renewed hope rang in the old mans mental voice buthow can you destroy it harry knew how the stake the sword and the fire if this creature had a vampire in it then these things would kill it sowhy not skip the first two steps and go straight to the third outside ringing faintly running footsteps sounded and somewhere an alarm bell had started to gong its raucous warning through the bowels of the subterranean complex they know im here harry said this has to be quick he wheeled agurskys shockbox over to the tank it was an electrical transformer on wheels with a flexible heavyduty cable to a wall socket it had a pair of clamps on coiled extension leads which harry quickly made fast to terminals on the side of the tank watching him the creature came to life changing colour and shape as it began to work through several rapid metamorphoses it knew what the shockbox was knew what was coming or it thought it did harry didnt have time to watch its contortions and in any case he didnt want to feeling slightly sick he turned on the current and the thing at once went berserk harry wasted no time but turned the current up all the way the clamps sputtered and issued blue sparks smoke and a heavy ozone reek the rooms lights flickered momentarily then steadied and brightened again highvoltage current flowed through electrical cables in the glass walls of the tank and the creature took the full charge it became a writhing puppet of a man small with one tiny arm and hand and one huge one it balled a massive fist a fist almost as big as harrys head and slammed it again and again at the glass wall of its prison the wall of its incinerator the thing was melting mewling and melting steam poured off it as its liquids boiled its corrugated skin blistered cracked open blackened gusts of vile vapour escaped in jets from its rupturing pores it screamed and screamed with old kazimirs face through his mouth but its voice wasnt human then the glass shattered and its great black steaming fist came through at which the thing curled up on itself and gave up the ghost it collapsed halfin halfout of the shattered tank became still then the blackened smoking flesh of its head split open like an overripe pomegranate a cobras head writhed in the mush of boiling steaming brainsthe vampire and it too died even as harry watched free said kazimir free behind harry the rooms great door sighed open he conjured a door of his own and stepped through it intruder khuv agursky and the others reeled as they entered the room of the thing in the swirl and reek of the dead frying creature in the tank they failed to see that manshaped space where the smoke rushed in to fill a sudden gap harry had made his exit just in time agursky recovered first leaped across the room and switched off the power who has done this he demanded of no one in particular who is responsible he clapped a hand to his brow staggered toward the sputtering smoking tank where even now shards of glass were beginning to melt in the intense heat then as the smoke began to clear he saw the creatures blackened remains hanging out through the shattered glass wall saw too something else something which he didnt want anyone else to see he ripped off his smock quickly threw it over the monstrous remains khuv had meanwhile turned to leo grenzel the locator you said he was here an intruder well someone has certainly been here though im damned if i can see how the door was locked and theres a guard outside oh a halfasleep stupid guard thats true but hes not a complete idiot sojust getting in here would be hard enough if not impossible but as for getting out then khuv grasped grenzel by the shoulders stared hard at him leo is there something else grenzels face was pale again his grey eyes were deep as deep space he swayed where khuv held him upright still here he finally said hes still here khuv stared all about the room as did the others black smoke boiling from the mess under agurskys smock and the crackle of cooked alien flesh starting to cool but no sign of any intruder here where here the girl grenzel swayed the prisoner taschenka kirescu yes grenzels nod khuv whirled on savinkov and slepak how can this be he asked but already his mind was working memories of reports hed read flashed before his minds eye it was something from before his time but werent the british supposed to have a man who could do this sort of thing harry keogh was said to have been one such and after him alec kyle keogh was dead butbut they never had found kyles body after the mess at the chateau bronnitsy how can it be savinkov repeated his kgb master it cant be he was definite but oh it can grenzels faraway voice contradicted him it is quickly khuv rasped the cells i want to know what the hell is happening here they ran out of the room left grenzel swaying there his face slack and vacant but his eyes seeing seeing and agursky bundling up the dead creature and its dead parasite in his smock trembling in his eagerness to get it back to his private quarters and away from any threat of inspection by others for he now knew what had controlled this nameless thing and he wanted to examine that controller most minutely indeed to vasily agursky there was nothing more important in the entire world but that he examine the things parasite whose egg had been deposited and was even now maturing inside agursky himself tassis nightmare of the key grating in the lock on her cell door and of khuv entering darkeyed and evil had kept her awake it was that sort of nightmare the sort you suffer when youre awake it was doubtful if she would have slept anyway she hadnt sincesince the horror khuv had shown her in the room of the thing she couldnt sleep for the face of her father kept smiling at her from the darkness behind her eyelids whenever she closed her eyes her fathers face on the body of a beast she kept her cell light on and lay warm on her cot but shivering drained of energy waiting for khuv for her time was up and she knew he would soon be coming for her that had been his threat and major chingiz khuv didnt make idle threats if only there was something she could tell him but she didnt know anything only that she was the most wretched unhappiest girl in the world when harry stepped out of the mobius continuum tassi had just turned on her side turned her face away from his reentry point into this universe a quick glance about the cell told harry they were alone he took a single pace to the metal bed put a hand round tassis face and over her mouth cautioned her in russian shhh be quiet dont shout or do anything stupid im going to get you out of here he kept his hand clamped to her face but let her turn her head to look at him and with his hand still in place he helped her to sit up then ok he asked tassi nodded but she was trembling in every limb her eyes looked like saucers above her nose and the bands of harrys fingers he slowly took his hand away gently urged her to her feet she looked at the door then at harry said who how i dont its ok harry put a finger to his lips but how did you get in here i didnt hear you come was i asleep then her hand flew to her mouth did the major send you but ive told him i dont know anything oh please dont hurt me no ones going to hurt you tassi harry told her and then he made his mistake your father sent me seeing her expression he could have bitten his tongue through she shook her head and backed away from him there were tears in her eyes now my fathers dead she wept hes dead he couldnt have sent you and accusingly what are you going to do to me ive told you harry answered an edge of desperation in his tone im going to take you out of this place do you hear those alarms she listened and indeed she could hear the klaxons sounding from deep down in the heart of the place well harry continued im what those alarms are all about theyre looking for me and pretty soon theyll be looking in here so now im asking you to trust me what he was saying was impossible it was either a trick of khuvs or else this man was insane no one could get out of this place tassi was sure but on the other hand how had he got in do you have keys she asked harry could see he was making an impression keys he grinned however tightly i have an entire door lots of doors he was mad surely but he was different from the others here totally different i dont understand she said still backing away her legs struck the edge of her bed and she flopped down on it again running footsteps sounded and the tight grin slipped from harrys face theyre coming he said get up the sudden authority in his voice had her on her feet again in a moment there was shouting outside the jangle of keys khuvs voice hoarsely commanding open it open it harry grabbed tassi by the waist put your arms round my neck he said quickly girl no arguments now she did it she had no reason to trust him but she had no reason not to close your eyes he said and keep them closed tightening one arm around her narrow waist he grunted as he lifted her feet from the floor she heard the cell door grating open then silence but such absolute silence wha she commenced a question she couldnt finish and shrank from the booming of her own voice startled she opened her eyes for a moment but only for a moment then she snapped them tightly shut again there said harry and he lowered her feet to a solid floor you can open your eyes now she did the merest slitthen opened them wide wider and sagged against him her eyes rolled up and she began to slide down his body harry caught her up lifted her laid her on the duty officers desk behind his newspaper the do had just this moment realized that he had visitors then the girls arm and hand flopped into view under his open newspaper and he reared up and back with an inarticulate cry gyahhh its ok said harry who was growing accustomed to excusing himself its only me and the friend of a friend of mine jesus jesus oh sweet jesus the do clutched at his desk for support of all people it was darcy clarke harry nodded the very briefest of greetings began to massage the unconscious girls hands it had been am when harry arrived at ebranch hq and it was almost an hour later when he left in between times he passed on some information told clarke all he had learned and in return received a little information from the other his instructions for the welfare of tassi kirescu were these she was to be given refuge comforted as best the staff of ebranch knew how offered permanent political asylum a russian interpreter was to be provided for her and she should be debriefed with regard to the perchorsk projekt for the present she was to keep a low profile her presence here in the west should be kept secret and when she was released it must be with a new identity lastly ebranch was to use such usual and paranormal means as were required to discover the whereabouts in the ussr of her mother harry had made kazimir kirescu a promise and it was one he intended to keep eventually as for the information darcy clarke had for harry its zek foener he had told the necroscope zek what about her the last time harry had seen zek was eight years ago she had been a telepath at the chateau bronnitsy the ussrs equivalent of ebranch hq which had made her an enemy but a reluctant one harry could have destroyed her but hed sensed a deeprooted decency in her a desire to be free of her kgb masters all she had wanted was to return to greece he had suspected she would buthe had warned her not to come up against him again she may be part of this clarke had told him how do you mean part of perchorsk was zek the one whod betrayed his presence there she would have known his mind at once as soon as he materialized in the place of course there was also khuvs detachment of espers they could have picked him up just as easily for the moment harry preferred to believe the latter at least he hoped so part of perchorsk yes a cog in the wheel of the place weve kept an eye on her ever since the bodescu affair she was doing time at a forced labour camp not especially hard stuff but not pleasant either then they sent her to perchorsk this was some months ago and weve just had news of it we can only assume shes working for soviet ebranch again and for the kgb harrys face soured again he said i warned her not to well if i have to mix it with them again he let the threat hang there clarke stared hard at him but isnt it more serious than that harry at the end of the bodescu affair zek foener was working with ivan gerenko had been working with him harry cut in correcting him but shed quit i thought so anyway but you know what i mean clarke insisted gerenko had some crazy idea about using vampires thats why he and theo dolgikh and zek went back to that mountain pass east of the carpathians to see if after all those centuries anything remained of faethor ferenczys buried creatures zek knows about vampires it makes it that much more definite that the russians have discovered a way to make the damned things and that theyre doing it there at perchorsk so youre saying harry you remember how you dealt with the chateau bronnitsy after a moment harry had nodded oh yes he remembered it well enough using the mobius continuum hed laid plastic explosive charges there gouting shattering fire and lashing heat and the chateau reduced to smouldering rubble and the soviet ebranch reduced along with it for their sins in the space of less than a minute enough sheer destructive savagery to last any man a lifetime i remember he had finally answered except yes darcy if youre right well obviously the place has to go but not until were sure one way or the other and not yet i have this feeling that the answer to my one big problem is right there it may be risky i mean i know what has escaped from that place and what could presumably escape from it in future indeed ive seen and dealt with an example but for the moment i cant darent try to close it down not if i want to see brenda and harry jnr again for a moment it had seemed that clarke understood but then hed said harry its not just a case of risky its deadly unthinkable you must see that and then it had been harrys turn coldly he had answered there are a couple of things you have to see too darcy like old man kirescu being dead his death probably precipitated by your sending jazz simmons in there and that poor girl having lost both her father and her brother and her mother probably in a forced labour camp by now half out of her mind with grief and worry no doubt these are things you cant write off darcy and youre certainly not going to write off brenda and harry jnr so for now well continue to play this my way whitefaced clarke could only agree sowhats your way going to be whats your next step harry well there are questions i need answered it looks like ill have to go right to the top to get them answered the top harry had nodded the perchorsk projekt if im right and its not about breeding vampires then what is it about someone in that place knows and is going to tell me there has to be a boss a controller not khuv but someone above him of course there is clarke had answered at once khuvs in charge of security thats all the man you want is viktor luchov and hed gone on to fill harry in on luchovs background when he was done harry had nodded grimly then hes the man i need to talk to if anyone has the answers viktor luchov has to be the one when will you try to see him now now clarke had been taken aback but the place will still be on top alert i know ill create a smoke screen a what a diversion let me worry about it you just look after that girl clarke had nodded stuck out his hand best of luck harry the necroscope wasnt one for holding grudges he shook hands conjured a mobius door clarke watched him take his departure thought i was there once pray god hed never be there again viktor luchov was back in his own executive quarters and he was furious quite apart from this latest incident this intrusion if such it had been the projekt direktor had chosen the period of the alert to approach and challenge khuv in respect of certain rumours which were beginning to circulate through the projekt rumours alleging brutality and murder they concerned the kgb officers prisoners kazimir and taschenka kirescu perhaps luchovs approach had been a little too liverish but that could not excuse khuvs response which had been brusque to put it mildly namely he had told luchov that he should get off his back and let him attend to the projekts security with a minimum of interference or better still with no interference at all this confrontation had taken place not in private but in the detention area where khuvs espers had been crowding one of the cells in their search for something or other sniffing the ether as one of them had put it appalled at the apparent chaos and confusion luchov had demanded to see the prisoners which was when khuv had rounded on him listen comrade direktor the kgb major had hissed i would be delighted if i could show you the girl tassi kirescu this was her cell a little over one hour ago she was here and a guard on duty in the corridor outside then he had thrown up his hands she was no longer here and the door still locked now i know you hold ebranch in small regard and the kgb in no regard at all but surely it must be amply apparent even to your ohsoscientific mind that something quite exceptional something indeed entirely metaphysical has occurred here my espers are attempting to discover what that something was and i who have no esp talent of my own am trying to make sense of what theyre telling me sonow is not the ideal moment for you to come interfering you go too far major luchov had shouted and i shall go further khuv had shouted back if you do not get out of my way i shall have you escorted back to your quarters and locked in what you dare listen you damned scientist khuv had then snarled at him in my capacity as the projekts security supervisor i dare almost anything now ill tell you one more time the creature from the gate is dead destroyed by some unknown person or thing the kirescu girl formerly my prisoner is missing her father isdead an unfortunate accident i shall ensure that you get a copy of the report and finally the projekt has had an intruder our security has been breached in the worst possible way i repeat our security my sphere of work direktor not yours so go back to bed go back to your mathematics and your physics and what all go study your magmass and your grey holes and your particle beam acceleration only leave me alonef and luchov shouted down had returned to his rooms and commenced to write a furious comprehensive report on khuvs suspected activities and his rank insubordination meanwhile for the last five minutes harry keogh had been making a nuisance of himself first hed appeared outside the projekt on the patrolled ramp cut into the perchorsk ravines wall where hed taken a halfhearted pot shot at a guard he hadnt attempted to hit the man for hed need serious reasons before sending yet another human being to join the great majority before the soldier could fire back at him harry had ducked into the cover of darkly swirling snow and through a mobius door from there hed returned to the room of the thing emerging there hed been ready on the instant to return into the mobius continuum but the room was empty and so hed simply gone to the locked door and banged on it shouting to be let out the guard outside the room had responded to this of course and moments later so had the alarm system tassi kirescus cell had been next harry emerged amidst a handful of baffled espers struck two of them rapid stunning blows retreated to the mobius continuum behind him he left leo grenzel and nik slepak groaning on the floor and others whitefaced and wideeyed astonished by what theyd seen and felt grenzel was still feeling it and not just the two front teeth harry had loosened thats him he gurgled sitting up and spitting blood thats him khuv was heading for kgb accommodation when the klaxons began to sound again he cursed put on speed coming through a door between sections of the corridor he ran into harry keogh he knew him at once or thought he did khuv had a good memory hed seen photographs of this man a onetime head of british ebranch alec kyle harry pressed his browning up under khuvs chin said i can see by the look on your face that you know me which puts me at a disadvantage but let me guess anyway major chingiz khuv khuv gulped nodded shoved his hands high in the air major youre in the wrong business harry pressed harder with his gun take some good advice and get out while the goings good and pray you never see me again he stepped back away from khuv looked for a door in the moment of harrys distraction khuv snatched his own gun from its holster triggered off a shot harry felt the bullet buzz past his face like an angry wasp to speed forever through the mobius continuum then khuv and the corridor blinked out of existence and he headed for somewhere else he emerged in a military duty room situated just inside the projekts service bays put the muzzle of his pistol in the orderly sergeants ear where he sat at his desk and ordered him to tell him the way to direktor luchovs quarters the terrified sergeant showed him what he wanted to know on a wall chart a diagram of the perchorsk complex and harry rewarded him with a chop to the neck that would keep him out of things for at least half an hour then he was on the move again harrys smoke screen was now established it was am precisely local time when he materialized in viktor luchovs claustrophobic suite of rooms luchov was on the phone demanding to know what this fresh spate of clamouring alarms was all about when harry arrived his back was to harry who let him finish his conversation and slam the telephone down before he spoke direktor luchov im what those alarms are all about he pointed his automatic at luchovs heart said better sit down luchov whirling from the telephone saw harry his gun and where it was pointed in that order he staggered as if hed been struck in the temple what who who doesnt matter harry told him and what is what im here to find out khuvs intruder luchov finally gasped i thought it was all part of some elaborate scheme of his sit harry said again waving his gun toward a chair luchov did as harry ordered the yellow veins pulsing rapidly under the scartissue skin of his seared skull harry looked at luchovs disfigurement saw that the damage was fairly recent an accident tightlipped breathing just a fraction too quickly luchov said nothing both he and harry jumped as the telephone came janglingly alive ringing repeatedly then harry scowled they must have some clever people working here it seemed theyd already located him he wouldnt have time to interrogate luchov not here anyway get up he said reaching out and jerking luchov to his feet and still holding him he conjured a door and dragged the other through it in a moment for the moment they were out on the ramp in the ravine snow stinging their eyes and a cold wind rushing down the length of the canyon harry looked up at the bleak mountains showing their fangs through the snow luchov seeing where he was where according to all the laws of science he had no right to be had barely sufficient time to voice some inarticulate query before harry dragged him squalling through another door passed through the mobius continuum and exitedon a ledge high over the perchorsk ravine luchov saw the sheer drop under his feet and almost fainted he let out a wild shriek and pressed himself back into the face of the cliff behind him and again harry commanded sit before you fall luchov carefully sat down hugged his dressinggown to him shivered partly from the cold and partly from the terror of this totally unbelievable and yet entirely inescapable experience harry went down on one knee before him and put his gun away now he said i should think that dressed as we are weve about ten to fifteen minutes before we freeze to death so youd better talk fast there are things i want to know about the perchorsk projekt and i have it on good authority that youd be the one to tell me so ill ask the questions and youll answer them luchov collected his whirling senses as best he could recovered something of his dignity ifif i have only fifteen minutes left then so do you we both freeze harry grinned wolfishly you dont catch on too quickly do you i dont have to stay here i can leave you right now like this and he was no longer there snow swirled in the space where he had kneeled he returned said so whats it going to be do you talk to me or do i simply leave you here youre an enemy of my country luchov blurted feeling the cold start to bite that place of yours harry nodded toward the grey sheen of lead far below appears to be an enemy of the world potentially anyway if i tell you anything anything about the projekt then im a traitor luchov protested this wasnt getting harry anywhere and now he was cold too listen he said youve seen what i can do but you havent seen everything im also a necroscope i can talk to the dead so i can talk to you alive or i can talk to you dead if you were dead youd be only too glad to talk to me viktor for then id be your only real contact with the world talk to the dead luchov shrank even further down into himself youre a madman harry shrugged obviously you dont know much about espers i take it you and khuv dont get on too well luchovs teeth had started to chatter esp is this something to do with esp harry had run out of time and patience ok he said straightening up i can see you need convincing so im going to leave you now im going somewhere else somewhere warm ill come back in about five minutes or maybe ten meanwhile you can make up your mind to talk to me or to attempt to climb down from here personally i dont think youd make it i think youd fall and then that we would talk again when i found your body at the bottom of the ravine luchov grasped his ankle it was all a nightmare had to be a nightmare surely but it felt horribly real as real as the fleshandblood ankle he was grasping wait wait whatwhat is it you want to know thats better said harry he drew luchov to his feet took him somewhere more comfortable an evening beach in australia luchov felt the hot sand under his feet saw a shimmering ocean with its endless lines of whitecaps sat down abruptly as his legs gave way he sat there in the sand wideeyed shivering and very nearly exhausted the beach was deserted harry looked down at luchov and nodded then he stripped down to his underpants went for a swim when he came out of the sea luchov was ready to talk when luchov was finished it was getting dark a handful of cars had come roaring down to the beach a quarter of a mile away spilled young people with blankets and barbecue gear laughter and rock music came wafting on a crosswind back at perchorsk itll be morning daylight said harry but theyll still be running around in circles looking for you if khuv has a locator theyll know approximately where you are to be absolutely sure though theyll go over the projekt with a finetoothed comb and by now everyone involved will be very tired one thing is certain khuv now knows something of what hes up against now listen youve cooperated with me and so ill give you fair warning it may be that i have to destroy perchorsk not for my sake or in the interest of any nation or specific group of people but for the sake of the world but in any case even if anything should happen to me eventually perchorsk will be destroyed the usa wont sit still for any more monsters coming out of that place of course luchov answered i had foreseen that eventuality some months ago i passed on my warning to people in authority made my recommendations the warning was heeded and the recommendations accepted within the week possibly as soon as tomorrow today trucks will start to arrive at perchorsk from sverdlovsk they will deliver a new failsafe so you see on this one point if on no other we are in agreement nothing alien must ever again get out of perchorsk harry nodded before i take you back there he said id like to ask you one more thing with that spacetime gate down there in perchorsks guts how come you found me so incredible i mean surely the two principles come pretty close in perchorsk you havea grey hole and i make use of a dimension or spacetime plane other than my own luchov stood up stiffly brushed sand from his clothes the difference is this he said i know how the perchorsk gate came into being ive worked out most of the mathematics the gate is a physical reality with nothing transient or insubstantial about it it is physical not metaphysical the result of an accident yes but at least i know how that accident happened you on the other hand youre just a man i cant understand how you could ever possibly have happened harry thought about his answer eventually nodded actually i believe i was an accident too he said the product of a oneinamillion combination of events anyway ive warned you about perchorsk you risk your life staying there do you think i dont know that luchov shrugged still its my job ill see it through and you what will you do now after ive taken you back i have to know whats on the other side of that gate there has to be more there than the nightmares youve described there had to be for how else could little harry and his mother exist there if they exist there but what if there are other dimensions beyond that one what if harry jnr has taken his mother even further afield harry dropped luchov off outside the great sliding doors of the service bays left him in the grey morning light and the sullen snow hammering at the wicketgate and bellowing to be let in then harry went to luchovs quarters where he donned a white smock which on his last visit hed seen hanging there the smock was the insignia of a projekt scientist or technician in the garments pocket he found tinted spectacles and put them on and without more ado he went straight to the magmass heart of the place materializing on the saturnsrings circumference midway between two sets of manned katushev cannons he stayed perfectly still held a mobius door fixed in his mind ready to take cover but all seemed well a soldier lounging against the smooth magmass wall saw him looked a little startled straightened up and gave a halfhearted salute harry stared hard at him much to the mans discomfort then turned and scanned the great unnatural cavern in which he found himself especially he stared at the blinding white sphere which was the gate there were other technicians about everyone looked tired following their nightshift even the gunners in their padded bucketseats where they sighted their weapons on the gate two scientists walked past harry talking moving in the direction of the walkway to the sphere one of them glanced his way as they passed smiled and nodded in a familiar manner harry wondered who the man thought he was he nodded back began to follow the pair and as he drew level with the walkway turned off and moved toward the centre heading directly for the sphere of light behind him a soldier shouted hey not in our line of fire sir regulations harry glanced back casually over his shoulder and kept going he left the outer platform behind and moved onto the walkway even as the gate in the electrified fence began to close he passed through it reached the spot where the boards were scorched behind him the gates opened again footsteps came hurrying harry was aware of a low angry muttering but he was more aware of the katushevs aimed directly at him or rather not trained on him but on the gate which amounted to the same thing sir a voice shouted in his ear from directly behind him harry conjured a mobius door and with a tremor of unaccustomed panic saw that it was all wrong the outline of the door wasnt clearcut in harrys mind its edges shimmered like a heathaze mirage it floated up alongside him drifted toward the sphere as if attracted by it and was held there gradually fading where it trembled above the wooden walkway harry had seen nothing like this before he conjured a second door with the same result the sphere both attracted and repelled the doors it made them less substantial pinned them down and broke them up it cancelled them a hand fell on harrys shoulder and at the same time he heard shouts from the wide wooden staircase where it emerged from the magmass shaft someone with a highpitched voice was screaming hes here hes here as the sergeant whod grabbed harrys shoulder turned him aboutface he glanced toward the stairs saw chingiz khuv and a second man coming down from the shaft harry thought god doesnt that bastard ever sleep khuv seemed to be holding his companion up keeping him from toppling headlong the man he helped was one of the espers harry had struck while he was laying his smoke screen and he was the one who was doing all the shouting then he pointed directly at harry screamed one last time thats him and khuvs dark gaze followed his shaking hand khuvs eyes blazed in a moment open fire he shouted at once he too pointed at harry shouting shoot him kill him hes an intruder the sergeant who had taken hold of harry let go of him stepped back went to draw the pistol at his hip harry moved quickly after him dropkicked him and sent him flying off the walkway falling to the boards harry stayed low out of the line of fire of the katushevs he conjured a mobius door level with the walkway hanging over empty space it was his notion to dive headlong through it but the door shimmered and warped was drawn up and toward the sphere of light harry could hear the katushev commander yelling target to the front take aim and knew that the next command would be fire he mustnt be here when that order was given before the shimmering disintegrating door could disappear entirely he sprang for it even though it appeared printed on the very face of the sphere itself still it was his one chance he passed through the door into a hell of physical and mental agony when harry regained consciousness he was adrift in the mobius continuum apparently in motion through a region of the continuum which was new to him his body and his psyche both felt badly battered and that sixth sense of harrys which was usually sharp as a razor felt tarnished and dull not without a deal of effort he formed the mental equations and conjured a door it opened on deep voids of space shot with stars in alien constellations he closed the door at once and groped for others he found a door on futuretime and peered through it no blue lifethreads raced into the future here only his own which bent violently aside beyond the door to disappear at rightangles to harrys viewpoint the past was equally hostile indeed there seemed to be no past in this place just an ocean of interminable impersonal stars the lack of human activity of even traces of activity reinforced harrys opinion that he had been blown offtrack and had left the mundane world of men far behind beginning to panic he tried one last door and gazed out on the surface of a roaring furnace star he closed that door too then forced himself into a state of calm a condition in which he might at least apply a little reason to the problem he was lost yes but what is lost can be found again he didnt know where he was or how he had got here true but since he had come here there must be a way back exceptspace is a big place and harry keogh felt like an exceedingly tiny mote in the eye of the infinite then harry whispered a familiar distant voice in his mind i thought i recognized you the voice sped closer rapidly grew stronger but whats this are you trespassing mobius thank god said harry god thats outside my line of research harry mobius told him i prefer to thank my equations if its all the same to you though i suppose it could be argued that they are one and the same how come youre out here harry was calmer now wherever here is here is in the constellation of orion mobius answered and the point is what are you doing out here harry explained hmm mobius mused well first lets get you home again and then well see if we can find an explanation for whats happened if youll just follow me harry stayed with mobius sped with him homeward materialized in the leipzig graveyard it was evening which told him hed spent an entire day in the mobius continuum in the grey wintry light of the graveyard harry blinked staggered his legs wouldnt hold him up so he sat down on the gravel beside mobiuss marker you could do with a good long rest my boy mobius told him youre right harry agreed but first id like to know if you can explain what happened to me i think can yes said the mathematician you yourself have likened my strip dimension to a parallel plane and this gate at perchorsk leads to another they are both gates between planes of existence both are negative conditions blemishes on the perfect surface of normal spacetime now take two magnets and push their negative poles together and what happens they repel one another harry shrugged exactly and so does the gate and the doors which you create in your mind but the perchorsk gate is stronger and so the repulsion is that much more fierce when you used that door close to this sphere gateway you were hurled across the mobius continuum like a shot from a gun your equations were warped out of focus your body underwent stresses it could never hope to survive in the physical world in threedimensioned space you would have died instantly the continuum itself saved you because it is infinitely resilient lesson you may not impose your metaphysical self upon the gate go through it as a man by all means if you must but never again attempt entry using the mobius continuum harry frowned then slowly nodded youre right he said and ive been foolish but that wasnt entirely my fault i hadnt intended to use the continuum in conjunction with the gate it just worked out that way but my curiosity has worked against me i had to see what this gate looked like see it with my own eyes and by now there wont be a man in the entire perchorsk projekt who doesnt know what i look like the next time i stick my nose in there be sure someone will blow it right off my face what will you do harry leaned back against the headstone and sighed i dont know but i know im tired go home said mobius sleep rest things will be that much clearer in your mind when you wake up harry said his thanks his farewells did as mobius advised he emerged back in jazz simmonss flat in a prone position two inches over his bed gently fell onto it almost before his head hit the pillows he was asleep zek continues her story it was deep twilight now a few birds sang hushed warbling songs in the grass of the plain the mountains marched cold on the right flank dark in their forested roots and gold on their snowspiked peaks the tribe of lardis the traveller moved silently no words spoken with only their natural jingle the creaking of their caravans and rustle of travois to tell that they were there at all in the shadows of the woods where they skirted the barrier mountains it was colder too and a racing moon sailed like a pale farflung coin on high calling to the wild wolves of the peaks whose answering calls echoed down with an eerie foreboding the sun was a sliver of gold in the south gleaming faintly far beyond the plain and silvering the coils of winding rivers only michael j simmons and zekintha foener spoke because they were helllanders and knew no better but even their speech was hushed it would soon be sundown which was not a time for making loud noises even strangers could sense that much jazz had built a lightframed travois he hauled their kit bundled up in skins carried only his smg strapped across his back zek helped as best she could where the going was rough but in the main he was well able to manage on his own in just a few days his trained physique had attained new heights of strength and endurance a few miles back theyd picked up the main traveller party and now lardiss tribe was complete now too the sanctuary outcrop was only a short distance ahead already its dome was visible with the sun gleaming on it like some great fleshless yellowed skull in the middle distance from here on as they went the gypsies would cover their tracks leave no sign to tell that theyd come this way oh the wamphyri knew their hiding holes well enough but even so they didnt care to advertise their presence here a few minutes ago lardis had toiled up alongside jazz and zek said jazz when the tribes in and settled down then meet me at the main entrance myself and three or four of the lads well have a go at learning how to use these weapons of yours the flameengine and your guns and the grenades jazz had paused for a moment wiped his sweating brow eh ah yes lardis grinned but bigger fish next time eh the grin had fallen from his face in a moment lets hope we dont have to use them any of them but if we do the silvertipped bolts of our crossbows sharpened staves which weve got cached away in the caves our swords of silver which are likewise hidden combined with your weaponsif its our turn to go at least well go fighting then zek had spoken up thats gloomy talk lardis lidesci is something bothering you weve just one more sundown ahead of us and before the next one well be meeting up with the dweller thats what you promised your people surely alls gone well so far hed nodded so far aye but the lord shaithis has a score to settle there was no bad blood before it was the old game of wolf and chicken as always but now the chicken has clawed the wolfs nose hes not just curious or greedy any more hes angry also and hed closed his mouth and shrugged tell us the worst of it lardis jazz had urged him whats on your mind again lardiss shrug i dont know maybe its nothing or maybe its several small things but theres a mist back there and thats something i dont like for a start hed pointed back the way theyd come in the distance to the east a wall of grey mist rolled down from the mountains coiled itself shallowly on the forests it swirled and eddied lapping like a slow tide over the foothills the wamphyri have a way with mists lardis had continued were not the only ones who cover our tracks but its still sunup jazz had protested in a very little while it will be sundown lardis had snapped and the great pass has been in darkness for a long time now here in the lee of these forests theres shade aplenty zeks hand had flown to her mouth you think shaithis is coming but ive sensed nothing ive been scanning constantly but ive read no alien thoughts lardis had breathed deeply more a sigh thats reassuring anyway and if he is coming well meet on our terms at least hed glanced up into the mountains but the wolves were howling and now theyve stopped and our own animals are quiet too see only look at wolf there zeks great wolf loped a little way apart his ears were flat and his tail brushed the rough ground every now and then hed pause and look back and whine a little jazz and zek had looked at each other then at lardis but maybe its nothing the gypsy leader had grunted and with another shrug hed gone on ahead what do you make of all that jazz now asked zek his tone soft i dont know maybe its just as he said anyway the closer we get to sundown the more nervy everyone becomes theres nothing new in that the travellers dont like mists and they like their animals frisky anything else is a bad sign the current mood its just a combination of things thats all for all her brave explanation she hugged herself and shivered ever the optimist jazzs smile was uncertain because ive come through a lot she was quick to answer and because were so close to the end now yes you have been through a lot jazz began hauling the travois again and come to think of it you never did get round to telling me how come the lady karen let you go weve been busy she shrugged do you still want to hear it suddenly the idea appealed to her maybe talking would calm her own nerves a little yes jazz said but first there are a couple of other things that have been bothering me oh anachronisms he nodded the gypsies this romancelanguage tongue of theirs their metal working unless theres a lot of this planet i dont know about and i cant see how that can be for one sides hot enough to fry eggs and the other would freeze you stiff then these things ive mentioned are anachronisms this world iswell its primitive but there are paradoxes some of the things in this worldby comparison theyre hightech zeks turn to nod i know she said and ive thought about it if you talk to the travellers about their history their legends as i have done you might find an explanation something of one anyway according to immemorial sources their world wasnt always like this wamphyri legends bear the traveller myths out incidentally jazz was interested go on he said you talk and ill save my breath for hauling well the traveller legends have it that once upon a time this planet was fertile in almost every region with oceans icecaps jungles and plains much like earth in fact and it teemed with people oh it had its vampire swamps too but they werent so active in those days people knew about them and shunned them local communities drew boundaries and patrolled them nothing living was ever allowed out vampirism was treated like rabies the only difference being that if a man was ever vampirized they didnt attempt a cure there is no cure so theyd simply stake him out andyou know the way it goes but in the main the vampires were kept down and in those days there were no wamphyri the people werent migratory they had nothing to fear and so nothing to run from their systems were mainly barter less frequently feudal anyway as far as i can make out they were maybe three to four hundred years behind us there were big differences of course they hadnt discovered gunpowder for one thing also while theyd developed a complex language they still hadnt made much effort to get it down on paper or on skins thats why most of this has had to come down by word of mouth from one generation to the next of course you can get big distortions that way some unimportant things get exaggerated while others of real importance are lost entirely for example the heroes in the traveller myths are all giants who eat vampires for breakfast and dont even get a stomach ache but no one remembers who developed the metalworking skills designed the first caravan made the first crossbow so that was the way this world was like ours maybe three or four hundred years ago but in many ways less dangerous less warlike less noisy mainly people lived in peace with each other and apart from small territorial disputes they were left alone to farm fish and trade off anything extra which they managed to produce there have been plenty of worse places and worse times in our own world oh and perhaps i should mention in that bygone time the world did have proper seasons shorter days and nights again pretty similar to our own planet but then then something happened according to the traveller legend a white sun appeared in the night sky it came through the heavens so fast it looked like a bar of fire it glanced off the moon speared down and blazed across the surface of the world as it fell so it shrank until finally it skimmed across the land in a huge ball of fire like a flat stone bouncing on water and came to rest back there beyond the mountains but though it was small this white sun its magic was enormous it speeded up the moon in its orbit changed the worlds axis brought into being geological stresses of awesome magnitude it created these mountains the frozen lands to the north the deserts of the south and for a thousand years after its coming the surface of this world was more like hell than the friendly place it had been the seasons were gone forever the moon was now a demon flyer that called to the wolves an estimated quarterbillion people were reduced to a few thousand the continents had changed mountains disappeared from where theyd been were forced up elsewhere the survivors went through a nightmare of tidal waves storms volcanic upheavals you name it but they learned to live with it and eventually the world settled down except that now there was a starside and a sunside centuries passed who knows how many far sunside became a desert and starsidewell youve seen it only the mountains and their sunside foothills could support human life as we know it people had settled there started to rebuild however slowly crudely they remembered a few of their skills used them to start afresh and meanwhile the swamps mainly unchanged had restocked with evil vampiric life explorers went over the mountains through the passes saw the frozen wastes beyond torrential rains the howling elements and glacial ice had carved mighty stacks from the mountain flanks but the land was all but barren men couldnt live there men mind you then there came the plague a plague of vampires the swamps overflowed with the damned things they infested men and animals in unprecedented numbers bands of vampirized men roamed on sunside murdering by night and crawling into holes during the interminable days reduced to nearsavagery by natures disaster now this unnatural disaster reduced people further still then the tribes rallied began hunting vampires killed them as they had in the old days they used the stake the sword fire they dragged vampires screaming into the open pinned them down for the sun to fry finally sunside was safe again the swamps became more or less quiescent the plague was under control but vampirized men had been driven north through the great pass longlived they fought with each other for the blood which sustains them they discovered and lived off the troglodytes in their deep caverns on starside then as they started to inhabit the stacks so they became the lords of that dark hemisphere they built their aeries called themselves wamphyri and with the intelligence of men and the drive of the vampires within them so at last they began to raid on sunside the people they victimized survived by becoming travellers and theyre still travelling thats the whole story this white sun jazz said after a while are we talking about the sphere the gate whatever zek shrugged i imagine so its a spacetime gate right not only a distortion of space but a bridge across time too is it possible that what appeared here thousands of years ago was caused by the perchorsk accident and that the two are linked through the sphere an anachronism as you say but what the hell was is it jazz frowned back at perchorsk there was talk of black white even grey holes and you said it tied in with wamphyri legends too how do you mean the wamphyri legends have it that the white sun came from hell or a place that was hell to them anyway in other words a world where the killing sun was a constant factor a regularly recurring nightmare from which there was only brief surcease up until a time only a few years ago the sphere we came through from perchorsk out onto the plain of boulders on starside was buried it used to lie at the bottom of its crater where only its upper surface was visible beaming its white light up into the sky like a searchlight it was maybe fifteen to twenty feet deep surrounded by the crater wall i had all of this from karen but just two years ago our time at the time of the perchorsk accident jazz was quick to note yes zek nodded i suppose so anyway that was when a change took place during sunup when the wamphyri stick close to their stacks the sphere apparently elevated itself up from the bed of its crater until it was positioned as it is now explanation zeks shrug i certainly dont have one but the wamphyri saw it as an omen their myths have it that any change in the sphere the gate to the helllands is portentous of great changes in general changes they themselves might instigate such as well for a long time now theyve talked of joining forces and waging war on the dweller if they could put aside their own petty squabbles long enough maybe theyd do that also we were something of a change in ourselves when chingiz khuv started sending political prisoners and other undesirables through the gate as a series of experimentsit was the first time that the wamphyri had proof that the hitherto halfmythical helllands were real jazz was frowning chewing his lip somethings wrong here he said if the recent perchorsk accident in our world caused the white sun effect thousands of years ago in this one why didnt we appear through the gate all that time ago another anachronism a spacetime paradox i dont buy it it doesnt ring true now tell me this how long have the wamphyri been using the gate as a punishment when did they first start sending transgressors through it zek glanced at him why do you ask just a thought well as far as im aware theyve been doing it right through their history for thousands of years see what i mean jazz was sure this was important up until the time i left perchorsk there had only been a handful of encounters of which only one was or had been a man a creature of the wamphyri anyway zek shook her head no he was true wamphyri that one he was lesk the gluts heir klaus desculu he had lesks egg but instead of going off and finding or stealing a stack of his own he tried to usurp his father lesk the glut is insane even the wamphyri recognize that fact that lesk the glut is not responsible his passions are enormous he brought klaus to heel punished him for ten years submitted him to incredible cruelties then banished him through the gate he was the one they hosed with liquid fire on the walkway but i see what you mean if the wamphyri have been sending their malefactors through the gate throughout their history where have they been going not to perchorsk obviously for perchorsk didnt exist then coming this way jazz mused from perchorsk to here theres only one exit onto the boulder plain on starside but going the other wayis there more than one exit into our world one at perchorsk and another somewhere else it was zeks turn to be excited ive wondered about that she said and it might explain away certain other things which have puzzled me and you oh she nodded for instance how is it that the traveller tongue is so close to the romanian of our world and for that matter how are the gypsies themselves so close what do you know of earths languages jazz our earth of course its obvious that youre something of a linguist he smiled what do i know about earth languages quite a lot actually i have qualifications in russian my father was a russian the slavonic languages yes and something of the romance tongues too thats how i picked up the traveller patois so quickly why do you ask a theory of mine she answered my own knack with languages comes from my telepathy languages are easy if youve a rapport with your subjects mind but the connection between the traveller tongue and romanian seemed so obvious to me and of course the wamphyri have the same tongue jazz saw what she was getting at and drew breath in a hiss the banished wamphyri took their language with them into our world he said zek thats clever but yes but thats to suppose that the latin tongues originated here not in our world thats my theory yes i also believe that some of those ancient banished wamphyri took their followers with them the szgany zingaro zigeuner the gypsy the romance tongues spread outwards from russia jazz looked puzzled i cant see that who mentioned russia she answered if there is more than one exit in our world why must they all be in russia romania that would be my bet yes ask yourself this where did the vampire legend arise from in our world where does it have its roots in romania of course and which nation has retained its own language almost entirely intact since time immemorial despite being surrounded by countries with little or no linguistic relationship like hungarian and the slavonic tongues i see he nodded by periodic injections of vampires and their followers right its possible jazz began to get hooked on the idea the more i think of it the more plausible it seems he finally said the first wamphyri migrated to our world many thousands of years ago they took their followers and their language with them the gypsies and their tongue which is a form of latin they spread outward from romania into all the lands around but their heartland was romania itself despite being conquered by avars magyars goths gepidae and what have you the language could only be diluted not eradicated for when the conquerors moved on there would always be new arrivals from this side of the gate to reinforce the watereddown tongue it explains why romania is so isolated in its use of a romance language and as you say it gives a real basis for earths vampire legends but werent gypsies supposed to have come out of india the karakoram mountains maybe the first of them through the gate went to india zek answered why not theyre travellers arent they and from there they spread themselves throughout the world their urge to travel is simple to explain it had been bred into them by the wamphyri for so many hundreds of years so to sum up jazz said what youre saying is this that theres another gate somewhere in romania through which the wamphyri have been arriving in our world for millennia never a great many of them she answered but yes that seems to be our conclusion i hinted at it and you worked it out for yourself its plausible as you said so why doesnt anyone know about this romanian gate i mean a thing like the shining sphere isnt likely to remain obscure for very long now is it ask me another said zek with another shrug but from what we know of the dweller he certainly seems to have access to our world and if he doesnt use the perchorsk gate which gate does he use exactly after a little while jazz said weve covered a lot of ground so now before i get too confused lets go on to something else like why karen set me free if you dont mind very well it was like this i dont know how long i stayed in the lady karens aerie time seems suspended in such places numbed by horror not interminably lengthened however because so much of ones time is spent asleep exhausted to live in such a place drains a person physically and mentally menace seems to lurk even where there is none nerves stretch to breaking massive as even the smallest room is still the feeling is claustrophobic silent for hours then ringing with the laughter of the wamphyri or perhaps reverberating with screams of direst agony an aerie is like satans antechamber and yet the lady karen became my friend or as much a friend as any human being could ever hope to find in a vampire perhaps thats not so hard to understand she had been a simple traveller girl she remembered her previous life knew the horror of her present circumstances foresaw a future more monstrous yet she had been a striking beauty in her tribe and i myself was not without good looks she found a kinship with me read in my predicament echoes of her own also she knew her vampire must soon take ascendancy when it didher actions would no longer be entirely her actions if she hadnt been female if this aerie had been that of one of the lords then things would have been very different i wouldnt have been here telling the story now can you imagine what it means to be loved physically loved by one of the wamphyri love in the spiritual meaning of the word isnt part of their language but in the physical when a vampire takes a woman for his pleasure jazz not for food but for sex pure and simple well it cannot be pure and it is never simple the things lovers donothing is forbidden between a woman and a man in love but between a vampire and a woman or between a female vampire and a man they are powerful creatures you have heard that old saying a fate worse than death ridiculous for what could be worse than death but there im sure i dont have to describe it but karen was entirely woman and her female elements were emphasized by her parasite there was nothing of the lesbian in her not yet anyway though god only knows what she would be like later so i dont suppose the thought of me as a sexual diversion even occurred to her not for herself anyway but her lieutenants they wanted me oh they had their own women stolen traveller girls but they were dark and i was fair my colours were so rare as to be almost unheard of and i was a helllander better still i could steal thoughts now the true wamphyri born of a vampire egg has a degree of telepathy but their lesser creatures do not not unless such is deliberately bred into them or gifted to them by their masters and so all in all i would make a highly desirable property karen feared that when the vampire in her was fully mature then shed lose what small degree of compassion remained in her following which my future would become that much more unreliable my unspeakable fate that much more certain she did not want that for me one day she said to me zekintha there is something you can do for me when it is done if it is done well then i shall take you to sunside and leave you there for the travellers to find i see no reason why you should become what i have become what i am still to become you offer me a way out of this place i answered only tell me what i have to do theres a truce she said the wamphyri have called a meeting all the lords shall gather in one place under their many banners to see if they can find common ground in a certain cause now can you guess where theyll gather here indeed in the aerie of karen that in itself that they wish to hold their talks here seems to me a highly suspicious thing a very inauspicious thing however i shall make provisions now what are your thoughts so far i know only what you have told me of these lords lady i answered which is to say that i fear them greatly i think that if you let the lords shaithis lesk lascula and the others into your castle then youll lose it of all the stacks this one of yours holds a prime position karen and they covet it they know too that you have me here and that i have magic i am therefore desirable your warrior creatures would pass down to him who killed you and they are the finest warriors of all for none could make warriors like dramal doombody these are your own words which i repeat to you but if your castle and your beasts and i myself am desirable you are more desirable still karen they would make fine sport with you with both of us before making an end of it but you are wamphyri you would last so much longer than me and suffer so much more are you finished for now normally i would agree with you in everything youve said but there are always two ways of looking at things for instance perhaps there is nothing inimical in this not immediately anyway at least admit this that if the lords are to meet then they need neutral ground on which to do it even if it is only to agree to disagree this would be the ideal spot for they dont consider me their equal i am merely renting them a room also i said i would make conditions by which i meant that i will take precautions against treachery one they must come alone without their lieutenants that shall be the first proviso two no gauntlets what i was amazed but lady will they heed you i mean you really intend to order them to leave their battlegauntlets behind for their own protection she smiled her halfhuman smile so that they will not be tempted to brawl among themselves if their talks get heated sono gauntlets or no admittance oh theyll agree for theyre eager to get this thing underway and finally three the meeting shall be right here in these chambers this very hall with one of my own warrior creatures in each corner stalemate if they attempt anyact against me then my creatures will attack remember zekintha that for all his strength and his powers a vampire is only flesh and blood he will die in the right circumstances under the correct conditions and melting in the stomachacids of a warrior is one such condition on the other hand the lords will know that if i call upon my creatures without provocation then they shall have the right to deal with me in their way a stave through my body decapitation a bath full of blazing oil as i said stalemate now what do you say i still find it fraught so do i but its done and i may even profit from it now look there through a window the mountains were blackly silhouetted where a fan of golden sunlight faded behind them in the southern sky sundown i said soon aye soon she echoed me when theres a pink rim all along those peaks then they stir mount their beasts glide from stack to stack they land in the launching levels below proceed on foot upward through the body of the stack one at a time they shall come my table shall bearunconventional dishes suckling wolf in pepper hearts of great bats floating in their blood but blackened by the use of herbs grassland game from sunside and weak mushroom ales from the trog caverns nothing to inflame their passions but what is your purpose lady i was curious terrified but curious i know you wish nothing to do with these lords i know that you arenot like them could you not refuse them outright is there no other place suitable for them to hold their meeting most of these men she answered thoughtfully have never before set foot in dramal doombodys aerie my aerie now i think shaithis was a visitor once or twice in dramals youth when they had something in common they used to hunt women together at sundown on sunside just the two of them not so much a friendship as a rivalry but for the others its an opportunity to see what ive got here i know that theyd use the visit to study my defences against some future invasion but if i turned down their request refused to offer them myhospitality that would only provoke them unite them against me you said you might even profit from their coming i reminded her in what way profit ah yes and thats where you come in she answered we wamphyri have powers zekintha you are not alone i too have the ability to steal the thoughts of others it is of course a talent of my vampire transferring to me as yet however the art is undeveloped dubious at best i cant always be sure that i read aright and over any great distance it is not worth the effort also because i am wamphyri they would know if i probed too deeply our vampire minds are similar do you see but you are not wamphyri you want me to listen to their thoughts and if they should discover me they will expect to discover you what profit in owning a thoughtstealer and letting her talent go to waste but the trick is this to sneak into their minds without them knowing with your guard up lest they read yours discover you mentally possibly but no real danger as ive said for theyd expect as much but they will not discover you physically for we shall hide you in a secure place and these are the things i shall desire to know their thoughts and plans concerning myself whether their meeting here is entirely genuine or simply a ploy to seek out my weaknesses their weaknesses their uncertainties if they have any look into each of their minds in turn and see what you can see except id caution you dont bother with lesk the glut his brain is addled his vampire is itself mad how may one discover truth in a mind as mercurial as that what he cannot make sense of his own thoughts not from one moment to the next but he has a strong aerie and his strength is prodigious else the others would have dealt with him long ago i shall do my best i told her but as yet you havent explained the point of this meeting what is it that brings them together like this the one they call thedwellerinhisgardeninthewest she answered they fear him him and his alchemies his magics and because they fear him they hate him he dares set up his home there in the western peaks midway between star and sunside without so much as a byyourleave he harbours travellers too and instructs them in his weird ways and any who dare go against himah but they have tales to tell and shall you too set yourself against this dweller i asked her she looked at me with those bloodhued eyes of hers we shall see what we shall see she said now go sleep rest your mind prepare yourself when it is time i shall come for you show you your hiding place do well and i shall keep my promise i wont fail you i told her and went off to my bedchamber but sleep was a long time in coming then it was sundown i started awake heard karens footsteps and she was hurrying come she said taking my hand that unnatural strength was in her fingers where they drew me up from my bed dress and quickly the first of them comes vampirized travellers slaves leeched to death and returned from that condition by reason of their converted physiologies their altered organs and functions had prepared the great hall the table had been laid and at one end had been placed the mighty bonethrone of dramal doombody raised up on a shallow platform it seemed to yawn down the great length of the table there said karen your hiding place within dramals great chair i might have protested but she foresaw it stilled my babble before it could pour out have done none shall sit upon the throne of dramal i do this to honour the leper lord my father and master whose egg is in me hah so they shall suppose anyway myself i take the great chair at the other end of the table between us they are trapped their thoughts at least too late now to make other arrangements ill brook no argument proceed with your part of our plan or get out and i mean get out if youre not with me youre against me find yourself new chambers within the aerie or escape from it if you can i shall not hinder you but i cant say as much for the others she knew i couldnt refuse her vampire was stirring in her aroused by her excitement useless indeed dangerous to try to dissuade her when she was like this i went to the bonethrone god what a monstrous chair that was it was a cartilage creatures lower jawbone as i have said perhaps five feet long the eyeteeth formed hand grips at the front so that the users arms would rest along the shining white cartilage ridges which in our jaws house our side or back teeth toward the rear of the jaw its sides rose up steeply to the hinge but of course the upper half was not there the flat steep slope at the back of the jaw formed the chairs backrest against which was normally set a massive redtasselled cushion at front and back the four corners knobs of cartilage protruded downward making perfectly symmetrical feet the whole piece had been intricately carved and arabesqued like an enormous ivory and like ivory it too had once known life of a sort entire it stood upon its own small stage beneath which was my hiding hole i must crawl in from behind where once had been the trachea then sit up inside in there i found a large cushion i could sit there as in a canoe upright with my head and shoulders protruding through into the cavity under the jaw and look out through the arabesques so artfully cut in the bone the great red cushion would not obstruct my view for karen had had it removed so that i could view at will every face at the table its far easier to know a mans thoughts when you can see his face and so they began to arrive as they came i read their names in karens mind they communicated briefly mentally in the fashion of the wamphyri exchanging names and boasts first was grigis the least of the wamphyri lords he made out it was a matter of priorities but plainly he had been sent to test the way grigis is here he sent as he appeared from the stairwell the wamphyri honour me lady as you see my stature is such that i am firstchosen to enter your aerie alas i see warriors there all about the room what is this for a greeting for your protection grigis she told him and for mine when heads as great as ours meet they might clash but for now consider the warriors as decoration a symbol of wamphyri power they have no instructions while we and the other lords are still they shall be still and now welcome to my manse you have entered of your own free will and i freely welcome you be seated the others are not far behind grigis strode to a window leaned out and made a sign it was dark of course but that is nothing to the wamphyri i read in karens mind how a second flyer warily circling at once turned inward and sped for the launching levels then grigis took his seat on one side of the table and well away from the bonethrone grigis was of course true wamphyri and awesome in aspect but he was nothing special among the lords pointless to describe him further so the arrivals proceeded many lesser lights but here and there a power among them menor maimbite was one such his blazon was a splintered skull between a pair of grinding jaws allegedly immune to kneblasch and silver menor was known on occasions like this to carry a small pepperbox of these poisons with which to flavour his food his head and the gape of his jaws were enormous even for a lord but after a dozen of them were in welcomed seated and while they fidgeted and muttered low among themselves then the mightiest of them began to show fess ferenc who stood eight and a half feet tall and needed no gauntlet for his hands were talons belath whose eyes were ever slitted set in a fleshless face never known to smile whose mind was cloudy and cloaked and totally unreadable volse pinescu who deliberately fostered running sores and festoons of boils all over his face and body so that his aspect would be that much more monstrous and lesk the glut who it was legended in an attack of his madness commanded one of his own warriors to fight him to the death the story went that hed got under the things scales where it couldnt reach him eaten his way into its brain and so crippled it but as lesk left its skull through a nostril so in a convulsion the beast had snapped at him he lost an eye and half of his face where now he wore a huge leather patch stitched to his jaw and temple but to replace the missing eye he had grown one on his left shoulder which he kept bare wearing his cloak thrown over the right lesk took a seat on the left right next to my hiding place in the bonethrone which caused me to tremble violently but i managed to control it next to last came lascula longtooth who had so refined and concentrated his metamorphic powers that he could lengthen his jaws and teeth at will on the spur of the moment which he was wont to do habitually like a man scratching his chin and last of all was shaithis whose stack was a fortress impenetrable whose legends were such as needed no embroidery of them all he might appear one of the least imposing but his mind was ice and every move he made had made or would ever make was calculated to an inch the wamphyri might not greatly respect each other but every one of them respected shaithis i had wondered at karens dress or lack of it if id been in her position unwilling hostess to these monsters i would certainly have buried myself in clothing even in armour she wore a sheath of a gown it was of a white material so fine and clinging that every ripple of her flesh was visible her left breast and she had beautiful breasts was bare her right buttock too or very nearly with no undergarments the effect was shattering but as the lords had arrived so her purpose became clear instead of casting about with their eyes and minds all thoughts had immediately centred on karen remember these had been men before they were wamphyri their lusts however magnified were the lusts of men all of them at first sight lusted after karen which kept their minds from more devious work ill not mention the things i read in their vampireridden minds as for lesk the glut i refuse to even dwell upon what i read in his and so they were assembled and so after some small preamble and after trying the food shed had prepared for them then the talks commenced the end of zeks story trouble at sanctuary rock events at perchorsk by now the dome of the sanctuary rock had risen up to a towering two hundred feet or more it was a light patchy ochre an enormous sandstone pebble lying on its side protruding from a hillside that rose through pines oaks bramble and blackthorn above the belt of trees was narrow dark now rising steeply to cliffs and mountainside below the forest spread downward into a thin rising mist levelled out where the foothills met the plain disappeared in milky distance a faint light came from the south like a false dawn it wasnt dawn however but sundown looking up at the rock as they followed flowing contours to its flank jazz asked zek have you been here before no but ive been told about it she answered its wormy as some vast blue cheese left forgotten on a shelf there are tunnels and caves right through it enough room for lardiss entire tribe and twice as many travellers again you could hide a small army in there they paused fifty yards from the boulders base where the hillside fell away and a great cave opened watched the stream of travellers entering taking travois caravans wolves and all with them in a little while orange lights became flickeringly visible in window holes higher up where lamps or torches were lighted and still jazz and zek stood there in the gathering gloom lardis came looking for them said give them a little longer to settle in and choose their places then ill meet you in there he pointed just inside the main entrance which we call the hall but if you like your air fresh best get your share of it now it gets smoky later by the time you see sunup again youll be ready to barter your eyes for one good deep breath of clean mountain air he took up the handles of jazzs travois here ill take this the rest of the way wait said jazz he dipped into an easily accessible bundle came out with two full magazines for his gun just in case he said lardis made no comment went off toward the cavern entrance where now moving lights flickered here and there lardis is right zek said theyll take some time to get themselves settled in and the place fortified lets climb up behind the rock we might still be able to see the rim of the sun from up there i dont like it when the sun goes down are you sure youre not just putting something off jazz answered zek ill not hold you to any promises i mean i know youre right this isnt our world and so were drawn together she linked arms with him actually she tossed back her hair i think id be drawn to you in any world no its just a feeling thats all those caves look totally uninviting to me see even wolf would prefer to stay out here with us the great wolf padded along behind them where they climbed through trees along the steeply sloping base of the rock for fifteen minutes they climbed until jazz said far enough i think itll take us just as long to get down again this rocks bigger than it looks come sunup then maybe well climb it to the top they found a ledge in the rock and sat there close together jazz with his arm around her she leaned back against the coarse sandstone and toward him sighed tiredly why do they call you jazz because my middle name is jason he said and i hate it dont make any cracks about the golden fleece for gods sake jason is a hero of my homeland she told him i wouldnt joke about him wolf whined a little where he sat at their feet looking up at them zek snuggled closer conscious of her warmth and of her shape against him jazz said zek finish your story it sounded abrupt but he knew it wouldnt do to get caught up in something he couldnt control not now up here with night settling fast what she said her tone surprised thenperhaps she sensed or read his thoughts oh that it was almost finished anyway butwhere was i a little angry with himself angry with everything jazz reminded her ill make it short zek said her voice a little cooler now then we can get on back down the wamphyri lords were there in karens aerie to talk about the dweller but karen had been right it wasnt only the dweller that concerned them they wanted karens stack shaithis wanted me too for my magic god knows for what else the rest of the bunch would dice for karen the winner would put her to whatever use afterwardsshe would be burned they feared that her vampire was a mother if it was and if she should vampirize her entire aerie give all of her lieutenants eggs and others to freshly selected stolen travellers why then with all of her children in thrall to her thered be no stopping her she had to go before things went that far as for her aerie fess ferenc volse pinescu and one of the lesser lords were of a mind to produce their own eggs with karen out of the way they would do so their progeny would fight it out and the winner become lord of karens aerie the losers would remain in thrall to their masters until new opportunities presented themselves wamphyri children in thrall by the way dont have an easy time of it theres nothing a lord enjoys more than using his own child male or female for his own satisfaction the blood of ones own kin especially of the vampire in him is the greatest delicacy of all if dramal doombody hadnt been done for karens life would have been an unending nightmare the deed itself the taking of karen and her properties that was to come before her vampire reached full maturity and took ascendancy patently it was a slow developer but the lords knew from their history and legends that ladies were hard to get rid of once they achieved full flower the female of the species so to speak soshe would be invited to join with the wamphyri lords in their attack upon the dweller her forces would be used as cannonfodder when the battle was over and without pause her depleted units would be crushed in their turn wiped out and karen herself taken if she refused to join in the attack on the dweller that would be seen as a rebuke an insult it would warrant a fullscale subsequent attack on her stack but it was hoped she would join in for if her aerie could be taken intact undamaged simply walked into so much the better all of this i got in bits and pieces from the minds of shaithis volse menor maimbite and one or two others i dared not stay with any mind too long in case they should become aware of me but karen had been quite right in protecting themselves against her probing they had left themselves wide open to me i can tell you now jazz that there are many hells and if one of them is that place we were told about as children where if were not careful we go for our sins then be sure that the others are the minds of wamphyri lords theres little enough to distinguish between them anyway finally the meeting was over and shaithis stood and made a closing speech as best i can remember it went like this lords and lady with one exception the exception of one vote that of ourcharming hostess who will she assures us give the matter her most earnest consideration we are all agreed on a punitive expedition against the dweller the hour of that effort against our great and mutual enemy is still to be set but until it is decided all are to stand forewarned and prepared we all have valid reasons to wish to be rid of him apart from the fact that he has set up house in our territory i take it we are agreed that the mountains are ours very well apart from that fact and that he gives succor to travellers who are our traditional prey some of us have more personal grievances some hundred sundowns past lesk sent one of his men to parley with the dweller only to parley mind you as we have heard from the lips of lesk himself most lucid of lords the man did not return angered lesk sent a warrior to test the dwellers mettle the dweller contrived to trap rays of the recently sunken sun in mirrors with which he burned lesks warrior to a crisp lesk whose reasoning occasionally differs from that of er less sensitive minds sent a second warrior but not directly against the dweller for lesk had determined that the dweller was a helllander sent here to spy on us and provoke us perhaps preparing the way for largescale invasion the idea became obsessive that is he was convinced of its logic especially so considering that immediately after lesks initial attacks upon the dweller the gate to the helllands was seen to rise up into the very mouth of its crater surely as preamble to the feared attack and so he sent the second warrior directly into the helllands through the gate to let any wouldbe invaders see for themselves something of the might of the wamphyri needless to say the second warrior did not return but then no one ever has volse pinescu having heard of lesks losses determined a more subtle approach he activated and armed a hundred trogs to send against the dwellers garden they were to sack burn rape any women to the death and murder any men they were raw these trogs with nothing of the wamphyri in them which is to say that while they did not much care for the sun still its rays would not harm them the dwellers vile mirrors would not avail him here butthey too failed to return apparently they were suborned the dweller found caves in which to house them placed them under his protection grigis of grigis being the son of the muchfabled grigis the gouge thought to enrich his struggling stack with the dwellers wealth perhaps even to steal his entire garden which commands a lofty view as we are all aware or maybe grigis thought to do something more than this for if he could gain some understanding of the dwellers magic and his cursed machines then his own currently er middling station his circumstances let us say would be that much more improved and enhanced indeed with the dwellers weapons at his command the lord grigis might even lord it over all of us but of course we can be certain that this was not his intention alas he lost three fine warriors one hundred and fifty trogs and travellers two lieutenants his stack is now inadequate to his needs let us be honest at least with ourselves if not for the menace posed by the dweller one of us by now might well have found the resources to diminish grigiss lot further yet my own interest is easy to explain it is interest pure and simple curiosity i desire to know who this dweller is wamphyri a new breed born of the swamps perhaps if so how came he by his knowledge of weapons machines foul magic what does he there in his garden and why are we scorned and so rudely ignored this then is the plan we watch the dweller nothing more simply that for now covertly in the darkness of sundown however many sundowns are required we watch him how through the eyes of our familiar creatures through bats great and small from below in stealth where trogs shall crouch in shadows and observe from above even so high as they may glide where our flyers may relay his every move in our very minds with which unceasingly we will spy upon him the extent of his garden dwellers therein other than he himself the locations of his mirrors weapons the numbers of his retainers until we know as much of him as is required and when we know all of these things and can concert our attack accordingly then you strike this last from karen and all eyes turning her way where she sat at the head of the long table facing the bonethrone shaithis eyed her leeringly then we strike lady surely unless youve already made up your mind not to be with us but she merely smiled at him saying fear not lord shaithis for i shall be there a sigh went up all were in accord and the lady neatly netted so it appeared then they took their leave shaithis and lascula being first away then lesk volse belath fess menor and all the rest and lastly grigis the reverse order in which theyd arrived leaving their least till last and when karen called me out of my hiding place to attend her by a window the sky was acrawl with them they circled outwards dark clouds of illomen in the lesser darkness each swooping back to his own place returning to his personal hell i turned to her lady you may not go with them against the dweller and i told her all i had read in their minds she smiled a strange sad knowing smile but did you not hear me i said i shall be there but be still why i could swear you actually care for me aye and perhaps i care for you so make ready what weapons you desire to take with you if you need something ask for it make provision of whatever i have to offer now i rest me when i awake before sunup then i keep my promise and she did she went with me for my safe conduct we had a flyer each she flew us direct over the mountains and down onto sunside and with the new sun rising she bade me farewell and raced her beasts home again that was the last time i saw her watching her flyer out of sight i couldnt help but feel sorry for her some time later lardis and his travellers found me and now ive told you everything in a little while jazz said there are a couple of other things id intended asking you one of them was about that warrior creature which caused all the destruction at perchorsk well youve answered that it was lesks creature but there are other things the great bat the wolf the thing in the tank zek shrugged maybe the bat and wolf got through accidentally blinded by the light the bat flew into the sphere like us it was guided one way through the gate similarly the wolf which was old nearly blind as for the thing in the tank it was a vampire as coincidence would have it it numbered among its ancestors both a wolf and a bat in its metamorphic state it was likely to take on characteristics of both the slug characteristics are typical of its swamp origin maybe it entered the gate looking for prey i dont know jazz blinked tired eyes said too deep for me i begin to halfunderstand but then i bog down i suppose im just weary one last thing what about the others from perchorsk the men who came through before you i wasnt told about them she grimaced khuv the lying dog didnt mention them but i did learn about them from karen belath took the first of them mutated hes now one of belaths warriors the other was a man called kopeler i used to know him ernst kopeler yes jazz said an esper zek nodded he could read the future when he came through the gate shaithiss familiar bats saw him shaithis took him but before he could make use of him kopeler shot himself dead if id been able to read the future maybe id have done the same jazz nodded his agreement said its time we got on down ive still got a spot of weapontraining to do and after thati want you very much thats assuming i can still manage it of course he grinned but only for a moment wolf who had been still and silent for some time began to growl low and throatily his ears twitched nervously went flat to his head what zek stiffened looked startled and for the first time jazz noticed how quiet it had gone and the thickness of the mist where it rolled down from the mountains zek clutched at him her eyes suddenly flown wide what is it he husked jazz she whispered oh jazz she halfclosed her eyes put a slim hand to her forehead thoughts she said whose thoughts gooseflesh rose on his spine his forearms theirs panicked shouts came echoing up to them shockingly an explosion tore the night one of jazzs grenades left with lardis a weird bestial roaring commenced a primal sound what the hell jazz lifted zek down from their niche in the rock turned from her to begin making the descent no jazz she cried then clapped a hand to her mouth and oh be quiet she whispered more explosions followed hideous screaming then shouting in blunt commanding tones following which all was a tumult of sounds battle sounds and desperate they were waiting for us zek hissed shaithis his lieutenants a warrior hidden away in the deepest recesses of the rock and there are other warriors out here something huge launched itself from a position higher than their own it throbbed in the thin mist that curled over the treetops a dark shape speeding down the sky trailing appendages which tore through the higher branches of the trees almost directly overhead it too began to roar jazz took his smg from behind his back automatically loaded up we have to help he said no i have to help you stay here dont you understand she clutched at him stopped him before he could get started its all over you cant help that was a warrior one of several if you had a tank and crew you still couldnt help as she spoke there came a last booming explosion and dull orange fire blazed momentarily through the screen of trees and mist there sounded a fresh bout of screaming human screaming nerveshattering from many terrified throats then through a barrage of lesser shouts and yelps shaithiss booming voice reaching up through drifting corditestink and mist find them find lardis and the helllanders as for the rest destroy them all but dont let the warriors glut themselves i have been hurt and now i take my vengeance now it is my turn to inflict pain now find the ones i want and bring them to me so much for lardiss defences jazz groaned he was ambushed zek sobbed his people didnt stand a chance come on we have to get out of here torn two ways jazz ground his teeth turned his head this way and that please jazz zek dragged at him we have to save our own lives if we can they couldnt go down so they started up but before they could take more than two paces there came a hoarse panting from below a scrabbling amidst the shrubbery whitefaced jazz and zek shrank back into the shadow of the rock stared at each other a figure came reeling up through the trees clawing at the base of the rock thrusting itself from bole to bole in zeks ear jazz whispered a traveller her face strained in concentration the panting was louder frightened almost a sobbing jazz thought it has to be a traveller he let the stumbling figure come closer reached out from cover and grabbed him at the same time he heard zeks hiss of warning no jazz its karl vyotsky vyotsky seizing his one chance to make a break for it or perhaps simply fleeing from the horror of what was happening below the two men recognized each other in the same moment their eyes bulged vyotskys mouth flew open in a gasp of complete astonishment he started to bring up his gun drew breath for a mighty shout which went unuttered jazz clubbed him in the throat with the butt of his smg tried to kick him and missed slammed a blow to his face vyotskys head rocked on his shoulders he went crashing backwards offbalance probably unconscious into brambles and mistdamp shrubbery the ground mist rolled over him as he went sliding out of sight jazz and zek listened with bated breath their hearts pounding they heard only the hoarse unending screams from below a gigantic snuffling and bellowing loud crunching sounds and in another moment they started in again to climb they forced aching muscles to the limits of effort drew level with the dome of the rock and climbed above it ran waistdeep through clinging mist and tearing undergrowth where the ground levelled out a little then they were climbing again still not daring to pant too loudly hearts and lungs straining as they forced weary legs to pump and tired arms to drag them through the foliage but the sounds from below were gradually fading and trees and mist both were thinning out a vampire mist zek gasped they cause it to happen dont ask me how i should have known should have heard them in my head but they knew about me and were shielding themselves wolf knew i think oh where is he she neednt have worried the animal hounded her heels like a faithful dog save your breath jazz growled climb but i might have heard them might have given a warning if i wasnt so tired and if if your mind hadnt been on other things youre only human zek dont blame yourself or if you must blame someone blame me jazz dragged her up onto a shalecovered ledge in a slippery rockface they had come through the treeline to the cliffs the feet of the very mountains themselves clear of the mist they could see a fading orange glow far to the south it was the sun and it was down sundown and nowhere was safe now but at least in the clean light of the stars they could see where they were going the ledge was wide but sloped outwards a little it ran crookedly steeply upwards echoing cries still rang from far below where the mist boiled as before fewer screams now mainly the signal calls of monstrous searchers and the answers of their fellows then zek gave a massive start drew air in a plainly audible gasp of terror vyotsky hes coming she said hes following us and shaithis himself is not far behind him keep still jazz grabbed her shhh they listened watched down below at the edge of the treeline the mist parted and vyotsky came into view he looked left and right but not up started toward the base of the cliffs perhaps he thought theyd skirted the cliffs and maybe they should have but at least on the ledge no one was going to surprise them jazz aimed his smg scowled and lowered it cant be sure of hitting him he whispered these things are for closequarters fighting street fighting also the shot would be heard again the mists parted and the awesome cloaked figure of shaithis flowed out of them he looked neither left nor right but inclined his head back to stare directly at the fugitives his eyes glowed like small fires under the stars there they are the vampire lord shouted pointed on the ledge under the cliff get after them karl and if youd be my man dont let me down as shaithis glided forward vyotsky passed out of sight into the angles of the cliff face jazz and zek heard shale sliding vyotskys surprised yelp and his cursing he was on the ledge and had discovered how slippery it was move said jazz quick climb and pray this ledge goes somewhere anywhere but if zek did pray then her prayers werent answered where the cliff was notched and bent back sharply on itself the ledge narrowed to an uneven eighteen inches in the v of the notch a chimney of rock had weathered free leaning outward over dizzy heights behind the chimney scree had gathered forming the floor of a cave the stars gleamed down on the ledge but in the deeps of the cave all was inky blackness shaithis too was on the ledge now his commands came echoing karl i want them alive the woman for what she may be able to do for me the man for what he has already done to me edging along the ledge toward the chimney and the cave behind it jazz asked zek why hasnt shaithis called up more help probably because hes sure he doesnt need it she groaned even as she spoke a knob of rock crumbled underfoot where she stepped causing her feet to slip her legs and lower body shot sideways out over empty space jazz let his weapon swing from its sling grabbed zeks flying hand he dropped to one knee raked the cliff with his free hand to find a hold his fingers contacted grasped a tough root in the instant before the girls weight fell on him zek was dangling now one elbow hooked over the rim of the ledge the rest of her kicking and swinging only jazzs grip on her offered any stability at all oh god she sobbed oh my god drag yourself up jazz groaned through gritted teeth try not to put too much leverage on me use your elbows squirm for christs sake she did as he said came slithering up onto the ledge in front of him he grabbed her belt hauled her unceremoniously against the face of the cliff now go on all fours he said dont try to stand up or youll be over again if we can just make that chimney oh and then what but he refused to think about that finally zek crawled onto the scree beneath the overhang collapsed facedown there and spreadeagled herself dug her fingers deep into loose rock fragments and hung on jazz stooped caught her under the arm and drew her upright we have to get under cover he said otherwise chching came that unmistakable sound from behind them jazz halfturned vyotsky had appeared round the sharp corner his cruel lips drew back from his teeth as he linedup his smg on the pair he pursued but from behind him alive karl do you hear shaithiss voice warned that much closer now vyotskys eyes went wide with fear he glanced back jazz took the opportunity to swing his own weapon in vyotskys direction squeezed the trigger to hell with keeping quiet the gun chattered and whining bullets chewed at the cliff like metal wasps hurling chippings in vyotskys face instinctively he fired back and a lucky round snatched jazzs gun from his hands sent it spinning out over the abyss as the sling was yanked from his shoulder only the chimney of rock stopped him from being drawn after it zek clutched at jazz and they clung together and step over here said a cool low voice from the shadows a figure was there in the cave under the overhang tall slim cloaked male he wore an impassive golden mask over his face starlight gleamed on the gold jazz was struck with the thought that he looked like the phantom of the opera who he gasped quickly said the newcomer if you want to live stand still vyotsky shouted but jazz and zek were already moving to obey the stranger as they stepped toward the cave so he came out to meet them vyotsky saw him because of his cloak at first the russian mistook him for one of shaithiss lieutenants the stranger held out an urgent hand to the pair held up his cloak almost as if to shield them he drew them toward him so much vyotsky saw but in the next momentthe big russian blinked used his free hand to rub furiously at his eyes theyd gone all three gone but he hadnt seen them step back into the cave a huge hand fell on vyotskys shoulder and he froze shaithiss monstrous voice hissed in his ear where are they did your weapon strike them i hope for your sake it did not vyotsky didnt look back simply continued to gape at the empty ledge ahead well shaithiss fingers dug into vyotskys shoulder i didnt hit them no the russian gulped shook his head there was someone else a man in a cloak and a mask he cameand he took them took them a man in a cloak and shaithiss breath was hot on vyotskys neck a mask of gold perhaps now vyotsky looked at him and at once shrank back cringing from the horror of his face whywhy yes he came and he went and they went with him ahhh shaithis hissed the dweller his fingers were like the jaws of a steel clamp crushing vyotskys shoulder for a moment the russian thought he intended to hurl him down from the ledge itit wasnt my fault he gibbered i found them followed them maybe they slipped into the cave there maybe all three of them are there shaithis sniffed the air his blunt snout quivering no he finally said nothing no one you failed me but shaithis released him i wont kill you karl your spirit is puny but your flesh is strong and there are uses to which good strong flesh can be put in the aerie of shaithis of the wamphyri he turned away now follow me down and be warned do not try to run away for if you do that a second time it will make me very very angry i would give you to my favourite warrior all except your quivering heart which i would eat myself vyotsky watched him commence the descent gritted his teeth and slowly lifted the barrel of his gun without looking back shaithis said yes by all means do karl and we shall see which one of us is caused the most pain the russians tense expression slowly slackened relaxed how could you fight beings like these what hope did any man have of ever defeating or even damaging something like lord shaithis he let out his pent breath gulped put his weapon on safe and followed timidly on behind the other where he made his way down from the ledge below in the woods a great wolf howled piteously zeks wolf who knew that his mistress was now removed from him and gone far away he lifted his head and howled again the cry rippling from his taut throat then he sniffed the air and looked north and a little west across the mountains she was there yes that was the way he must go grey as the night wolf began to climb through the trees two figures passed him going down he curled his upper lip back writhing from his carnivore teeth but he made no sound they passed out of sight into the misty woods wolf let them go and continued on his way the siren call of his mistress was strong in his mind it was noon at perchorsk but in the metal and plastic bowels of that place it could be midnight and nothing would be changed one change at least was occurring however and direktor luchov and chingiz khuv were watching as a team of workmen fitted pipes high in the wall of the perimeter corridor the pipes were maybe seventy millimeters in diameter made of black plastic and might in other circumstances be conduits for heavyduty electrical cable but that was not their purpose a failsafe khuv said he looked flustered but i know nothing about this perhaps youd explain luchov looked at him tilted his head on one side a little you work here he shrugged and i have no reason to keep it from you i proposed this mechanism some time ago it is simplicity in itself and quite foolproof whats more its cheap and very quick and easy to install as you can see if you follow these pipes youll see that they go straight back to the loading bays inside the main doors there youll find a fifteenthousandlitre container on the back of a truck the truck is locked in position with its brakes on rotor arm removed that too is a failsafe the pipes connect directly to the truck and theyre being laid throughout the projekt khuvs frown grew deeper ive seen the truck he said its a military supply vehicle carrying chemical fuel for flamethrowers are you telling me that these pipes will carry that stuff but its highly corrosive man it would eat through this plastic in a matter of minutes luchov shrugged by which time it wouldnt matter anyway he said a failsafe only has to work once major and thats the beauty of this one gravity fed fifteen thousand litres of highly combustible fuel will rush downward through these pipes and circulate right through the projekt in less than three minutes as it courses along its way there are sprinklers they will spray the fuel under pressure into every corner its fumes are heavy but theyll spread very rapidly the projekt has laboratories boiler rooms electrical fires workshops a thousand naked flames of one sort or another he shrugged again but im sure you can see what im getting at we can sum it up in one very descriptive word inferno a short distance away vasily agursky had paused to listen khuv had noticed him and now he deliberately stared at him still looking at agursky khuv said i take it this information is not sensitive if it is you should know we are being eavesdropped sensitive luchov glanced along the corridor saw agursky ah but it is sensitive yes everyone who works here in the projekt will soon be aware exactly how sensitive it is it would be criminally irresponsible for anyone to try to keep it a secret there will be notices posted everywhere explaining the system in great detail this is not a matter for the kgb major but for humanity it is not your sort of security but mine and my superiors and your superiors agursky came closer joined khuv and luchov if this system is ever used he said in a strange emotionless voice the projekt would be destroyed utterly correct vasily luchov turned to him that is its purpose but it will only be used if another horror like encounter one should ever escape from the gate agursky nodded of course for fire destroys them its the only way we can be sure that nothing like that ever gets out into the world again more than that said luchov its the only way we can be certain that this place never becomes the focal point of world war iii what khuv snapped luchov rounded on him oh and do you think the americans will sit still for a second of those nightmares launched from here into their airspace man you know as well as i do that they think were manufacturing them khuv drew air in a gasp became suspicious in a moment who have you been talking to viktor that sounded very much like something the british spy michael simmons once said to me i hope you havent been interfering in things which dont concern you i accept that this failsafe of yours is probably necessary but i will not accept anyone meddling in my work are you accusing me of something luchov kept his anger under control maybe i am khuvs tone was icy we still dont know where you disappeared to for three hours when that damned esper ran amok in here is that it has alec kyle been talking to you luchov scowled the veins in his seared skull pulsing ive told you i dont know what happened to me that night i suppose i was unconscious maybe it was an attempt to kidnap me bungled as it turns out as for this alec kyle ive not only never met him ive never even heard of him which was true enough for the man hed spoken to was called harry keogh agursky had turned away leaving them to their argument khuv watched him go staring hard after his departing whitesmocked figure was there something wrong with the peculiar little scientist ornot wrong but different somethingdifferent about him arent you interested how its triggered luchov asked still glaring eh oh yes very interested id also like to know if theres a failsafe for your failsafe khuvs attention was back on the projekt direktor this place houses some hundred and eighty scientists technicians soldiers at any given time of the day and night and it contains many millions of roubles worth of equipment if there was an accident oh therell be no accident luchov shook his head if its ever used it will be a very deliberate act i assure you let me tell you how it works theres empty accommodation close to mine that becomes the failsafe control centre with access only to the officer on duty and round the clock access to myself oh and yourself too i suppose since youll probably insist upon it however i shall expect you to make your name available for the duty roster as mine will be control centre said khuv and what will this control centre contain a closed circuit tv monitor panel with three screens one will watch the gate and the others the stairwell through the shaft and the exit from it into the projekt proper there will be evacuation alert klaxons too though i admit a man will have to be pretty nimble to get out once they start sounding as for the failsafe mechanism two buttons and a heavy electrical switch button one will sound the evacuation alert in the upper levels the very moment that the duty officer sees anything come through the gate button two will only be used if the creature is of that sort and if the electrical fence flamethrowers and katushevs dont stop it the button will control subordinate machinery the alarms will sound more urgently and steel doors will close in the ventilator shafts if and when the creature passes from the core area through the magmass levels and into the complex itselfthen the switch is thrown this cannot be done accidentally or until the two buttons have been pressed the switch of course opens the stopcocks on the tanker huh khuv grunted i note that your quarters and the control centre are not far removed from the loading bays and the main entrance your own quarters are similarly situated albeit on a different bearing luchov pointed out we would have equal chances so would anyone in that area including your kgb men and parapsychologists khuv grudgingly conceded that and you think its a wise move to tell everyone just exactly how this failsafe operates you dont think it will scare them witless i think it probably will luchov answered but i see no alternative in the event ofa disaster as many as possible should have the chance to live and where the military is concerned well they are the only ones who cant run when the alarms start sounding the katushev crews and the flamethrower squads and here im afraid i begin to sound too much like you for my own liking but at least they now have the ultimate incentive to stop any emergence from the sphere khuv pursed his lips made no reply and now that i have satisfied your curiosity luchov continued perhaps youd be so good as to tell me how your experiments are proceeding have you had any message from those poor bastards you hurled through the gate or have you simply written them off and what about your investigations into this intruder affair do you know how he got in what have you discovered about him khuv scowled turned on his heel and strode away over his shoulder he called back at this moment in time i have no information for you direktor but when i have all the answers and when they make sense then rest assured that you will be among the first to know of it he paused in his striding and looked back but you are not the only one who has been busy comrade and i have made certain recommendations of my own so far you have only considered an invasion from the other side but my imagination is more wideranging in a few days you will more fully comprehend my meaning with the arrival of a platoon of crack assault troops under my command before luchov could enquire further khuv had passed through a bulkhead door and so out of sight in his private quarters vasily agursky stared at himself in a mirror on his toilet wall he stared and had difficulty believing what he saw as yet no one else appeared to have noticed but then no one took a great deal of interest in him but agursky knew himself very well indeed and he also knew that what he saw in the mirror was more than the sum total of his parts of his parts his first reaction when hed noticed the early changes had been to distrust the mirror a distrust which had quickly turned to a strong dislike ridiculous for a man to dislike a mirror but it was true he did he disliked all mirrors probably because they reminded him of certain undeniable alterations which hed be only too happy to forget about the changes wereweird he wouldnt have believed them possible he had positioned this mirror on the wall himself so that his face would be exactly centered in the glass but now he had to bend his knees a little to get the same effect he had gained two or more full inches in height that fact should have delighted him who had always considered himself as being little more than a dwarf but instead it terrified him for he could actually feel the ability of his body to be tall and if the vampiric growth continued then someone would notice his hair too was undergoing something of a metamorphosis its dirtygrey down was darkening showing signs of a longdelayed virility and the halo was contracting toward the centre of his heads dome filling itself in no one had noticed that either but he supposed they must when finally the growth was complete why already he looked and felt years younger felt ready now foralmost anything and yet for a little while longer he must continue to play the part of the old vasily the old despised neglected and contemptuously treated vasily still gazing at himself agursky was surprised to feel a growl rising unbidden in his throat it came up soft purring from his chest then thickened to a snarl his lips curled back from his teeth from his strong white animal teeth whose canines had grown so as to interlock with each other more surely than they ever had in all his previous life and he snarled like a beast but he cut it off right there took a grip on himself for a moment thered been a power in him like none hed ever known before and knowing where it came from he knew too that he must control it as long as he could for at the perchorsk projekt they had this habit of burning things like vasily agursky finally he took off his thicklensed spectacles the old curved lenses were gone now removed from their frames and disposed of in their place flat discs of common glass which hed cut in the workshop eyepieces for my instruments as hed explained it no need now for aids to eyesight which had improved to an entirely incredible degree why he could even see in the dark but in connection with his eyes there was something else which might soon begin to show though what he could do about that was quite beyond him to imagine contact lenses by the time he could order and receive them it might well be too late in a way that frightened him too but in another wayit was fascinating slowly he reached out a hand to the cord of the lightswitch gave it a single sharp tug click and the light went out but in the mirror two lesser lights had taken its place agursky couldnt suppress the strange smile the wolfish grin which spread over his darklymirrored features then a smile in which the pupils of his eyes burned like tiny censers filled with hells own sulphur harry and friends the second gate harry had slept the clock round and toward the end he dreamed not knowing he dreamed it seemed to him that he had always existed in this timeless lightless limbo and that now someone called to him from far far away harry harry youre asleep harry keogh but the dead are awake theyve begged a boon of me me whom hitherto they shunned utterly and i have agreed to talk to you but when i sought you out i discovered only a sleeping mind jumbled memories and dreams and intricate mindpuzzles pictures of an existence beyond existence a strange thing your sleeping mind harry and not one with which i may readily converse so stir yourself faethor ferenczy offers his services faethor harry snapped awake sat bolt upright in his bed cold sweat drenched his brow slimed his trembling limbs a nightmare yes hed dreamed that faethor ferenczy called to him in his sleep a man shouldnt dream about creatures like faethor not even when they were dead and no longer capable of mischief a dream like that was the worst possible omen but a dream the glutinous faraway voice sounded again in harrys mobiusorientated mind a nightmare hardly flattering harry and faethors ancient deadundead mental chuckle came across all the miles between came unerringly tingling at the edges of harrys still sluggish perceptions but he was awake now and the thing was no longer nightmare but reality it was his business it was what a necroscope is all about and now that he knew it was real it was no longer frightening his limbs stopped shaking and he peered about the room the blinds were drawn but slices of light made faded bands on the wall opposite the windows an electric bedside clock said that the time was three in the afternoon faethor harry said the last time i spoke to you was at your old place under the moldavian alps at that time i got the impression id heard the last from you has something changed that anyway im still in your debt so if theres something what the others dark chuckle was sly now insinuating something you can do for me thats a fine macabre sense of humour you have there harry no theres nothing you can do for me but perhaps there is something can do for you didnt you hear what i said were you that deeply asleep i said that the teeming dead have begged my assistance and that i have agreed to help if i can eh the dead talking to you harry slowly shook his head in astonishment there must be something they want pretty badly aye but not for themselves harry for you theyve spoken to me of a quest your quest and asked for my guidance and in this theyve shown a deal more wisdom than you for who would know better the secret source of vampires than an exmember of the wamphyri himself eh harry gaped the source of vampires the place where they originated the world in which they were spawned to come through into this world as they had now started to come through the gate in perchorsk and do you know this secret source harry couldnt conceal the eagerness in his voice and thoughts did you yourself come from that place myself was i once an inhabitant of that world of vampire legend ah no harry but my grandfather was your grandfather do you know where he lies where his remains are buried buried old belos pheropzis alas no harry the romans crucified and burned him a hundred years before your christ and my father the last word i had of him was that he was lost at sea somewhere off the mouths of the danube in the black sea in the year he was a mercenary for the ostrogoths against justinian but of course he was on the wrong side ah we wamphyri were a fierce lot in our day there was a living to be made if youd the stomach for it then how can you help me harry was perplexed it seems to me that something like a thousand years separates your grandfathers era and yours whatever he knew about his origins about this source world must have died with him but there are legends harry there are memories stories old belos told his son waldemar which he in turn passed down to me they are as fresh now in my mind as they were the day i heard them i kept them fresh for they were the only wamphyri history i was ever likely to know i was still in thrall to my father at that time if thibor that ingrate had ever spent his apprenticeship with me then i would have passed the legends down to him but of course he never did now if you in your turn would learn these things which might well provide the clues you need to complete your quest then come to me in my place and talk to me as we talked once before faethors voice was faint now killed in a bombing raid in world war ii and burned to ashes what was left of him had seeped into the earth where once stood his house on the outskirts of ploiesti toward bucharest it must be an effort for one such as he to speak across all these miles after all this time on the other hand harry was well aware of the devious nature of the vampire of all vampires to his knowledge they rarely did anything which was not of benefit to themselves but there again in the past faethor had not been orthodox harry could never like or ever really trust him but he did in a way respect him no strings he said strings im a dead thing harry nothing remains of me but my voice and only you can hear it and the dead of course when they choose to listen even my voice is fading with the years but do as you will i am merely respecting the wishes of the dead harry would have to be satisfied with that ill come he told the other but as well as hungry for knowledge im plain hungry too give me an hour and ill be there take your time faethor answered ive plenty of it but do you remember the way his voice was dwindling now shrinking into deep distances of mind oh i remember it well enough then ill wait for you and then perhaps the great majority will see fit to leave me in peace harry washed and shaved had a change of clothes breakfasted and contacted ebranch he quickly told darcy clarke what hed done and what he was about to do clarke offered a cautionary take care and harry was ready he used the mobius continuum and went to ploiesti the scene was much the same as it had been eight years earlier faethors house on the outskirts of the town was one of several burnedout shells lying halfburied in heaps of overgrown rubble stony corpses in what was otherwise open countryside it was dark here around pm middle european time but there was still enough light for harry to find himself a tumbled wall and take a seat and he had remembered the way he could feel faethors presence lying like a shroud on the place albeit one which was slowly returning to dust a very faint nimbus of light glowed on the western horizon beyond the carpathians in the direction of home all around harry was desolation made worse by the feel of winter in the air he shivered but entirely because of the chill he could feel slowly working its way into his bones in summer this place would have a certain wild beauty when the old bomb craters would be masked by flowers and unchecked brambles and the skeletal walls covered with lush ivy in the winter however the snow would bring the perspective back to gaunt monochrome reality the devastation would be obvious incapable of disguise it would always be a reminder and that was probably why the romanians would never rebuild here one of the reasons anyway faethor agreed but i have always liked to believe that i was the main reason i dont want people building here since thibor destroyed my old place ive had several homes but this was the last of them this is where i am so to speak so now when people come nosing around and i feel their footfalls you sort of gloom over the place you exert an influence your aura youve noticed harry shivered again but still only from the cold how about your legends faethor he said i dont like to rush you but ive never yet spoken to one of your sort who told me anything in plain simple language and time is precious it could be that lives are at stake at stake an unfortunate choice of words do you mean human lives in that other world ah but they always have been i mean lives which are important to me you see i think people have found a way into that place that source world some of whom are or were very dear to me he sensed faethors nod for the fact is that people nod with their minds as well as their heads so have been informed er by the dead of course very well the legends wait said harry first tell me whats in this for you oh i know youve said there are no strings attached but still i cant imagine youll help me out of the goodness of your heart faethors chuckle grew into a laugh not a pleasant thing ah but you know us well harry keogh very well ill tell you my grandfather belos was exiled from his aerie his world his heritage by the wamphyri he had grown too strong they feared him mightily and when their chance came they tricked entrapped expelled him his lands and properties were stolen and he found himself here in this world he wasnt the first or the last and if things dont change there may well be others still to come now i never knew belos who was dead before waldemar passed on his egg to me but i do know that if he had not been so badly treated then i would now be one of the wamphyri in my rightful place in the source world when they expelled him they not only stole his heritage but denied waldemar his after him and also mine for that reason and despite the years flown in between belos is worth avenging youre going to help me find my way into that world for revenge harry frowned i dont intend to look anyone up for you faethor as i see it it will be a case of in rescue retreat i wont be staying there long enough to write off any old scores oh and you know all about this place youre searching for do you get in rescue your loved ones or whatever and get out again as simple as that something like that yes but harry was less certain now again faethors shrug wellpossibly but i see it differently for after all you are harry keogh and the fact is that in your use of your special talents you have been a dire force against vampires in this world youve dealt with my treacherous son thibor with boris dragosani yulian bodescu the list is impressive my feeling is that when you enter into the source world then things are almost bound to happen i believe that you are the catalyst which will change perhaps even destroy the old balance so all i require of you is this that if the time should come and someone should ask you who are ou you will answer him that belos sent you is that too much to ask no you have a deal harry agreed so now tell me what you know first about perchorsk eh never heard of it harry quickly explained that may well be one way into or out of the source world faethor answered but it is not the old route now listen this is what old belos told my father which he in turn told me the wamphyri sent him into the helllands through a shining white door in the shape of a sphere yes the very duplicate of this sphere youve mentioned at perchorsk but perchorsk is in the upper urals and beloss exitpoint was far removed from there so where did belos surface surface is the wrong word rather he descended inside the sphere he fell he was aware of falling as if into hell it was as if he plunged down the throat of a great white luminous shaft whose walls were so far distant he could not see them he fell and yet at no great speed or so he believed and he must have been correct in that belief for when he emerged he was still falling he fell out of the sphere the gate of entry into this world where harry was eager again underground like at perchorsk unlike perchorsk belos gathered his senses looked all around the sphere he had fallen through was embedded in the ceiling of a great horizontal borehole over a ledge of smooth dripstone through the bed of the bore rushed a black gurgling river belos knew not where it came from nor where it went all around the sphere where it hung suspended great holes were apparent in the ceiling like these magmass holes of yours at perchorsk likewise in the ledge where belos had landed the extent of the cave and its ledge was not great where the river rushed from cave into darkness the gap between ceiling and water came down to a few inches the ledge was large enough for a man to walk maybe ten paces this way ten paces that before it narrowed down and smoothed into the glistening wall of the bore there was no way out or there was if a man had the stomach for it a subterranean sump said harry exactly the river might run for miles it might never surface at all that was beloss predicament others had been there before him and some of them were still there he found their remains ossified things he called trogs and travellers even the skulls and mummified remains of wamphyri whod preferred to sit here on the ledge and wither rather than risk the unknown but beloss heart was bigger than that he dared the river harry was fascinated faethors shrug what else could he do first he tried to reenter the sphere of course but it rejected him when he held up his arms to plunge them into its light they were repelled the gate into the helllands had closed on him but to sit here with these others and stiffen into stone was not his way he would go now while he still had all of his great strength now harry i suppose you have heard this myth how vampires fear running water next to you said harry tm the worlds greatest expert on vampires or as much of one as youll find anyway youre going to tell me the myth stems from this underground river which the wamphyri had to overcome to make their way to the surface of this world right correct thibor had a different explanation faethor sighed thibor didnt know as ive explained he could have learned so much from me that one but not knowing he obviously invented an explanation devious as youve said ive said that of all of you harry reminded but youve sidetracked get back to the point very well but the underground river is the source of that particular myth a vampire is flesh and blood and bone harry immerse him in water long enough and he will die now let me get on belos braved the river was washed along downstream at times his head was above water but there were other desperate moments when the gap narrowed to nothing so that he was pushed under it seemed a long time before the ceiling receded before natural light returned glimmering at the end of the watercourse then came the resurgence into a basin which emptied itself into a sluggish river but this time as ive said on the surface bedraggled and a little battered coughing up the river water until he thought hed dislodge his lungs at last old belos was in this world the time the era was some three hundred years before your christ and the place yes harry could scarcely contain himself as the crow flies one hundred and seventy miles from the very spot where you now stand and indeed harry was on his feet where exactly he asked near radujevac on the dunarea faethor told him or on the banks of the danube as it might be better known to you thats where youll find this resurgence it is the source of the legend and the legend is the source of the wamphyri will you go there now at once now no harry shook his head tonight i plan i go there tomorrow he stood there in the darkness and sighed a weight off your shoulders harry perhaps or maybe its just one more burden have kept my part of the bargain and ill keep mine if the time should come meanwhile you have my thanks aye and those of the teeming dead hah talk about legends but your own legend is spreading harry and soon to spread much farther i think i bid you farewell harry beat his arms across his body loosening the stiffness in his joints and driving out the cold then goodbye faethor he said and as always the mobius continuum was waiting to welcome him harrys plans and preparations were the simplest of things easily carried out back at ebranch hq he told darcy clarke what he required and while the items were being assembled he brought clarke up to date and went a little deeper into detailing what the boss of ebranch already knew when hed finished clarke said lets get this right youre going to romania the danube in the vicinity of radujevac where youll travel upstream along the course of an underground river right thats right somewhere up there you expect to find a gate like the one at perchorsk except there wont be anyone wholl shoot you dead on sight there might well be people there said harry a handful maybe but they wont shoot at me they wont be able to if i know my business theyll welcome me they may even have valuable information for me clarke looked at him and thought dear god hes human but hes so bloody inhuman out loud quietly he said dead people right corpses yes maybe not even that maybe just memories of people now clarke shuddered long and visibly and violently he was remembering the bodescu affair a time when hed witnessed with his own eyes the unbelievable extent of harrys power over the dead or rather the result of their respect for him in fact it hadnt been harry who called up the dead that time but his son the then infant harry jnr but harry could do it too when he had the need finally clarke steadied himself and continued and having found this gate then youll use it to gowherever to another world the place where your wife and son are and presumably jazz simmons too harry nodded and zek foener and maybe one or two others if theyre still alive and you know i believe they are then i should have some friends there think but i may also have enemies at least one anyway a kgb thug called karl vyotsky but assuming everything works out ok then youll speak to brenda harry jnr and when thats done youll see who wants to come back with you something like that except i still dont know if theres a way back remember i know that nothing from this world has ever got back here and i know that nothing thats come here can ever go back there does that make sense anyway thats the way it is in short youre risking your life do you want it done or dont you i want it done yes in my own way im as curious as you are and the next thing i want is to see perchorsk closed down even if they dont make those things there still its a timebomb harry nodded i feel the same way about it but i have viktor luchovs word that nothing will ever escape from perchorsk again thats good enough for me clarke gave a snort harry your word is good enough for me any time but im just one small cog in a very big wheel i dont suppose that anyone is going to take preemptive or any other sort of action against perchorsk especially not now in this new climate of political understanding but if something else does escape he threw up his hands then it would be right out of your hands i know harry answered again clarkes snort right out of control is more like it he answered well and thats another reason for my going in harry was almost fatalistic about it to see if theres anything we can do about it which is maybe better done from the other side the two were silent a while then clarke said harry the rest of your gear will take a little time to get hold of but its being done its very late now and im overdue for my bed ill catch a couple of hours and be here to see you off in the morning before i go is there anything else i can do for you and what will you do with yourself for the rest of the night harry shrugged oh im not tired he said but i will try to get some sleep later its silly i know but id rather tackle that underground river during the daylight hours i mean i could go tonight but i dont fancy that silly whats silly about it because day or night will make no difference down there its pitch dark all the time its just that ill feel happier knowing its daylight outside but anyway before i do anything i have to speak to mobius again lost for words clarke shook his head harry always had this effect on him you know he finally said were both part of the same world you and i but when you talk like that so naturally matteroffactly about the dead and about these talents of yours the mobius continuum and what all the way you say im going to speak to mobius just like that jesus its like youre an alien or else its like im a small kid again i mean i know what you can do ive experienced it but still i sometimes doubt my own senses harry smiled open and honest and youre the boss of ebranch he said maybe youve got the wrong job darcy he waited until clarke had left before he went to see mobius in leipzig it was am and the graveyard was locked for the night but of course harry didnt go in through the gates but through a door went to see the man whod taught him to unlock all such doors harry my boy im glad youve come said mobius ive been doing some thinking about this conjectural parallel universe of yours it gets less conjectural all the time harry told him only its nature is conjectural now and he quickly brought the dead mathematician up to date fascinating said mobius and indeed it confirms my own thoughts on the matter well i have to admit it only baffles me said harry there is light at the end of the tunnel so to speak buti mean if there are two gates on this side why does there only appear to be one on the other only one what makes you say that faethor talked about a shining white door in the shape of a sphere one door if thered been two wouldnt old belos have mentioned the fact well whether he did or didnt there are two i assure you mobius sounded convinced two on this side and two on that i can explain the principle very simply without going into a lot of mathematical detail im all ears said harry right mobius got down to business lets consider these gateways a little less intensely a little more basically these doors which defy the physical laws of that state which we call spacetime we know there are several sorts and that all of them warp the skin of this spacetime dimension modern scientists readily admit of one such the black hole and they make guesses about another sort which theyve termed white holes in fact a current theory has it that white and black holes are two ends of the same tunnel the black sucks material in and the white expels it agreed harry nodded so i understand he said very well now even if the theory is wrong and theyre not two sides of the same coin there remains one factor common to both which is that theyre both oneway systems once you enter a black hole you dont get out again and once youve been expelled from a white hole theres no way back in the way i see it the same thing applies to your grey holes this gate at perchorsk and the second gate which you believe lies somewhere along the course of this underground river oneway systems each of them emphasis on each you go in through one and you come out through the other it stopped harry dead in his tracks finally he said thats brilliant once you use a gate its out of bounds having passed you through it wont accept you again no matter which end you started out from but a second gate will so all i have to do is find the second gate in fact i already know where it is its the gate the wamphyri have been using to send their monstrosities through to perchorsk ah but thats what it is not where it is said mobius its a step in the right direction anyway harry replied then he sobered a little there is however one small drawback if i come through that gate into perchorsk theyll not only shoot me theyll probably fry me too ah but here mobius could only shrug thanks anyway said harry youve confirmed what i was already suspecting that there have to be two gates the wamphyri have been using one for thousands of years and now theyve started using the new one which luchov and his crowd inadvertently blasted into being at perchorsk its the only explanation soif youll excuse me now ill be on my way i have to say goodbye to my mother shed never forgive me if i did something like this without telling her he sighed shell want to try to talk me out of it even knowing she cant butshes like that all mothers are like that harry said mobius very seriously good luck my boy but in fact luck would have very little to do with it the next morning darcy clarke met harry at ebranch hq in london and while harry checked his equipment making sure he knew how to use it clarke took the opportunity to pass on a little information about this subterranean tributary of the danube he said harry its a deathtrap i had it checked out overnight our man in bucharest looked into it for you the place is known well enough and we have its exact location there are newspaper clippings concerning it various bits of documentation the locals have an immemorial dislike for it in a couple of cavers took it on it was summer and the tributary was running dry at the time four hours after they started in there was a flash flood up in the mountains one body was washed out the other lost forever and these were experts and they were walking and swimming said harry i wont be eh i said i was going up to the watercourse but i didnt say how clarke gasped youll use the mobius continuum of course then why the wetsuit aqualung and all just in case clarke fell silent for a moment then said i was only trying to help and i appreciate it harry told him but i know my own business best ten minutes later he took up his gear in a waterproof kitbag and went to radujevac from the outskirts of the town he caught a taxi into the countryside close to the location clarke had given him he paid his driver with money from the same source with his bag over his shoulder he set off down a country track eventually arriving at his destination it was a wild place and there was no one around harry dumped his kit in a copse and covered the bag with dead branches then returned to the site of the resurgence it was in the base of a cliff overgrown with ivy where limestone outcrops glistened with moisture to the northeast stood the grey forbidding carpathians and to the south sloping wooded countryside harry stood on the banks of the pool under the cliffs and looked again at the mountains then down at the dark water where it gurgled into view from untold caverns of gloom it issued from the mouth of a cave this was the spot where old belos of the wamphyri first entered our world and others like him and between here and those legendary mountains somewhere underground lay a gateway to an alien world now it was harrys task to pinpoint that gate as accurately as possible before setting out up the river to find it he checked again that there was no one around no one to see him take his departure the place was silent wooded where only the birds sang and the cold water gurgled but this time harry was well muffledup and didnt feel the cold he picked a spot in the foothills to the northeast went there via the mobius continuum the door from which he exited was the same as always a hole in the universe with nothing to distinguish it from hundreds of other doors harry had used harry moved again even closer to the looming peaks but this time when he emerged the edges of his door shimmered a little it was the warning hed been looking for which told him he was close very close harry said a dead voice in his mind surprising him it felt like someone had come up close behind him and whispered in his ear do i know you he scanned the countryside around looked down on distant towns radujevac cujmir recea they were smoky wintry smudges on his horizon no but i know you your mother has been making enquiries on your behalf harry sighed she means well he said has she disturbed you not at all im happy to help you intend to travel the length of the radujevac resurgence right the voice was full of excitement eagerness which was what gave its owner away you were a caver said harry you died back in the summer of somewhere up that underground river thats me said the other a little sadly and i never did get to finish the job my name is gari nadiscu and if id made it the bore would have been named after me the nadiscu route it was a dream maybe you can finish it for me harry said wait and transferred to the mobius continuum now talk to me he said i want to get closer to you he followed the others thoughts emerged at the very foot of the mountains and again the mobius door shimmered more than before confirming harrys belief that he was moving closer to the gate you didnt do badly he told nadiscu you covered oh maybe nine miles before that flood hit you are you still down there he glanced at the stony mountain soil under his feet i mean is there anything leftyou know how did you get trapped your companion was washed out trapped answered the other grimly thats the right word harry i crawled onto a ledge there was a crack in the wall as the water rose i climbed deeper into the crack finally i got jammed couldnt move i was wearing a lung of course it was a bad time i lasted as long as my air that must have been pretty terrible harry commiserated but dont waste time on that said the other youve things to do how can i help you two things said harry one what was the course of the river up to the time youwhen the flood came and two how deep are you as you calculate it under the surface nadiscu supplied the answers and harry thanked him i wont be looking for the rivers source he admitted for its a different kind of source that interests me but if it all works out ill come back some time and tell you how far i got ok thanks harry id appreciate that harry used the continuum and moved on into the mountains exiting on a steep pinecovered slope this time the interference was such that harry knew he was almost there directly below him at some great depth in the roots of the mountains the gate to the world of the wamphyri was waiting for him he calculated the distance to his starting point fixed his location firmly in his head his location not only in the mundane world but also in the metaphysical mobius continuum it was a sort of mental triangulation and then he went back to the copse where hed hidden his gear half an hour later dressed in wetsuit and aqualung equipped with fins and a powerful waterproof torch harry slipped into the water and conjured a mobius door no shimmer here he moved upstream emerging in darkness with his flippered feet on a pebbly bed the darkness was absolute and there was a current strong enough to cause harry to lean against it he used his torch to scan the way ahead its powerful beam cutting the dark like a knife on the next jump his feet were still on the bottom but the bore had narrowed down the water was chindeep the way ahead convoluted and so harry proceeded sometimes he swam at other times he was underwater where there was no gap between ceiling and river occasionally the bore was wide as a cathedral and the water shallow almost before he knew it he found gari nadiscu in the crevice where hed trapped himself there was very little of him left a single flipper and an air tank halfburied in shingle and a trapped thigh bone harry could have come to nadiscu direct he saw that now but there could have been hazards the caver had been trapped in a tight spot harry hadnt wanted to emerge in a cramped difficult location also and more importantly nadiscu might have been too close to the gate harry had experienced the danger in using the mobius continuum close to a gate it was to be avoided no hed preferred his own way if thered been difficulties getting out again would have been as easy as conjuring a mobius door and this way hed got used to his system of sighting the way ahead and then jumping there which was as well for beyond this point the route was totally unknown now he and nadiscu exchanged a few encouraging words and harry moved on five minutes later after a series of short jumps harrys exit door shimmered violently and seemed to bend back on itself harry emerged in deep water swimming he shone his torch ahead the bore was almost circular with maybe twelve inches between ceiling and water he darent use the continuum again and so put all of his efforts to swimming the current wasnt much but still it made for hard work then ahead harry saw a faintly luminous arc of light he switched off his torch and hooked it to his belt using both hands to aid his flippered feet in forging ahead the arc expanded and the light grew stronger white light harry emerged into the cave of the sphere and gratefully hauled himself up onto the ledge where he at once recoiled from what lay upon the moist floor it was a headless corpse running rapidly to decay the head also sloughing flesh lay some little way along the ledge jesus harry breathed he had taken off his demandvalve attachment but now quickly replaced it to breathe bottled air that was better then he examined the corpse more carefully but without touching it the severed spinal column was fat reinforced with extra bone and sinew it contained in effect two spines wamphyri the head would likewise contain a composite brain also turning to mush who were you harry asked it was corlis of the lady karens aerie the other moaned alas i was too ambitious ow go away me to my misery too ambitious harry gulped so it would appear he glanced up at the sphere and quickly looked away the light was unbearable from a zippered pocket he took out dark goggles and put them on then looked all about a little apart from the corpse lay a modern walkietalkie radio somewhat battered its aerial fully extended harry stared at it shook his head he could see that it was a russian model beyond that it seemed pointless to conjecture there were various niches in the walls together with the mouths of many magmass wormholes when harry saw what some of these contained then he remembered faethors or beloss story high up in the curved wall one such sat with its shrivelled legs dangling over the rim of a magmass hole the thing was mummified where dripstone had fused its legs to the wall and commenced covering them with gleaming calcium an eyeless skull hideously misshapen leaned out frozen in death its gaping jaws were wolfish toothed like a carnivore the creature seemed to leer at harry with a permanent imperishable malignancy he wasnt much worried it had leered like that for a long long time vampire killer it suddenly accused harry shrugged i cant deny it but on that score it seems you at least have no worries nor any of you here now other voices joined the first impudent pup and this is a private place of the wamphyri begone and who are you to disturb our sleep of centuries sorry harry shrugged but im not dressed for conversation polite or otherwise but id better inform you i know that to a man youre all exiles you may have been high and mighty wamphyri in your own world but here youre just crumbling old dead things thats how it goes now me i wont hold your past against you as long as you dont hold mine against me after a moment of blank astonishment you dare they cried in one voice now its cold in here harry continued unperturbed so im going to pick up a change of clothing if by the time i return youre feeling more sociable we can start over and no hard feelings if not again his shrug its your loss as the teeming dead would doubtless testify if theyd waste their time talking to such as you before they could answer he took up his torch and flippers slipped back into the water it was icy cold but it would only be for a moment he let the river bob him downstream to a safe distance then conjured a slightly warped door and floated through it he fixed the location firmly in his mind went back to the copse and his kitbag there he took a long deep swig from a hip flask of brandy tossed the flask away he tied a fiftyfoot length of nylon cord to the neck of the waterproof bag went back to the midnight river and exited the mobius continuum into the water at the required location as the kitbag sank he swam furiously for the cave of the sphere climbing back onto the ledge he hauled in the kitbag and quickly changed into warm clothes the bag also contained a heavy specialissue machinegun which he now checked against the possibility of damp or damage everything seemed ok ahhh he was aware of a concerted mental sighing as he stood on the ledge and paused to wonder if hed forgotten anything he comes and goes like a ghost he has a deal of magic harry smiled oh ive got some magic all right he agreed but as for being a ghostim flesh and blood and its you fellows who harry said a different voice a very frightened very primitive guttural almost animal voice in his mind be careful harry keogh its dangerous to speak to the wamphyri as you have spoken to them harry found the speaker a squat dwarfish aboriginal creature crouched in a cramped cavity apart from the others a stalagmitic sheath had almost completely enveloped him so that it seemed to harry he conversed with what was very nearly a stone statue youre not wamphyri he said hah the others were part amused part outraged him that wamphyri a trog you fool trog harry glanced from the trog to the others and back oh yes i remember i was told i might find a trog or two here travellers too perhaps travellers too harry said yet another voice much more human but it sounded very distant that voice very faint and fading alas we dont have the same durability as trogs and wamphyri im afraid were little more than memories now so several sorts of people from the world beyond the gate harry mused and none of you willing to help me eh he adjusted his goggles tightened the strap of his weapon across his shoulder what dead these thousands or at least many hundreds of years you trogs and travellers and still the wamphyri oppress you id hoped to ask your advice he looked up gazed at the glaring white surface of the sphere if he reached up a hand he could touch it only ask it several traveller voices spoke up in our time we fought the wamphyri we staked them through their black hearts and burned them but when they came to power this is how they avenged themselves still we have no regrets so speak to us harry we were not primitive fearful trogs but men there was pride in their fading voices then sudden panic as harry stood on his toes stretched a straining hand toward the surface of the glaring sphere where its huge globe bulged downward from the ceiling harry dont too late his hand had touched the sphere broken the surface of its skin he tried to snatch the hand back which was about as much use as asking a hurled stone not to return to earth harry heard the grim laughter of the wamphyri the groans of trogs and travellers alike felt himself grasped drawn up passed into the sphere and in a moment the cave and gurgling river had disappeared from sight and he floated up up weightless as a feather in a beam of white light toward a different place a different world the dweller the problem at perchorsk in the garden perhaps inspired by the reaction of the spherecaves ossified inhabitants harrys first reflex was to panic instinctively he came close to conjuring almost attempted to fashion a mobius door and only just retreated from that action in time to avert a disaster god alone knew where or how he would end up if he tried to use mobius mathematics here inside the grey hole and so he floated drawn irresistibly upward or passed through the gate and almost before he knew it his resurgence was almost as big a shock as his entry he passed through the skin of the sphere then slid down its curve crashingly onto a jumble of stony debris between the sphere and the crater wall for indeed he saw that the sphere was inside a crater and directly overhead a second sphere so that now harry could see almost all of the picture the jigsaw was very nearly complete the gate he had just traversed was the original the one above seated in the mouth of the crater had appeared here simultaneous with the creation of its twin its other end in perchorsk perhaps the presence of the first had somehow influenced the location of the second harry couldnt say maybe mobius would know except if that decapitated corpse in the cave had come through comparatively recently and also the walkietalkiewere the wamphyri now using the original sphere as a dumping site and why dump a radio but one thing was certain they had passed through they had entered the sphere this sphere from this side and if they had found their way down here then he could make his way up no sooner had the thought occurred than he saw the magmass wormholes running through the rock they were everywhere cutting smoothly through the solid rock at all angles under his dufflecoat harry still had his torch clipped to his belt he took the torch out chose a horizontal shaft and wriggled in in a little while the hole turned to the right then bent sharply into a descent harry abandoned it came out backwards other holes were no better but then at his fifth attempt he found a hole which climbed gently not so steeply as to cause him to slide back in a little while it too bent to one side the left following which it rose marginally more steeply then it levelled out and swung right but beyond the level bend it shot almost vertically upward harry stood up switched off his torch after the claustrophobia of the hole this was a little better for now it was as though he stood at the bottom of a shallow well up there strange constellations of stars glittered brightly in a black jewelled sky he reached up a handthe rim of the hole was at least twentyfour inches beyond his grasp he bent his knees jumped a hard thing to spring upright and make any height in the confined space of a hole two and a half feet across especially in a dufflecoat carrying a heavy machinegun with a spare magazine and two hundred rounds in your pockets the gun harry took the weapon from his shoulder extended the sling to its full extent taking the gun by the barrel he pushed its stock up the smooth bore of the wormhole hooked its pistolgrip over the rim then wedging himself against the wall he used elbows and knees to gain enough height to get his foot into the loop of the dangling sling and after that it was easy gradually straightening up he dragged himself out of the wormhole and hauled the gun up after him panting a little from his exertions he scanned the terrain and just as it had affected zek foener jazz simmons and others before them so it affected harry starside at sundown was weird but while harry observed starside so too was he observed keeneyed shapes moved in the shadows of boulders to the west and a flitting thing high overhead squeaked a cry beyond the range of harrys ears to detect then the great bat desmodus sped east making for a distant stack while on the ground a trog set off to lope westward cupping horny hands to his neanderthal face and sending a cry ringing ahead of him the cry was heard picked up passed on a straggled scattering of trogs spread out over many miles passed the eerie message down the line almost at the same time the messages were received both in the stack and in the dwellers garden but where lord shaithis of the wamphyri must order a flyer readied and descend to the launching bays the dweller was not dependent upon that sort of conveyance he simply inclined his head and listened for a moment turned his eyes eastward and sighed the newcomers identity could not be doubted the dweller would have known that mind anywhere any time so after all these years finally he had come and at such a time well nothing for it but to welcome him and who could say but that shortly he might be sorely needed and so the dweller simply went to harry where for long minutes he had stood close to the glaring sphere gazing on the world of the wamphyri harry was staring at the distantly rearing stacks wondering about them just as zek jazz and others had wondered before him suddenlyhe was aware that someone watched him he spun round and fell into a crouch swung his gun up and cocked it some forty yards north of the sphere out on the boulder plain there stood a figure motionless watching it was a slim figure male from what harry could see of it and its face was golden burning in the reflected glare of the sphere dont shoot the other called out in a youngold voice holding up a hand theres no danger not yet there was something about the voice harry relaxed a very little tilted his head on one side enquiringly not yet no said the other but soon look and he pointed at the sky to the east harry looked dark blots were growing large in the sky two of them with others mere dots far behind they came from the direction of the stacks one was winged shaped something like a manta the other wasa nightmare shape gigantic it squirted through the sky like a squid i should think thats shaithis said the dweller pointing and the other thing thatll be one of his warriors and see behind them more flyers carrying a couple of his lieutenants wamphyri harry guessed oh yes youd better come over here go over there harry believed he knew why to be away from the gate he knew the voice too he didnt know it couldnt possibly know it but he knew it he moved to obey and the flying shapes came closer the two leading shapes shaithis aboard a flyer and a riderless warrior swooped down out of the sky they began to circle and shaithiss beast sank lower the wind of its great wings blasting dust and grit up from the plain into harrys and the dwellers faces its shadow fell on them as it shut out the stars and shaithiss booming voice called surrender surrender now to the lord shaithis are you ready father said the dweller he held up one wing of his cloak harry believed no he knew the child he had searched for was eight years old and this young man was at least twenty but the two were one and the same how didnt matter not right now harrys whole world his entire life had been filled with things just as strange as this stranger im ready son he answered his voice catching a little butdoes it work here oh it works except you mustnt use it too close to a gate i know said harry i tried it once shaithis settled his beast to earth to the west his warrior crunched down to the east other shapes loomed in the sky almost directly overhead ho dweller shaithis called dismounting it seems i have you let me take you to our garden said harry jnr to his father harry stepped forward took him in his arms and hugged him he felt his sons cloak close around him shaithis striding forward jerked to a halt dust leaped up from the plain formed itself into a devil that swirled in the vacuum that the two men had left behind they were no longer there for long moments shaithis stood his flattened convoluted snout sniffing the air then his great nostrils flared and his eyes blazed their fury he threw back his head and roared and as the plain echoed his cry so he began to curse and then he made his vow dweller i shall have you he snarled you and your garden and all you possess i shall have your magic your weapons your cloak of invisibility your every secret do you hear i shall have you and the helllanders and everything and when i have these things then i shall use them to make myself the most powerful lord there ever has been or ever will be so speaks shaithis of the wamphyri so let it be the echoes of his cry his cursing and his vow died away and for a long time shaithis stood there alone with his dark wamphyri thoughts ten days later at perchorsk chingiz khuz paraded inspected and briefed his troops khuvs kommandos as he had named them a platoon of topquality infantrymen from the famous moskva volunteers thirty armed men and machines specially uniformed in the colours of their task black combat suits with white discs on the upper arms plus the usual badges of rank with the hammer and sickle sigil blazoned over their vehicles five lightweight jeeplike trucks and trailers plus three outrider motorcycles all for the moment waiting in the projekts loadingunloading bays were likewise black marked on their doors and panniers with the white disc of the gate they bore no number plates carried no documentation no requirement for such encumbrances where they were going for the next ten days these men would sleep in a converted projekt warehouse here on the premises theyd be briefed given all available details of what they could expect shown films of the same and intensively trained in the use of oneman flamethrowers and three larger trailertransported units their mission go into the sphere through the gate and set up a base camp on the other side they were in short an expeditionary force each man was handpicked they left no loved ones behind had few friends or relatives were all volunteers as befitted the history and traditions of their parent regiment and they were as hard as footsoldiers come from the landing at the top of the wooden stairs viktor luchov watched khuv strut listened to his voice echoing up as he paraded before the platoon on the boards of the saturnsrings circumference saw the goggled faces of the thirty where they stood at ease turning to follow him up and down up and down as he delivered his welcoming address welcome hah and would the hostile new world they were invading welcome them too luchov wondered with what would it welcome them finally the initial introduction to perchorsk was over khuv handed over to his sergeantmajor ic the men were fallen out told to leave the core in an orderly fashion and return to their billets they came up the steps singlefile passed luchov and disappeared through the magmass levels khuv himself was the last to leave and looking ahead up the steps he saw luchov waiting for him well he said as he came up the stairs to the landing and what do you think of them i heard what you said to them luchovs voice was cold almost distant what difference does it make what i think of them i know where theyre going and therefore that theyre dead men khuvs dark eyes were bright less than inscrutable there was a fever in them which while it told of excitement refused to hint at the source so perhaps they were inscrutable after all no he shook his head theyll survive they are the best men of steel against entirely fleshandblood monsters selfsupporting working as a perfectly coordinated team equipped with the best personal weapons we can given themtheyll do much better than just survive against the primitives we know exist through there he glanced down on the shining gate theyll appear as supermen theyre a bridgehead direktor into a new world oh a military bridgehead i agree but thats only temporary one day soon you too shall visit that other world when theyve made it safe for you and who can say what resources will be found there who knows what wealth eh dont you understand theyll claim and tame that world for the ussr pioneers luchov hardly seemed impressed theyre soldiers major not settlers their prime function isnt to farm or explore its to kill again khuv shook his head no their prime function is to protect themselves and the gate to open it up keep anything else from breaking through to us from the time they go in this gate becomes literally oneway from here to there thats what i call security and what about them luchovs voice was colder than ever do they know they cant come back no they dont khuvs response was immediate and they cant be told youd better understand that they cant be told i have instructions for you on that matter and on other matters instructions for luchov sucked in air implosively you have instructions for me khuv was impassive from the very highest authority the very highest where those soldiers are concerned direktor i am in charge he produced and handed luchov a sealed envelope stamped with the kremlin crest as for not coming back no they wont not immediately but eventually eventually luchov glanced at the envelope put it away eventually he snorted how long do we need man this gate has been here for over two years and what have we learned about the world on the other side nothing except that its home formonsters weve never even communicated with the other side that comes first said khuv field telephones what we know sound travels through the sphere said the other and light both ways however warped the effect men can talk and communicate with each other in there these men will lay a cable as they go it can be tested after theyve travelled no more than a few paces and if that doesnt work theyll set up temporary semaphore stations at least well get to know what its like through there what its like on the other side luchov shook his head that still wont get them back he said not yet not now khuv grated losing his patience but if there is a way back well find it even if it means building another perchorsk luchov took a pace backwards was brought up short when the small of his back met the handrail another per his jaw fell open why i hadnt even considered i didnt think you had direktor now khuv grinned his face a grim emotionless mask so now consider it and stop worrying about these men if you must worry then worry for yourself and for your staff youll find that in those orders too once the bridgehead is established youre next luchov tottered where he stood grasping the rail he was furious but shock had made him impotent as khuv turned away then he found his voice called out but oh how neatly youve escaped the net yourself eh major khuv paused slowly turned to face him he was as pale as luchov had ever seen him no he shook his head and luchov saw his adams apple working for that too is in the orders youll be happy to know that in just ten days time we part company viktor for when they go through i go with them at the other end of the shaft to the magmass levels out of sight round the corner vasily agursky had been privy to all their conversation now as khuvs footsteps sounded on the boards he turned and ran silently for the upper levels he wore rubbersoled shoes moved with the litheness of a cat no like a wolf he loped and revelled in the strength of his thighs as they effortlessly propelled him strong even in his youth hed never known such strength nor such passions desires hungers but for all agurskys speed and stealth still khuv caught a glimpse of him before he could pass out of sight it was only that a glimpse but it caused the kgb major to frown on top of all his other worries now there was this thing with agursky whatever it was khuv hadnt seen much of him lately but whenever he hadhe couldnt put his finger on it but something was wrong and there he went swift as a deer head forward silent as a ghost and just as weird khuv shook his head and wondered what was ailing the strange little scientist wondered what had got into him the next morning early khuv jerked awake to the clamour of alarms in the moment of waking his heart almost stopped tried to tear itself free and leap up into his throat until he realized that these were only the general alert alarms not luchovs damned failsafe thank god whom khuv didnt really have any faith in anyway for that a moment later as he hurriedly dressed came the hammering on his door he opened it to let in the unctuous paul savinkov except that apart from the sweat on his fat shining frightened face there was nothing at all slimy about him now he smelled now not of grease but fear major he gasped comrade my god my god khuv shook him what is it man he snarled here sit down before you fall down he shoved savinkov into a chair the fat esper was trembling wobbling like a jelly iim sorry he said its justjust khuv slapped him backhanded him deliberately slapped him again now perhaps youll tell me whats wrong he growled the white burn of khuvs slim fingers came up like long blisters on savinkovs face his eyes lost their glaze and he shook his head as if he was the one who had just woken up and not khuv then khuv thought the man was about to burst into tears if he did khuv knew he would hit him right in the teeth well he rasped its roborov and rublev savinkov gasped dead both of them what khuv knew he must be imagining this it had to be some crazy dream dead how for the love of an accident he finished dressing slipped into his shoes accident savinkov grinned like an idiot but his features quickly melted into a sob oh no no it wasnt an accident when it happened their thoughts woke me up their thoughts were awful thoughts khuvs mind still not fully awake sought for an explanation of course savinkov was a telepath what about their thoughts v somethingsomething was attacking them in roborovs room i think theyd been playing cards gambling and that roborov was a heavy loser hed been to the toilet when he came outrublev was nearly dead something had him by the throat roborov tried to pull it off andit turned on him oh god felt him die huhhuhhe go on man khuv gasped he grabbed the thing and turned it around and he saw it he was thinking i dont believe this oh mother help me sweet god you know ive always loved you dont let this happen those were his thoughts yes savinkov sobbed the rest of it was just background stuff but it was roborovs thoughts that really woke me up and as he died i saw it too what did you see khuv took savinkovs face between the flats of his palms god i dont know it wasnt human or maybe it was it was a nightmare it wasits shape was all wrong it was likelike that thing in the glass tank khuvs blood ran cold he gulped air into his lungs released savinkovs face he grabbed his lapels and dragged him to his feet take me there he snapped roborovs room i know it were you there no then who is there you dont know fool well were going there right now on their way the alarms stopped clamouring well lets be thankful for that anyway khuv grunted he jostled savinkov ahead of him at least i can hear myself think now are you sure you cant remember who you told i mean did you simply forget all the procedures and come running straight to me god but if this is a wildgoose chase ill but it wasnt outside the door of roborovs room a sleepy nervous soldier stood on guard he saluted sloppily as khuv and savinkov came into view they rushed by him inside were two more espers and a kgb man named gustav litve all were wheyfaced shaken to their roots crumpled on the floor there lay the reason or reasons nikolai rublev could be savinkovs twin thought khuv grimacing at what he saw they were or had been much of a kind but now there were differences the main one being that savinkov was still alive and he was also intact whatever it was that had killed rublev it had taken half his face from him the fleshy part of the left side of his face was missing flensed from the bone from his ear to his nose and down to his chin but it wasnt the work of a scalpel or knife the flesh had been ripped off in addition his throat was torn torn as by an animal with the main arteries severed and exposed khuv thought wheres all the blood perhaps hed said something out loud for his underling litve said sir eh khuv looked up oh nothing fetch vasily agursky will you gustav bring him here i want to know what kind of an animal could do this and he might be able to tell me litve gratefully made for the door called back the others not much better sir other khuvs mind still wasnt on business roborov khuv realized hed been wandering to make up for it he snapped he was your colleague wasnt he was sir yes litve answered he went out behind an overturned table amidst a litter of bloodied paper money and cards lay the other andrei roborov the two espers were standing looking down on him khuv shoved them aside took a look for himself roborovs face was a mask of sheer horror his dead eyes bulged his jaws gaped in a frozen rictus of terror his tongue projected blue and glistening mainly cadaverous in life he was totally grotesque in death his thin head from the ears up looked like it had been trapped in a toothed vise and crushed the skull had caved in and blood and brain fluid seeped from the cracks and the deep punctures ofteeth marks good lord said khuv to which one of the espers added something bit his head like it was a plum major look at his arms khuv looked both arms were broken at the elbows bent back on themselves until the bones had parted at the sockets whatever it was it had found a simple and effective way of stopping roborov from fighting back khuv shook his head felt his gorge rising he could almost feel the pulse of the projekt quickening as morning came and the place started to wake up there was a faint throbbing underfoot like the heart of a great beast and within the beast a lesser beast the one that had done this or perhaps a greater beast what sort of beast not human surely but if not human there was a telephone out in the corridor khuv ran to it and called the duty officer at failsafe concen he didnt let the man speak but rasped have you been sleeping have you been asleep on duty who is this came a wideawake alert voice from the other end khuv recognized the voice a senior scientist on luchovs team a very responsible person this is major khuv he lowered his voice it seems we may have an intruder certainly we have a murderer in the place an intruder the voice on the other end hardened where are you major im in the corridor close to kgb quarters why do you mean an intruder from outside or from the gate well obviously thats why im on the phone khuv snapped to find out now the other came back just as venomously in which case it should also be obvious that your intruder is from outside if it was anything else by now youd be burning khuv i listen ive got the screens right here in front of me everything is normal down there except theyre all a bit nervous because of those bloody alarms nothing repeat nothing has come through that gate khuv slammed the phone down he stood glaring at it something was loose in here maybe it had been let loose in here by whom british ebranch he ran back into roborovs room told the two espers out leave all this if you come up with something let me know but until then leave this to my investigators savinkov was making himself as small and insignificant as he could in a corner you khuv said there are three more kgb men stinking in their beds just down the corridor a stones throw from the scene of a double murder go wake the idle bastards up wake them all up tell them i want them here now savinkov went khuv ushered the espers out into the corridor and closed roborovs door viktor luchov had just arrived looked bewildered only halfawake dont go in there khuv warned him shaking his head luchov took one look at the kgb officers face and was sensible enough to take heed but whats happened murder at least i think so but dont you know luchov gaped i know two people are dead and if their killer is human then its murder luchov was waking up quickly is it that bad have you checked with fail yes khuv cut him short to both questions but no buts khuv interrupted again if its something from the gate then its invisible at that moment litve returned with agursky khuvs eyes went straight to the tiny scientist exceptagursky hardly seemed that small any more he slumped a little yes but if he were to stand up straight agursky had on his night things with a dressinggown thrown over them and he was wearing dark spectacles something wrong with your eyes khuv frowned eh agursky squinted peered at the major through tinted lenses oh yes it comes on now and then photophobia its with being down here out of the natural light all this artificial lighting khuv nodded he had more than enough with which to concern himself without worrying about agurskys weirdness in there he nodded indicating the door to roborovs room two dead men agursky seemed hardly concerned he opened the door made to go in khuv caught his arm felt the tension in him strange because it hadnt shown in his movements or his mannerisms i want you to tell me what killed them if you can give me some sort of idea anyway gustav go in there with him while they were inside the room khuv told luchov all he knew impossible to work if the projekt direktor was going to be prying into everything better to put him firmly in the picture right now from square one by the time he was through litve and agursky had come back out of the room litve was still very pale agursky seemed his usual self any ideas khuv asked him the other shook his head averted his eyes something terrifically strong immensely strong a beast certainly beast luchov blurted agursky glanced at him in a way of speaking direktor yes a human beast a murderer but as i said a very large very strong man khuv said and the teeth marks in roborovs skull no agursky shook his head his skull was smashed in with a hammer or something very similar yes something like a smallpane hammer but wielded with considerable force remembering that garbage savinkov had spewed out khuv scowled but i have an esper he said paul savinkov who says he saw the killer and he says it was something nightmarish agursky had started to turn away but now he slowly turned back he saw this happen you say in his mind yes ah agursky nodded his understanding then he smiled shrugged halfapologetically well my science takes note of physical evidence only major metaphysics isnt my scene will you be requiring me any more i have many things to do now and only one more thing said khuv tell me what did you do with the corpse of the dead creature from the tank do with it i photographed it studied it to the point of stripping it down to cartilage and bone finally destroyed burned it burned it agursky shrugged again of course it was from the gate after all there was nothing else to be learned from it andbest not to take chances with things like that dont you agree luchov patted him on the shoulder of course vasily of course we do thank you very much if we do want you khuv called after him youll be hearing from me but with any luck we wont to luchov he said god he gives me the creeps this whole place luchov muttered gives me the creeps as agursky went off so savinkov returned with khuvs kgb operatives theyd had civil police training and since this now appeared to be a case of routine murder khuv scowled at them they looked ruffled unshaven he dressed them down told them what had happened and what he wanted they went into roborovs room by now savinkov had disappeared probably sneaked off before khuv could find more work for him but as khuv and luchov made to return to the upper levels so the telepath came back he was reeling sobbing seemed totally uncoordinated major help iioh god khuv pounced on him grated what now paul its leo he gasped leo grenzel the locator what is it with leo i wondered why he hadnt picked up the presence of the intruder savinkov babbled and so i went to his room the door wasit was open i went in andand khuv and luchov looked at each other their expressions were much the same shock disbelief horror savinkovs reasoning was faultless of course grenzel if he was awake and well should have appeared on the scene long before now leaving savinkov leaning against the metal wall sobbing khuv and luchov set off down the corridor at a run khuv called back no alarms paul only set them off one more time and the entire projekt will take flight in grenzels room it was a repeat of the same story his spine had been broken looked bitten through to the marrow and spinal cord his sharp features seemed even sharper in death and his huge bulging eyes an even deeper shade of grey what had those espers eyes of his seen before he died khuv wondered and then he stilled the bobbing of his adams apple and staggered out of the room until he was no longer able to hear luchovs throwing up into grenzels toilet the dwellers garden was a marvellous place it was a miniature valley a gently hollowed pocket at the rear of a saddle in the midwestern reach of the mountains in extent the garden was something a little more than three acres in a row with the length of its rear boundary against the final rise of the saddle and its frontage where the saddle started to dip toward frowning cliffs a low wall had been built there to keep people from moving too close in between there were small fields or allotments greenhouses and a scattering of clearwater ponds one of the ponds swarmed with rainbow trout while some of the others bubbled with heat from thermal activity deep in the ground hot springs in fact because of the abundance of water the place was lush with vegetation but only a handful of species were unknown to earth the rest of the flowers shrubs trees in the garden would have been perfectly at home in any english garden harry jnrs mother tended them when she felt up to it but usually his travellers looked after the garden as they looked after almost everything here harry jnrs bungalow house was centrally situated built of white stone with a red tile roof its front perched over the wide mouth of a well that occasionally gave off streamers of steam he swam and bathed in the pool regularly his travellers inhabited similarly constructed stone houses at the sides of the saddle where the level ground met rising cliffs all such homes were centrally heated with a system of plastic pipes carrying hot water from a deep gurgling blowhole they had glass windows too and other refinements utterly unheard of before harry jnrs time the dweller had built greenhouses in which to grow an abundance of vegetable produce heated and watered from the springs his crops were amazing also he had found ways round the long cold dark sundowns plant species which would adapt already had but others which wouldnt received artificial sunlight the permanently running water drove his generators which in turn powered ultraviolet lamps in the greenhouses and electric lights in the houses youve doneso much harry keogh told his son where he walked with him along the edge of a plot shady with sweet corn grown tall all of this is nothing short ofastonishing harry jnr had heard much the same thing from zek foener jazz simmons every traveller who ever made it here it was a common reaction to things hed come to take for granted not really he answered not set against what im capable of doing chiefly i wanted a place to live for myself and for my mother so it had to be made liveable and what is it really but a strip of fertile soil some two hundred or more yards long by eighty wide eh as for the running of the place the travellers do that for me but the buildings harry said as hed said it so often during the course of the past sunup oh i know theyre only bungalows but theyre so well beautiful theyre simple but delightful the great span of their arches the delicate buttresses the cut of the roof timbers theyre not greek not anything i can put a finger on just so pleasing and all built by thesewell by these cavedwellers of yours the trogs are people father harry jnr smiled but the wamphyri never gave them a chance to develop thats all theyre no more primitive than your australian bushmen all considered but on the other hand theyre eager to learn show them a principle or a system and they catch on quick also theyre grateful their old gods didnt treat them too well and i do as for the architecture which so impresses you well that surprises me surely you realize that im not the designer i got all this from a berliner who died back in a bauhaus student who never did make it when he was alive but hes designed some beautiful stuff since then im a necroscope like you remember all of the very simple very efficient systems you see in use here were given to me by the dead of your own world dont you realize how far you could have gone the things you could have done if you hadnt spent the last eight years of your life tracking me harry shook his head still a little dazed by what his son had shown him by what hed been told see he finally said perhaps a little desperately thats another thing eight years you said now in my mind youre a boy an eightyearold boy in fact ive prided myself in picturing you that way in imagining what youd be like it would have been far easier to think of you as a baby which is how i remember you but i made myself see you as youd be now or as i thought youd be andand just look how you are i still cant get over it he shook his head again ive explained that what how you tricked me harry didnt try to disguise the bitterness in his tone how you not only crossed the divide between universes but displaced yourself in time too you went back in time long before you were born and long before i lost you while i was growing up you were growing up too here just exactly how old are you anyway im twentyfour harry harry nodded sharply your mothers now fifteen years my senior not that shed recognize me anyway andand you have looked after her that was always one of my biggest worries that she be looked after but through all of those years i didnt know couldnt you have let me know just once and prolong the agony harry so that youd always be there just one step behind us harry grimaced turned away i noticed youve skipped the father bit too youre a man not the boy i expected you wear that damned golden mask so that i cant even see your face yourea stranger yes were like strangers well i suppose thats the way it had to be i mean were hardly father and son are we lets face it im not all that much older than you now am i harry jnr sighed i know ive hurt you i knew it all the time you were chasing me but you kept running i might have come back butoh there were a lot of things mother wasnt improving there were good places i could take her where shed be happy many reasons for not coming back one day youll understand harry felt something of his sons sadness yes there was a sadness in him he nodded again but not so sharply now for long moments he wrestled with his emotions in the end blood won anyway he relaxed took a deep breath somehow managed to grin just how did you do it harry jnr had felt the tension go out of his father knew hed been forgiven he too relaxed timetravel you mean but you did it too and long before me relatively speaking i was immaterial literally i was incorporeal al aura youre flesh and blood mobius reckons it cant be done it would create too many irresolvable paradoxes hes right harry jnr nodded in the purely physical sense in any entirely physical universe it cant be done are you telling me there are other sorts of universe you know of at least one harry felt hed had this conversation before the mobius continuum but weve already agreed that harry his son cut in ill tell you you took the universe you knew and gave it a mobius halftwist you did to spacetime what your mentor had done to a strip of paper and the ability to do that came down to me but lets face it you always knew id go one better than that well i did i took the mobius continuum itself and did to it what felix klein did to his bottle that allowed me to break the time barrier and retain a physical identity and come through to this place but you know this is only one place harry said nothing just stood very still and absorbed what his son had said there were more places more worlds an infinite number just as space and time were limitless so were the spaces in between space and time now harry knew what darcy clarke had meant when he said he felt like he stood in the presence of an alien harry jnr was that far ahead or was he son said harry eventually tell me are you still vulnerable vulnerable can you be hurt physically oh yes harry jnr answered and he sighed again im vulnerable and never more so than now in about one hundred hours it will be sundown again and thats when ill discover just how vulnerable i am harry frowned do you want to explain just like the wamphyri have their spies so i have mine and i geta feel for what the opposition is up to this place has been under observation for months close scrutiny bats on high trogs down below on the plain even wamphyri mentalists trying to wriggle into my mind as theyve doubtless got into the minds of my travellers all of which corroborates things that zek foener has already told me but what reads can be read you know what observes can be observed an attack his father frowned but you told me theyd tried that before with no success so whats different now this time theyre united harry jnr answered this time theyll all come their combined army will be massive three dozen warriors countless trogs all the lords and their lieutenants shaithis has stirred them up butyou can get out of it harry was bewildered saw no real problem you know the way all of the ways we can all be long gone from here harry jnr smiled a sad smile no he shook his head you can and the others the travellers and trogs whoever wants to go but i cant this is my place youll defend it harry shook his head i dont understand but you will father you will the dwellers secret karen defects war the suns declining rays were starting to fade where they turned the highest peaks gold when the dweller harry jnr called his meeting he wanted to speak to everyone who lived in or was supported by the garden and he must do it now while there was still time he stood on a balcony under the hollow eaves of his house and addressed guests travellers trogs making no distinction his mother was there too for a little while before she went indoors smiling sweet greyhaired and quite bereft of mind but happy too in her ignorance harry snr couldnt bear to look at her forgetting that in his alec kyle body she wouldnt recognize him he was glad when she went inside and anyway to her it had all been so long long ago friends its time for truths harry jnr held up his arms and the low hubbub of voices was stilled its time for you to make up your minds about certain things i havent deliberately misled you but neither have i told you everything well now i want to put that right there are some of you here who have nothing to fight for this just isnt your fight at all you came or were sent here by the will of others and i can just as easily take you out of it zek jazz harry im talking to you as for you travellers you can return to your travelling the way is open to you go now down the saddle and through the passes to sunside and you trogs you can be down on the plain on starside and hidden away in your caves or in other safer places long before the wamphyri strike but you should all be aware that they will strike and soon a low massed moaning went up from his shuffling bewildered trogs harry zek and jazz looked at each other in dismay a young male traveller cried but why dweller you are powerful you have given us weapons we can kill the wamphyri why do you send us away harry jnr looked down on him are the wamphyri your enemies yes they all cried and they always have been shouted the same young man and do you desire to kill them yes again the massed shout all of them he nodded aye all of them and you trogs there was a time when you served a wamphyri lord would you now turn against them there came a brief grunted discussion for you dweller aye answered their spokesman we know good from evil and you are good and you harry father youve been a scourge on vampires in your own world do you hate them still i know what they would do to my world harry answered yes i would hate them in this and any world harry jnr looked at them all his eyes behind his golden mask flitting over them where they stood in a body finally his gaze fell on zek and jazz and you two he said i can take you out of here back where you came from do you know that any place in your world where you want to go do you understand they looked at each other then jazz said if you can do it now then you can do it later you saved us once not so long ago and weve faced the wamphyri before how can you think well run out on you again harry jnrs nod let me tell you how it is he said before most of you came here at a time when i was beginning to build something here and had only my trogs to help me i found a wolf on the hillside his pack had turned on him attacked him he was badly torn dying i thought i didnt know or understand the things i know now i took the wolf in healed him made him well soon he was up on his feet again too soon and i thought i had saved his life but in fact hed been saved by the creature within him no one spoke a hushed silence had fallen over the gathering harry keogh found himself taking a step forward under the balcony gazing fearfully up at his son father harry jnr continued i told you there were reasons why i couldnt come back reasons why i must stand and defend my place but all of you have told me how you hate and would destroy the wamphyri all the wamphyri so how can i ask you to fight for me harry his father began only to be cut short this is how the wolf repaid me said the dweller and he took off his golden mask beneath it was the face of a young harry keogh harry knew now beyond any doubt that he gazed upon his own true son but the eyes in his face were scarlet in the twilight a long low sigh went up from the crowd for long moments they stood and stared began to mutter to talk in breathless whispers finally the crowd began to break up drift away in small groups in a little while only harry snr jazz and zek remained and the dweller thought theyre here because without me they have nowhere to go ill take you out of here now he said like hell you will his father growled come the hell down from there and explain you might be the dweller but youre also my flesh you a vampire what kind of vampire that so many people have loved you i dont believe it harry jnr came down believe it or not he said its the truth oh im different all right my mind and will are too strong for it i have mastery over it i have it tamed it takes me on now and then but im always ready and i always win or have so far anyway so the vampire works for me and not the other way around i get its strength its powers its tenacity it gets a host and thats all but there are disadvantages too for one i have to stay here on starside or close to starside the sunlight real sunlight would hurt me but the main reason i stay here is because this has become my place my place my territory no other shall have it he looked at them with his scarlet eyes smiled mirthlessly so there you have it and now if youre ready not me harry shook his head im staying until this is over anyway i didnt look for you for eight years just to leave you now harry jnr looked at jazz and zek jazz said you already have our answer trogs came shuffling out of the twilight their spokesman said we were lesks creatures and we didnt like it we liked working for you without you we have nothing we stay and fight harry jnrs face showed his despair the trogs may be fast learners but they werent much good with his weapons then lanterns came bobbing together with a familiar jingling from the direction of the traveller dwellings jazz and zek tried to count heads pointless there were as many as before maybe eighty of them not a man woman or child had run out so said harry snr looking at them all where they regrouped themselves it looks like we stand and fight his son could only throw up his hands in amazement and gladness harry thought an hour later at the dwellers armoury jazz simmons had finished handing out germanmade pumpaction shotguns and shells to the travellers the armoury was wellstocked and there were weapons for everyone there were halfadozen flamethrowers too and travellers who had been trained in their use harry jnr was there to point out that the shells for the shotguns were probably the most expensive ammunition ever made their shot was pure silver though most of the equipment had been stolen hed been obliged to order and buy these shells jazz ever practical had asked how theyd been paid for with traveller gold hed been told of which this world had an abundance the travellers considered it pretty and of course it was very malleable on the other hand it was much too heavy to carry around in large amounts and far too soft for serious metalworking it made nice baubles which was about as much as could be said for it for himself jazz had chosen a heavy caliber machinegun a russian job firing a mix of tracer and explosive shells the weapon could be used with a tripod or carried in both arms it took a strong man to handle it jazz knew the gun and had trained with it it was capable of laying down a deadly and shattering barrage of fire but still he told the dweller from what ive seen of wamphyri warriors id say these things are toys harry jnr nodded but the flamethrowers are not toys he said and i assure you the wamphyri wont like this silver shot still i take your meaning one warrior even a dozen but forty ah but you havent seen all my weapons he showed jazz a grenade jazz weighed the thing in his hand it was as large as an orange and very heavy he shook his head i dont know this one its american the dweller told him for clearing pillboxes and foxholes a very grim weapon it shivers into fragments of blazing metallic phosphorus meanwhile harry snr had used the mobius continuum to convey two very important travellers to a nearby peak rearing high over most of the others they knew their job and had practiced it on many previous occasions in a hollowedout depression at the peaks crest literally an aerie in its own right great mirrors had been rigged on swivels to catch the dying suns rays and hurl them down or up at any attackers the travellers also had shotguns and bandoliers of vampirelethal shells as harry dropped off his astonished charges and prepared to return to the garden so his keen eyes spotted something approaching in the sky as yet it was two or three miles east of the garden but even at that distance its size and shape made it unmistakable a flyer like shaithiss mount the travellers had seen it too shall we try to burn it they cried springing to their mirrorweapons one flyer harry frowned instinct cautioned him against abrupt action not unless it makes an attack on the garden he went back there looked for harry jnr instead he found zek foener her eyes closed where she stood facing east and slightly north one trembling hand to her brow is something wrong zek harry asked no harry she answered without opening her eyes somethings right the lady karen is coming to join us she wants to fight on our side she has four fine warriors but theyre holding back until she calls to them nowshe wants to know if its safe for her to land shes not attacking us shes joining us zek repeated you dont know her like i do harry shes different karen was closer now a mile at the outside but still wary still holding off everyone in the garden had seen her jazz simmons came hurrying a shining brass belt dangling from the ammohousing of his gun what is it he said at the same moment the dweller had materialized zek spoke to both men told them what shed told harry snr harry the dweller turned to his father go and tell the travellers to hold their fire lets see if shes genuine before anything else harry detoured straight to the peak where the travellers manned their mirrorweapons he passed on harry jnrs message then spread the word right through the garden and its defenders meanwhile zek had told the lady karen land in front of the wall between the wall and the cliffs karens flyer swept closer swooped lower swiftly grew larger in the sky far behind it four dark shapes made spurting motions across the starsprinkled indigo of the heavens tiny at this distance still everyone knew how big they really were knew what they really were here she comes zek breathed the flyer turning faceon to a low night wind that moaned from the west dropped lower it seemed to hover for a moment like a kite then dipped down and uncoiled its nest of springy worm legs to the earth it bumped gently down lowered its wings for stability the thing parked there swaying and nodding hugely gazing with vacuous disinterest first at the garden then down the sweeping ramps of the mountains to the plain then back to the garden karen dismounted came to the wall she was dressed or undressed to cause consternation as was her wont the two harrys jazz and zek met her there it was zeks impulse to hug her but she held back she saw that jazz was immediately shaken stricken by karens looks harry snr too awed by karens beauty it was an unearthly beauty of course for it was the work of her vampire but what it had given her in looks shape and desirability it had taken from her in the bloody fire of her eyes she was unmistakably wamphyri only the dweller seemed unmoved youve come to join us in the coming battle his voice was unemotional ive come to die with you she answered oh and is it that certain certain she repeated him if you believe in miracles pray for one for myself i dont care and she told them her dilemma reinforcing what zek foener had already made known how whichever way she jumped the wamphyri meant to be rid of her this wayat least ill take a few of them with me what of your trogs your lieutenants the dweller pressed her i activated my trogs turned them loose she answered my lieutenants as you call them are fainthearted dogs them i sent away maybe the lords have taken them on i neither know nor care your aerie stands empty aye youve sacrificed a lot no she tossed her head i have been sacrificed and now youd better make your final preparations you cant hear them but i can and theyre on their way shes right zek confirmed it their minds are lusting for war open to read like reading a monstrous book theyre coming the dweller nodded pointed to the four dark shapes squirting down through the darkening sky your warriors karen are they trustworthy they answer only my commands she answered then station two of them at the back of the saddle over the rise there and again he pointed and the other pair down there at the foot of the cliffs where the first trees grow there theyll form our protection some protection at least and theyll be wellpositioned for launching if the need should arise and how will you fight in the thick of it she swept back her diaphanous cloak from her right side took her gauntlet from her belt and thrust her right hand into it blades hooks and scythes gleamed silver in the bright starlight where she flexed the deadly thing adjusting its fit look jazz snapped i see them it was impossible not to see them the sky to the east was dark with dots large and small like the approach of a small swarm of locusts except while they were just as ravenous they were not small and they were not locusts everyone to his station the dweller cried are those lamps in order for answer all along the wall travellers turned on their batteries of ultraviolet lamps aiming them down into darkness they cut the night with their hot smoking beams the light wouldnt kill vampire flesh but they would hurt it greatly and blind wamphyri eyes however temporarily the dweller caught the elbow of a passing traveller what of your women and children he asked and my mother gone dweller the man answered down toward sunside where theyll stay until they know the outcome harry jnr turned to his father and the others he nodded grimly then were ready he said just as well jazz simmons answered for its already started he inclined his head down toward starside listen hoarse trog cries and the clamour of battle drifted up out of the shadows the roar and blast of gunfire too from a handful of trogs whose learning skills had been able to accommodate weapons harry jnr said well this was to be expected the lords have been massing their trogs along the fringes of these mountains for a long time now therell be many hundreds of thembut i may have their measure he turned to his father harry i could use some expert help just name it when did you last call up the dead harry took a pace back from the other his face falling but then he slowly nodded whatevers in your mind im ready when you are son he said they rode the mobius continuum down to the plain of boulders materializing clear of the mountains and their shadows up in the gloomy foothills where they met the mountains proper there they saw dustclouds boiling up from what could only be furious fighting also amidst the rumble and roil the occasional flash and crack of a discharged weapon the two harrys moved closer taking a short jump that brought them to the very fringe of the fighting and already it was clear that the dwellers trog troops were on the retreat a thin brave line of shuffling neanderthals they fell back under the massive assault of others just like them driven ever higher into the sullen foothills but in fact the wamphyri trogs were not like them because they were slaves and the dwellers trogs were free which was why they fought when harry jnr saw how it was going he groaned id like to save some of them if i can he said harry keogh necroscope closed his eyes and talked to the teeming dead of this strange world we need your help he begged of them you down there in the earth under the soil and down where the roots twine we need your help against a great injustice things stirred in the ground heard the desperate voice of a friend and tried to answer him who what help you but how can we help trogs said harry jnr before the wamphyri they roved over starside at will thousands of them lived and died here they were their own masters then and this was their land how about it harry spoke to them as he always spoke to the dead as his friends his equals even as his peers if youre dust then youre beyond helping us but if you can still hear me if you can understand then listen he told them what was required harry jnr too answering the stumbling questions of the dead the wamphyri you say some of us served them in life many of us many hundreds died in their wars false gods vile terrible masters but fight them how theyll destroy us again a second time you cant die twice harry and the dweller were desperate only your brothers can die and theyre doing it right now dying to hold back the troops of the wamphyri troops you mean trogs like us trogs yes said the dweller but slaves of the wamphyri death holds no terrors for such as them it is preferable to what they have now the dweller speaks truth some of harry jnrs own trogs recently dead in the fighting joined in we at least know you dweller and we gladly rise up again what of the rest of you harry snr cried will you not also rise up wake up now before its too late you have sons and grandsons and greatgrandsons who are fighting even now join us in this last great battle against your immemorial vampire oppressors in the cliffs backing these foothills in ancient cavern burial grounds the preserved mummified bodies of a thousand trogs stirred groped upward tore free of the clinging soil under the trees lone graves gave up their dead behind the massed wamphyri trogs where they drove back the defenders freshly dead cadavers sat up forced their riven bodies to move shuffled or crawled toward their vampirecontrolled enemies the stench of the pit filled the air they came from the shadows from mildewed graves and niches from all their many resting places beyond life the dwellers trog forces when they saw what now battled on their side even though they were on their side hemming the invaders in all about broke in terror and fled for their secret places no matter the grim army of the dead would do their work for them and they would win for as the necroscopes had pointed out they couldnt die twice shrieks of terror split the night wrenched from hundreds of wamphyritrog throats when they saw and understood what they were fighting sickened the two harrys turned away from the carnage but son said harry snr grasping the others arm look the sky was dark with wamphyri flyers and warriors they circled the garden descending toward it and some of the warriors were truly gigantic any five of them falling on the garden in unison would totally obscure and obliterate it up there in the mountains even now a greater battle was about to be waged they took their own special route back to the garden warriors had already landed below the cliffs fronting the wall where the lady karens creatures were now locked in hellish combat with them their shrieking and bellowing alone was deafening other warriors circled looking for an opening in the ultraviolet searchlight beams which swept the sky and seared their hides up on a certain peak mirrorweapons blinked out as lesk the glut deliberately crashed his flyer down on the travellers who sweated and swore and died there but theyd seen him coming before his flyer struck they had turned their shotguns on it pumping shot after shot at both beast and rider right to the end lesk wounded and more dangerous than ever goaded his halfcrippled beast to slither free of the peak directed it in an insane suicide dive on the heart of the garden he was seen smoking raybeams converged blindingly on him his flyer felt artificial sunlight eating at its hide burning in its many eyes it reared back from its headlong dive pulled up swooped low over the garden then someone threw a grenade which exploded directly in front of the beast with its spatulate head blazing screaming like a safetyvalve under high pressure it swooped to earth struck the wall and carried a great section of it away and with it several defenders the creatures huge manta body tore up the earth somersaulted like a derailed train hurled lesk out of the saddle other flyers swept down out of the darkness on the periphery they crashed among the greenhouses and allotments floundered in the pools down from their backs sprang lieutenants of shaithis belath and volse to create carnage within the garden itself jazz simmons saw them he tracked them with tracers and streams of exploding shells two at least ducked away into the shadows and smoke to commence their task of cold butchery on whichever travellers or trogs they should come across jazz saw harry and his son on the balcony of the latters house they watched the battle he breathlessly called up hows it going in the glare and sweep of hot beams the booming of automatic weapons howling of monsters and cries of men it was hard to say we should be in this harry said to his son no the other shook his head were the last resort harry didnt understand but he trusted zek came running caught jazzs arm where he stood by the dwellers house look she cried high overhead a warrior dragged some bloated puffing incredible thing through the sky a second warrior higher was similarly burdened scything searchlight beams cut across them and zek gasped gasbeasts what jazz gaped he saw the bloated thing cut loose begin drifting like some obscene balloon down toward the garden the thing drifted a little northward over the wall where the battery of searchlights was concentrated the beams picked it out centered upon it and it began to smoke puffing black evaporation and clouds of steam it settled faster toward earth jazz saw the strategy aw he cried then he grabbed zek threw her down and hurled himself on top of her the gasbeast a living creature once a man issued a hissing highpitched scream as its skin blackened and ruptured and then it blew itself to bits with all the force of a thousandpound bomb the raygunners directly underneath it died instantly in the blast their bodies and equipment flattened at a stroke onethird of the dwellers defences had been wiped out a foul stinking hot wind blew across the garden and when it cleared jazz helped zek to her feet the dwellers house was still standing but all of its windows had been blown in and half of its roof was missing harry and his son had ducked inside the space under the eaves in the moment before the blast now they came out white and shaken more warriors had landed at the back of the saddle there they fought with karens creatures overwhelming and quickly silencing them but there were travellers back there and they were armed with grenades lobbing their deadly eggs they gave the warriors blow for blow lieutenants of the wamphyri seemed to be ravaging in every quarter of the garden their wargauntlets drenched in traveller blood the night was covered with smoke and stench split by shotgun blasts made still more hellish in the surreal slash of searing light and long moments of total blindness down by the shattered wall the lady karen saw something coming up out of the smokefilled depression it crawled but as it reached level ground reared up and charged it was the mad lord lesk bloodiest of all the wamphyri almost fully recovered and little the worse for his wounds and the tumble hed taken he saw karen rushed upon her full of nightmare intent she thrust aside a dazed traveller and turned his lamps beam full in lesks hideous face blinding his eye he cursed clapped a hand to his face came on and kicked the lamp from her grasp halfblind he turned his left side toward her glared his fury from the lidless eye in his shoulder but as he swung his gauntlet so his body turned with the swing and he again lost sight of her she ducked under lesks arcing blow tore away the flesh and ribs from his left side with one raking razorsharp swipe of her own gauntlet he cried out staggered gasped his amazement he felt fumblingly with his free hand at the terrible damage to his body his heart pounded like a great yellow bellows plainly visible against the dark pulsing sac of his exposed left lung travellers leaped on him tried to trip him and drag him down while he roared and raged karen stepped in and grasped his naked heart with her awesome weaponhand she cut the hearts pipes and tore it out of his body he coughed blood puffed himself upand toppled like a felled tree the travellers fell on him like wolves beheaded him poured oil on his body and set fire to it lesk went up in flames meanwhile a second gasbeast had come drifting directly toward the dwellers house the two harrys fled the place encountered a pair of wamphyri lieutenants in their way their strategy in dealing with them proved their kinship they let the grinning gauntleted vampires close with them and charge then ducked through mobius doors as their pursuers plunged into that unknown realm directly on their heels so they closed the doors and exited through others the lieutenants had simply disappeared perhaps faint echoes of their screams came back to be quickly drowned in the row and confusion of battle the mewling gasbeast over the dwellers house was hit by a stray burst of gunfire it exploded with a devastating roar demolishing the place and sending out a great rush of vile stench warriors were coming over the saddle behind the settlement another crashed down on the low structure housing harry jnrs generators the remaining ultraviolet lamps blinked out leaving only a handful of lanterns and starlight to light the reeling night the bellowing voices of the lords belath and menor maimbite sounded inside the garden from overhead the lord shaithis shouted down instructions still reeling from the gasbeast blast harry clutched his sons arm you said we were a last resort he breathlessly reminded him whatever you meant by that whatevers on your mind youd better say it now father the other answered in the mobius continuum even thought has weight and you and i were linked wherever we are in the mobius continuum we know each other harry nodded of course ive done things with and to the continuum that youve never dreamed of the dweller continued but innocently without boasting i can send more than mere thoughts through it as long as theres someone to receive what i send in this instance however what i must send is dangerous not to you but to me i dont follow you desperately aware that the battle was being lost harry licked suddenly dry lips shook his head but you will quickly the dweller explained ive got you harry said but wont it hurt the garden the travellers im not sure a little perhaps nothing serious or lasting but you should get the lady karen out of the way he went running back to the ruins of his house found a shimmering metallic robe of foil where hed stored it and put it on it covered him from head to toe with tinted glass discs for his eyes ive used it before he said out beyond the stars now youd better see to karen harry had followed him said where will i find you here ill wait for you harry used the mobius continuum and went to the wall men with flamethrowers were hosing down a stricken warrior karen fought with a lieutenant dispatching him even as harry arrived dont question this he said come quickly he caught her up stepped through a mobius door emerged down on the plain of boulders at a safe distance from the glaring sphere gate dazed she swayed for a moment and her scarlet eyes went round as saucers how which is your stack he asked her she pointed and he caught her to him again harry left her in her deserted aerie returned to the garden his son was waiting do you understand the dweller wanted to know yes harry nodded lets get on with it they entered the mobius continuum and harry jnr moved away very quickly across the mountains to sunside and from there to the sun he stood off from that monstrous furnace in deep space opened a mobius door harry heard his hiss of torment also his directed thought now harry opened a mobius door on the garden trapped and fixed it there let his son redirect and pour sunlight through the mobius continuum and out through harrys door the garden was at once bathed in intense glaring golden light harry turned the door like the gunturret of a tank sending his shaft of concentrated sunlight sliding across the garden the beam struck warriors where they ravaged forward across the saddle it ate into them like acid devouring their vampire flesh for this was sunlight but not thinned by distance not diluted by atmosphere it was the essence of the sun the monsters melted boiled away and slumped down into sticky black pools ahhh the dwellers agony was a fire in its own right burning in his fathers mind the beam shut off gave harry time to recoup rest from the task of holding steady and controlling his mobius door son his anxious thoughts went out along the mobius way are you all right noyes yes im all right give me a moment harry waited conjured a door and looked out he chose new targets the lords belath and menor where they came striding through a host of panicking travellers swatting them like flies now harry fixed the door guided his sons sunblast through it the brilliant beam fell on belath and menor like a solid shaft of gold it superheated them blew away their skins and flesh in writhing stinking evaporation as the travellers scrambled wildly away from them they exploded into tatters of smouldering vileness harry turned his beam to the north found a warrior in midair descending toward the defenders at the wall he shrivelled the thing before it could come too close reduced it to a tarry fireball that fell well beyond the cliffs other warriors were overhead and flyers with their startled riders harry swung the door horizontally turned its beam into a giant searchlight the sun shone upwards from the earth monstrous debris rained from the sky and ahhh again the beam was shut off son son harry cried into the mobius continuum let that be an end to it theyre beaten moving off stop now before you kill yourself no the others mobius voice was a shudder they must never recover from this go down onto the boulder plain close to their stacks harry understood he did as directed now the dwellers beam reached out and licked at the base of shaithiss stack it played there for a moment blazed in across bony balconies and through cartilage windows found the gasbeasts in their places in an uncontrollable chainreaction of living bombs the stacks base exploded outwards hurling rock bones cartilage carcasses and all far out onto the plain the stack teetered crumpled downward into itself toppled falling it flew apart but before its gigantic sections could strike earth already harry had redirected his beam and one by one the aeries were brought crashing down on the shuddering plain reduced to rubble erased twice more during the work the dweller cried out and the beam was shut off but in the end only the lady karens stack remained and let it be harry jnr whispered father and son went back to the garden they emerged as the smoke and reek were lifting and as the dazed travellers and their friends from a different world looked all about them and rubbed grime from stinging eyes the dwellers cloak of foil had fused to his body smouldering he swayed there a moment a black and silver thing that groped blindly as it took a single pace forward then crumpled into its fathers arms in what would have been three days earthtime the news was the dweller would recover it was the vampire in him which given time would repair the damage hed suffered but harry snr knew he could never take his son or brenda back to the world where they were born harry jnr was wamphyri however different from the others still he must stay here forever indeed he wanted to stay here this was his place now his territory which hed fought and paid dearly for and of course he could never be sure how things would go butthe lady karen was different too for the moment anyway also if what harry had heard about her was true shed one day be more dangerous than all the others put together he cared nothing for her but he did care for his son and an idea had formed in his mind leaving the dweller in the care of jazz zek and the everfaithful travellers harry went to karens aerie it was memorable when he left the garden because for one thing there was gold on the peaks again and also he had witnessed a strange reunion wolf his paws bleeding had made the crossing to find his mistress no vampire in him just a great deal of love and a lot of faith thered been another perhaps even more joyous reunion too along with wolf had come a weary lardis lidesci and a handful of his people the last warrior the horror at perchorsk following the battle at the dwellers garden shaithis of the wamphyri guided his halfcrippled seared flyer for home he fancied the creature wouldnt make it not for all his goading for it was burned all along its underbelly and dripping fluids like rain he too had taken a dose of direct sunlight but had been nimbleminded enough to throw himself down on his flyers back in the trench of horny ridges formed of its huge wing muscles the blast had come as shaithiss creature was turning away from the garden after a trial landing run and so hed not been blinded but still hed felt the hideous searing heat of the true sun and so had known that the dweller could not be defeated his weapons were simply too powerful beyond wamphyri understanding and certainly beyond their control which together with the loss of his lieutenants and warriors had convinced shaithis that the attack was a pointless exercise wamphyri losses had been devastating and the survivors had come to the same conclusion as shaithis quitting the fight en masse and heading for home down across the starside plain theyd flown their creatures many limping all humiliated and shaithis had felt their hatred of him beating like hammer blows on his psychic wamphyri mind they blamed him for their losses for hed been the one who instigated the attack their selfappointed leader in the abortive affray generals who lose are rarely feted mainly scorned on the way east using the halfdome of the shining sphere for pharos and rolling in his saddle shaithis had seen fess ferenc and volse pinescu go down fluttering out of the sky on flyers finally too weak to resist gravitys pull and hed watched them crash in clouds of dust far below on the moonsilvered plain the lords must finish the rest of their journey afoot for shaithis doubted theyd have strength for flight metamorphosis he certainly wouldnt if his flyer were to succumb still walking had to be better than dying the lords belath and lesk the glut grigis and menor maimbite lascula longtooth and tor tornbody were missing along with many lesser wamphyri lights of warriors there were none to be seenno shaithis corrected himself one only one spurting through the sky eastward acting of its own volition doubtless its master was dead and now it returned to the only home it knew as for lieutenants where were they gone gone with the flyers the warriors the trogs gone with all dreams of conquest and revenge only a dozen flyers left in all the sky exhausted gliding where they caught the thermals and desperate to conserve energy carrying their lords whole or crippled bearing them back to their stacks and theirtheir aeries crossing over the glaring dome of the gate shaithis had lifted his blackened face to peer ahead and hed seen the unbelievable the unthinkable of all the mighty stacks of the wamphyri only one remained standing and that was the stack of the treacherous karen fury galvanized him karen that motherbearing bitch he hauled on the reins lifted the head of his flyer and turned it towards karens stack his creature tried its manta wings pulsed once twice three times pulsed feebly at the air then quivered mightily and formed a shallow v the thing was barely alive its fluids were gone and there was nothing left to power it the glide grew steeper swifter and nothing to be done about it at the last moment shaithis bellowed frantic mental commands into his creatures dull dying mind dragged on the reins until he thought theyd surely snap the beasts head slowly came up and its wings adopted a more nearly aerodynamic profile it swooped levelled out tilted to one side the debrislittered plain became a dizzy whirling surreal kaleidoscope of rushing landscape then the creatures inner wingtip struck the stump of a stack accelerating its spin its master was hurled from the saddle felt bones break in his left arm and shoulder tasted dust and his own blood where his face ploughed the plain and rocks broke his teeth long moments passed silent except for shaithiss pounding heartbeat and the worst of the pain slowly ebbed finally gasping and swaying he staggered to his feet shook his gauntletclad right hand at karens lone stack he cursed it long and loud her aerie stood as a sure sign of her treachery she was the dwellers bought and paid for a vengeful snarl twisted shaithiss broken features more yet well and when she returned from the dwellers garden ah but then thered be a reckoning a reckoning aye long and lusty and bloody bloody bloody and oh so very sweet he took a stumbling step in the direction of her stack and froze descending toward that solitary needle of rock that last wamphyri aerie was the warrior hed previously noted he groaned as it squirted in through the dark mouth of her launching bay her warrior and while she lived it would defend her aerie to the last against all comers even against shaithis of the wamphyri himself how shaithis raved then ranted and raved and no one at all to hear him but a flock of great bats familiar creatures who doubtless questioned the whereabouts of their crevice colonies in the stricken wamphyri stacks the moon raced on across the sky and shaithis grew quiet and became still his shadow passed through the vertical and began to lengthen on the other side when it was as long as shaithis himself then his shoulders slumped and he turned and headed for the shattered farflung ruins hed once called home weary and hollowcheeked with half of his body seared several broken bones and his face crushed and burned on one side the oncegreat lord shaithis of the wamphyri drew nigh the base of that mighty outcrop that towering rock now gone forever which had housed him for all of his five and a half centuries in the stump itself there hed had his workshops the vast vats where with great cunning hed forced and moulded metamorphic flesh creating his warriors flyers gaslings siphoneers and various types of cartilage creature down there if the massy ceiling had not fallen in upon it a freshly formed flyer was even now mewling and floundering in its vat once a traveller soon it would travel again and at least shaithis would have a mount there too hed find his pitthings metamorphosed travellers and trogs mindless criers in perpetual night the raw materials of his warriors and the other creatures hed made well they could leap in their pits wail and gibber stiffen eventually fossilize he cared not at all overhead the last of the wamphyri were silently flying north heading out across the icelands for those dark regions on the roof of the world where the sun never shone at all when his flyer was ready then shaithis would join them there the legends had it that if one crossed the polar cap and kept going then hed find more mountains new territories to conquer no one in living memory had tested the legends however for the great stacks had been the places of the wamphyri their immemorial homes butthat was yesterday and now it appeared that the legends were to be tested in full so be it as shaithis went to descend a shattered stairwell his good eye detected a movement in the rubble and he heard a muffled moan someone here alive in the ruins of his aerie shaithis picked his way over tumbled blocks of stone and bony debris came to a tangle of shiny cartilage and fractured rock where a hand and arm protruded from a gap the hand groped blindly about clawed uselessly at rough stone from below came a halfconscious moaning for a moment shaithis was puzzled a lord even the lowliest lieutenant would have dug his way out by now but eventually he smiled a grim smile and nodded his recognition of the trapped man karl the vampires false smile disappeared as quickly as it had come helllander ah but ive several large scores to settle with helllanders he tore away blocks of stone and weirdly fused cartilage masses reached down into darkness and drew vyotsky out his handling of the russian wasnt gentle especially since both of vyotskys legs were broken below the knees he cried out no no oh god my legs shaithis shook him mercilessly until his agonized eyes popped open your legs he hissed your legs man look at me he sat vyotsky down on a flat stone surface let fall his cloak to expose his ravaged body slowly turned in a circle for the others inspection trembling in his own extreme of pain still the russian winced at the extent of shaithiss injuries aye shaithis agreed pretty isnt it vyotsky said nothing continued to hold himself upright where he sat by pressing down on the rocks surface with the flats of his spread palms in this way he kept pressure off his trembling jelly legs now karl said shaithis facing him squarely it seems to me that i remember a conversation we had that time when we almost caught your fellow helllanders before the dwellers intervention you remember vyotsky said nothing wished he could faint but in any case knew that he didnt dare do so his agony was great but if he collapsed now the odds were that hed never wake up again he gasped closed his eyes as a fresh wave of pain burned upwards through his body from his shattered legs you dont remember said shaithis in mock surprise he lifted his gauntlet clenched and unclenched his hand opened the weapon wide so that the russian could see its dozens of cutting edges a single blow from that would flense a mans entire face vyotsky knew or crush his skull like an eggshell well i do remember the vampire lord continued and it seems to me i warned you then what i would do if you should ever again attempt to flee from me i said i would give you to my favourite warrior all except your heart which i would eat myself surely you remember that vyotskys eyes were wide now and his lips trembled to match his straining arms alas said shaithis but i no longer have a warrior and so cant keep my promise but i would you may believe me except of course we do not know that you were fleeing ah but i also remember telling gustan that he was to carry you with him upon his flyer when we went to sack the dwellers garden could it be that gustan forgot my command a shame for i so wanted you to be there to witness the way i would have dealt with the woman zek and the man jazz on the other handperhaps you were hiding waiting for us to leave before making a break for it vyotsky managed to shake his head in silent denial ii he stuttered oh indeed shaithis nodded smiling hideously ii and as his smile once more slid from his face he reached down a second time into the space where the russian had been trapped and this time he drew out vyotskys smg and a leather sack containing provisions again vyotsky moaned out load closing his eyes and swaying where he sat racked with pain but shaithis only burst out laughing slapping his thigh as at some rich joke then abruptly stopped laughing reached out with his gauntlet and slapped vyotsky across the knees for shaithis by his standards the blow was the merest tap light as the touch of a feather it ripped open vyotskys combatsuit trousers tore away his kneecaps in a red welter he did faint then toppling sideways off the flat stone but shaithis caught him up before he could further injure himself then without further pause the vampire tossed him over his good shoulder and proceeded with him down into the black bowels of his workshops below it was not as bad as shaithis had thought it might be parts of the stone and cartilage ceiling had collapsed here and there and several of the protoplasmic things in their deep pits had been blocked in so that their mindless cries were made faint by masses of fallen stone but in the main all was in order the larger vats were undamaged and shaithiss new flyer uninjured it mewled when it saw him bending its glistening spatulate armoured head in his direction soon the liquids in its vat would all be absorbed into it and then its skin would form into membranous leather after that a training flight and finally shaithis would be ready to undertake his great journey northwards before then however there was one last task he must perform one final act of vengeance in this place he had admitted to the helllander karl vyotsky that his warriors were all dead well and so they were but that was not to say he couldnt make another indeed the making of warriors and other beasts was an art of the wamphyri and certainly shaithis was a great artist moreover he had the necessary materials right here ah but this one would be the warrior in a recent experiment shaithis had created a small creature of such primitive slyness and insidious vileness that his creation had surprised even him the small mind of a trog with some subtle alterations had governed the thing if governed was the word while its principal physical component had not been manflesh but that of wild creatures the tissues of a great bat and a feral wolf had featured strongly together with protoplasmic flesh from shaithiss pitthings but twice the creature had escaped which in the end prompted him to put it down and have done with it indeed it would not have been prudent to let it live not here anyway not and chance the other wamphyri lords learning of it for while nature often gave wild creatures a vampire egg it was generally deemed unseemly for the wamphyri themselves to perform such experiments and yet shaithis had done just that slighted by a lesser lord hed challenged and killed him and so earned the right to burn his remains instead he had brought the body here to his workshop cut out the vampire within and transplanted its egg into his creature but when he saw how uncontrollable was the thing then hed sent it through the gate it had seemed to him a grand jest that his creature should take its own brand of hell with it into the helllands ah but that was before he realized just how hellish the helllands were shaithis little doubted now but that all his troubles stemmed from that unknown place beyond the shining spheregate perhaps even the dweller himself had his origin there which was why he would now create the warrior of all warriors and who could say perhaps it might even be the last warrior aye and when they saw what he had sent them then the wizards of that world would think again before sending their hirelings adventuring here so thinking shaithis tossed karl vyotskys limp form down onto the great slab of stone which was his workbench then went to fetch the other ingredients of his work and certain instruments with which to fuse them it was a long job sunup came and went and a new sundown was beginning finally shaithis was done he inspected with some satisfaction the thing heaving and hissing where it waxed in its enormous trench of a vat striding down the length of it and admiring the rapid formation of a deadly array of weapons then into its groping vestigial mind he implanted those commands which would form its one aim its single goal in life and left it to fend for itself emerging in a very little while the warrior would discover the pitthings and devour them and find its way out of here the exit might well be too small for it by then but shaithis could not doubt that this warrior would make it bigger in the interim he had tested his flyer the beast was better than any before it fit steed for the long journey ahead first however shaithis would gaze once more upon the face of that mother of all treachery the beautiful face of the lady karen he flew to her aerie and without hostility began circling it calling to her in the way of the wamphyri until she came to a window so karen he called from where he rode a gusting wind then you are the last or maybe the first still no matter we are all undone because of you shaithis she answered of all the great wamphryi liars you are the greatest you even lie to yourself you blame me for your troubles or whoever else it takes your fancy to blame when in fact you know that you alone have brought the wamphryi to this end and in any case what care you for them nothing you care only for the lord shaithis ah youre a cold cruel creature karen he nodded and scowled at her across an abyss of air merely accurate she answered do you think i did not know your plans for me the truth is that you underestimated shaithis you underestimated me the dweller everything you were so bloated up with your own schemes and lust for ultimate domination that you considered yourself beyond defeat well and now we see how wrong you were he flew closer all of his great fury visible in his partlyhealed face until she cautioned ware shaithis i have a warrior its but the work of a second to launch him he drew back aye i have seen it but do you call that a warrior i doubt if it would have my measure not if i was the whole man which i will be one day are you in a position to threaten he glared at her saw that a second face had appeared at her window ah and you even managed to save a companion for yourself he said a lieutenant lover to warm you through all the lonely time ahead no doubt buti dont recognize this one now tell me who is he i speak for myself harry keogh answered im a helllander shaithis the father of the one you call the dweller shaithis gasped drew back further yet but in a little while his courage returned from what he knew of the dweller and his sort if they were desperate to have him dead then he would be dead perhaps they were satisfied with what they had done curiosity overcame all and shaithis flew his beast closer tell me one thing he called out why did you come here to destroy the wamphryi harry shook his head that was the way it worked out thats all and then he remembered a promise hed made maybe you should ask instead who sent me shaithis nodded say on his name was belos harry said and he told me tell them belos sent you it meant nothing to shaithis who had never been much of a one for studying the legends and histories he frowned shrugged turned his beast away and headed north the winds carried back to them his final word farewell but they knew he didnt mean it chingiz khuv accompanied by two of his kgb men was on his way to the failsafe control centre it was almost am and khuvs shift would last for six hours when hed be relieved by the next failsafe duty officer the wee small hours of the morning but here in the projekt time didnt mean a lot except that it was rapidly running down for khuv for his commando platoon maybe even for the projekt itself these were khuvs thoughts as he marched the steel and rubber corridors with his men flanking him one of them was armed with a machinegun the other had a flamethrower khuv himself carried only his issue automatic but the safetycatch was off where it sat snug in its holster eight days khuv thought eight days of sheer hell tomorrow he had no official duties and could rest but the day after thatthat was when he and his platoon were scheduled to be on their way through the gate that in itself the preparations worrying about what was waiting in there and on the other side would be troubles enough but of course in the thirtysix hours between times there would also be the small matter of staying alive the perchorsk projekt had always been claustrophobic its magmass levels had been eerie frightening places ever since the accident which spawned them and there was always the fear of further nightmare incursions from the gate but at least the creeping horror of the magmass was a familiar one and the dangers of the gate were known and appreciated now however the entirely unknown had entered into it and someone or something was loose in the projekt which struck and disappeared without trace and which so far seemed quite invulnerable it wasnt simply a case of stopping it first it had to be found for since the night of the triple murderwell things had only got worse now to any outsider entering perchorsk for the first time it would seem a place of total madness the main exit was guarded day and night by half a dozen men with a variety of weapons people no longer moved about singly but in pairs or even threes every face wore a strained look with eyes hollow and bloodshot their gaunt owners given to violent starts at every smallest unaccustomed sound a terror had settled on perchorsk and there seemed no way to break its hold it had started with the deaths of the kgb men rublev and roborov and the psychic locator leo grenzel god alone knew where it would end khuv thought back on the string of murders since those first three a lab technician had been next during a latenight power failure as he was clearing up in his lab something had entered in the darkness crushing his windpipe to a pulp and crumpling his face and forehead with what must have been a single terrific blow it had looked as though a giant bulldog grip had been allowed to snap shut on his face and the front of his head agursky had given his opinion that it was the work of a maniac with a tool of some sort possibly a portable powervise from the workshops next had been a pair of soldiers going off duty leaving the core and passing through the magmass levels where theyd encountered something which they shot at the shots had been heard of course and the bodies of the two eventually discovered their throats had been torn out and theyd been stuffed into one of the magmass holes an examination had shown that under the massive bruising many bones had been broken and the spinal columns dislocated then the night before last one of khuvs remaining four kgb men had gone missing and still hadnt been found and just three hours ago that one was one of the worst the body of klara orlova a theoretical physicist working closely with luchovs team of scientists had been discovered in one of the ventilation shafts dangling upsidedown from the pulley cables her throat too had been ripped out and as with many of the other cases there hadnt seemed to be very much blood around khuv had barely arrived at the scene of that one when he was called on the double to the telepath paul savinkovs room the door a lightweight timber frame with a thin metal skin had a fistsized hole in it and was hanging halfwrenched from its hinges inside was savinkov crumpled in a corner like a discarded doll and hideously broken although the snapping of his bones must have sounded out like a series of gunshots apparently no one had heard a thing but at least this time it was seen how the murderer was wily as well as immensely strong and brutal the cable to savinkovs telephone had been cut outside his room in the corridor the killer had been taking no chances that he might try to summon help which seemed to prove vasily agurskys theory the murders were the work of a powerful cunning madman or at least a human being by then however it had been time for khuv to prepare himself for his duty at failsafe control hed left gustav litve in charge of the new cases and gone to change into clothes suitable for the long shift ahead and now that shift was about to commence approaching failsafe control khuv and his men heard footsteps behind them turned on their heels to see gustav litve coming at a run whitefaced he was thrusting a sheet of paper before him waving it at khuv comrade major he gasped drawing close this is it i found it stuffed down the back of savinkovs chair the paper was a little crumpled khuv smoothed it against the wall saw shaky lines written in pencil they said ive been checking all the staff one by one i would have done it sooner but andrei roborov saw it with his own eyes and what he saw wasnt human so i thought it must be something from the gate something wed missed then i thought how is it that with all these espers we cant find the intruder maybe it was shielding itself psychically maybe it was hiding behind its own mindscreens but if it could do that then i should be able to detect the shields grenzel would be proud of me i found it he would have done it better of course which is why it stopped him how i did it i found an area where there were no telepathic readings where there was powerful psychic interference it was the mortuary i checked to be double sure and found id been wrong but then i got the same sort of reading in the accommodation area in the scientific section i narrowed it down its agursky he keeps the bodies in the mortuary he must have been in there when i checked the place the first time and he was in his room when i went there a few minutes ago i managed to contact his mind and i think he recognized me but be sure hes the thing that roborov saw my telephone is out of order i think theres someone outside if i listen at the the note stopped right there khuv read it again his eyes wide skipping over the words something of the meaning of the thing sank in and he felt the short hairs stiffen at the back of his neck his blood seemed to turn to ice in his veins but he forced himself to leap toward the heavy metal door of failsafe control and hammer on it yelling viktor open up for gods sake direktor luchov was on duty redeyed he came to the door and opened it was bowled backwards as khuv burst in what in the name of read this said khuv thrusting savinkovs note at him its something of a dying declaration things are beginning to add up making a monstrous sort of sense savinkov seems to be saying that theres a connection between vasily agursky and the thing he kept in that tank of his i still dont know what its all about but im damned well going to find out now listen viktor get on the phone lets have no alarms for that would only alert him but i want everyone looking for agursky god ive known there was something weird about him for weeks ever sincesince luchov stared at him said since that time when he had his breakdown when they found him down there in the things room poor vasily and he always seemed to me such a harmless little man well hes not harmless now khuv snapped right were off to find him put the word about if anyone gets to him first theyre to hold him by any means possible and if they cant hold him they must kill him also by any means possible he ushered his men out of the room called over his shoulder searchparties in threes viktor for gods sake dont let anyone tackle him alone the mortuary was situated off the main perimeter corridor above the magmass levels in its time it had housed the victims of the perchorsk incident and for a while it had been a cold storehouse but right now it was a mortuary again and agursky was the only one with a key on their way to the place khuv and litve had separated from the other two kgb men litve had commandeered one of the projekts flamethrowers from its bracket on a wall and the major had equipped himself with a snubnosed submachine gun taken from a reluctant soldier theyd been to agurskys laboratory and found it locked with the lighted sign over its door proclaiming it vacant likewise agurskys room which khuv had opened with skeleton keys agursky could be anywhere in the complex but they might as well try the mortuary all of the bodies from the murders were down there on ice where agursky had supposedly been examining them word of the manhunt had not got down to the core and the magmass levels were silent as usual khuv and litve looked down there for a moment down to where the lights were low and the wormholeriddled walls moulded into weird shapes before turning off along the short straight corridor through solid rock to the door of the mortuary it was locked but it wasnt a security door khuvs keys opened it they swung the door wide and stepped inside and litve went to put on the lights they didnt come on the lightbulbs had been removed from their fixtures in the low ceiling a little light filtered in from the corridor khuv and litve stood just inside the open doorway glanced at each other then at the tables against the wall and at the long narrow boxes on the tables at the back of the mortuary machinery made a slow regular breathing sound sending frigid air circulating other than that there was no sound no motion the room was a giant refrigerator litve primed his flamethrower lit the pilot light its blue flicker threw the shadows back a little major litve said his voice nervous and echoing theres nowhere he could hide in here lets go khuv tucked his elbows in and shivered he blew into the palm of his free hand all right he said but dont be in such a hurry he turned in a slow circle paused for a moment to watch his breath pluming in the air then he relaxed a little ok well make for the and again he paused listening intently after a moment did you hear something litve listened shook his head just the pumps back there khuv stepped toward the makeshift coffins where they lined the walls while were here he said it might be a good idea to check on what agurskys been up to you dont know him quite as well as i do he shivered again but not from the cold he has funny ways with dead bodies that one with litve moving up beside him he looked into the first casket klara orlova had been brought down white as a candle and stark naked she lay there the gash across her neck which went from ear to ear looked like a black velvet choker on a young girl it would have looked erotic if one was unaware that in fact it was a fatal wound the two men stepped to the next box the contorted face of a young soldier still silently screaming looked up at them god khuv thought youd think someone would have closed his eyes the next box was empty and as khuv moved on litve quickly crossed the room to where a box stood on its own on a separate table it had a lid loosely laid on top which he lifted down on khuvs side of the room the next box contained the second soldier his face was a raw red mess completely unrecognizable two more boxes to go khuv made to move on and across the room litve drew breath in a shocked gasp erich he said what khuv strode over to where he stood litve seemed frozen in horror but he was right the man in the box was the missing kgb agent erich bildarev he was naked and of course dead the ribs over his heart were crushed in as badly as if hed fallen on a bear trap khuv grasped litves arm more for support than any other reason his breath came faster making a string of tiny plumes at last he managed to gasp thats the last bit of proof we needed savinkov was right agurskys our man then across the room someone something said ahhh jesus jesus litve cried out going into a crouch and whirling to look across the room khuv turned with him his eyes bulging to penetrate the gloom the last two coffins lay there their contents as yet uninspected but even as the two men clung together and stared so there was movement a tiny plume of air rose up from the first coffin and another from the second and andrei roborov and nikolai rublev sat up in their boxes and stared back at them their injuries visible even in the poor light said that this could not be but it could be it was rublevs cheek was absent from the left side of his face so that the left eye gazed from a bony orbit the cadaverous roborovs skull dripped pus and brain fluid which crept like wax down his pallid cheeks they sat there in their coffins stared then smiled and their upper eyeteeth curved down like fangs over their lower lips khuv tried to gasp oh god oh my god but his tongue had stuck to the roof of his mouth the eyes of the dead men no of the corpses the undead men were pits of glowing sulphur cratered with blood and they continued to smile burn them khuv finally managed to gasp quickly man burn them oh said a sly familiar voice from the door then you must hope that your flamethrower is not one of the many which i have emptied they looked that way saw vasily agursky step back out into the corridor and close the door his key grated in the lock agursky wait khuv yelled after him oh no major came agurskys faint answer youve found me out and so theres no more time for waiting his footsteps rapidly faded meanwhile roborov and rublev had climbed out of their coffins khuv saw them ran for the door astonished that his legs obeyed him he hoped his hands would do the same as he went he took his keys from a pocket trying to distinguish the right one from its feel at the door fumbling with the bunch of keys he glanced back the two dead men were advancing on litve their hands starting to reach for him khuv shouted from a sandpaper throat what are you waiting for you idiot burn them burn the fucking things litve came out of his trance aimed his weapon and squeezed the trigger nothing the flamethrower hissed but that was all the pilotlight flickered jesus litve screamed he came scrambling dodged roborov where he went to grab him khuv had tried half of his keys in the neardarkness he couldnt make out which was which he wrenched the ones hed tried from the key ring and hurled them down litve clawed at him gasping open the door for gods sake open the door khuv shoved him away thrust his remaining keys at him you open it he shouted he cocked his submachine gun turned it toward the vampires where they came almost mincingly forward out of the mortuarys shadows roborovs smile was malicious as he said why comrade major i do believe that this is the first time ive seen you in a real flap has something upset you get back khuv shrilly warned back rublev seemed to mimic him have we offended in some way major but thats too too bad they were almost within arms reach and still litve babbled and cursed while he tried to find the right key khuv fired a deafening cacophony of sound in the enclosed space he squeezed the trigger of his gun and kept it squeezed until the stink of cordite stung his eyes and clawed the back of this throat then he released it and as the fumes cleared saw the two where his sleeting lead had picked them up and hurled them halfway across the room they lay there moaning but even as he stared in disbelief they were struggling to rise up again litve gave a sobbing gasp and the key he was trying turned in the lock he yanked the door open stumbled outside khuv was right on his heels as the major came he stooped to retrieve litves discarded weapon litve locked the door and both of them leaned on it khuv scowling while he checked the flamethrower over you can tell by its weight that its loaded he said what he pointed a shaking finger at the mixlever on the stock look you were giving it too much air and not enough juice fool he adjusted the lever aimed the weapon along the corridor and fired a jet of flame instantly roared out white at its core and tapering to a shimmering blue tip he killed the flame said now open that door litve unlocked the door kicked it open and stood back roborov and rublev were on their feet advancing behind them the young soldiers were also out of their boxes khuv didnt wait for further developments he turned all four to shrieking crackling torches burned them until they collapsed melted them to bubbling crumpled stinking piles of fused flesh then as litve once more locked the door he turned away and fought to retain his control fought desperately not to be ill grenzel wasnt in there said litve that pulled khuv out of it thats right he choked the words out holding up a hand to his mouth which means there are two of them on the loose where to now litve was in control of himself again and now that the immediate horror had been dealt with khuvs mind got back in gear and began working with its usual efficiency perhaps too efficiently his bottom jaw fell open and he grabbed litves arm then released him and set off down the rock corridor at a run where to he called back where would you go if you were agursky or grenzel what would you do eh litve came running after him we know what they are khuv cried he knows well burn him if we can he cant let any of us live theres only one place he can go of course failsafe control inferno harry and karen chingiz khuv and gustav litve raced for their lives for the lives of all concerned through the serpentine bowels of the perchorsk projekt and toward failsafe control at any moment they expected dreaded to hear the failsafe klaxons starting up they realized what would happen when the klaxons did sound the panic horror the mad futile scramble and mainly the nightmare of more than one hundred people waking staggering from their beds opening doors to see liquid death spraying from the sprinklers and hear the roaring of a rushing allconsuming inferno for if vasily agursky or the thing he had become got to failsafe control before themit was obvious what he would do save himself and burn them burn the entire projekt and yet for all their terror the two kgb men werent without courage twice at telephone points khuv skidded to a halt and tried to phone ahead on the first occasion the phone was dead and on the second he noticed the cable sliced through trailing its severed ends down the wall agursky had outmanoeuvred him litve where he ran on as he reached the scientific accommodation section thought to recheck agurskys room on the way out he roared like a bull kicked doors screaming hoarsevoiced for everyone to vacate vacate vacate khuv every forty or fifty paces would pause briefly to fire a deafening burst from his gun into the ceiling which he continued to do until the magazine was empty and he was left with only his issue automatic but those shells he reserved it was as much as the two men could do for not only the telephones were out but also the everyday corridor alarms agursky had taken care of everything finally they climbed a spiralling ramp to the upper level where they encountered a lot more activity obviously viktor luchov had managed to pass on something of a message for here at least the manhunt was underway maybe a dozen or more soldiers searched rooms patrolled at the double in pairs along side corridors used walkietalkies to keep in touch and loudhailers to muster people from their beds or their work this last was against khuvs advice to luchov but the major was unsure which way events had moved since then in any case the measures were having an effect however disorderly lateshift staff were spewing out from laboratories jamming themselves in the corridors and tunnels on the move without really knowing what they were doing or where they were going khuv and litve couldnt talk to all of them they simply howled their warnings as they battled a way through them get out they yelled the place is going to go up get out now or youll all burn it worked but only served to slow them down as the struggling crowd began to move with them in the same direction and it dawned on khuv in the crush of frightened people agursky would be that much harder to spot but as it happened agursky wasnt the one they had to worry about not yet up ahead with maybe only thirty metres to go to failsafe control corridors converged at a bulkhead door khuv and other highranking projekt officials had their quarters in one of these corridors luchov and various heads of his staff were accommodated in the other further into the complex the corridors put out smaller branches which led inward and inevitably downward but here at the end closest to the exit into the perchorsk ravine they came together forming something of a bottleneck worse there was the bulkhead door of dense metal set in concrete which when shut formed in effect an airtight seal ever since the introduction of luchovs failsafe the door had been kept permanently open firmly clamped to the wall but now as khuv and litve outdistanced the bulk of fleeing personnel and came round a bend where the corridors merged on the approach to the door so automatic gunfire sounded from up ahead approaching a second bend more cautiously they came in sight of the door saw what the shooting was about and took cover in an alcove in the wall leo grenzel was at the door he had unlocked two of the three clamps and was working on the third which appeared to be jammed every time he stepped into view to put leverage on the clamp soldiers in the alcoves closest to the door would open up with their guns driving him back under cover the thickness of the door itself and an alcove directly behind it shielded him from the worst of their fire but even as khuv and litve arrived on the scene they saw him hit saw him stagger back out of view in another moment he reappeared cradling a machinegun opened up and sent a hail of lead sleeting the length of the corridor two soldiers toppled screaming out of their alcoves where ricochets hit them their comrades dragged them moaning out of sight you up there khuv called during the lull whos in charge i am a sergeant stuck his head out snatched it back as grenzel opened up again khuv saw him briefly before he too ducked back his white face and staring eyes their glazed look and he could well understand that look it was unlikely that the sergeant knew grenzel was dead but it must be very hard to him to understand why he wasnt the soldiers kept hitting grenzel but they couldnt put him down as grenzel appeared yet again at the door tugging furiously at the last clamp the damage hed suffered was obvious he was lopsided in his stance that will be from his snapped spine khuv supposed and he marvelled at his own ability to accept this impossible thing just like that a broken spine and grenzel still mobile however awkward but why not for he was also dead nor was that the end of it he was wearing white coveralls they smouldered down his right side where they hung in rags tatters of flesh hung with the rags grey and red but there was very little blood in evidence these things didnt bleed too readily there were three small holes in grenzels right shoulder neat as the dots on a dice where a burst of bullets had printed full stops on his coveralls but at the back the holes were the size of small apples coloured a ragged reddishblack grenzel hung his shoulder on that side adding to his lopsidedness his difficulty with the clamp was that he worked at it lefthanded khuv took litves flamethrower called out to the men ahead give me a burst of covering fire when i call for it just a concentrated burst and ill deal with this bastard but first of all can one of you boys take out that light are you sure you know what youre doing sir a shout came back i mean this one hardly seems human how right you are yes just put out that light above the door was a lamp in a wire basket on instructions from the sergeant one of his men shot it out there was a crack a tinkle of glass and the buckled wire basket was torn from its housing the light in the corridor was at once reduced turning the place to a smoky tunnel when i yell now khuv reminded one burst and then keep your heads down grenzel had vanished for a moment but now he reappeared stood halfsilhouetted in the doorway he had his gun with him which he propped against the wall before returning his attention to the clamp behind khuv and litve the converging corridors were suddenly full of milling people their hushed yet massed voices were like the susurration of a congregation in a great sounding church litve called back stay still be quiet just wait where you are khuv checked that his weapon was primed and ready for action it was still fairly heavy indicating that there was no lack of fuel then he shouted now there came an answering burst of fire and grenzel staggered back khuv crouched down ran forward grenzel sensed or saw him grabbed up his gun fired a short burst and ran out of bullets khuv heard the whip and buzz of angry lead heard voices back down the corridor cry out their agony then he opened up with his flamethrower stabbed its blade of nearsolid heat right at the yellow wolfeyes burning in grenzels silhouetted face all shadows fled as the flamethrower roared grenzel was scorched and screeched like a runover cat he dropped his useless gun and in the next moment khuv was on him he hosed him down with fire burned him to a blistered crisp that burst into flame and stuck itself to the metal wall then grenzel slid down the wall toppled over and lay still khuv stopped firing stood back the flames gradually died down and grenzels remains hissed and crackled issuing vile black smoke then litve came forward with the sergeant and khuv told the latter see that all of these people get safely out of here theyre not out of the woods yet without waiting he and litve went on to failsafe control with frightened people hurriedly filing past them they stood in the corridor and banged on the metal door luchovs voice shrill terrified came through to them who is it whats happening viktor khuv answered its me khuv open up no i dont believe you i know who you are go away what khuv glanced at litve then he guessed what had happened agursky had been here he banged again on the door viktor it is me then wheres your key all of the listed failsafe duty officers had keys to this room litve still had khuvs keys he took them from a pocket and handed them over luckily khuv hadnt thrown the failsafe key away with the others down in the mortuary now the major turned the key in the lock pushed the door open and at once gasped and stepped back luchov stood there eyes bulging veins pulsing in the seared half of his head aiming the hot muzzle of a flamethrower straight into khuvs straining face god he gasped lowering the weapon to point at the floor it is you he staggered back collapsed into his swivel chair in front of the tv screens he was a wreck a trembling panting completely terrified wreck khuv carefully took the flamethrower from him said what happened viktor luchov gulped started to talk as he proceeded some of the wild frightened look went out of his eyes after you left ii started to phone half the lines were out but i got the guards on the entrance in the ravine and told them about agursky then i got through to halfadozen other numbers too and passed on the message i said everyone should evacuate but as quietly as possible then it dawned on me how crazy that was agursky was out there somewhere and hed see them leaving hed know the game was up and god only knows what hed do i managed to raise the military and told them to see to the evacuation also to hunt agursky down i said the phones were out of order and that they should alert all the people i couldnt reach i spoke to everyone i could but so far i havent been able to reach the core khuv and litve glanced at the screens all looked normal down there faces were strained and nervous but there was no sign of any unusual activity what about agursky khuv asked did he come here again luchov gulped god yes he came knocked on the door said he had to speak to me i told him i couldnt let him in he said he knew i knew about him and he could explain he said if i didnt let him in he would do something terrible i said if i did i knew hed kill me then he said that he knew we planned to burn him but that he was going to burn us all of us in the end he went away but i thought if he kills any one of the failsafe duty officers and takes his key i had an automatic but i knew that those two dead soldiers hadnt been able to stop him with their guns so i waited a little while sneaked out and took the nearest flamethrower i came back and just as i was letting myself inoh jesus he showed up khuv took the others elbow yes luchov nodded gulped but you should see him khuv its not agursky dont know what it is but it isnt him all three men exchanged glances how do you mean not him litve asked sure that he wouldnt like the answer his face luchovs lips trembled and he shook his head disbelievingly its all wrong and his head the wrong shape the way he moves like a great sly animal anyway he came at me at the run loping toward me he didnt have his dark glasses on and his eyes were red as blood swear it i got inside slammed the door and somehow managed to turn the key and outsidehe was a madman he raved and threatened hammered on the door but eventually he went away again khuv shuddered the whole thing was like a nightmare getting worse all the time then luchovs phone rang causing all three men to start violently khuv reached the phone first snatched it from its cradle yes corporal grudov at the entrance sir an excited tinny voice sounded agursky he was here what khuv crouched over the phone did you see him have you killed him we shot at him sir but kill him im sure we must have hit him but he seemed to ignore us so we went after him with a flamethrower but you didnt get him where is he now outside khuv held his breath he knew that agursky mustnt escape no he ducked back inside we burned him a little i think you think it all happened so very quickly sir khuv thought fast are the people out yet most of them but theyre still coming ive called up trucks from the barracks else theyd all freeze out here good man khuv sighed his relief now listen let everyone out except agursky if he shows up again give him all youve got kill him burn him destroy him utterly have you got that yes sir khuv put the phone down turned to the others hes still in here him and us and maybe a few stragglers oh and the soldiers at the core and whoever else is down there with them he turned to luchov the first button sounds the klaxons right luchov nodded you know it does if theyre still working khuv reached across and pressed button number one he gave luchov no time to think or to argue simply did it the alarms were still working their monotonous yet nervewrenching howling started up at once it was like the crying of some vast wounded prehistoric beast but what are you doing luchov gasped getting those soldiers out of it khuv nodded at the screens down at the core all such niceties as orders went to the wall those men down there knew what the klaxons meant and theyd had enough nerves could stand just so much and then no more in a matter of moments it was chaos a panicflight the staircase was packed with fleeing men the katushev teams were scrambling out of their kit running for it a sergeantmajor fired his pistol into the air once twice then holstered it and joined the rush khuv laughed slapped his thigh punched litves shoulder agursky cant get out he said hes in here probably wounded and those men heavily armed men are coming up from below and were going down from the top youre right luchov gasped but me im staying right here if he comes back this way ill make sure he doesnt get in here also im not chancing meeting him between here and the exit good said khuv but well need your flamethrower here he brought out his automatic and handed it over its not much but better than nothing luchov let them out into the corridor good luck he said simply you too khuv nodded then luchov quickly closed the door and locked it halfway between failsafe control and the magmass levels they met the soldiers coming up they came at the stampede until khuv called out its ok you men theres no problem we have a maniac running loose thats all the scientist vasily agursky has anyone seen him no sir the sergeantmajor who had fired his pistol down at the core came to attention saluted im afraid we all panicked sir and forget it khuv said you were supposed to panic that way i could be sure youd get out of there fast thats all you see sir the other was at pains to explain the phones have been out for some time so we guessed there was a problem then when those klaxons started up i said forget it khuv snapped now get your men out of here i mean right out of it out of the projekt litve grabbed his arm but they could be of assistance he protested khuv shook his head with them out of the way anything else that moves has to be agursky and anything that moves dies lets go they proceeded to the magmass levels checking rooms and laboratories as they went and all the while the klaxons sounding sounding sounding and their flesh crawling on them like they were covered in cockroaches up in failsafe control viktor luchov heard the pounding of booted feet as the cores military units vacated the projekt well at least they were out of it now that left khuv and litve and whatever else was down there waiting for them luchov glanced again at the silent now motionless screens especially the centre screen which showed the core and the gate then returned to his private thoughts thoughts about khuv he had never much cared for the man the kgb were a brutal lot and yet now luchovs thoughts froze right there gooseflesh crept on his neck something he had seen he looked at the centre screen again he strained his eyes rubbed at thembut no there was nothing wrong with his eyes on the centre screen a pale gelatinous mass was visible on the curve of the spheres dome a slowmotion picture of something within it hadnt been there ten or fifteen minutes ago or maybe it had and with so much going on he simply hadnt noticed it crazy it was exactly what he was here to notice he stared harder and yes in a minute the thing had grown larger starting to bloat up huge on the great curved screen which was the gate it was likelike encounter one but bigger much bigger and it was moving faster than anything had ever moved in there before if it was the same sort of creature as encounter one and if it should break loose from the gate god luchov gritted his teeth slammed a balled fist into his palm at a time like this khuv and litve were still down there somewhere they had thought to trap agursky between themselves and the soldiers and now who was trapped at least luchov could try to warn them khuvs own novel method should suffice he reached out a trembling hand and pressed button number two down on the fringe of the eerie magmass levels khuv and litve stayed close together moving very slowly there was darkness here where even the wellilluminated areas were dark with implication even above the blaring maddening klaxons whose row was fading a little behind them the heart of the perchorsk beast could be heard thudding more loudly seemed that much closer they moved cautiously down the wide timber stairway khuvs eyes raking the magmass on the right and litves on the left the pilotlights of their flamethrowers threw weird blueflickering shadows making faces and threatening figures of the disturbing magmass fusions khuv adjusted the strap of his flamethrower across his right shoulder and metal parts chinked together the sound was amplified by the magmass and despite the incessant klaxons came echoing back seemingly from all directions another sound having its origin elsewhere and rising to drown it out came back with it stuttering almost chattering laughter behind us khuv whirled to look back eyes wide so as to miss nothing no litves voice was a whisper where he crouched in front of us i think its hard to tell said khuv beginning to breathe a little faster he could be anywhere but hes just one litve was starting to shake his voice too and there are two of us for gods sake dont get separated from me major they turned right and followed the wooden path an artificial and entirely familiar road through this alien landscape into the heart of a magmass cavern where the echoes of their footsteps resounded louder yetand that was when the pitch and frequency of the alarms increased from a repetitive mindless blaring to a definite cry of warning what the hell litve gasped that was luchov said khuv telling us that something isnt right shit we know that already the laughter came again and this time there was no mistaking its source behind them also khuv recognized the voice as agurskys beyond any shadow of doubt so did litve apparently hes tracking us he whispered lets find a vantage point khuv moved faster heading for the stairwell through to the core that was the only way to go now down to the core itself but with still thirty or so paces to go to the final descent litve grabbed khuvs elbow look he croaked khuv looked back from behind a leaning magmass nodule a shadow had fallen on the walkway one that moved closer still there was more movement khuvs and litves startled eyes went together to a heavyduty cable where it snaked along the mad flow of the magmass wall the cable jerked its loops between staples contracted as something hauled on it almost before the meaning of this could dawn there came a cry of combined pain and frustration from behind the same magmass nodule the shadow on the walkway was highlighted emboldened by flaring blue illumination and a shower of sputtering sparks and it was a monstrous shadow incapable as yet of movement the two watched the shadow a single shadow began to split in two there came a rending sound like sailcloth tearing as the two halves of the shadow struggled to break apart struggled and succeeded two of them now one of which seemed human and the other the size and roughly the shape of a dog except it was not a dog then both of them moving back a little merging with the shadow of the nodule and a further moment of struggling with the power cable there was more electrical sputtering and a second shower of sparks and the lights went out the two men backed toward the shaft going down to the core their legs were jelly but they forced movement out of them a faint wash of light came from behind them over their shoulders residual light from the spheregate shining up through the shaft but along the walkway where theyd been all was now night if he it they are going to come litve stuttered then it has to be along this walkway khuvs throat was too dry and tight to answer but he thought thats right they were both wrong the thing from the tank or rather metamorphic vampire material from the core of the thing in the tank not dead but subsumed into agursky and now released to even up the score two against two didnt have to come that way at all it came under the walkway almost at the mouth of the shaft where the walkway turned sharply to the left and once more descended as stairs the thing struck something coiled up over the handrail wrapped itself clingingly around litves waist dragged him screaming through the shattering rail he was there beside khuv and he was gone his flamethrower put forth a single blast of flame and looking down khuv saw what had him the thing from the tank yes a great flat tentacled leech now which smothered litves face and the upper half of his body like a mass of leprous dough while its manyjointed limbs wrapped him and crushed his body like so many pythons and eyes in the surging filth of the thing staring up unblinking at khuv where he choked and gurgled on the walkway litves flamethrower went clattering khuv knew that was the end of him he aimed his own weapon and sent searing flame blasting into the heaving obscenity where it threshed on the magmass floor screaming his rage and terror he burned it burned it burned it until the white heart of his torch turned yellow hissed crackled into silence until the pilotlight itself went out then came agurskys chuckle again and through the reek and the smoke khuv saw him coming he saw him closing with him his hands elongating reaching he dropped his empty weapon ran stumbled went flailing down the stairwell into the heart of the place and down the stairs from the landing onto the boards of the saturnsrings perimeter agursky came close behind chuckling flowing inexorably pursuing khuv looked back and saw him the impossible gape of his jaws the nightmare of his bone dagger teeth meshing like a mincer in the cavern of his mouth he screamed and raced for the nearest katushev cannon shit shit he screamed and oh god oh mother of he leaped up onto the katushevs platform slid into the gunners chair traversed the assembly to face agursky where he loped after him buthe had no idea how to fire the thing before agursky could reach him he leaped out of his seat fled across the rings and onto the gantry bridging the gap to the sphere the power was off and the gate in the electrical fence open khuv ran through it reached the spot where the boards were scorched and blackened the gate was the only route open to him now but better that than he skidded to a halt threw up his hands before him to ward offsomething he couldnt believe something from the mind of a raving lunatic he stared at the sphere and his eyes bulged popped in his white mask of a face agursky had seen it too and he was likewise brought up short and a third pair of eyes had seen it had indeed been watching it for some time up in failsafe control viktor luchov waited no longer but threw the failsafe switch he opened the floodgates to hell because he had to and for khuv for khuv yes who even now turned his face to the closed circuit tv monitor and pleaded with him begged him to do it do it the majors face screamed silently at luchov from the centre screen for gods sake viktor if you know the meaning of mercy do it volatile liquids rushed and sprinklers commenced spraying all through the projekt plastic pipes began to blister as the liquid flowed faster thousands of litres of the stuff flowed into the heart of perchorsk becoming vapour where it was exposed to air forced by the weight of fuel in the huge tanker dragged downwards by gravity it quickly saturated the complex began to gush from an outlet into the core itself the core where now agursky knew he was finished and closed with khuv reaching for him but the major was no longer concerned with agursky only with the thing that was breaking through the screen of the sphere only with the heaving pulsating monstrosity of hooks and teeth and claws which wore the vast bloated nightmare distortion ofof karl vyotskys face but this was not could not be the vyotsky who had gone into that other world it was so radically different that its passage through the gate in the reverse direction had not been forbidden it halfemerged saw and fell upon the figures on the gantry and devoured them and in the next moment was itself devoured somewhere the deadly vapours had reached a naked flame incendiary fires raced through the projekt in an unstoppable chainreaction the entire place detonated exploded like a vast bomb viktor luchov gasping and almost fainting from his exertions was hauled through the wicketgate onto the marshalling area in the ravine under the cold night stars they hurried him away from the giant doors which in a little while were blown off their rollers like so much scrap metal a shaft of fire roared out bending like a waterfall to strike the dammed waters sending clouds of steam boiling upwards perchorsk was no more from the time of his early childhood when he was maybe eight or nine years old harry keogh remembered one especially bad dream it had been repetitive bothering him through many long nights and even now especially now was not forgotten where the idea had originated he couldnt say it might have come from some ancient medical book or from the mind of one of his longdead friends may even have stemmed from a flash of precognition but he could still remember it in detail the long hall brick walls and the heavy wooden tables set end to end the starving man stretched out on his back lashed to the end table his head firmly fixed between blocks of wood a leather strap across his forehead to keep it tilted back and his jaws propped wide open he lay there conscious skeletal chest heaving and arms and legs straining where they too were lashed and men in long white coats and a woman with a longbladed hatchet watching him and nodding among themselves tightlipped then the men standing well back and the woman with the hatchet laying her weapon down on the table farthest from the wretched man her departure through an arched doorway and her return with a large plate of rancid fish the pictures were very vivid the way she carefully took a piece of putrid fish and smeared it from directly in front of the mans face all the way along the centre of the joinedup tables to the last one before dropping it on the plate with the other stinking remnants there was a screen at that end where now she took her position seated there with her cleaver in her hand patience itself as she looked through a peephole in the screen and waited for it to happen the way her eyes fixed upon the gaping mouth of the racked man then the worst part of the dream when the cestode came out of him its segmented ribbonlike body inching laboriously from his convulsing throat writhing where it followed the fishstink in its search for food blind the tapeworm but not without senses of its own and not without hunger its head flat on the table but swaying this way and that creeping forward and the hooked segments coming into view from the mans choking throat one by one releasing their hooks within him and venturing forth into daylight for while the man was starving because of his worm it was starving because of the doctors who hadnt fed him for five or six days harry remembered it so well that dream the length of the thing covering first one sixfoot table then two three until it had been feared that six tables would not be enough twentyfive feet of it when at last the forked scorpion tail appeared trailing mucus and blood behind it and at that one of the doctors had tensed started to inch silently forward and the man on the table gurgling and gagging the cestode worm creeping warily forward but more avidly as the fishstink thickened the woman with her cleaver poised waiting her teeth drawn back from her lips in almost savage anticipation the parasite reaching the plate and its leechhead gorgingthe cleaver flashing silver in those practiced female hands shearing through the soft chitin and primitive guts of the thingthe doctor slapping his hand over the mans mouth as the frantically writhing rear sections of the worm tried to wriggle back into him which was always the point where harry used to come yelping awake he came awake now to the lady karens voice asking some questions of him where they sat facing each other across her table and he hoped hed been able to keep the canvas of his mind shielded from her so that she had not read the vivid thoughts painted there im sorry my mind was wandering i said she repeated herself smiling that youve been my guest through three sundowns with another on its way soon and still you havent told me why you came came willingly of your own volition into my aerie for my son because you were a friend to the dweller in a time of need he lied keeping his mindvoice to himself and because im curious and desired to see your aerie also because if i can find a cure for you i might be able to cure him she shrugged but youve seen my aerie harry almost all of it there are some things i have not shown you because you would find themunpleasant but you have seen the rest of it so what keeps you here you wont eat my food or even drink my water theres really nothing here for you except maybe danger your vampire he raised an eyebrow your cestode with its hooks in your heart and your guts and your brain of course except i no longer think of it as my vampire we are one she laughed but not gaily and a snakes tongue flickered behind her gleaming teeth and her eyes were of a uniform very deep scarlet oh i fought it for a long time but uselessly in the end the battle in the dwellers garden was the turning point when i knew it was over and accepted that i am what i am it was the battle and the power and the blood waiting watchful quiescent until then thats what woke it up and brought it to ascendancy but i mustnt think of it that way for now were the same creature and i am wamphyri you are warning me he said she looked away gave an impatient toss of her head looked back i am telling you it were better if you went the dwellers father you may be but you are innocent harry keogh and this is no place for innocence me innocent when i fell asleep in my room he said when i sat by my window and watched the gold fading on the distant peaks before the last sundown and woke up with a start i dreamed you were standing over me i was or had been she sighed harry i have lusted after you after me or after my blood how in every way my host is a woman with a womans needs but i am wamphyri with the needs of a vampire you dont have to draw blood wrong the blood is the life then by now you must be starved of life for you havent eaten not while i have been here he had taken his meals in the garden travelling to and fro via the mobius continuum but theyd been more snacks than meals proper for he had not wanted to leave her alone too long had not wanted to missanything when she spoke again her voice was cold harry if you insist on stayingi cannot be held responsible before he could answer she stood up swept out of the great hall disappeared from view in that regal way of hers harry had not followed her before had not spied on her in any depth but the time had come and he knew it where is she going he asked the longdead cartilage creatures where their corpses fashioned the stacks decor a carved bone handrail following stairs between the upper levels answered him she descends harry to her larder her hand falls on me even now her larder where like drama doombody before her she keeps a number of trogs in store hibernating she told me she had set her trogs free sent them home but not these the handrail once a trog itself answered these are for fashioning and in times of siege for eating harry went there two levels down saw karen flow in through a dark niche doorway and followed her a trog had been activated brought out of its cocoon harry stayed in the shadows guarded his thoughts he watched karen lead the trog to the table the creature shambling only halfawake enthralled lay down bent back its ugly prehistoric head for her her mouth opened opened gaped blood dripped from her gums where scytheteeth sprouted to poise over the creatures sluggishly pulsing jugular her nose wrinkled flattened back on itself and her eyes were crimson jewels in the twilight room karen harry shouted she snapped upright hissed at him cursed him long and loud then swept by him in a fury and was gone there was no putting it off any longer knowing what he must do harry went again to the garden he trapped her at sunup while she slept in her windowless room he put silver chains on her door which he left open no more than four or five inches and arranged potted kneblasch plants whose stink sickened even him their smell woke her up and she cried harry what have you done be calm he told her from outside for theres nothing you can do about it oh she raged rushing all about her room is it so she sent commands to her warrior come free me but there was no answer burned harry told her and the trogs in your larder activated all fled and your siphoneer that pitiful monstrous thing dead from the water which i poisoned in your wells your gasbeasts too themselves poisoned with unbreathable gasses now theres just you she wept and pleaded with him then what will you do with me will you burn me too he made no answer but went away he checked on her every three or four hours returning to test the chains on her door or water the kneblasch plants but never letting her see him sometimes she was asleep moaning in her red dreams and at others she was awake raving and cursing harry slept in the aerie only once at that time and on that occasion woke up to find himself at her door called there by karen it strengthened his resolve another time she was quite naked telling him how she loved him wanted him needed him but he knew what she needed he ignored her lustful luscious writhings and went away five more sunups came and went and karen sank into delirium and when it was sundown again she slept and could not be brought awake it was time harry cleared away the kneblasch but kept the chains on the door as before he left only a small gap then he went to the garden and fetched a piglet which he slaughtered into a golden bowl he made a thin trail of blood from the door of karens room into the great hall where he laid the bowl on the floor in the centre of the room the poor creature lay there stiff in an inch of its own blood and then harry waited sitting in the shadows quiet as never before and guarding his thoughts and it was just like his dream but worse for this time he was there and he was the one with the cleaver except it wasnt a cleaver eventually the vampire left karen and began to follow the bloody trail swaying its head this way and that it entered the hall inched forward towards the bowl it was a long leech corrugated cobraheaded blind with many hooks and it had pointed udders a great many of them along its grey pulsating underbelly it sensed the blood came on faster then sensed harry it began a hasty retreat curled back on itself and wriggled like a blindworm harry stepped into the mobius continuum stepped out again at the door of karens room the vampire came crawling saw him but too late he aimed his flamethrower and burned it dying it issued eggs a great many of them which rolled and skittered vibrating across the floor toward him sweating but cold inside harry burned them all until all that was left was the awful smell and the screaming karens screaming exhausted harry slept he slept in the aerie because there was no longer anything there to fear he dreamed that karen stood over him in her white gown that gown she had worn so revealingly for the wamphyri lords and explained why he was the most miserable of all men his victory was ashes she had been wamphyri and now she was a shell he thought he had won but he had lost when one has known the power the freedom the magnified emotions of the vampirewhat is there after that she told him she pitied him for she knew why he had done what he had done and he had failed and then she said goodbye he woke up looked for her no longer wamphyri she had taken the chains from her door escaped he searched the stack top to bottom came and went through the mobius continuum until he was dizzy but he couldnt find her eventually he went out onto her high balcony and looked down karens white dress lay crumpled on the scree more than a kilometer below no longer entirely white but red too and karen was inside it epilogue in the garden the damage done in the fighting had been very nearly put to rights travellers worked at it during sunups and trogs through the dark sundowns and meanwhile the message had gone out the wamphyri are no more streams of travellers entire tribes were en route even now coming to celebrate and worship at the feet of their saviour jazz and zek and wolf too had gone home conveyed to that distant place by the dweller who had then returned and all in all the dweller was well satisfied with his work butfeeling a burning on his neck harry jnr turned from where he supervised the rebuilding of the wall turned to glance at a rising hummock of ground a little way apart someone stood there someone who watched him intently silently someone whose mind was sealed tight as a limpet to its rock harry jnr frowned peered for a moment through the holes in his golden mask then smiled it was only his father he waved and went back to work
