john mortimer rumpole and the learned friends from rumpole of the bailey now more than ever seems it rich to die to cease upon the midnight with no pain doctor hanson told you rumpole youre not dying youve got flu i was lying on my back in a pair of flannel pyjamas my brow with anguish moist and fever dew and hilda most efficiently playing the part of matey or ward sister was pouring out the linctus into a spoon and keeping my mind from wandering whatever doctor hanson who in my humble opinion would be quite unable to recognize a case of death when he saw it might say i felt a curious and trancelike sense of detachment not at all unpleasant and seriously wondered if rumpole were not about to drop off the twig fade far away dissolve and quite forget what thou among the leaves hast never known the weariness the fever and the fret as i recited to her hilda took advantage of the open mouth to slide in the spoonful of linctus i didnt relish the taste of artificially sweetened hair oil all the same little johnny keats lord byrons pissabed poet had put the matter rather well then more than ever seemed it rich to get away from it all no more judges no more bowing and saying if your lordship pleases no more hopelessly challenging the verbals no more listening to endless turgid speeches from my learned friends for the prosecution to cease upon the midnight with no pain from my position between two worlds i heard the telephone beside the bed ringing distantly hilda picked it up and told whoever it was that they couldnt speak to mr rumpole who who cant speak to me well hes busy at the moment hilda lied to the telephone in fact i had done absolutely nothing for the last three days busy im not busy busy dying hilda laughed i thought a trifle flippantly thats what he says anyway no henry well not this week certainly its my clerk my clerk henry i returned to earth and grabbed the telephone from she im sorry to hear youre dying sir henry as alwaysj sounded perfectly serious and not tremendously interested dying henry well thats a bit of an exaggeration there was a con for you sir at brixton prison the dartford post office robbery mr bernards got the safe blower a safe blowing in dartford i felt my head clear and swung my legs out of bed and feet to the floor theres nothing like the prospect of the old bailey for curing all other diseases ill tell mr bernard you cant be there tell him nothing of the sort henry ill be there no trouble at all ill just fling on a few togs as i made for the wardrobe hilda looked at me as if my recent flirtation with the unknown had been some sort of a charade i thought you were dying she said dying as i explained to her would have to be postponed safe blowing came first when i was dressed wrapped in a muffler and buttoned into an overcoat by matey i set out for chambers and there i made two unpleasant discoveries the first being that there were those who would not have regretted rumpoles continued absence from chambers by reason of death at that time we were suffering from a good deal of overcrowding and erskinebrowns small room which opened into the entrance hall had to accommodate not only erskinebrown himself but his expupil miss phyllida trant and his two new pupils who sometimes dived into my room to borrow books and then shot out again like frightened rabbits also my old friend george frobisher took refuge there whenever his old friend hoskins with whom george shared a room was having an intimate conference with a divorcee as i passed erskinebrowns open door i could see his room was bursting at the seams and as i hung up my hat and coat in the hallway i heard the voice of the erskinebrown say he supposed theyd have to hang on in that black hole of calcutta a little longer but he added at least he cant be with us forever who cant be with us forever it was miss trants voice rumpole of course i mean hes bound to retire sometime hes a good age and henrys been telling me hes not all that well i chose that moment to stick my nose into the black hole morning erskinebrown nose to the grindstone miss trant miss trant looked up from the brief she was reading and gave me a smile she really has decidedly pretty teeth ever since i deceived her so heartlessly i have become almost fond of miss trant oh hello rumpole i thought you were off sick erskinebrown was trying to move georges particulars of nuisance off his statement of claim recovered now i sneezed loudly rumpole resurrected sorry to disappoint you thats a nasty cold youve got oughtnt you to be in bed miss trant was solicitous i looked at her brief neatly underlined in red and green points for and against women are such industrious creatures whos your client oh just a thief hell have to plead guilty hes said such ridiculous things to the police you twist his arm philly judges dont like you wasting the courts time with hopeless cases erskinebrown was one of natures pleaders i decided that the stage of her career had come when miss trant might benefit from some proper advice never plead guilty i told her that should be written up in letters a foot high in every room in chambers a foot high we havent got the room for it erskinebrown was still sulking and george looked up from the corner of the desk he was occupying as though hed just noticed me hello rumpole havent seen you about lately ive been dying i say dont do that i should miss your help with the crossword thinking uneasily that the sole justification of my existence seemed to be helping george frobisher with the crossword i went into the clerks room and henry presented me with the brief in the dartford post office robbery youve got plenty of time air rumpole they dont want the two of you down there till three oclock now the two of us i was puzzled the defendant wheelers got a certificate for two counsel excellent giving me a junior are they someone to take a note well not exactly mr rumpole henry had the grace to look embarrassed youre being led theyre briefing a silk you can take it easy for once i was being led i was a junior barrister in the th year of my life easy i dont want to take it easy im afraid i exploded at henry havent they heard im out of rompers im off the bloody leading rein i managed the penge bungalow murder alone and without a leader i came out of the clerks room clutching my junior brief and was met with a whiff of aftershave as the tall elegant figure of guthrie featherstone qc appeared through the front door in his gents natty velvetcollared overcoat and bowler hat slumming down in chambers after a triumph in the house hullo rumpole he greeted me affably im afraid youre going to see a lot of my back this week your back what do you mean your back im leading you in the dartford post office robbery he smiled in a damnably friendly fashion and went into the clerks room youre leading me featherstone i called after him but he affected not to hear i went on towards my room but as i passed her open door i looked in once more on that tireless worker miss phyllida trant you were perfectly right miss trant i ought to have stayed in bed i dont expect youve noticed brixton prison as youve driven down to brighton on a sunny sunday morning the prison gates are down a long extremely dreary street off the main road you pass little knots of visitors girl friends black mums with their babies and large screws going or coming from their time off being a screw has become something of a growth industry i met one who gave up school teaching for wardering the pays so much better and you get free golf no matter what the weather is like in other parts of london a fine rain always seems to be falling on the long walk down to brixton that day featherstone had parked his wellmanicured rover up in the main road and leader and junior walked together up to the gates of the prison house our client was a wellknown minor south london villain named charlie wheeler a professional safe blower with a string of convictions going back to his childhood days when charlie forced the dr barnardos box in the local church and which included many notable exploits with safes the evidence against him wasnt much just charlies fingerprints found on a fragment of gelignite left beside the blown safe in the post office it wasnt much but it was quite satisfactory evidence provided you were appearing for the prosecution if you were for the defence well youd have to improvise i explained this to featherstone but he looked gloomy and said if you ask me this case is as dead as a doornail so are we all eventually i tried to cheer him up two men in stocking masks hold up the post office one has a shotgun and our friend wheelers fingerprints are on a lump of explosive i know i know wed reached the prison doors and i rang the visitors bell featherstone smiled faintly i wonder why he didnt leave his visiting card ill tell you old sweetheart i was serious old cons like charlie wheeler dont have visiting cards the small hole in the huge wooden doors rattled open i waved featherstone in after you my learned friend leaders always go into prison first as soon as i get into a prison i become moody and depressed and have a strong desire to scream and fight my way out if this is how a visitor feels treated with respect even deference by the screws i dont know how i could stand a fiveyear sentence and yet ive had clients who greet five years rather like a pound from the poor box i have also been entirely convinced since my seventh year that i would land up in the nick sooner or later for some trivial reason or other and fear it constantly that wet afternoon in the inner courtyard at brixton with the killer airedales sniffing around at the end of their leads and the trusty boys planting out crysanths in the sooty flower beds the feeling came over me more strongly than ever stronger than the fear of death when they put me inside i said to myself ill volunteer to be one of those trusties that plant out the crysanths at least ill get to learn about horticulture but before i could plan further we were in the neat glasspanelled interview room you could see through the walls to where in a succession of similar rooms cons were having meetings with their briefs in the centre of the complex the screws sat by a table on which cacti grew in pots among stones providing half a dozen elegant and miniature japanese gardens i can tell you its really very cosy in brixton so we all sat round charlie wheelers advisors featherstone the qcj rumpole the junior bernard the solicitor and joyce his secretary a jolly fairhaired girl in jeans and a mac dressed more for a wet weekend in haslemere than the nick who clutched the file and was inclined to giggle disconcertingly during serious passages of the evidence i once had her in court in a murder and she laughed so audibly at the pathologists report that she had to be led out well we were both younger then now she seemed moderately composed as charlie wheeler held out his hand to me as though we were alone in the room im glad to see you mr rumpole itd amaze you the reputation you got in e wing i felt a dry cough coming on and my head still swam a little they can inscribe that on my tombstone he had an amazing reputation round e wing youre not going to die are you mr rumpole charlie seemed genuinely concerned i was considering the possibility im that glad youre doing my case im not exactly doing your case charlie i hated to disappoint him your case is being conducted by mr guthrie featherstone qc mp his name is constantly mentioned charlie in the corridors of power i havent heard much of you charlie looked doubtfully at the qc mp not from the blokes in e wing rumpole if i may featherstone was apparently about to gather up the reins of course of course my learned leader you want to conduct this conference well its your right now then wheeler he means you charlie i translated rumpole please i shall make a note of all your words of wisdom from now on i got out a note book and pen featherstone went on with admirable calm what i wanted to say wheeler was not too fast if you dont mind i was putting him down at dictation speed were here to fight this case were going to leave no stone unturned to fight it to the best of my poor ability my poor ability i repeated what seemed to me to be a key phrase as i wrote but mr bernards no doubt told you who our judge is featherstone went on ignoring the interruption i know charlie sounded deeply depressed judge bullingham so any sort of attack on the honesty of the police featherstone went on and bernard raised a voice in warning i told you charlie would act like a red rag to a bullingham i suppose you told him that i supplied the thought for charlie to chew over look mr bernards explained it to me i dont want to lay into dirty dickerson whos that featherstone looked puzzled and i enlightened him from my memory of the brief i imagine that is a reference to detective inspector dickerson the officer in charge of the case i mean there aint a whole lot of point charlie seemed resigned for which featherstone was extremely grateful well exactly the evidence against you is undisputable so whats the point of annoying the judge with a whole lot of questions i told you charlie bernard nodded wisely i mean if i dont say nothing against dickerson if i keep quiet like well how much mr rumpole i were hoping for an eight hope springs eternal in the human breast i could tell him no more in my experience listen to the wise words of the learned leader when they came the leaders words were by no means filled with original thought any sort of attack on the police in a case like this will add considerably to your sentence so lets be sensible i must warn you wheeler the time may very well come when i have to throw in my hand you mean charlies hand dont you i said and featherstone looked at me as if he wished hed been lumbered with any other junior counsel in the temple however old and near to death as we walked back to the main road and the parked rover featherstone put his problem in a nutshell i cant make bricks without straw rumpole down the bailey you have to make bricks without bricks you never get the luxury of straw of course ill mitigate featherstone said sportingly i tried to point out the hopelessness of this course what could you say in mitigation my client only called in for a yp stamp my lord but as he was kept waiting behind ten old ladies with pension books and a lunatic arguing over a dog licence he lost his patience and blew the safe well rumpole hardly we were standing on each side of the rover eyeing each other in an unfriendly fashion across the polished roof as featherstone unlocked the drivers door forget mitigation for a moment i told him whats the use of spending your life in an attitude of perpetual apology do you think charlie wheelers going to blow a safe without gloves even in a sub post office in dartford do you think hes going to leave a bit of spare gelignite around with his trade mark on it is that the mark of a professional featherstone slid into the drivers seat and opened the passenger door think about it featherstone i bundled myself into the car beside him it would be like you standing up in court and mitigating in your pyjamas i decided that evening to drown all uneasy thoughts as to the conduct of wheelers defence in three or four glasses of chateau fleet street in pommeroys wine bar i went there with my old friend george frobisher and saw that the watering hole was well filled barristers at one end of the bar including erskinebrown miss trant and guthrie featherstone going walkabout among his loyal subjects journalists at the other and myself and george at one of the crowded tables in the snug they say uncle toms not too well george told me about our oldest no longer practising member of chambers who is nowadays they say old t c rowley is distinctly seedy well hes a good age hes over whats good about being over i really would have liked an answer to this question does the pain of hopeless frustration in which we all live become at such an age a dull and bearable ache of resignation is the loss of hearing and eyesight compensated for by a palate more than ever sensible to the thin warmth of chateau fleet street before i could press george further on the subject however a young man in a tweed suit with hornrimmed glasses and a falling lock of fair hair detached himself from the journalists group and approached our table mrrumpole i admitted it philbeam i write the in depth column in the sunday george stood i dont believe he trusts journalists forgive me rumpole i thought id call in on old tom on my way back to the hotel any messages give him my love oh and tell him well all be joining him eventually really rumpole george sounded shocked and he went whereupon philbeam sat opposite me and fixed me with his glittering hornrims i made him welcome and ordered further clarets a gentleman of the press ill always be grateful for the space you gave me during the penge bungalow murder i think that was before my time i rather think it was probably reported by your grandfather philbeam i could see by looking at him had a point i was in court when you defended ken aspen the rape case with the member of parliament hardly one of my major triumphs admired the way you crossexamined that girl i was just wondering where all this chat with the smoothtalking philbeam was getting us when he leaned forward and said what i wanted to ask you mr rumpole was yes have you ever run up against a detective inspector dickerson round dartford somewhere dirty dickersoni was interested have you heard that too philbeam smiled you know how he got his name noi saidive no idea so he started to tell me up by the bar i heard featherstone say sante as he raised his glass to erskinebrown i discovered later that erskinebrown had been picked to make one of his comparatively rare apppearances at the bailey in the role of prosecuting counsel in the dartford post office case and that featherstone was drinking to what promised to be a most civilized occasion with both sides being of the greatest possible assistance to each other and prosecution and defence collaborating in seeing charlie wheeler put gently away for a very long time indeed whilst this was going on philbeam was telling me of an investigation his paper was carrying out on dickerson there were the usual sort of allegations villains verballed unless they paid up money taken for not opposing bail and such like police procedure i once did an interview with a man called harris philbeam told me minor sort of south london villain loads of convictions sounds like my kind of criminal never printed it of course but harry harris told me d i dickerson once handed him a stolen cigarette case got his fingerprints all over it then he made harris pay him quid not to be prosecuted for the theft glory hallelujah i had my first hint then of how dangerously charlie wheeler might be defended you are a blessing philbeam in an excellent disguise i trust this is not an isolated incident ive got a whole file on dickerson of course i cant use it yet the leading lady likes to win his libel actions leading lady thats what we call our editor i let that pass i had an urgent mission for philbeam can you find us harris i know the pubs he goes to shouldnt be difficult oh please i beg you philbeam find him leave no pub unturned he sounds like a small straw we might just make a brick or two with him until harris was found i had really nothing to go on nothing that i could make featherstone use as ammunition in a fight even if i had harris and a pile of similar cannonballs i was beginning to doubt if i could ever get guthrie to fire a shot i looked across to my learned leader at the bar and saw him get out a large silk handkerchief and sneeze it was not i feared a signal to change rather a trumpet call to retreat lacking harris or any other tangible defence i had to fall back on the flu as ammunition for my learned leader accordingly i brought to court a throat spray a pile of clean handkerchiefs and a packet of cough drops which could be opened and noisily consumed during vital parts of the prosecution evidence i ranged these weapons out in front of me on the first remarkably uneventful day in court it was so uneventful in fact and so little was said on behalf of the defence that his honour judge bullingham became positively benign one of the unsolved mysteries of the universe and a matter i find it hard to speculate upon that such relatively straightforward problems as free will or life after death is why on earth ronnie bullingham was ever made an old bailey judge its not his fault that he has a thick heavily veined neck and the complexion of a beetroot past its first youth his personal habits such as picking his teeth and searching in his ear with his little finger while on the bench i can forgive and his unreasoning prejudice against all black persons defence lawyers and probation officers i can mercifully attribute to some deep psychological cause perhaps the bulls mother if such a person can be imagined was assaulted by a black probation officer who was on his way to give evidence for the defence what i cannot forgive is his honours appalling treatment of the english language his summingups have to be translated by the court of appeal like pages of urdu and all the jury get is a vague impression of a man so shaken with rage that some dreadful crime must have caused it the only kind of sentence in which bullingham never falters is one of seven years and up so there we were before this appalling tribunal charlie wheeler resigned bernard tremendously anxious his nice secretary blushing as the judge stared with undisguised hostility at her trousers and erskinebrown taking mr fingleton the fingerprint expert through his predictably damaging evidence it was a rare occasion peace and tranquillity in bullinghams court mr fingleton said erskinebrown do you produce enlarged photographs of the first second and third fingers of the defendant wheeler yes i carefully unfolded the first of my pile of hankies and loudly blew the rurnpole nose diverting the attention of some of the jury does the defence admit them the bull glared towards us featherstone rose and bowed as if hed been addressing the house of lords those are admitted my lord well thank you said the judge in an unprecedented burst of good manners im very much obliged to you mr featherstone i bet you are old darling i muttered as featherstone sank gracefully back into his seat and do you also produce enlarged photographs of the fingerprints on the small piece of gelignite taken by detective inspector dickerson from the scene of the crime yes i could see it was time to use the throat spray i lifted it to the open mouth now what do you say about those two sets of fingerprints i puffed the throat spray regrettably i couldnt drown the answer i have found distinct points of similarity and by points of similarity you mean the bull wanted it spelt out for the jury the break in the first whorl on the index finger for instance my lord is exactly the same in both cases the photographs were handed round twelve good jurypersons who were flattered into becoming experts yes i think the members of the jury can see that quite clearly you can cant you bullinghams manner to the jury was a nice mixture of a creep and a crow and so mr fingleton what is your conclusion just tell the jury erskinebrowns approach was more subtle he simply wanted the witness to tell us his views provided of course they were the views of the prosecution my conclusion is fingleton was an experienced witness he turned politely to the jury but rumpole was an experienced defender he worked at the throat spray producing a cloud of medicated mist and created a genuine diversion even fingleton paused and turned to look this is not a hospital the judges remark seemed painfully obvious i would stress that for the benefit of junior counsel for the defence yes mr fingleton in the enforced silence that followed fingleton struck the fingerprints are identical my lord thank you very much mr fingleton erskinebrown sat down with great pleasure i dont know what i expected of the rustling silk in front of me an attack on the whole theory of the fingerprint as first promulgated by professor purkinje of the university of breslau the classification into whorls loops arches and composites pioneered by sir e r henry of the bengal police something anything to puzzle the jury and infuriate the bull as it was the qc rose in all his glory to deliver himself of his single ban mot no questions my lord i cant do anything with this evidence featherstone whispered to me as he sat down no you cant i told him i gave out a final fusillade of coughs the only effect of which was to drown the judge as he thanked my leader with every appearance of delight for his brilliant contribution to the trial that evening i was rereading my brief in the livingroom at froxbury court with a still slightly feverish eye i came again to something in charlie wheelers proof of evidence that had always puzzled me a conversation he had had with d i dickerson at about two in the morning in a police cell charlies recollection of the event hadnt been particularly clear but it seemed there had been an offer of bail in exchange for a confession and it had ended in some sort of temporary agreement because the officer had shaken charlies hand before leaving him for the rest of the night i read the short unilluminating paragraph through several times before something which could hardly be called an idea more a vague hint of the possibility of some future thought floated into my mind i lit a small cigar which considerably improved the quality of my cough and gazed at the rising smoke then the telephone rang a most unexpected caller none other than mrs marigold featherstone speaking directly from the sick bed she was heartbroken to tell me but poor guthrie had a temperature of it had come at the worst possible time what with the foreign office dinner next week and his speech on devolution she really couldnt let guthrie risk all that by coming down to the old bailey of course not dont dream of it you keep the old darling tucked up in bed rumpole was extremely solicitous and keep the hotwaterbottles going and beef tea constantly simmering on the hob the old baileys a nasty draughty place marigold sounded grateful and passed the phone to her husband who croaked an apology and said did i mind holding the fort and he was sure i agreed there was nothing to do ut to mitigate in view of the evidence we had heard quite right guthrie i assured him of course well have to plead no i wont attack the officer in charge of the case ill adopt your technique i admired it so much no questions my lord that really endeared you to the old bull you had the old sweetheart purring now you stay in bed guthrie twentyfour hours at least dont you dream of moving i was putting down the phone with a grin of pure pleasure when hilda came in flushed from the washing up and asked who was on the phone i stood and greeted her with words of delight oh frabjous day hilda i said callooh callay he chortled in his joy what on earths the matter with you rumpole the matter nothings the matter its an occasion for rejoicing ive given up my learned leader the flu then i phoned the night editor of that prestigious sunday paper which examines our lives in depth and left a message for the industrious philbeam i got up early the next morning and was down at ludgate circus as the allnight printers came off work and indulged myself in the treat of breakfast in jocks cafe opposite the old bailey a place patronized by the discerning coppers reporters and meat porters of smithfield where the two eggs rashers and fried slice are the best in london and where i have roughed out over a third cup of coffee some of my most devastating crossexaminations and most moving speeches for the defence i was joined at breakfast by philbeam to whom i gave the glad tidings that the worlds greatest mitigator was docked in bed for the remainder of the trial my spirits were only a little dashed by the fact that philbeam had so far failed in his search for harris ive been round twenty pubs he told me no joy but ive got a number to phone place where his sister works he looked at his watch they wont be open till oh find him philbeam old darling we may be all set for the unmasking of dirty dickerson i sent philbeam about his business and went over to the palais de justice the dear old place was as i liked it best quiet and peaceful with only a few tired cleaning ladies and sleepy attendants to greet me i got changed into my working clobber wig gown and so on at my leisure and went down to the lower ground floor i had rung bernard the night before and asked him to meet me for an early conference with the client but when i got to the old battered newgate door which divides the safe sheep from the imperilled goats i found only the secretary joyce looking harassed and with her arms full of files oh mr rumpole she panted at me mr bernard wont be with you this morning a funeral not his a clients thats all right then im just going down the cells to see charlie oh oh well im with mr hoskins on a fraud in the west court weve got a conference over there and you run along my dear i reassured her i believe i can cope with a conference alone and without a leader at which she went off gratefully and i went up to the iron gate to do what no sensible barrister ever does see a client alone before a trial perhaps i was too full of my sudden freedom from the leading rein to be sensible at that moment and i was still in a cheerful mood when the screw left his mug of tea and jam sandwich to open the door to me got wheeler have you i asked him charlie wheeler well i dont think hes gone out anywhere this screw was a wit he dont get many invitations not many invitations thats rich that is exceeding rich i laughed appreciatively you know what being an old bailey hack over the years blunts it blunts the sensitivity the sensitivity comes out like hair on the comb and when you go down the cells youre prepared to laugh at anything you ever paid dickerson money charlie wheeler and i were a deux in the interview room both smoking away at my small cigars id never entertain it oh i know some as paid him including harry harris you knows a lot dont you charlie looked at me with some admiration i try to keep abreast of the underworld so you were known to the detective inspector as a dedicated nonpayer you could say that there was a pause as i searched for charlies statement in the brief then he said mr featherstone not here today we had a bit of luck with the flu it says somewhere here that the d i was on the point of offering you bail that seemed funny to me like very funny with your record of course he wanted something for it he was asking me to put my hands up like sign a confession you werent going to i never done that mr rumpole its not the way i work all the same yes i strung him along a bit i let him think we might do a deal we even shook hands on it like yes tell me more about that shook hands on the deal like well he put out his hand like and took mine you ever had your hand taken by a police officer before this was the part that interested me no only me collar show me how he shook hands with you you be the detective inspector charlie took my hand but only for a moment it was all over in a second and i never made no statement it aint in me character how did dickerson look when he shook hands with you did he look pleased triumphant i couldnt hardly see him what it was in my cell in the dartford nick i dont know about two oclock of a morning i was half asleep well he was in the dark like he did seem that little bit nervous nervous well you know what you expect from a man of his build good firm grip well that hand of his felt a bit clammy and soft i stood up the vague thought had not only become an idea but a plan of attack a series of questions for crossexamination how do you feel about this case mr rumpole charlie looked up at me doubtfully feel like stout cortez who when with the eagle eyes he stared at the pacific and all his men looked at each other with a wild surmise you got me there mr rumpole keats its been an autumn of keats to cease upon the midnight with no pain quite enough of that were recovered now rumpole resurrected you reckon weve got a chance mr rumpole a tiny chance perhaps like a small electric light bulb in a dark cell more chance than mitigating i sat down again at the table and started to explain the position as clearly as i could to charlie i cant tell you understand that i cant put you in the box and let the jury have your excellent record as a safe blower read out to them but i want your express instructions you ave them mr rumpole what you got in mind i think i ought to ask inspector dirty dickerson a few impertinent questions so this is what im going to ask him with your kind permission it was then that i got charlie wheelers instructions to do exactly as i did in his trial i think in view of the following disastrous happenings i should make that perfectly clear d i dickerson was a large smiling man with greying hair which covered the top of his ears and a bright and expensive silk tie and matching handkerchief he looked the sort of man who would be the life and soul of the office party or the man on the package holiday to ibiza you would be most careful to move away from he was holding his prized possession a small plastic bag containing a minute quantity of gelignite labelled exhibit i as erskinebrown came to the end of his questions we have heard from the expert that wheelers fingerprints are on that small piece of gelignite where did you find it beside the safe at the scene of the crime my lord dickerson said respectfully in the dartford post office the bull weighed in yes my lord thank you detective inspector erskinebrown sat down his duty done have you any questions to ask the detective inspector the judge dared me just a few my lord rumpole rose slowly to his feet well then get on with it the judge was treating the defence with his usual courtesy do you know a man named harris harry harris there are two ways to crossexamine depending on the witness and your mood you either start off politely asking a series of questions to which the answer will be yes gaining the subjects confidence and agreement leading him gently up the garden path to a carefully planned booby trap or you go in like an old warship with all guns blazing i had decided that the bulls court at the bailey was no place for subtlety and i went in for the broadside approach the d i looked somewhat taken aback but answered with his usual bonhomie i know a harry harris a friend of charlie wheelers yes how would you describe him you want me to describe him mr rumpole has asked the questions the risk is on his head the bulls image was imprecise but his knowing leer at the jury made his meaning plain harris is a minor villain sir round the dartford area you asked for it mr rumpole the judge was delighted and the jury smiled i battled on ignoring the barracking from the bench have you had any financial dealings with harris my lord as if i hadnt got enough opponents erskinebrown rose to interrupt erskinebrown i muttered will you not interrupt my crossexamination can i ask how questions about this man harris are in any way relevant to the case of wheeler erskinebrown persisted with a glare of judicial encouragement quite right the judge challenged me whats this man harris got to do with this case not this case my lord but then your question is entirely irrelevant a simple mind that of the bull my lord when the character of this officer is called into question oh really are you attacking this officers character the judge tried a voice of dangerous courtesy but only succeeded in sounding ordinarily rude i wasnt offering him a gold medal at this the jury laughed bullingham let that one go and then said i can only assume youre making this attack on instructions i take full responsibility my lord i see your learned leader isnt in court unfortunately my lord he is struck down by the flu i tried to sound depressed bullingham came insultingly to my aidperhaps youd like me to adjourn this crossexamination so it can be done properly by learned leading counsel thank you my lord i am quite happy to proceed i had no time to loose for gods sake guthries flu might be better by the next day the judge tried a last attack i hope you are not making this suggestion without being in a position to call harris i looked round the court and at this moment my good angel philbeam came bursting in through the swing doors i put my stake on an even chance and said certainly i can call him at this point the witness nobly volunteered to answer my questions however objectionable they might be and i beckoned philbeam to my side the news was not good harriss sister had been contacted but hadnt heard of her brother for two years philbeam whispered shall i keep trying for gods sake i whispered back and then straightened to hear d i dickerson tell the judge that he never had any financial dealings of any sort with harris the bull wrote this down carefully and said very well mr rumpole has his answer although it probably wasnt the one he wanted with this judge the rapier was always replaced by the bludgeon do you want to try your luck with any more questions mr rumpole just one or two my lord detective inspector when charlie wheeler was in the dartford nick where the j udge frowned in the police cells at dartford police station i translated politely there is such a thing as plain english mr rumpole just as well to use it bullingham said that to me i had no time to lose my temper with him and i was off in pursuit of the di did you ever on any occasion at dartford police station shake hands with charlie wheeler there was a moments hesitation and the witness put his big hands in his jacket pockets is my english plain enough for you shake his hand i may have done have you ever shaken a prisoners hand before not that i can remember so why should you have shaken hands with charlie wheeler suddenly the court was quiet the jury were paying attention dickerson took a long ten seconds to think of his answer your client told me he was about to make a confession statement i was congratulating him on showing a bit of sense the silence was broken by a general giggle led by the judge is that the answer you wanted mr rumpole the bull was positively beaming yes my lord it is i wished to establish that this officer took my client by the hand as he was prepared to make a confession the jury were reminded from the bench once again i ignored the interruption and asked the witness did you discuss bail with him on that occasion bail no sir there was no discussion of bail whatsoever dickerson looked pained at the suggestion did you say you wouldnt oppose bail if he made a confession i said nothing of the sort my lord bullingham sighed heavily threw down his pencil and turned on me mr rumpole are there any further allegations of a serious nature to be made against this officer only one my lord may i have exhibit i please the usher brought me the little lump of gelignite in its plastic bag that is the small piece of gelignite the judge took great pleasure in reminding the jury with your clients fingerprints on it exactly my lord who found this piece of gelignite detective inspector i did at the scene of the crime did you show it to any other officer when i got back to the station when you got back to the station so the jury must rely on your evidence and your evidence alone to satisfy them that this small piece of gelignite was ever at the scene of the crime if my evidence isnt good enough if your evidence isnt good enough detective inspector charlie wheeler is entitled to be acquitted i felt the quietness in court again the jury were listening i leant forward and spoke to the witness as though we were alone in the room have you ever in your long experience known a safe blower to leave his gelignite with his fingerprints on it at the scene of a crime at which of course the judge had to comment to the jury if criminals never made mistakes we would have no trials at the old bailey however i felt they were becoming more interested in the witness than the judge and i went on quickly you see there is another possibility the jury may have to consider is there dickerson smiled politely interested we have no idea when the fingerprints got on the gelignite havent we or where is it just possible detective inspector that charlie wheeler only touched the gelignite in the dartford police station there was another minute pause before he answered i dont know what you mean it was time to tell the jury exactly what i meant and bring charlies defence out into the open in that dark cell at two oclock in the morning do you think you had the gelignite this little piece of gelignite concealed in your palm when you held your hand out to him and shook hands as you had never shaken hands with any prisoner in your life before is that the only explanation of how charlie wheelers fingerprints got on to exhibit i i hadnt expected dickerson to crumble and apologize but i had hoped for a bluster an outraged denial which might have said more than he intended but he was too experienced a witness for that he only smiled tolerantly and said if thats what wheeler told you i mean if then its a load of nonsense you know that mr rumpole is it all lies detective inspector bullingham asked all lies my lord the judge wrote that last answer down in case he forgot it then he gave the jury one of his least lovable grins its always painful to watch an officer of this sort of length of service under attack members of the jury i expect wed all be glad of a break back at ten past two air erskinebrown so ignoring rumpole he bundled himself out of court mr featherstone heard from the doctor sir henry was waiting for me as i came out of court hes to stay in bed for the rest of the week he was asking is it all over tell him its all going according to plan nothing to send his temperature up in the lift on my way up to the robing room i met miss phyllida trant she seemed in a mood of strange elation and told me that everything was going wonderfully everything i took your advice and i didnt plead she was positively glowing the light of battle burning behind her specs now it seems that theres no note of some of the verbals and most of it was after he was charged anyway and good news from somewhere you were right of course when you said always fight everything fight everything what else had we left to do i called the sunday paper again from the robing room philbeam had gone out again and left no message wheeler youre a coward as well as a thief you tied up this helpless sub post mistress and you robbed what makes it all a great deal more grave you deliberately chose through your counsel to attack the honesty and good name of someone of twentyfive years standing in the police force i mean detective inspector dickerson ive had the misfortune to sit here and hear that fine officer subjected to a number of questions we were at the last gasp of the wheeler trial a proceeding marked by the continued absence of any man called harris even so the jury had taken three hours to find charlie guilty by a majority a fact which had clearly displeased the judge i waited for the bull to finish the illphrased lecture and come to announce a figure when to the surprise of everyone in court there was a voice of protest from the dock i never silence the usher shouted but charlie battled on i never wanted my barrister to ask them questions i told him to keep quiet i sat quite still i couldnt blame charlie but i began to feel that we were at the start of something that could prove deeply embarrassing for rumpole ignoring the interruption the judge went on you have the most appalling record and it is clearly time that society was protected from you for a considerably long period the least sentence i can pass is one of twelve years imprisonment take him down charlie was removed from the dock i levered myself to my feet and started to move out of counsels row when bullingham stopped me just one moment i have something to add mr rumpole i stopped rooted to the spot the judge proceeded to sentence once more your attack on the integrity of detective inspector dickerson was not only not backed up by the evidence its now clear it was an adventure of your own without instructions i take a very serious view of it very serious indeed fourteen years i wondered but the judge contented himself with saying ominously i intend to report the matter in the proper quarter if your lordship pleases i gave him my politest bow a muchneeded lesson in courtroom manners and perhaps rumpoles last genuflection in front of the bench what had i to look forward to now except the end of life as i knew it as i took oil the wig and looked in the robing room mirror i seemed to see a new rumpole a man who might just possibly not be a barrister any more featherstone back in the land of the living was pacing his room i thought somewhat nervously while i sat in his big leather armchair and smoked a small cigar reported to the benchers of your inn a disciplinary hearing before the senate my dear horace i dont want to worry you on the contrary youre having a most calming effect i reassured him ive thought about retiring from the bar for a long time perhaps i shall start a small market garden behind gloucester road tube station ive had to write to the senate myself about the case guthrie looked embarrassed to tell them that the attack on dirty dickerson was an escapade dreamt up by your learned junior yes im sure you had to write and tell them that youll confirm that of course dont worry old sweetheart youve got a perfect alibi i stood as if in court my lord i call mrs marigold featherstone she will prove conclusively that my client was flat on his back having his chest rubbed with vick and chewing aspirin at the time of the dark deeds down the bailey rumpole dont you wish he is entirely innocent of the attempted rape of di clean fingers dickerson dont you wish youd been laid up with flu during r v wheeler i looked at him astonished at his lack of understanding you want to know the truth guvnor all right ill come clean youve got me bang to rights rumpole i loved that crossexamination i enjoyed every minute of it and whats more i swear by almighty god i was onto something if id only had a tiny bit of straw to make a brick with i hope youre not going to say that in front of the senate featherstone looked so worried that i comforted him by asking his advice what would you suggest i said as my brief he took me quite seriously and gave my hopeless case his most learned opinion i think he said at last id put it in this way in your enthusiasm understandable enthusiasm for your clients interests you were carried away rumpole in the heat of the moment you made an attack on the honesty of a senior police officer which you now deeply regret what do you think i might get probation the worst aspect of your case in my opinion featherstone was giving the matter judicial consideration now in your learned opinion is that you proceeded entirely without instructions i looked at him with astonishemnt do you think im totally insane i must say i was beginning to wonder of course i had instructions but at the conference in brixton we clearly decided i had another conference whilst you were tucked up with your hotwaterbottle charlie wheeler gave you instructions to put to this officer that he handed him the gelignite yes of course i got instructions of course featherstone asked the question which theyd be bound to ask in the senate you made a note of them at the time a note ive got too old for making notes in or out of court i carry things in my head theres no fool like an old fool of course i should have made a note our solicitor bernard will have a note of the conference or at any rate a recollection featherstone was doing his best bernard was off enjoying himself at some funeral or other he left me to the tender mercies of joyce then joyce will remember well get hold of joyce he saw another ray of light and reached for the phone joyce wasnt there oh she had some sort of fraud on with hoskins in the west court you mean you actually saw the client alone featherstone was reduced to the unalterable fact oh we live dangerously i told him down the old bailey the trouble is more trouble wheeler denied hed given you instructions he told the judge as much wouldnt you have done that in his place old darling as a matter of fact rumpole ive never been on trial for safe blowing i did my best to help featherstones imagination youve just waited three hours for the jury to find you guilty youve been told by learned leading counsel no less in brixton prison that its a few extra years for asking the dirty di certain rude questions wouldnt you deny youd given any instructions im too old to expect honour among safe blowers its a problem featherstone sat at his desk temporarily bankrupt of ideas i felt sorry for him to me it seems perfectly simple ill have to give it a good deal of thought give what a good deal of thought i was on my way to the door it was only then i realized that the old darling had actually briefed himself for my defence exactly what im going to say on your behalf to the senate soy i dont want you to say anything youd only mitigate featherstone wasnt the only one who has been giving thought to the nature of rumpoles defence a few days later hilda rang up chambers and invited my old friend george frobisher to dinner she put on a very passable meal for us and as we sat over our apple pie and cream gave me some words of wisdom apparently learned at her fathers knee daddy always said a man should stand up and admit hes in the wrong he said that was by far the best way hilda what are you talking about i was puzzled by the relevance of the thoughts of daddy he always told his clients an apology costs nothing but it can earn you untold gold in sympathy from the judge hilda finished triumphantly old c h wystan your daddy was hardly one of the nations fighters was he george a man with a good deal of wisdom for all that george and hilda seemed to be in agreement ill go and make some coffee all right quite all right ill leave you two gentlemen to your wine hilda left us and i poured port for george i meant to pluck out the heart of his mystery george i said how long is it since hilda last asked you to dinner with us it must be a good few years now a good few years yes it must be so why do you think my wife felt this sudden longing to have you share our cutlets you know perfectly well hildas worried rumpole and so am i very worried by the stand youre taking stand george what sort of stand is that this wretched man this wheeler how can he be worth risking your career over rumpole your wife cant understand that and i must say i have considerable difficulty he was worth defending everyones worth defending thats what were for isnt it do we have any other function but hilda says that you admitted to her that the man was a professional safe blower george looked at me distinctly puzzled but he had put his finger on the exact point professional of course so he wouldnt have left fingerprints do you honestly believe can you put your hand on your heart rumpole and tell me you really believe that this man wheeler was innocent oh come now george how many of your clients can you swear were innocent so you dont believe he was innocent if you ask my view of the matter and you know my view is strictly irrelevant all the same rumpole id like you to answer my questions i admired him then a new george quiet but firm and not to be put off i told him hed make a crossexaminer yet and poured him another glass of port then i gave him his answer no no i dont believe he was innocent in fact i think charlie wheeler probably blew the safe in the dartford post office so no injustice was done probably not george stood up then he was beaming at me apparently hugely relieved so that is good news rumpole youve seen sense at last hilda came in with the coffee tray and george gave her the glad tidings i believe your husbands seen sense at last i knew youd be able to talk to him hilda smiled as she poured the coffee youve always told me rumpole george is so sensible rumpoles always had a tremendous amount of respect for you george guthrie featherstone agrees it can all be dealt with by way of an apology arid now you admit it was unnecessary to attack the officer george took his coffee and smiled at me i hated to disappoint him unnecessary did you say unnecessary you said yourself wheeler was probably guilty george seemed to think that was an end of the matter guilty or innocent whats it matter what matters is he may have been convicted on faked evidence but rumpole if hed done it anyway hilda was as puzzled as george i did my best to explain it to them both we cant decide guilt or innocence thats not for us you know that george thats for twelve puzzled old darlings pulled off the street for three boring days with a safe blower but we can make sure theyre not lied to not deceived not tricked by some smiling copper who wants to take away their decision from them by a few conjuring tricks in a dark cell oh for gods sake have another glass of port i felt he needed it for he sat looking quite despondent and asked what on earth i thought i was going to do grow vegetables well probably have to go to the country to do it rumpole they wont disbar you george did his best to sound comforting i went over to the old desk in the corner and found a packet of small cigars suspend me disbar me i dont care i shant apologize for what i did for wheeler talk to him george please talk to him hilda sounded desperate george did his best rumpole forget wheeler for a moment youve got yourself to think about i found my cigars and lit one i was still searching for something i had concealed in a drawer of the desk oh i am thinking of myself you see hilda with the insurance policy and what wed get for this flat we could get quite a decent cottage and a smallholding a smallholding oh george has he gone quite mad you wouldnt know what to do with a smallholding rumpole dig it and dung it thats what id do and grow the stuff im rather keen on artichokes and marrows and parsnips and after a few years perhaps asparagus i had found what i wanted a seed catalogue full of fine colour photographs of prize vegetables look hilda do look at this please look at it i took the catalogue over to hilda and held it open at a particularly succulent row of runner beans dont you think it all looks rather splendid she shook her head hilda rumpole is incredibly urban all her life has revolved round law courts and barristers chambers she could only see a row of runners or even a picking of early peas through a haze of tears a man under our system is innocent until hes proved guilty and in the time that elapsed before my case was due to be heard in the senate by the tribunal that decides matters of discipline at the bar i continued business as usual although the briefs didnt exactly fall like summer rain onto the fertile soil of rumpoles chambers however i left home earlier than usual largely to escape the sorrowful and rebuking eye of she who must be obeyed often had breakfast on my own with the times crossword at jocks cafe and lingered late in pommeroys wine bar i was sitting there at a lonely table with my head deep in the evening standard when i heard erskinebrowns voice ringing from the bar vegetables did you say rumpole was going to grow vegetables he actually bought a catalogue a list of seeds with illustrations george sounded like a doctor announcing the symptoms of a fatal disease how old is rumpole do you think he might be going a bit screwy of course not the female voice was quite positive the first thing i learned at the bar was never underestimate the cunning of rumpole it was the clear and dulcet tone of miss trant for a while their voices were drowned in the general clatter of legal anecdotes journalists attempted seductions and cries for claret which make up the full orchestra of the sound of pommeroys and then i heard my old friend george booming sadly obstinate rumpoles incredibly obstinate you know what hes saying now even if they just suspend him for a little while even if they censure him hell leave the bar and he wont apologize then surely one things perfectly clear george it was erskinebrown again whats that rumpole has absolutely no one to blame but himself im going back to chambers come on philly ive just got to pick up a brief and then were off to the festival hall til catch you up i sank my head deeper in the londoners diary and then looked up as miss trants voice came again from about three feet away you going to send us up some nice fresh vegetables as i lowered the paper miss trant sat down and joined me uninvited it was amazing the confidence she had developed since her baptism of fire in dock street peas and carrots new potatoes sounds delicious i have been having doubts i suppose i needed someone to talk to at that moment life with hilda being then on the silent side looking back at my past life hanging round law courts i found absolutely no evidence for the proposition that i have green fingers neither have i what my pot plants all go yellow its only that whenever i visit prisons and see the trusties planting out straight rows of chrysanths in the sooty soil i think yes thats the job ill choose when im in the nick then an extraordinary thing happened miss trant actually seemed to lose her temper with me really youre not going to the nick you told me never to underestimate your cunning like the time when i was prosecuting you and you got me to bore the magistrate with a load of law and you won the case finally tumbled to that did you i smiled remembering the occasion well if you can think of that in the dock street mags court cant you deal with this little case of yours in the senate i shant apologize i told her that quite firmly and another surprise she didnt argue of course you wont why were you thinking of it was i creeping off to the country to grow vegetables its like pleading guilty well stuff that for a lark this slip of a girl had the spirit which was lacking in featherstone or hilda or even george the courage of an advocate miss trant i told her i remember when you first came to the chambers you weie a somewhat straightlaced young woman only interested in law reports ive learned a lot since then from your pupil master erskinebrown no from you what do you say we ought to have written up in chambers in letters a foot high never plead guilty i bricks without bricks miss trant bricks without the bloody shadow of a brick unless wellgoon unless someone could lay their hands on a man called harry harris when she had gone i sat on for a while alone i thought of my hearing before the senate of the inns of court what would that august body do to me change me utterly i might leave their presence as someone quite new perhaps even as myself it seemed to me that i had spent my whole life being other people safe blowers fraudsmen a few rather gentle murderers id had remarkably little time to be rumpole would i have time now and if i had time hanging heavy on my hands forever should i enjoy the experience of being my own genuine unadulterated rumpole at last jack pommeroy broke in on this uncomfortable reverie there was a phone call for me from philbeam he wanted me to stay where i was he was bringing a man round for a drink a man called harry harris a few nights later detective inspector dickerson was sitting in the corner of his favourite chinese restaurant waiting his eye lit up when a tall very thin man with grey hair came in for had this man not arrived the detective inspector was in great danger of having to pay his own bill harris dickerson waved a large hand at the empty chair at his table where you been keeping yourself harry i got word you wanted to see me dickerson you want to buy me a chinese do you the ai combination with the sweet and sour lobster id be glad to harris smiled patiently i thought you would you been a bit late on your instalments harris sorry dickerson ive been travelling at this point harris took a bulky envelope out of his breast pocket and handed it to the detective inspector whose manner became if possible even more affable well leave a forwarding address then well get on much more nicely if i can bleed you regular i think dickerson consulted the wine list a nice bottle of chablisd go well with the sweet and sour when harris had ordered the chablis from the chinese waiter he broached an awkward subject can we forget it now he asked and his voice had for the first time a whining tone forget what harris a couple of fingerprints on a gold case there was a long silence and then dickerson said youre so careless harris where you put your fingers youre as bad as your friend charlie wheeler i heard you fitted charlie up nicely too fitted him up who told you i fitted charlie up the jury convicted him didnt they dickerson sounded cautious but harris was laughing such a nice friendly lad charlie hed shake hands with anyone it was a little while before dickerson joined in the joke but apparently he found it irresistible all right harris he said through chuckles very funny very funny indeed but let it be a lesson to you if you dont bleed regular ill have your fingers round a lump of jelly just the way i did with charlie there was an interruption then when the waiter brought the chablis dickerson turned his attention to the temperature of the bottle if he hadnt done so he might have noticed the tip of a small metallic object hidden in the breast pocket of harriss jacket the reason for that and for my having a verbatim account of this conversation is that it was being taken down for posterity and the subsequent police inquiry on a small but efficient tape recorder which was later delivered to philbeams car parked outside the garden of delights whilst i was explaining matters to the senate the learned friends ot no i equity court were holding a chambers meeting i am grateful to george frobisher for supplying me with a note of what was said during my enforced absence the first item on the agenda was the question of accommodation in chambers and was raised by erskinebrown it seems likely he began that we will soon be having a vacancy in chambers what do you mean exactly miss trant asked the question well philly after todays hearing rumpoles made it quite clear he intends to leave the bar and grow vegetables vegetables i hadnt heard about the vegetables featherstone was understandably puzzled shouldnt we perhaps wait george suggested but erskinebrown was not to be stopped i think its important he said that we should decide what the policy is as you know my own room is impossibly overcrowded george frobisher is sharing with hoskins which isnt always convenient when it comes to conferences i mean do we take in another young man who could make himself useful and do a bit of paper work and so on the door was behind him and he didnt stop immediately when i opened it or do we use rumpoles room to relieve our acute accommodation problem do you want to take over my room erskinebrown i was back from my hearing from erskinebrowns point of view like bloody banquo at the dinner party he stopped in full flow and george said rumpole it cant be over ah horace featherstone pulled up a chair for the ghost of rumpole you can help us weve just been discussing the possible future so have i old darling and ill tell you what the possible future is rather interesting i lit a small cigar remember detective inspector dickerson hes suspended a full inquiry when he heard that in the nick charlie suddenly remembered giving me instructions so were applying to the court of appeal with fresh evidence i was rather thinking of doing it alone without a leader im sorry erskinebrown the vegetables have been postponed indefinitely i left them then the learned and astonished friends to sort out their accommodation problems knowing that rumpoles room would not be available in the foreseeable future when i got home to the mansions i found hilda sitting inert by one bar of a sullen electric fire she looked up as i came into the living room and said rumpole is it over im afraid so oh rumpole its over i know my dear no peace no quiet no just being rumpole above all no vegetables im doing rather a larky manslaughter tomorrow at chelmsford they let you off i couldnt imagine why she sounded so surprised i filled in the details acquitted by unanimous verdict left the dock without a stain on my character in fact i was commended for picking out one of the few rotten apples in that sweetsmelling barrowload the metropolitan police oh rumpole it was an astonishing moment she who must be obeyed actually had her arms round me she was holding me tightly rather as though i were some rare and precious object and not the old white elephant that continually got in her way hilda hilda youre not i looked down at her agitated head you werent worried were you worried well of course i was worried i she broke away and resumed the royal manner having you at home all day would have been impossible yes yes i suppose it would now we can go on just as before just as before i suppose it calls for a celebration i went to the drinks table and poured two booths taking care not to ruin them with too much tonic well just a tiny one ive got dinner to get and im sorry to have to tell you this hilda you know your old daddy old ch wystan was quite wrong i handed her a steadying g and t wrong why was daddy wrong never plead guilty come on old thing bottoms up i raised my glass hilda raised hers and we drank to a future which was going to be thanks to the wonders of tape recording and the fallibility of human nature as indistinguishable as possible from our past the end
