 chapter one back for the holidays george cant you sit still for even a minute said julian its bad enough to have the train rocking about all over the place without you falling over my feet all the time going to look out of first one window and then the other well were nearly at kirrin almost home said george i cant help feeling excited ive missed old timmy so much this term and i just cant wait to see him i love to look out of the window and see how much nearer we are to kirrin do you think timmy will be on the station to meet us barking madly dont be an ass said dick hes a clever dog but not clever enough to read railway timetables he doesnt need to said george he always knows when im coming home i really believe he does said anne seriously your mother always says how excited he is on the day you are arriving home from school cant keep still keeps going to the front gate and looking down the road dear dear timmy said george falling over julians feet again as she scrambled once more to the window were nearly there look theres the signalbox and the signal is down hurrah her three cousins looked at her in amusement george was always like this on the way home from school her thoughts were full of very little else but her beloved timmy all the way home julian thought how much she looked like a restless boy just then with her short curly hair and her determined expression george had always longed to be a boy but as she wasnt she made up for it by trying to speak and act like one and would never answer to her full name of georgina were coming into kirrin station yelled george almost falling out of the window i can see our porter hey peters were back again were back again the train slid into kirrin station and peters waved and grinned he had known george since she was a baby george opened the door and leapt out of the carriage home again back at kirrin oh i do hope timmy will be at the station she said but there was no timmy there he must have forgotten you were coming said dick with a grin and at once got a scowl from george peters came up smiling all over his face and gave them his usual welcome everyone in kirrin village knew the five which of course included timmy the dog peters soon had the childrens luggage out and wheeled it down the platform on his trolley ill send it along to kirrin cottage as soon as the van comes he said had a good term smashing said dick but it seemed very long as easter is so late this year my word look at the primroses on the railway banks but george had no eyes for anything just then she was still looking out for timmy where was he why hadnt he come to the station to meet them he came last time and the time before she turned a troubled face to dick do you think hes ill she asked or has he forgotten me or oh dont be an ass george said dick he is probably in the house somewhere and cant get out look out the trolley nearly ran you over then george skipped out of the way glaring where was timmy she was sure he was ill or had had an accident or was tied up and couldnt get away perhaps joan the cook had forgotten to let him loose im going to take a taxi home if ive enough money she said taking out her purse you others can walk i must see if anythings happened to timmy hes never missed meeting our train before but george its such a lovely walk to kirrin cottage said anne you know how you love to see your island dear old kirrin island as we walk to your mothers house and the bay and hear the waves crashing on the rocks im taking the station taxi said george obstinately counting the money in her purse if youd like to come with me you can its timmy i want to see not islands and waves and things im sure hes ill or has had an accident or something all right george do as you please said julian hope you find dear old timmy is perfectly well and has only forgotten the time of the train see you later the two brothers and their sister anne set off together looking forward to the walk to kirrin cottage how lovely to see kirrin bay again and georges island isnt she lucky to have a real island of her very own said anne fancy it belonging to her family for years and years and then one day her mother suddenly gives it to george i bet she worried and worried dear aunt fanny until she gave in to old george i do so hope timmy is all right we shant enjoy our holidays with georges mother if theres anything wrong with timmy oh george will probably go and live in timmys kennel with him said dick with a chuckle ha look the sea and kirrin bay and the little old island as lovely as ever with its gulls circling round and mewing like cats said julian and the old ruined castle there just exactly the same as usual not a single stone fallen out of it as far as i can see you cant possibly see that at this distance said anne screwing up her eyes oh isnt the first day of the hols heavenly we seem to have all the time in the world in front of us yes and then alas after a few days the holidays rush by said julian i wonder if george is home by now well her taxi passed us going at a tremendous pace said dick i bet old george was shouting at the driver to go as fast as possible look theres kirrin cottage i can just see the chimneys in the distance said dick smoke is coming from one of them funny why only one said julian they usually have the kitchen fire going and a fire in uncle quentins study hes such a cold mortal when hes working out all his wonderful figures for his inventions perhaps hes away said anne hopefully she was rather afraid of georges hastytempered father i should think uncle quentin could do with a holiday at times hes always buried in rows and rows of figures well lets hope we dont disturb him too much said julian its hard on aunt fanny if he keeps yelling at everyone well try and be out of doors most of the time they were nearly at kirrin cottage now as they came near to the front gate they saw george come running down the gardenpath to julians horror she was crying bitterly i say it does look as if something has happened to old timmy he said scared its not like george to cry she never cries what can have happened in great alarm they began to run and anne shouted as she ran george george whats the matter is something wrong with timmy whats happened we cant stay at home wept george weve got to go away somewhere something awfuls happened what is it tell us you idiot said dick in alarm for goodness sake whats happened is timmy run over or something no it isnt timmy said george wiping her eyes with her hand because as usual she had no handkerchief its joan joan our dear darling cook whats the matter with her asked julian thinking of all kinds of dreadful things george will you please tell us joans got scarlet fever said george sniffing dolefully so we cant be at kirrin cottage why not demanded dick joan will have to go to a fever hospital and we can all stay at kirrin cottage and help your mother poor old joan but cheer up george scarlet fever isnt much of a thing to have nowadays come on lets go in and see if we can comfort your mother poor old aunt fanny she will be in a stew with all of us four cousins at kirrin cottage too never mind we can stop jabbering dick said george exasperated we cant stay at kirrin cottage mother wouldnt even let me go in at the front door she shooed me away and said i was to wait in the garden the doctor was coming in a minute or two someone called to them from a window of kirrin cottage are you all there children julian come here will you they all went into the garden and saw their aunt fanny georges mother leaning out of a bedroom window listen dears she said joan has scarlet fever and is waiting for an ambulance to take her to the hospital and aunt fanny dont worry well all turn to and help called back julian cheerfully dear julian you still dont understand said his aunt you see neither your uncle nor i have had scarlet fever so we are in quarantine and mustnt have anyone near us in case we get it and give it to them and that might mean wed give it to all you four would timmy get it asked george still sniffing dolefully no of course not dont be silly george said her mother did you ever hear of dogs getting measles or whoopingcough or any of our illnesses timmy isnt in quarantine you can get him out of his kennel as soon as you like georges face lighted up immediately and she shot round the back of the house yelling timmys name at once there came a volley of barks aunt fanny what do you want us to do asked julian we cant go to my home because my people are still in germany should we go to a hotel no dear ill think of somewhere you can all go said his aunt good gracious what a row timmy is making poor joan she has such a splitting headache heres the ambulance cried anne as a big hospital van drew up outside the gate mrs kirrin disappeared from the window at once to tell joan the ambulance man went up to the front door his mate behind him carrying a stretcher the four children watched in surprise hes gone to fetch dear old joan said julian and sure enough the stretcher was soon carried out with joan lying on it wrapped round in blankets she waved to the children as the men carried her out soon be back she said in rather a croaky voice help mrs kirrin if you can so sorry about this poor joan said anne with tears in her eyes get better quickly joan we shall miss you so the ambulance door closed and the van went off very smoothly and quietly whatever shall we do said dick turning to julian cant go home cant stay here oh heres timmy how are you tim old thing thank goodness you cant get scarlet fever dont knock me over old boy down gosh what a licky dog you are timmy was the only one in high spirits the others felt really down in the dumps oh dear what was to be done where could they go what a horrid beginning to a holiday down timmy down what a dog anyone would think he had never even heard of scarlet fever will you get down timmy chapter two plans for the five george was still looking upset what with her fears that timmy might be ill or hurt and now her distress at joan being carried off in the ambulance she wasnt much help to anyone do stop sniffing george said anne weve just got to be sensible and think of some way out of this im going to find mother said george i dont care if shes in quarantine or not oh no youre not said julian taking her firmly by the arm you jolly well know what quarantine means when you had whoopingcough you werent allowed to come near any of us in case we caught it too you were infectious and that meant that you didnt have close contact with anybody for at least a few weeks i think its only two weeks for scarlet fever so it wont be too bad george went on sniffing trying to pull away from julians hand julian winked at dick and said something that made george pull herself together at once well really george he said youre acting just like a weepy girl poor georgina poor little old georgina george stopped sniffing immediately and glared at julian in fury if there was one thing she really hated it was to be told she was acting like a silly girl and how awful to be called by her real name georgina she gave julian a hefty punch and he grinned at her warding her off thats better he said cheer up just look at timmy staring at you in amazement hes hardly ever heard you crying before im not crying said george im well im upset about joan and its awful to have nowhere to go i can hear aunt fanny telephoning said anne who had very sharp ears she fondled timmys head and he licked her hand he had already given everyone a wonderful welcome whining with pleasure and licking lavishly he had been mad with joy to see george again and was surprised and sad to find her looking so miserable now dear timmy he certainly belonged to the five lets sit down and wait for aunt fanny said julian settling himself on the grass we look a bit silly standing staring at kirrin cottage like this aunt fanny will come to the window in a minute she is sure to have thought of a good idea for us timmy i shant stay sitting down for long if you keep licking my neck like that i shall send you for a towel in a minute so that i can wipe it dry the little joke made everyone feel better they were all sitting on the grass now and timmy went lovingly from one to the other all his family back again it was too good to be true he settled down at last his head on georges knee georges hand caressing his ears aunt fannys put down the telephone said anne now shell come to the window youve got ears like a dog just as good as timmys said dick i couldnt hear a thing heres mother said george and leapt to her feet as mrs kirrin came to the window and leaned out its all right dears she called ive been able to arrange something for you i have been telephoning the scientist that your father has been working with george professor hayling he was coming here for a day or two and when i told him he couldnt because were in quarantine he at once said that you must all go there and that tinker his son you remember him dont you would be delighted to have your company tinker goodness yes i shall never forget him or his monkey either said julian hes the boy who owns that old lighthouse at demons rocks isnt he we went to stay there with him and had a marvellous time well youre not staying at the lighthouse im afraid said his aunt from the window apparently a storm blew up one night and damaged it and its not safe to live in any more groans from all the five of course timmy joining in as usual where are we to go then to tinkers home asked dick yes you can get a bus from here at little hollow that will take you almost to big hollow where professor hayling lives said aunt fanny youre to go today im so very sorry about this dears but its just one of those things we have to put up with im sure youll have a good time with tinker and that monkey of his what was it called now mischief said everyone together and anne smiled in delight to think of being with the naughty little creature and watching its wicked ways the bus will pass in ten minutes said her aunt julian if you cant manage to get your things on the bus ask the gardener over the way to help you and have a good time dears and send me a card or two ill let you know how we get on but i really dont think that either your uncle or i will catch scarlet fever so dont worry and ill send you some money to spend youd better run for the bus now right aunt fanny and thank you called julian ill look after everyone and keep them in order especially old george dont worry at all and i do hope you or uncle dont go down with the fever goodbye they all went to the front gate where the luggage still stood anne go out into the road and stop the bus when it comes ordered julian then dick and i will heave our bags aboard gosh i wonder what it will be like with old tinker at big hollow ive a feeling it might be rather exciting i dont think so said george mournfully i like tinker all right hes funny and that little monkey is a darling such a naughty little thing too but oh dear dont you remember what it was like when tinkers father came to stay with us it was awful he never remembered to come to meals and was always losing his coat or his hanky or his money and losing his temper too i got very tired of him well hell probably get very tired of us said julian he wont find it very funny to have four kids parked on him especially if hes in the middle of difficult work to say nothing of a rather large licky dog leaping round the house as well timmy isnt likely to lick him said george at once and put on one of her scowls i didnt like tinkers father at all well dont look like a thunderstorm said julian i dont expect hell like any of us either but its decent of him to give us an invitation to stay at big hollow and were jolly well going to behave ourselves see theres to be no backchat from you george even if he dares to disapprove of timmy hed better not said george in fact ive a good mind not to go i think ill live in the summerhouse with timmy at the bottom of the garden you will not said julian taking firm hold of her arm youll play fair come with us and behave properly listen theres the bus come on well all wave and hope the driver has a few empty seats anne had already stopped the bus and run round to the back of it to ask the conductor if he could help with the bags he knew the children very well and leapt down at once youre going back to school pretty quick he said i thought the schools had only just broken up they have said julian but were off to stay at big hollow the bus goes there doesnt it yes we go right through the village of big hollow said the conductor carrying three bags at once much to julians envy whereabouts are you staying there at professor haylings house said julian i think thats called big hollow too like the village ah we pass it said the conductor ill stop the bus just outside and give you a hand with your things again my word youll have to mind your ps and qs there old professor haylings a bit peculiar you know goes off the handle properly if things dont go his way once a horse got into his garden and believe it or not he chased that horse for two miles shouting at it all the way and bless me when he got back home tired out there was that horse chewing up his garden again the horse was cute hed taken a short cut back yes you be careful how you behave at big hollow the old man might get cross and pop you into one of his queer machines and grind you up into little pieces the four children laughed oh the old professor is all right said julian a bit forgetful like most people who work with their brains all the time my brain goes fairly slowly but my uncle quentins goes about a hundred miles an hour and i bet the professors does too well be all right away went the bus bumping over the road from kirrin and little hollow and on to big hollow the four children gazed out of the windows as they passed alongside the shore where the sea shone as blue as cornflowers and once more saw kirrin island out in the big bay wish we were going there sighed george well have to take a picnic meal there sometime and enjoy ourselves id like old tinker to visit my island he may have a lighthouse of his own but having an island is much better i think i agree with you said julian tinkers lighthouse is certainly lovely and all on its own and the view from it is amazing but theres something about kirrin island that i love islands are quite different from anything else yes they are said anne id like one too a very little one so that i could see all round it at one glance and id like one little cave to sleep in just big enough for me youd soon be lonely anne said dick giving his sister a friendly pat you love to have people round you you like to be friendly so does timmy said julian as timmy left his place by georges knee and went to sniff at a netbag held by an old man who at once fondled the big dog and fumbled for a biscuit out of a paper bag timmy doesnt mind how many people there are around so long as one or two of them has a biscuit or a bone to hand out come to heel timmy said george youre not to go round begging telling people you are halfstarved i should think you eat more than any other dog in kirrin who eats the cats dinner whenever he can i should like to know timmy gave george a loving lick and settled down beside her his head on her shoes he got up politely every time someone entered or left the bus the conductor was most impressed i wish all dogs were as good on my bus as yours he told george youd better get ready to jump out our next stop is supposed to be a little way beyond big hollow but ill ring my bell and the driver will stop for a moment and you can get out thanks awfully said julian gratefully and when the bus stopped with a jerk a minute later all the five were ready to jump out the bus went on and left them standing outside a large wooden gate the drive from it led steeply downwards and a large house could just be seen hidden in a hollow by great trees big hollow said julian well here we are what a queer place sort of mysterious and brooding now to find old tinker i bet hell be pleased to see us all especially timmy help me with the bags dick chapter three big hollow and tinker and mischief again the four children and timmy went through the big heavy gate which groaned loudly timmy was very startled to hear the mournful creak and barked sharply sh said george youll get into trouble with the professor timmy if you raise your voice like that i expect well have to talk in whispers so as not to disturb the professor so just see if you can whisper too timmy gave a small whine he knew he couldnt whisper he trotted at georges heel as they all went down the steep drive to the house it was a queer house built sideways to the drive and had astonishingly few windows i expect professor hayling is afraid of people peering in at his work said anne its very very secret isnt it i know he uses miles and miles of figures said dick tinker told me one day that his monkey mischief once chewed up a page of figures when he was very small and professor hayling chased him for a whole hour hoping to catch him and find even a few bits of paper still in his mouth so that he could rescue at least part of his figures but mischief fled down a rabbithole and didnt come up for two days so it wasnt any good everyone smiled at the thought of poor mischief hiding down a rabbithole you couldnt do that timmy old thing said julian so just be careful of any paper you eat he wouldnt be so silly said george at once he knows perfectly well whats eatable and whats not ha does he said anne well id just like to know what kind of food he thought my blue slipper was that he chewed up last hols dont tell tales of him said george he only chewed it because someone shut him in your bedroom and he hadnt anything else to do woof said timmy quite agreeing he gave annes hand a little lick as if to say very sorry anne but i was so bored dear timmy i wouldnt mind if you chewed up all my slippers said anne but it would be nice if you chose the very oldest ones timmy suddenly stopped and looked into the bushes he gave a low growl george put her hand on his collar at once she was always afraid of snakes in the spring time it might be an adder she said the dog next door trod on one last year so i heard and his leg swelled up terribly and he was in great pain come away now timmy its an adder with poison in its fangs but timmy went on growling then he suddenly stood still and sniffed hard he gave an excited whimper and pulled away from george jumping into the bushes and out came not a snake but mischief tinkers brighteyed little monkey he at once leapt on to the dogs broad back put his little monkey fingers under timmys collar and chattered in delight timmy nearly dislocated his neck trying to twist his head round to lick him mischief cried everyone at once in real delight youve come to welcome us and the little monkey jabbering away excitedly in monkeylanguage leapt first on to georges shoulder and then on to julians he pulled julians hair twisted his right ear round and then leapt from him to dick and on to annes shoulder he cuddled into her neck his eyes bright and brown looking very happy oh isnt he pleased to see us again said anne delighted mischief wheres tinker mischief jumped off annes shoulder and scampered down the drive as if he quite understood all that anne had said the children raced after him and then a stentorian voice suddenly roared at them from one side of the drive what are you doing here clear out this is private ground ill fetch the police clear out the five stopped still in fright and then julian saw who it was professor hayling he stepped forward at once good afternoon sir he said i hope we didnt disturb you but you did tell my aunt we could come here your aunt whos your aunt i dont know any aunt roared the professor youre sightseers thats what you are come to pry into my work just because there was a piece about it in some silly paper youre the third lot today clear out i tell you and take that dog too how dare you but sir dont you really know us said julian very startled you came to stay at our house you know and stuff and nonsense i havent been away for years shouted the professor mischief the monkey was so frightened that he leapt away into the bushes making a funny little crying noise i hope he fetches tinker said julian in a low voice to dick the professor has forgotten who we are and why weve come lets retreat a bit but as they went cautiously back up the steep path followed by the angry professor a loud voice hailed them and tinker came racing up with mischief on his shoulder clinging to his hair so the little monkey had gone to fetch him good for him thought julian pleased dad dont yell at our friends like that cried tinker dancing about in front of his angry father you asked them here yourself you know you did i did not said the professor who are they well george that girl is the daughter of mr kirrin and the others are his niece and nephews and thats their dog timmy and you asked them all here because mr and mrs kirrin are in quarantine for scarlet fever shouted tinker still dancing about in front of his father stop jigging about like that said the professor crossly i dont remember asking them i would have told jenny the maid if i had you did tell her shouted tinker still jigging about with mischief the monkey jigging too in delight shes already made up the beds i helped her shes angry because you left your breakfast and now its almost dinnertime shes cleared it away bless us all so thats why i feel so hungry and cross said professor hayling and he began to laugh he had a tremendous laugh and the children couldnt help laughing too what an odd fellow so brainy such a fine scientist with the most enormous amount of knowledge in his head and yet no memory for such ordinary things as breakfast and visitors and telephone calls it was just a misunderstanding sir said julian politely it was very very kind of you to invite us here when we cant be at home because of the scarlet fever well try not to be a nuisance and if theres anything we can do to help you please ask us well make as little noise as possible and keep out of your way of course you hear that tinker said professor hayling suddenly swinging round on the startled tinker why cant you do the same make a very little noise and keep out of my way you know im very busy now on a most important project he turned to julian youll be very welcome if you keep tinker out of my way and nobody absolutely nobody is to go up into that tower understand they all looked up to where he was pointing and saw a tall slender tower rising up amid the trees it had curious tentaclelike rods sticking out at the top and these shook slightly in the breeze and dont ask me questions about it went on the professor looking fiercely at george your fathers the only other man who knows what its for and he knows how to keep his mouth shut none of us would dream of prying sir said julian its very very kind of you to offer to have us here and do believe me when i say we shant be any trouble to you at all but a help if youll allow us ah well you sound a sensible fellow i must say said the professor who had now calmed down and looked quite peaceable well ill say goodbye for now and go and have my breakfast i hope its fried eggs and bacon im very hungry dad jennys cleared your breakfast away i told you that before said tinker in despair its almost dinnertime now ah good good said the professor ill come at once and he led the way indoors followed by the five children with timmy and mischief all looking rather worried really nobody ever knew what the professor was going to do or say next jenny certainly had a good dinner for them all there was a large and delicious stew with carrots onions and peas swimming in the gravy and plenty of potatoes everyone tucked in well and mischief who loved the peas took quite a few from tinkers plate his little paw creeping up and neatly snatching a pea from the gravy the girls went out to help bring in the next course which was a big steamed pudding with plenty of raisins in it mischief at once jigged up and down in delight for he loved raisins he leapt on to the table and received a sharp smack from the professor who unfortunately smacked the pudding dish at the same time making the pudding jump in the air good gracious dad we nearly lost the pudding cried tinker and its my favourite oh dont give us such small pieces mischief get off the table you are not to put your paw into the white sauce so mischief disappeared under the table where he received quite a lot of raisins from various kindly hands unseen by the professor timmy felt rather left out he was under the table too having been rather scared by the professors angry voice but as he didnt very much like raisins he wasnt as lucky as mischief ha i enjoyed that said the professor having cleaned his plate thoroughly nothing like a good breakfast it was midday dinner dad said tinker you dont have pudding at breakfast dear me of course that was pudding said his father and laughed his great laugh now you can all do exactly what you like so long as you do not go into my study or my workroom or that tower and dont meddle with anything mischief get off the waterjug youll upset it cant you teach that monkey some tablemanners tinker and with that he marched out of the room and disappeared into some mysterious passage that apparently led to his study or workroom everyone heaved a sigh of relief well clear away and then ill show you your rooms said tinker i do hope you wont be too dull here dull tinker you neednt worry there is far too much excitement waiting for the five and you too just wait a bit and see chapter four jenny has a very good idea tinker raced out to the kitchen to fetch a tray or two he made a most peculiar noise as he went and for a moment timmy looked extremely startled goodness dont say that tinker still has that awful habit of pretending to be some kind of car groaned julian how on earth does his father put up with it whats he think he is now a motorbicycle by the sound of it there was a sudden crash and a loud yell the five raced down the kitchen passage to find out what had happened timmy at the front accident bellowed tinker scrambling up from the floor i took the bend too quickly and my front wheel skidded and i went bang into a wall ive bent my mudguard tinker do you mean to say youre still being fatheaded enough to pretend to be cars and bicycles and tractors and lorries demanded julian you nearly drove us all mad driving about all over the house when you stayed with us have you got to be a machine of some sort yes said tinker rubbing one of his arms it sort of comes over me and away i go you should have heard me being a lorry absolutely loaded with new cars for delivery yesterday dad really thought it was a great lorry and he rushed out into the drive to send it away but it was only me i hooted too like this and the sound of a loud and deep hooter immediately filled the passage julian shoved tinker into the kitchen and shut the door i should have thought that your father would have been driven completely mad by now he said now you just shut up cant you grow up a bit no said tinker sullenly i dont want to grow up i might be like my father and forget to eat my meals and go out with one sock on and one off and id hate to forget my meals just think how awful it would be id always be hungry julian couldnt help laughing pick up your tray and help to clear away he said and if you simply cant help being a car sometimes for goodness sake go outside it sounds frightful in the house youre much too good at awful noises oh am i really good said tinker pleased i suppose you wouldnt like to hear me being one of those new planes that go over here sometimes making a queer droning noise no i would not said julian firmly now will you please get that tray tinker and tell mischief to get off my right foot he seems to think its a chair but mischief clung to julians ankle and refused to move all right all right said julian i shall just have to walk about all day with you riding on my foot if you stamp as you walk he soon gets off remarked tinker why didnt you tell me that just now asked julian and stamped a few steps round the room mischief leapt off his foot at once and sat on a table making an angry noise he sits on dads foot for ages even when he walks about said tinker but dad doesnt even notice him there he even sat on dads head once and dad thought he was wearing his hat indoors and tried to take it off but it was only mischief there that made everyone laugh now come on said julian briskly we really must clear away the dinner things we three boys will carry out the loaded trays and you girls can wash up and dont let mischief think he can carry teapots or milkjugs jenny was very pleased with their help she was short and fat and waddled rather than walked but managed to get here and there remarkably quickly ill show your visitors their bedrooms after weve cleared she said but you know tinker those mattresses we sent to be remade havent come back yet ive told your father a dozen times to telephone about them but im sure he hasnt remembered oh jenny said tinker in dismay that means that the two beds for visitors cant be slept in what ever are we to do well your dad will have to ring up for new mattresses to be sent today said jenny maybe they would send them out by van tinker immediately became a furniture van and rushed down the passage into the diningroom and back again mischief following him in delight he made a noise exactly like a slowmoving van and the children couldnt help laughing the professor shot out of his study his hands to his ears tinker come here no thanks said tinker warily sorry father i was a van bringing the mattresses you forgot to order for the beds for visitors but the professor didnt seem to hear he advanced on tinker who fled upstairs with mischief leaping after him professor hayling turned on jenny cant you keep the children quiet what do i pay you for cleaning cooking and washing she said briskly but im not a nurse for children sir that tinker of yours could do with half a dozen nurses and hed still be a nuisance to you while he was in the house why dont you let him take his tent and camp out in the field with his friends its hot weather and those new mattresses havent come and theyd all love it i can cook for the children and take them out meals or they could come and fetch them the professor looked as if he could give jenny a big hug the children waited eagerly to see what he would say camping out that would be fun in this weather and honestly living in the same house as the professor wasnt going to be much fun timmy gave a little whine as if to say fine idea lets go at once good idea jenny very good idea said professor hayling but that monkeys to camp out too then perhaps he wont jump in at my workroom window and fiddle about with my models he marched back into his study and slammed the door so hard that the whole house shook timmy was startled and gave a yelp mischief the monkey leapt up the stairs howling in fright tinker began to dance round in joy and very firmly jenny took hold of him and propelled him into her big clean kitchen wait jenny ive remembered something weve only one tent and thats mine a small one ill have to ask dad if i can get two big ones and before anyone could stop him he was banging at the professors door then flung it open and shouted out his request we want two more tents dad can i buy them for goodness sake tinker clear out and leave me alone shouted his father buy six tents if you want them but get out ooh thanks dad said tinker and was just slipping out of the door when his father yelled again but what on earth do you want tents for tinker slammed the door and grinned at the others id better buy dad a new memory hes only just told us we can camp out and he knows theres only my very small tent almost a toy one im glad we shant be in the house said anne i know what a nuisance it is to georges father to have us around playing about well be better out of the way camping out again said george very pleased lets catch the bus back home and get our own tents ive got them all stored away in the garden shed we can ask jim the carrier to fetch them when weve found them hes calling here today ill give him the message for you if you like said jenny the sooner you get the tents the better it was a kind thought of the masters to ask you all here but i just knew it wouldnt work youll be all right out in the fields at the back of the house he wont hear a thing not even if you all yell together so you get your tents and put them up and ill see what i can find in the way of groundsheets and rugs dont bother jenny said julian weve got all those things weve often camped out before i only hope there arent any cows in the fields said anne last time we camped a cow put its head into my tent opening and mooed i woke up with such a jump and i was too scared to move i dont think there are any cows said jenny laughing now i am to get on with the washingup so will you bring out the dinner things please but dont let that monkey carry anything breakable for goodness sake he tried to balance the teapot on his head last week and that was the end of the teapot soon everyone was cleaning away with a will and the two girls helped jenny with the washingup i shall like camping out anne told her id be scared of staying here in the house professor hayling is a bit like my uncle quentin you know forgetful and quicktempered and a bit shouty oh you dont want to be scared of him said jenny handing anne a dish to dry hes kind for all his crossness when hes upset why when my mother was ill he paid for her to go into a really good nursinghome and believe it or not he gave me money to buy her fruit and flowers oh goodness that reminds me we must send our cook joan some flowers said george she has scarlet fever you know thats why were here well you go and telephone the florist said jenny ill finish this job but george was rather afraid that professor hayling might rush out to see who was using the telephone im sure we can buy flowers in kirrin village and have them sent she said weve got to go and get our things ready for the carrier and i can order the flowers then we might as well come back on our bicycles theyd be useful here well youd better go now said jenny or you wont be back in time for tea and then thered be trouble ill bring back annes bicycle said julian i can easily manage it beside mine as i ride back look george said dick you neednt come ill order the flowers and i can bring your bike back too so you stay with anne reluctantly george agreed off went julian and dick leaving tinker and the girls to help jenny but jenny soon sent tinker off afraid that he would drop things and break them you go and be a nice quiet purring rolls royce at the bottom of the garden she saidand when you think youve done thirty miles or so come back for petrol lemonade you mean said tinker with a grin all right i havent been a rolls royce for a long time dad wont hear me right at the bottom of the garden off he went and jenny and the girls finished the washingup mischief was a nuisance and went off with the teaspoons he leapt to the top of a high cupboard and dropped them there tinker suddenly put his head in at the window come on out in the field where were going to put up our tents he called to anne and george well choose a nice sheltered spot buck up you must have finished washingup by now im tired of being a rolls royce you go with him anne said george i dont feel like it just now so down the garden went the two children and out through a gate at the bottom into a big field good gracious said tinker staring look at all those caravans coming in at the gate the other end of the field ill soon send them off its our field and away he marched to the gate in the distance come back tinker shouted anne youll get into trouble if you interfere come back but tinker marched on his head held high ha hed soon tell the caravanfolk it was his field chapter five the travelling circus anne watched anxiously as tinker went on and on over the field there were now four caravans trundling in at the far gate and behind them in the lane were vans enormous vans all with enormously large words painted on them tappers travelling circus hoo ill tell mr tapper what i think of him coming into my field said tinker to himself mischief the monkey was on his shoulder jogging up and down as tinker marched along muttering furiously four or five children from the caravans looked at him curiously as he marched along one small boy rushed up to him shouting in delight to see the monkey a monkey look a monkey he cried much smaller than our chimp whats he called boy mind your own business said tinker wheres mr tapper mr tapper oh you mean our grandad said the boy hes over there look beside that big van better not talk to him now boy hes that busy tinker walked over to the van and addressed the man there he was rather fiercelooking and had a long bushy beard enormous eyebrows that hung down over his eyes a rather small nose and only one ear he looked inquiringly down at tinker and put out his hand to mischief my monkey might bite you said tinker at once he doesnt like strangers im no stranger to any monkey said the man in a deepdown voice there isnt a monkey in the world nor a chimp either that wouldnt come to me if i called it nor a gorilla see well my monkey wont come to you said tinker angrily but what ive come to say is before he could finish his sentence the man made a curious noise in his throat rather like mischief did when he was pleased about anything mischief looked at the man in surprised delight and then leapt straight from tinkers shoulder to his nuzzling against his neck making little crooning noises tinker was so amazed that he stared without saying a word see said the man hes my little friend already dont gawp so little fellow ive trained the monkey family all my life you lend me this little chap and ill teach him to ride a small tricycle in two days come here mischief said tinker amazed and angry at the monkeys behaviour but mischief cuddled down still farther into the big mans neck the man hauled him out and handed him to tinker there you are he said nice little fellow he is what is it you wanted to say to me ive come to say that this field belongs to my father professor hayling said tinker and youve no right to bring your caravans here so please take them all out i and my friends are planning to camp out here well ive no objection to that said the big man goodtemperedly you choose your own corner young sir if you dont interfere with us we shant interfere with you a boy of about tinkers age came sidling up and looked at tinker and mischief with interest is he selling you that monkey grandad he asked no im not almost shouted tinker i came to tell you and your caravans to clear out this field belongs to my family ah but weve an old licence to come here every ten years and show our circus said the bearded man and believe it or not theres been a tappers circus in this field every ten years since the year so you just run home and make no silly fuss young man youre a fibber cried tinker losing his temper ill tell the police ill tell my father ill dont you talk to my old grandad like that shouted the boy standing beside the old man ill hit you if you do ill say what i like shouted tinker his temper now quite lost and just you shut up the very next moment tinker found himself flat on his back on the grass the boy had shot out his fist and hit tinker hard in the chest he struggled to his feet red in the face quite furious the old man fended him away dont you be silly now boy he said this youngster is a tapper like me and hell never give in you go home and be sensible we aint going to take notice of a hotheaded little kid like you our circus is coming in this here field just like it has for years and years he turned and walked to the nearest caravan it was drawn by horses and he clicked to them they strained forward and the caravan followed others behind began to move too the circus boy put his tongue out at tinker sucks to you he said nobody gets the better of my grandad or of me either still it was plucky of you to go for him i enjoyed it shut up said tinker alarmed to find himself very near to tears you just wait till my dad tells the police youll all go out much quicker than you came in and one of these days ill knock you down he turned and ran back to the gate he wondered what to do he had so often heard his father say that the field behind their house belonged to him and that he had let this or that farmer have the grazing rights for his horses or cattle how dare the travelling circus come into his fathers field ill tell dad he said to anne who was waiting at the gate he ought to turn them out its our field and i love it especially just now when its so green and beautiful and the hedges are just going to be covered in white may ill tell dad that boy knocked me down shot out his fist just like that and down i went id like to do the same to him he went into the house followed by a puzzled anne he looked into the sittingroom and saw george there tinker that boy knocked you down said anne in a horrified voice why did he do that oh just because i told his grandad to take his caravans away said tinker feeling rather grand he didnt hurt me at all just punched me on the chest still i said what i had gone to say but will they take the caravans away out of the field asked anne i told them id tell the police said tinker so i bet theyll skedaddle they havent any right to be there its our field are you going to the police asked george disbelievingly i really dont see why you have to make such a fuss about it all tinker they might make it difficult for us to go camping there but i tell you its my field dads always said so said tinker he said it wasnt any use to him so i could consider it my own and i do and were going to camp in it whatever anyone says its a travelling circus thats coming there so the old man said oh tinker how marvellous to have a circus at the bottom of the garden said george her eyes shining and anne nodded too tinker glared at them just like girls to say a thing like that he said would you want people trespassing all over a field that belonged to you with horses neighing and tigers and lions roaring and bears grunting and chimpanzees stealing things and nasty little circus boys being rude all the time ready to knock you down oh tinker you do make it sound so exciting said george will there really be lions and tigers suppose one escaped what a thrill well i shouldnt like that said anne at once i dont particularly want a lion peering in at my window or a bear clomping round my bedroom neither do i said tinker in a most decided voice thats why im going to tell dad about it hes got the old documents that set out our rights to that field he showed me them one day ill ask him about them and if hell let me see them ill take them straight to the police and let them turn out that rude old man and his horrible circus how do you know its horrible asked george it might be awfully good im sure theyd let us camp in the corner nearest the garden and wed get an awfully good view of whats going on all the time look theres your father strolling down the path smoking a pipe he never does that if hes busy it would be a good time to go and ask him about the document he might even show it to us all right said tinker rather sulkily but youll see im right come on however tinker proved to be quite quite wrong his father went to fetch the old yellowed piece of parchment at once ha here it is he said its pretty valuable too because its so old it dates back quite a few centuries he undid the rather dirty piece of ribbon round it and unrolled it neither the girls nor tinker could read the oldfashioned lettering what does it all say asked anne with great interest it says that the field known as cromwells corner is to be held by the hayling family for always said professor hayling it was given to them by cromwell because our family allowed them to camp in that field when they sorely needed a rest after battle its been ours ever since so nobody else is allowed to camp in it or use it for grazing or anything unless we say so said tinker triumphantly quite right said his father but wait a minute i seem to remember an odd clause that said something about a travelling show a show that had rights to camp in the field since about not even cromwell could alter that it was in the original deeds long before cromwell battled in that district now lets see that piece would come about the end i expect the two girls and tinker waited while the professor pored over the old and beautiful lettering he jabbed his finger on to three lines towards the end yes there it is ill quote it listen and let it be known that ye travelling show sonamed tappers travelling show which has always had camping rights shall still have the right to claim these once every ten years so long as the show travels the country ways given under my hand and so on and so on well i dont expect that tappers travelling show is going now all these years and years after the document was drawn up and signed in the year see heres the date if you can read the old figures the children stared at the date and then glanced up at tinker he looked angry and very red in the face you might have told me all that before dad he said why asked his father astonished what possible interest can it have for you children only that theres a circus called tappers travelling circus in that field this very minute said anne and the old man with it is called tapper and he said it was his right to be there and he was rude to me and i want you to turn out this circus this very day said tinker we want to camp there im sure mr tapper would have no objection to you camping there said his father arent you being rather silly tinker you werent rude to any of the circus folk were you tinker went very red turned his back and stalked out of the room mischief clinging to his neck he rubbed his chest where the circus boy had punched him just you wait he said in a whisper ill punch you one day anne if you and the others want to camp in the field ill go and speak to mr tapper said the professor puzzled by tinkers behaviour oh no its all right said anne hastily he has already said that it didnt matter if we camped there oh there are the boys back again ill just go and see if they have brought back all our bicycles safely thank you for showing us that marvellous old document professor and away she went looking rather hot and bothered chapter six getting ready for camping out dick and julian were most interested to hear about tinker and the travelling circus and the old old document you made a bit of a fool of yourself said julian looking at tinker still theres no harm done apparently i vote we go and see where we can put up our tents personally i shall be thrilled to see a bit of circus life so close to me i wonder how theyll manage to put on a show i suppose theyve everything with them and can put up a circus ring and a marquee and anything else necessary there are a lot of big vans said anne i went down to have a look about half an hour ago the field is almost full now except for one corner near our hedge that i suppose they have left for our tents i saw the posters about the circus as we cycled back said dick deadshot dick chimpanzee that plays cricket the boneless man madelon and her beautiful horses monty and winks the clowns the dancing donkey mr wooh the wonder wizard gosh it sounded quite a circus im glad we can camp in the same field we shall really see behind the scenes then dont forget there was charlie the chimp and the bonzo band said julian what fun if the chimp got loose and peeped in at the kitchen window it wouldnt be at all funny said anne jenny would run for miles so would tinkers monkey what about putting up our own tents after tea said dick the carrier said hed have them here by teatime its hotter than ever today i dont feel i can do much at the moment i just want to laze woof said timmy who was lying down with his head on his paws panting you feel the same old chap dont you said julian poking him with his toe youre tired out with your long run to kirrin and back again arent you the roads were so dusty said dick he kept sneezing whenever a car passed us because the dust got up his nose poor old tim you really are tired out with that long long run woof said tim suddenly sitting up straight and pawing vigorously at george everyone laughed he says hes not at all tired he wants a walk chuckled dick well if hes not tired i am said julian it really was a job sorting out all our things at kirrin and cycling there and back no timmy i am not going to take you for a walk timmy whined and at once mischief the monkey leapt down from tinkers shoulder and went to cuddle against the big dog making small comforting noises he even put his thin little arms round timmys neck youre just being a little bit soppy mischief said tinker but mischief didnt care his big friend was sad about something or he wouldnt have whined timmy put out a big red tongue and licked the little creature delicately on his nose then he suddenly pricked up his ears and sat straight up he had heard a noise from somewhere so had all the others its music of some kind said anne oh i believe i know what it is what said the others it must be tappers travelling circus band practising for opening night said anne well thats tomorrow yawned george yes it does sound like a band maybe we shall see the bandsmen after tea when we put up our tents id like to see the boneless man wouldnt you no said anne hed be all limp and wriggly and horrid like a worm or a jellyfish i shant go and see him but id love to see the horses and the dancing donkey does he dance to the band do you think well find out when we go said dick as it opens tomorrow if mr tapper isnt annoyed about tinker trying to turn them out he might let us wander round i dont think i want to come said tinker mr tapper was rude and that boy knocked me flat well i expect id do the same if i thought you were being rude to my grandad said julian lazily now its settled is it that we go down with our things to the field after tea and see if we can put up our tents in some sheltered corner yes said everyone dick idly tickled mischiefs nose with a thin blade of grass the monkey sneezed at once and then again he rubbed his little paw across his nose and stared disapprovingly at dick then he sneezed once more borrow a hanky old thing said julian and to everyones intense amusement mischief leapt across to dick and neatly pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket then he pretended to blow his nose everyone roared with laughter and mischief was delighted youll be stolen to act in a circus one day if you behave like that said dick snatching back his hanky the pickpocket monkey hed be very good in a circus said julian id never let him join a circus said tinker at once he might have a dreadful life no i dont think he would said julian circusfolk love their animals and are proud of them and after all if they treated them unkindly the animals wouldnt be happy or healthy and couldnt enjoy their acts most circus people treat their animals like one of the family what even a chimpanzee said anne in horror theyre nice creatures and very clever said julian mischief do not remove my handkerchief please it was funny the first time but not a second time look at him now trying to undo timmys collar come and sit quietly by me mischief ordered tinker and the little creature obediently went to him and cuddled on to his knee making a soft crooning noise youre a humbug said tinker fondling him you be careful i dont give you away to the circus and get an elephant in exchange idiot said dick and everyone laughed at the thought of tinker and an elephant what in the world would he do with it a voice called from the house tinker the carriers come with all the camping things hes put them in the hall just where your father will fall over them youd better come and see to them now in a few minutes jenny called back tinker were busy youre a real fibber tinker said dick we are not busy you could easily go to find out where the things are and see if theyre all there there are quite a lot well go in twenty minutes or so said anne yawning i bet tinkers father is asleep this hot afternoon he wont stir out of his study but she was wrong professor hayling was wide awake and when he had finished his work he wanted a drink of very cold water he threw open his study door strode out towards the kitchen and fell over a pile of all kinds of camping gear bringing them down with a tremendous noise jenny rushed out of the kitchen with loud screams of fright and the professor bellowed in anger as he took a groundsheet off his head and a tentpole off his back what are these things i will not have them in the hall jenny jenny take them down to the bonfire and burn the lot our camping things cried george listening in horror quick we must get them oh i do hope tinkers father hasnt hurt himself blow blow blow while julian and dick deftly removed everything that had fallen on to the angry professor and took them down the garden anne and george comforted him and made such a fuss of him that he began to feel decidedly less angry he sat down in a chair and wiped his forehead i hope youve taken all those things down to the bottom of the garden he asked after a while yes said tinker truthfully er theyre all by the bonfire but its not lighted yet ill light it myself tomorrow said his father and tinker heaved a sigh of relief his father would forget of course and anyhow everything was going to be taken into the camping field after tea have a cup of nice hot tea sir said jenny appearing with a tray of teathings sit you down and drink this its newly made best thing to have after a fall and a shock she turned and whispered crossly to tinker didnt i call to you and tell you the professor would trip over those things the poor man now you just get your own tea while i take him into the diningroom and comfort him with a nice hot scone and a cup of tea ill get our tea said anne then well set up the tents down in the field and enjoy ourselves and tinker dont you get into any more trouble with the circus folk ill see he doesnt said george firmly come on lets go down to the field while anne gets the tea i could do with a bun or two between them dick and julian had lugged all the things down the garden two tents groundsheets blankets tentpegs and all the rest timmy ran with them in excitement wondering what all the fuss was about mischief of course leapt to the top of whatever was being carried and chattered excitedly all the way down the garden he got into trouble when he ran off with a tentpeg but timmy managed to catch him and make him drop it then very solemnly timmy carried the tentpeg to julian good dog said julian just keep an eye on that wicked little monkey tim will you there are all sorts of things he might run off with so timmy kept an eye on mischief nosing him away whenever he thought the monkey was going to pick up something he shouldnt finally mischief became tired of timmys nose and leapt on his back where clinging to the dogs collar he rode just as if he were on horseback only its dogback not horseback said anne with a laugh they would make quite a good pair for the circus said dick i bet mischief could hold on to reins if timmy had any well hes not going to have any said george the next thing would be a whip whew what a lot of things weve got is that the lot it was thank goodness a bell rang out from the house at that moment and everyone heaved a sigh of relief tea at last said dick i could drink a whole potful come on weve finished piling up all the things well get busy after tea with them i cant do a thing more dont you agree timmy woof said timmy heartily and galloped up the garden path at top speed with mischief scampering after him talk about a circus said dick weve a readymade one here all right anne were coming were coming chapter seven in the circus field nobody wanted to spend a long time over tea they all longed to go down to the field and set up their little camp we shall have a wonderful lookin at what goes on in a circus camp said dick we shall be living so near the circus folk i do hope mischief wont get too friendly with the people there they might take him away with them when they leave indeed they wont said tinker fiercely what a thing to say as if mischief would go with them anyhow i dont expect hell mix with the circus crowd at all you wait and see grinned dick now buck up with your tea im longing to go and set our camp in the field and see whats going on there it wasnt long before they were ready they were soon down by the fence and gazed over it in amazement great vans were in the field all with mr tappers name on and all painted in gay colours there were caravans too much smaller than the great vans and these had windows each with neat lace curtains the circus folk lived in the caravans of course and george found herself wishing that she herself could go about in one instead of living in a house that couldnt move anywhere look at the horses cried dick as a bunch of them appeared with tossing heads and beautiful long thick tails the boy who had knocked tinker down was with them whistling they were all coming from a big horsevan and were delighted to be in a field with lush green grass is that field gate properly shut yelled an enormous voice and the boy yelled back yes grandad i shut it theres nowhere the horses can get out my word dont they like this grass then he saw julian and the others all looking over the fence and waved to them see our horses arent they a grand lot and just to show off a little he leapt on to the back of the nearest one and went all round the edge of the field with it george watched him enviously if only she could have a horse like that well lets take our camp things into the field said tinker the nearer we are to the circus the better we ought to have some fun he climbed over the fence and dick followed ill hand everything over said julian george can help me shes as good as a boy any day george grinned she loved to hear anyone say that it was quite a job getting some of the things over the fence the tents neatly wrapped though they were were heavy awkward things to handle but at last everything was safely over lying on the grass then julian anne and george climbed over the fence too and stood in the field looking round for a good corner to set up their things what about near those bushes over there said julian theres that big tree behind as well to protect us from the wind and we arent too near the circus folk they might not like us right on top of them and yet were near enough to see whats going on oh its going to be fun said anne her eyes shining i think id better go and find the old grandad mr tapper said julian just to tell him were here in case he thinks were intruders and have no right to be here you havent got to ask his permission for us to be in my field said tinker at once now dont keep flying off the handle like that tinker said julian this is merely a question of good manners something you dont seem to know much about how do we know that the circus folk wont resent us camping so near them much better to show ourselves friendly from the start all right all right said tinker sulkily but it is my field after all youll be telling me to be friends with that nasty little circusboy next well youd better be else he might knock you flat again said george anyway be sensible tinker its not often people have a circus just at the bottom of their garden and can pop over the fence and mix with the circus folk julian walked over to the nearest caravan it was empty and no one answered his knock what you want mister called a high little voice and a small girl with tangled untidy hair came running up wheres mr tapper asked julian smiling at the untidy brighteyed little thing hes with one of the horses said the small girl who are you were your neighbours said julian will you take us to mr tapper old grandads this way said the child and slipped a dirty little hand into julians ill show you i like you mister she led the children to the middle of the camp a mournful howl came from somewhere behind them and george stopped suddenly thats timmy he must have found out that weve got out of the garden ill go back for him better not said julian there might be ructions if he met the chimpanzee a big chimp would make mincemeat of him it wouldnt said george but all the same she didnt go back to fetch timmy julian hoped that the dog wouldnt jump over the fence and come to find them theres old granddad tapper on them steps said the little girl smiling up at julian whose hand she still held i like you mister your hand smells nice well thats because i wash it with soap and water four or five times a day said julian yours would smell nice too if you did the same the little girl sniffed at julians hand then she shouted loudly to the old fellow sitting on the steps of a nearby caravan grandad heres folks to see you grandad was looking at a beautiful chestnutbrown horse tethered close to him he had one of the horses hooves in his hand the children stood and gazed at him black beard frowning eyebrows and oh dear thought anne only one ear poor man what could have happened to the missing one grandad called the girl again folks to see you mr tapper looked round his eyes very bright under his black eyebrows he set the horses hoof down and gave the lovely creature a pat you dont need to limp any more my beauty he said ive taken out the stone that was in your hoof you can dance again the horse lifted up its magnificent head and neighed as if it were saying thank you tinker almost jumped out of his skin and mischief slipped from his shoulder and cuddled under his arm in terror now now little monkey dont you know a horses voice when you hear one said grandad and mischief poked his head out from under tinkers arm to listen does that horse really dance said anne longing to stroke its long smooth nose dance its one of the finest horsedancers in the world said grandad and began to whistle a gay little tune the horse pricked up its ears gazed at grandad and then began to dance the children watched in astonishment there it went round and round nodding its head to the tune its feet tapping the grass in perfect time to grandads whistling oh the lovely thing said george do all your horses dance as well as this one yes some a good deal better said grandad this one has a fair ear for music but not as good an ear as some you wait till you see them dressed up with feathery plumes nodding on their heads horses theres nothing in the world as beautiful as a good horse mr tapper we come from the house over the fence there said julian feeling that it was time to explain their visit as you probably know tinkers father owns this field and yes yes but we have an old right to come every so often said the old man raising his voice now dont you start arg i havent come to argue with you said julian politely ive only just come to say that we that is my friends here and i would like to come and camp in this field but we shouldnt annoy you in any way and oh well if thats what you want youre more than welcome said the old man more than welcome i thought maybe youd think you could turn us out like that youngster there would like to do and he nodded at tinker tinker went red and said nothing the old man laughed ha my grandson didnt think much of that idea did he youngster he hit out and down you went on your back hes got a temper he has young jeremy but another time maybe hell find himself on his back eh yes he will said tinker at once right well youll be even with one another then and you can shake hands like gentlemen said the old man his eyes twinkling now what about you bringing your gear right into the field and setting up your tents ill get old charlie the chimp to help you hes as strong as ten men the chimpanzee is he tame enough to help us to put up our tents said anne disbelievingly old charlie is cleverer than all of you put together and as tame as you are said grandad and he could beat you three boys at cricket any day you bring your bat along one morning and watch him ill call him to help you charlie charlie where are you snoozing i suppose but no charlie came you go and fetch him said the old man pointing to a corner of the field where stood a big strong cage with a tarpaulin roof to keep out the rain hell do anything you want him to do so long as you give him a word of praise now and again lets get him ju said dick eagerly my word fancy having a chimpanzee to help us and off they all went to the great cage charlie charlie wake up youre wanted charlie chapter eight charlie the chimp is a help tinker came to the big cage first he peered inside charlie the chimp was there all right sitting at the back of his cage his brown eyes looking at the children with curiosity he got up and went over to where tinker was peering in and pressed his nose against the strong wire almost against tinkers then he blew hard and tinker backed away surprised and cross he blew at me he said to the others who were laughing at tinkers disgust the chimp made a funny noise that mischief the monkey immediately tried to imitate the chimpanzee stared at mischief then he grew very excited he rattled his cage jumped up and down and made some very queer noises indeed a boy came running up at once it was the boy who had knocked tinker down hey what are you doing to the chimp he called oh arent you the boy who shouted at my grandad the one i knocked down yes and dont you dare try that on again or youll be sorry said tinker in a fierce voice shut up tinker said julian he turned to the boy your names jeremy isnt it he said well weve just been talking to your grandad over there and he said we could get the chimpanzee to help us with our camping gear its all right for him to come out of his cage isnt it oh yes i take him out two or three times a day said jeremy he gets bored in his cage hed love to help put up your tents hes always helping us circus folk with things like that hes as strong as a lion is he er is he safe asked dick eyeing the big animal doubtfully safe what do you mean safe asked jeremy surprised hes as safe as i am charlie come on out go on you can undo your cage perfectly well you know you can the chimpanzee made a funny little chuckling noise put his hand through the wire reached the bolt pulled it took his hand back and pushed open the cage door see easy isnt it said jeremy grinning charlie boy come along your helps wanted charlie lumbered out of his cage and went with the children to where they had left their tents and groundsheets and the rest he walked with his fists on the ground in a most inelegant manner making a funny little groaning noise all the time mischief was rather afraid of him and kept well to the back but the chimpanzee suddenly turned round caught hold of mischief and sat him up on his shoulder mischief held on not knowing whether to be scared or jubilant i wish i had my camera here said anne to george just look at them mischief is as pleased as can be they arrived at the pile of camping gear carry this charlie and follow us ordered jeremy the chimp grabbed at this that and the other and with his great arms full followed the children to where they thought they could camp with the great hedge to shelter them from the wind drop those things charlie said jeremy and go back for the rest buck up dont stand there staring youve got work to do but charlie still crouched there staring straight at mischief oh he wants mischief the monkey to go with him cried george go on mischief have a ride again mischief leapt up on to the chimpanzees shoulders charlie put up a great paw to steady him and then lumbered off to fetch the rest of the things one of the groundsheets came undone and slithered over his head like a tent so that he couldnt see where he was going in a rage he leapt on it and began to jump up and down up and down growling most terrifyingly the children felt rather scared charlie dont be an ass said jeremy and pulled it away from him rolling it up swiftly the chimpanzee could manage it then and his good temper immediately came back again everything was soon piled up in one place and julian and dick began to put up the tents charlie watched them with the greatest interest and helped most intelligently when he saw that he could hes a good sort isnt he said jeremy proud that his friend the chimpanzee could show off like this did you see him put that tentpole in exactly the right place and you ought to see him fetch the pails of water for the horses each day he carries a full pail in each hand he ought to get wages said tinker he does said jeremy he gets eight bananas a day and as many oranges as he likes and he loves sweets oh i think ive got some said tinker and delved into one of his pockets he brought up a peculiar mixture of things among which was a screwedup sweet bag inside was a mess of halfmelted boiled sweets you cant give him those said anne theyre old and sticky and messy but charlie thought differently he took the paper bag straight out of tinkers hand sniffed it and then put the whole thing into his mouth at once hell choke said julian not charlie said jeremy let him be hell go straight back to his cage get in shoot the bolt and sit there sucking sweets till theyre gone hell be as happy as can be well he certainly deserved a reward said george he did all the heavy work come on lets finish putting everything straight i say wont it be fun sleeping out in tents tonight wed better have supper first you can come and join us if you like said jeremy we dont have posh food like you of course but its good food all the same old grandma cooks it in her pot shes two hundred years old the children laughed in disbelief two hundred nobody lives as long as that said george well thats what she tells everyone said jeremy and she looks it too but her eyes are as sharp as needles still shall i tell her youll be here to supper well would there be enough for so many extra said julian we meant to bring our own meal should

tonight and fred the fiddlers playing his fiddle ah that fiddle its tunes get into your feet and away you go this all sounded very exciting julian thought they ought to go back home before anyone began to be worried about their complete disappearance and pack up the food for supper that night well be back as soon as we can said he and thanks awfully for all your help come on mischief say goodbye to charlie for the moment and dont look so gloomy were coming back here tonight they all went back over the fence feeling a little tired now but full of their plans for the evening its almost like belonging to the circus going back to sit round a campfire and eat supper from that old black stewpot on the fire said tinker i bet the supper will taste delicious i say i hope dad wont mind us popping off to the circus camp i dont expect hell even notice that weve gone said george my father never notices things like that sometimes he doesnt even notice when people are there in front of his nose well that must be useful at times if theyre people he doesnt like said tinker now lets see what jennys got that we can take back with us jenny listened wideeyed to all they had to say well well well she said camping out with the circusfolk whatever next id like to know what your parents would think of that master julian well ask them next time we see them said julian with a grin what do you have for our supper were taking it down to our camp i thought maybe youd do that said jenny its all cold a meat pie cold sausages a cucumber and lettuce hearts and tomatoes rolls and apples and bananas will that be enough gosh yes said tinker thrilled what about something to drink you can take lemonade or orangeade with you whichever you please said jenny but listen now dont go bursting into your fathers workroom hes worked hard all day and hes tired and cross i expect said tinker people are always cross when theyre tired except you dear dear jenny ha you want something else out of my cupboard calling me your dear dear jenny she said with a twinkle could we have some sugarlumps asked tinker oh jenny there are the loveliest horses you ever saw down in the circus field i want to give them a sugar lump each and yourself a few as well said jenny all right ill pack up everything for you and give you a few enamel plates and mugs and knives what about timmy doesnt he want a meal too wuff said timmy glad that someone had remembered him jenny patted his big head its all ready in the larder for you she said george you go and get it he must be hungry george fetched a plate of meat and biscuits from the larder and timmy fell on it with happy little barks yes he was very very hungry at last all the food was readypacked to take down the garden to the field what a lot there seemed well they would certainly have plenty to spare for their circus friends they said good night to jenny and set off down the garden again they thought they had better not disturb professor hayling he might be cross and forbid us to go and feed with the circusfolk said tinker mischief come off that basket and dont pretend you werent fishing in it for a banana and please put on your best tablemanners tonight or charlie the chimp will be ashamed of you it was fun going back down the garden and over the fence into the field again the sun was sinking fast and soon the shadows would fall how lovely to sit round a fire and eat supper with the kindly circusfolk and perhaps to sing old songs with them and hear fred the fiddler fiddle his old old tunes what fun to creep into a tent and sleep with the cries of owls around and stars shining in at the tent opening there they go over the fence handing the food one to another take your paw out of that basket mischief thats right timmy nibble his ear if hes as mischievous as his name youre all going to have some fun tonight chapter nine a wonderful evening as soon as jeremy saw the visitors climbing over the fence he ran to help them he was very excited at the thought of having guests he took them over to old grandad first to be welcomed now i expect your friends will like to see round a bit said grandad charlie the chimp can go with you weve a rehearsal on tonight so the ring has been set up you can watch some of the show this was grand news the children saw that curved pieces of painted wood had been set together to make a great ring in the field and as they went across the grass the musical horses began to troop into the ring the leading one ridden by madelon a lovely girl dressed in shimmering gold how beautiful they are thought anne as she watched look at their great feathery plumes nodding on their magnificent heads the bonzo band struck up just then and the horses at once trotted in perfect time to the music the band looked a little peculiar as the bandsmen had not put on their smart uniforms they were saving those for the opening night the horses trotted prettily out of the ring after two or three rounds the beautiful madelon on the leading horse then in came fred the fiddler and played his violin for a few minutes first the music was slow and solemn then fred began to play quickly and the children found themselves jiggling about up and down and round about i cant keep still panted anne the tunes got into my feet charlie the chimp came up just then walking on hind legs and looking unexpectedly tall he usually walked on all fours he began to jig about too looking very funny he ran right into the ring and put his arms round fred the fiddlers legs he loves fred said jeremy now hes going to rehearse his cricket act i must go and bowl to him and off went jeremy into the ring the chimpanzee rushed over to him and hugged him a bat was thrown into the ring and charlie picked it up and made a few swipes into the air with it making delighted noises all the time then a cricket ball was thrown to jeremy who caught it deftly a small girl appeared from somewhere and set up three stumps for a wicket cant find the bails jeremy she called have you got them in your pocket no said jeremy never mind ill knock the stumps right over but that wasnt so easy with charlie the chimp at the wicket he took a terrific swipe at the ball and it went right over jeremys head too high to catch the chimp lost his balance and sat down on the wicket knocking the stumps out of the ground out yelled jeremy but the chimp wasnt having that he carefully put up the stumps again and then set himself in front once more waggling the bat it was the funniest cricket that the children had ever seen the chimpanzee was very very clever with the bat and sent poor jeremy running all over the place then finally he chased the boy all round the ring with the bat making curious chortling noises the children didnt know if he was amused or angry finally he threw the bat at jeremy and walked off scratching himself under one arm the children roared with laughter at him hes as good as any clown said dick jeremy does he do this cricket act every night when the circus is open oh yes and sometimes he hits the ball into the audience said jeremy theres great excitement then sometimes for a treat we let one of the boys in the audience come down and bowl to charlie one bowled him right out once and charlie was so cross that he chased him all round the ring three times just as he chased me just now the boy didnt like it much charlie came up to jeremy and put his great arms round him trying to swing him off the ground stop that charlie said jeremy wriggling free look out here comes the dancing donkey better get out of the ring goodness knows what antics hell be up to in came the dancing donkey he was dark grey and tossed his head as he came galloping in he stood and looked round at everyone then he sat down lifted up a leg and scratched his nose the children stared in astonishment they had never in their lives seen a donkey do that before then when the band suddenly began to play the donkey stood up and listened flapping his ears first one way and then another and nodding his head in time to the music the band changed its tune to a march the donkey listened again and then began to march round the ring in perfect time clipclopclipclopclipclop then it apparently felt tired and sat down heavily on its back legs the children couldnt help laughing the donkey got up and somehow its back legs became entangled with its front ones and it fell down looking most ridiculous has it hurt itself asked anne anxiously oh dear it will break one of its legs if it goes on like this look it cant untangle them jeremy the donkey gave a mournful bray tried to get up and flopped down again the band changed its tune and the donkey leapt up at once and began to do a kind of tapdance clicketyclick clicketyclick clicketyclick it was marvellous i shouldnt have thought that a donkey could possibly have been taught to tapdance said george soon the donkey seemed to feel tired again it stopped dancing but the band still went on playing the donkey ran towards it and stamped its foot a weird voice suddenly came from it too fast too fast but the band took no notice and went on playing the donkey bent down wriggled hard and its head fell off on to the grass in the ring anne gave a shriek of fright dont be an ass anne said dick you didnt think the donkey was a real one did you isnt it said anne relieved it looks just like that donkey that used to give rides to children on kirrin beach the donkey now split in half and a small man climbed out of each half taking their legs carefully out of the donkeys legs the donkeyskin fell to the ground and lay there flat and collapsed wish i had a donkeyskin like that said tinker ive got a friend at school who could be the back legs and id be the front legs the things wed do well i must say youd make a firstclass donkey the way you behave sometimes said george look this must be deadshot dick coming on but before deadshot dick could do any of his shooting tricks the two donkeymen had run to the band and begun a loud argument with them why play so fast you know we cant do our tricks at top speed are you trying to mess up our turn the band leader shouted something back it must have been rude because one of the donkeymen shook his fist and began to run towards the band a loud voice crashed in on the argument and made everyone jump it was mr tapper old grandad giving his orders in an enormous voice enough you pat and you jim get out of the ring i give the orders not you enough i say the two donkeymen glared at him but did not dare to say a word more they stalked out of the ring taking the donkeyskin with them deadshot dick looked very ordinary dressed in a rather untidy flannel suit hes not going to go all through his act said jeremy youll see him another night when the shows on for the public he shoots at all kinds of things even a sixpenny bit dangling on a long string from the roof and never misses hes got a smashing rigout too sequins sewn all over his trousers and jersey and his little horse is a wonder goes round and round the ring and never turns a hair when deadshot dick fires his gun look there he is peeping in to see if dicks coming back to him a small white horse was looking anxiously at the ring its eyes fixed on deadshot dick it pawed the ground as if to say buck up im waiting for you am i to come on or not all right dick you can go off now shouted grandad i hear your horse has hurt a foot give him a good rest tonight well want him on tomorrow right sir said deadshot dick he saluted smartly and ran off to his little horse whats next jeremy asked george who was enjoying everything very much dont know lets see theres the acrobats but the trapezeswings arent put up yet so they wont come on tonight and theres the boneless man look there he is good old boney i like him hes free with his money he is not like some of the other folk the boneless man looked very peculiar he was remarkably thin and remarkably tall he walked in looking quite extraordinary he cant be boneless said dick he couldnt walk if he was but the boneless man soon began to seem absolutely boneless his legs gave way at the knees and his ankles turned over so that he sank down to the ground unable to walk he could bend his arms all kinds of different ways and turned his head almost completely round on his neck he did a few peculiar things with his apparently boneless body and finally wriggled along the ground exactly like a snake hell be dressed in a sort of snakeskin when he does his act properly said jeremy queer isnt he how on earth does he do it wondered julian amazed he bends his arms and legs all the wrong ways mine would break if i did that oh its easy for him said jeremy its just that hes completely doublejointed he can bend his arms both ways and his legs both ways and make them seem so loose that it looks as if he really is boneless hes a nice chap youd like him anne felt a bit doubtful what queer people made up a circus it was a world of its own she jumped suddenly as there came the sound of a trumpet blowing loudly thats for supper said jeremy gleefully come on lets go to old grandma and her pot buck up all of you chapter ten round the campfire jeremy led the way out of the circusring it had been welllighted and the night seemed very dark outside the ring they went over the field to where a large fire was burning cleverly set about with stones an enormous cookingpot was hung over it and a very very nice smell came to their noses as they went near old grandma was there of course and she began stirring the pot when she saw them youve been a long time in the ring she grumbled to grandad anything gone wrong no said grandad and sniffed the air im hungry that smells good jeremy help your grandma yes grandad said jeremy and took a pile of plates to the old lady who at once began ladling out pieces of meat and potatoes and vegetables from the steaming pot old grandad turned to julian well did you like our little rehearsal he asked oh yes said julian im only sorry you didnt rehearse all the turns i badly wanted to see the acrobats and the clowns are they here i cant see them oh yes theres one clown over there look with madelon who had the horses said grandad the children looked and were very disappointed is he a clown said dick disbelievingly he doesnt look a bit funny he looks miserable thats monty all right said grandad he always looks like that out of the ring hell make you double up with laughter when the circus is on hes a born clown but a lot of clowns are like monty when theyre not performing not much to say for themselves and looking miserable winks is a bit livelier thats him pulling madelons hair hell get a smacked face in a minute hes a real tease there i knew hed get a clip on the ear winks went howling over to the children boohooing most realistically she smacked me he said and shes got such ppppretty hair the children couldnt help laughing mischief ran to the clown jumped up on his shoulder and chattered comforting monkeywords into his ear charlie the chimp let himself out of his cage and came to put his great paw into winkss hand they both thought that winks really was hurt thats enough winks said grandad youll have the horses comforting you next you do that in the ring tomorrow when we open and youll bring the house down sit down and have your supper mr tapper said julian theres one member of your circus we didnt see at the rehearsal and thats mr wooh the wonder magician why wasnt he there oh he never rehearses said mr tapper he keeps himself to himself does mr wooh he may come and join us for supper and he may not as were opening the circus tomorrow night maybe hell turn up tonight im a bit scared of him to tell you the truth but hes not a real wizard is he asked tinker well when i talk to mr wooh i feel as if he is said mr tapper there isnt a thing he doesnt know about figures there isnt a thing he cant do with them ask him to multiply any number by any other number running into dozens of figures and hell tell you in a second he shouldnt be in a circus he should be an inventor of some sort an inventor whose invention needs pages and pages of figures hed be happy then he sounds a bit like my father said tinker hes an inventor you know and sometimes when i creep into his study i see papers full of millions of tiny figures and plans and diagrams with tiny figures all over them too very interesting said grandad your father and mr wooh ought to meet they would probably talk figures all day long my word whats that youre handing round young lady some of the food we brought said anne have a sausage or two mr tapper and a roll and a tomato well thanks said mr tapper pleased very kind of you nice to have met you all you might be able to teach jeremy a few manners grandad heres mr wooh said jeremy suddenly and got up everyone turned round so this was mr wooh the wonder magician well he certainly looked the part he stood there with a halfsmile on his face tall commanding and handsome his hair was thick and black as soot his eyes gleamed in the firelight half hidden by great eyebrows and he wore a thin pointed beard he had a curiously deep voice and spoke like a foreigner so we have visitors this night he said and showed a row of gleaming white teeth in a quick smile may i join you oh do mr wooh said anne delighted to have the chance of talking to a wonder magician weve brought plenty of food do you like cold sausage and tomato and a roll most deelicious said the magician and sat down crosslegged to join the group we were disappointed not to see you at the rehearsal said dick id have liked to hear you doing all kinds of wizard sums in your head as quick as lightning my father can do that too said tinker proudly hes a wizard at figures as well hes an inventor ha an inventor and what does he invent asked mr wooh eating his roll that was enough to set tinker describing at once how wonderful his father was he can invent anything hes asked for said the boy proudly he invented a wonderful thing for keeping aeroplanes dead straight in the right direction better than any idea before he invented the skowheel if you know what that is and the electric trosymon if youve ever heard of that i dont suppose you have though theyre too wait boy said mr wooh sounding most interested these things i have heard of yes i do not know them but i have certainly heard of them your father must be a very very clever man with a most unusual brain tinker swelled with pride something got into the papers about his inventions a little while ago he said and reporters came down to see dad and his name was in the papers but dad was awfully cross about it you see hes in the middle of the biggest idea hes ever thought of and it messed up his work to have people coming to interview him some of them even peered through the window and went to see his wonderful tower with its tower he has a tower said mr wooh full of surprise before tinker could answer he received a hard poke from julians finger he turned crossly to see julian frowning fiercely at him so was george he went suddenly red in the face of course he had been told never to talk about his fathers work it was secret work very secret he pretended to choke over a piece of meat hoping that julian would take the chance of changing the subject and julian did of course mr wooh could you do a bit of magic reckoning with figures he asked ive heard that you can give the answers to any sum as quick as lightning that is true said mr wooh there is nothing that i cannot do with figures ask me anything you like and i will give you the answer at once well mr wooh answer this then cried tinker multiply sixtythree thousand three hundred and fortytwo by eighty thousand nine hundred and fiftythree ha you cant do that in a hurry the answer is in figures said mr wooh at once with a slight bow that is an easy question my boy crumbs said tinker astounded he turned to julian is that right ju julian worked out the sum on paper yes absolutely correct whew he said you said that as quick as lightning let me give him a sum to do cried george what do you get if you multiply by mr magician i get the figures said mr wooh immediately and once more julian worked out the sum on paper he raised his head and grinned yes correct how do you do it so quickly magic just a little elementary magic answered mr wooh try it sometime yourself i am sure that this boys father would be as quick as i am he looked at tinker i should much like to meet your clever father my boy he said in his deep foreignsounding voice we would have much so much to talk about i have heard about his wonderful tower a monument to his genius ah you see even we foreigners know of your fathers great work surely he is afraid of having his secrets stolen oh i dont think so said tinker the tower is a pretty good hidingplace and he stopped suddenly and went red again as he received an even harder kick from julian how could he be such an ass as to give away the fact that his fathers secret plans and models were hidden in the tower julian thought it was time to take tinker firmly away from mr wooh and give him a good lecture on keeping his mouth shut he looked at his watch and pretended to be horrified at the time good graciousdo you know what the time is jenny will be ringing up the police if we dont get back straight away come on tinker and you others we must go thanks most awfully grandad for letting us share your supper but we havent yet finished said grandad you havent had enough to eat we really couldnt eat any more said dick following julians determined lead see you tomorrow grandad good night grandma thanks very much indeed weve still got bananas and apples to eat said tinker feeling obstinate oh we brought those for charlie the chimp said dick not quite truthfully he could have boxed tinkers ears silly little fathead couldnt he realize that julian wanted to get him away from this cunning mr wooh wait till he got tinker by himself tinker found himself hustled on all sides and felt a bit scared julian sounded rather fierce he thought old grandad was most astonished at the sudden departure of his guests but charlie the chimp didnt mind the guests had left behind a most generous supply of fruit over the fence they all went with julian hustling tinker in front of him once over the fence and out of mr woohs hearing julian and george rounded on the boy angrily are you mad tinker demanded julian didnt you guess that that foreign fellow was trying to pump you about your fathers hushhush job he wasnt said tinker almost in tears youre just exaggerating well i hope i never try to give away my fathers secret work said george in a tone of such disgust that tinker could have howled i wasnt trying to he said mr woohs all right why should you think he isnt i dont like him and i dont trust him said julian sounding suddenly very grown up but there you sat lapping up everything he said ready to pour out all he wanted to know im ashamed of you youd get a jolly good thrashing if your father had heard you i only hope you havent already said too much you know how angry your father was when a report of his latest ideas got into the papers and swarms of people came prying round the house tinker could stand it no longer he gave a forlorn howl that made mischief jump and fled up the garden to the house the little monkey running swiftly behind him he wanted to comfort tinker what was the matter poor little mischief felt bewildered and tried his best to catch up the sobbing tinker he caught him up at last leapt to the boys shoulder and put his little furry arms round tinkers neck making a queer comforting noise oh mischief said tinker im glad youre still my friend the others wont be now i know arent i an idiot mischief but i was only being proud of my father i was really mischief clung to tinker puzzled and upset tinker stopped outside the tall tower there was a light at the top his father must still be working there a faint humming noise came to his ears he wondered if it was those queer spindly tentacles right at the very top of the tower that made the noise suddenly the light at the top of the tower went out dad must have finished his work for tonight thought tinker hell be coming to the house id better go he might wonder why im all upset gosh i never heard julian be so angry before he sounded as if he absolutely despised me he crept up the path that led to the house and in at the garden door better not go and see jenny she might worm everything out of him and be as disgusted with him as julian was she would wonder why he wasnt camping out with them hed go upstairs and sleep in his own bed tonight come on mischief he said in a mournful voice well go to bed and you can cuddle down with me youd never be mean to me would you youd always be my friend mischief jabbered away and the funny little monkey voice comforted tinker all the time he undressed he flung himself into bed and mischief lay at the bottom on his feet i shall never be able to get to sleep tonight said tinker still miserable never but he fell asleep at once which was a great pity really he might have shared in quite a bit of excitement if he hadnt slept so soundly poor tinker chapter eleven in the dark of the night julian and the others made no attempt to follow tinker let him go the little ass said julian come into one of the tents and have a low powwow before we get undressed and go to sleep im sorry poor old tinker isnt going to camp out with us our first night in the field said anne i dont think he meant to give anything away thats no excuse anne said george he can be an awful little fathead at times and hes got to learn not to be lets go to our tent i feel quite tired come along timmy she yawned and dick yawned too then julian found himself yawning awfully catching this yawning business he said well its turned out to be a lovely night as regards weather warm and dry and theres a nice little halfmoon to look at good night girls sleep tight and dont scream if a spider wakes you because i warn you i am not going to get up to deal with a harmless spider you wait till one runs all over your face said anne and starts making a web from your nose to your chin and catches flies in it dont anne said george im not a bit scared of spiders but thats a horrible idea of yours timmy please watch out for spiders and give me warning of them everyone laughed well good night girls said dick pity about young tinker still hes got to learn a few things and keeping his mouth shut is one of them they were all quite tired and it wasnt long before everyones torch was out and peace and quiet descended on the little camp much farther up the field the circus was also peaceful and quiet though there were still lights here and there in the tents someone belonging to the circus band was strumming a banjo but not loudly and the sound was pleasant to hear strumastrum strumastrum strummmm a few clouds blew up and slid across the moon one by one the lights went out in the circus tents the wind blew softly through the trees and an owl hooted anne was still awake she lay listening to the wind and to the owls toowhootoowhit and then she too fell asleep nobody heard someone stirring in the circus camp nobody saw a shadowy figure creep out when the moon was safely behind a cloud it was late very late and the two camps were lost in dreams timmy was fast asleep too but in his sleep he heard a faint sound and at once he was awake he didnt move except for his ears which switched themselves up to listen he gave a little growl but not enough to wake george so long as the person who was moving about in the circus camp did not come near to georges tent or the boys tent timmy did not mean to bark he heard a tiny grunt and recognized it at once charlie the chimp well that was all right timmy fell asleep again tinker too was fast asleep in his bed up at the house mischief at his feet he had thought he would be too miserable to sleep but found himself halfdreaming in no time he didnt hear a small noise outside a very small noise indeed a little scrape as if someones foot had caught against a stone then there came other very small noises and a whisper of a voice and more noises again nobody heard anything at all until jenny woke up thirsty and stretched out her hand to get a glass of water from her bedtable she didnt switch her light on and was about to lie down again when her quick ears caught a little sound she sat up that cant be the children she thought theyre camping down in the field oh my goodness me i hope its not a burglar or someone trying to steal the professors secrets hes got papers all over the place thank goodness he keeps most of them in that tower of his she listened and then lay down again but soon she heard another little noise and sat up scared it sounds as if it comes from the tower she thought and got out of bed no there was no light in the tower no light anywhere that she could see the moon was behind a cloud shed just wait till it slid out and lighted up the courtyard below and the tower there that was another little noise could it be the wind no it couldnt and now what was that it sounded just like someone whispering down there in the courtyard jenny felt really frightened and began to shake she must go and wake the professor suppose it was someone after his precious papers or his wonderful new invention the moon swung out from behind the cloud and jenny peered cautiously out of the window again she gave a loud scream and staggered back into her room still screaming theres a man help help hes climbing up the wall of the tower professor professor hayling come quickly thieves robbers help help get the police there came a long slithering sound and before jenny dared to look out again the moon had gone behind another cloud and she could not see a thing in the sudden darkness there was a deep silence after the slithering noise and jenny couldnt bear it she rushed out of her bedroom yelling at the top of her voice thieves robbers sir come quickly the professor woke with a jump threw off his bedclothes and rushed out into the passage almost colliding with jenny he clutched at her thinking she was the thief and she screamed again sure that one of the intruders had got hold of her they struggled together and then the professor realized that he wasnt holding a thief he was holding poor plump jenny jenny what on earth are you doing waking up the whole household said the professor switching on the passage light have you had a bad dream a nightmare no sir no sir panted jenny out of breath with her struggle sir theres robbers about i saw one climbing up the tower wall and there must have been others below i heard them whispering sir oh im that scared what shall we do can you telephone for the police sir well said the professor doubtfully are you quite sure jenny that you didnt have a nightmare i mean if there really are robbers ill certainly telephone but its rather a long way for the police to come out here and oh sir then wont you just take a torch and look round the place begged jenny you know theres your precious papers in that tower sir and isnt there that new invention of yours oh yes i know im not supposed to know anything about it sir but i do dust your rooms thoroughly you know and i see quite a lot though i keep my mouth shut and yes yes jenny i know said poor professor hayling trying to stop jennys stream of talk but honestly everything seems quiet now ive looked out into the courtyard theres no one there and you know as well as i do that nobody can get into my tower it has three different keys one to unlock the bottom door one for the middle door halfway up and one for the top door jenny be sensible nobody could have used my three keys look there they are on my dressingtable jenny began to calm down but she still wasnt satisfied i did hear whispering and i did see someone halfway up the wall of the tower sir please do come down with me sir and lets look around i darent go on my own but i shant sleep again tonight till i know nobodys forced the tower door or taken a ladder to go up the tower all right jenny said the professor with a sigh put on your dressinggown and ill put mine on too well try the doors and well look for a ladder though mind you it would have to be an absolutely colossal one to reach the top of that tower nobody could possibly bring one that size and length into our small courtyard all right all right well go and so a few minutes later jenny and the professor were down in the courtyard there was no sign of any ladder at all no sign of anyone climbing up the walland the downstairs tower door was safely locked you unlock the door sir and go up to the top room and see if that doors locked too begged jenny i think youre being rather silly now jenny said the professor impatiently here take the keys yourself this ones locked of course and if the middle door is still locked youll know nobody could have got into my top room hurry jenny so jenny still trembling slid a key into the bottom lock opened the door and began to climb the spiral stair that led upwards halfway was another door also safely locked she unlocked this too she began to feel rather silly nobody could have gone through locked doors and there now the top one was well and truly locked also she gave a sigh of relief and ran down the spiral stairway locking the middle door and then the bottom one she gave the keys to the professor who by now was feeling rather chilly all locked sir said jenny but im still sure someone was about i could have sworn i saw someone up that towerwall and heard somebody else whispering below i expect you were so scared that you imagined things jenny said the professor yawning i think youll agree with me that the wall is far too steep for anyone to climb and im pretty certain id have heard it if a ladder had been dragged about the courtyard well im sure im very sorry sir said poor jenny its a good thing we didnt wake tinker though im surprised mischief didnt hear something and come running down the stairs but mischief is surely with tinker camping out in the field said the professor in surprise no tinker and mischief are back sir i found them asleep in bed but not the others said jenny maybe tinker has quarrelled with them funny that mischief didnt come running out to see what was up he must have heard us mischief is clever but not clever enough to open tinkers bedroom door said the professor yawning again good night jenny dont worry youll feel all right in the morning and that will be that the professor went sleepily to his room he looked out of the window down into the courtyard and then across at the tower and smiled dear jenny she did rather let her imagination run away with her as if anyone in the world could get up into that tower room without a ladder and now could a long long ladder be brought into that small courtyard without either being seen or heard the professor yawned once more and climbed into bed but someone had been in the tower room someone very clever someone very lightfingered what a shock for poor professor hayling next morning when he crossed the courtyard unlocked the bottom door of the tower walked up the spiral stairway unlocked the middle door and went on up the stairway again and finally unlocked the top door and opened it wide he stood and stared in horror the place was upside down all his papers were scattered everywhere he crouched down at once to see if any were missing yes quite a lot but they seemed to have been taken quite haphazardly a few pages from this note book a few pages from that some letters he had written and left on his desk to post and good gracious the ink was spilt all over the place and the little clock was gone from the mantelpiece so jenny was right a thief had been about last night a thief that could apparently get through three locked doors or else could climb up a long long ladder that he had put outside without being seen and taken away again ill have to ring the police he thought but i must say its a mystery i wonder if tinker heard anything in the night no he couldnt have or he would have run to fetch me its a mystery a real puzzle of a mystery chapter twelve a shock for tinker tinker was horrified when jenny told him the next morning what had happened your fathers in a rare old state she said he came down early this morning because he wanted to finish some work up in the tower and as soon as he unlocked the top door into the tower room he saw the whole room upside down and some of his precious papers gone and jenny how awful said tinker dad kept his most precious papers there with all the figures for that new electric thing of his its a wonderful thing too marvellous for words jenny its for now dont you give away any of your fathers plans not even to me said jenny youve been told that before maybe youve been talking too much already and somebodys ears took it all in tinker suddenly felt quite sick was it because of something he had been silly enough to say in public in the bus perhaps or in the circusfield what would the others say especially julian when they heard that someone had come in the night and stolen precious papers containing figures and diagrams for some of his fathers inventions julian would be sure to say that it was his fault for not keeping his mouth shut oh dear would this be in the papers and would hordes of people come visiting the place again staring and whispering and exclaiming in awe at his fathers curious tower with its waving tentacles he dressed quickly and ran downstairs jenny had told him that she was sure she had heard whispering down in the courtyard the night before and had seen someone climbing up the tower your father says nobody could have brought a long ladder into that courtyard she said not without us seeing it anyway or hearing some kind of noise when it was dragged in but it might have been a sliding ladder mightnt it that would be a smallish thing with ropes to pull out the sliding part yes like the windowcleaner uses said tinker i say could it have been the windowcleaner do you think no hes a real decent fellow said jenny ive known him for twenty years so put that out of your head but the ladder could certainly have been the sort that windowcleaners use well go out into the courtyard as soon as ive finished washingup and see if we can find the marks where the ladder was dragged over the courtyard though i must say i didnt hear any dragging noises i heard whispering and a kind of slithery noise but thats all the slithery noise might have been made by the ladder when it was dragged along said tinker i say look at old mischief hes listening as if he understood every word mischief why didnt you wake me up last night when all this was going on you usually wake if anything unusual happens or you hear a strange noise mischief leapt into tinkers arms and cuddled there he didnt like it when tinker was upset about anything he knew by the boys voice that he was worried he made small comforting noises and rubbed his monkey nose against the boys chin youd better go to your father said jenny you might be able to comfort him a little hes very upset indeed hes up in the tower room trying to sort out his papers my word they were left in a state scattered all over the room tinker stood up to go and was astonished to find that he was shaky at the knees would his father ask him if he had been talking about the work he was doing oh dear he had even boasted about it just the day before and talked about his fathers skowheel and the wonderful new machine the electric trosymon tinkers knees became shakier than ever but fortunately his father was far too upset about his muddled room and missing papers to worry about anything tinker had said or done he was up in the tower room trying to discover which of his papers were missing ah tinker he said when the boy came into the tower room just give me a hand will you the thief who came last night must have knocked the whole bunch of papers off the table down on the floor and fortunately he seems not to have seen some that went under the table so i doubt very much if the papers he did take away with him will be of any use hed need to be quite a scientist to understand them without having the ones he left behind will he come back for the others then asked tinker probably said his father but i shall hide them somewhere can you think of a good hidingplace tinker dad dont you hide them begged tinker not unless you tell me where they are you know how you forget things you might forget where youd put this bunch of papers and then you wouldnt be able to go on with your inventions have you copies of the stolen sheets of figures and diagrams no but theyre all in my head as well as on paper said his father it will take me a bit of time to work them all out again but it can be done its a nuisanceespecially as im working to a date now run along tinker please ive work to do tinker went down the spiral staircase of the tower hed have to make sure that his father did hide away those papers very carefully indeed in some really good place oh dear i hope he wont do what he did with the last lot of papers he wanted to hide he thought he stuffed them up the chimney and they nearly went up in flames because jenny thought shed light the fire the next night it was unexpectedly so cold good thing they fell down when she laid the fire and she rescued them before they got burnt why are brainy people like dad so silly about ordinary things i say hell either forget where he puts them or go and hide them in some easy place where anyone could find them he went to talk to jenny jenny dad says that the thief only took some of his papers and that he cant make much use of the ones he took unless he has the whole lot and dad says he thinks that when the thief finds this out hell try to steal the rest of the papers well let him try said jenny i could hide them in a place where no thief would find them if your dad would let me have them i shant tell you where im afraid he might hide them up a chimney again or some silly place like that said tinker looking so worried that jenny felt really worried too theyve got to be hidden somewhere nobody would think of looking and if dad finds a place like that hell promptly forget all about it and never be able to find them again but a thief might find them hed know all the places to look in lets go up to the tower room and clear up the mess that the spilt ink made and see if your father has taken his precious papers and hidden them somewhere there said jenny it would be just like him to hide them in the very room that the thief went to last night up the ladder in at the window left wide open ive no doubt snatched up every paper he could see the rogue and then raced down the ladder again come on up to the tower then said tinker i only hope dad isnt there hes just crossing the courtyard look said jenny leaning out of the window see there he is carrying something under his arm his morning newspapers said tinker it looks as if hes going to have a jolly good read doesnt it oh dear i do hope all this wont be printed in the newspapers it would bring hordes of people down here again do you remember how awful it was last time jenny people even walked over the flowerbeds hoo some people like to poke their noses into everything said jenny i dont mind telling you that i emptied my dirty washingwater out of the window on to a few of them quite by mistake of course how was i to know they were out there staring up and down tinker gave a shout of laughter i wish id seen that he said oh jenny if people come poking their noses into dads business again do lets empty water on their silly heads come on jenny lets go up to the tower room now dads out of the way quick they were soon out in the courtyard and as they crossed it jenny stopped and looked hard at the ground what are you looking for asked tinker just to see if there are any marks that might have been made by someone dragging a ladder across said jenny i heard a funny slithering sound you know but it didnt sound like a ladder being dragged across the two of them looked all over the courtyard but could see no marks there that could possibly have been made by a ladder funny said jenny it worries me that slithery sound she looked up at the tall steep wall of the tower it was made of flintstones of all shapes and sizes the kind found in the countryside round about kirrin and big hollow well i suppose a cat might climb up said jenny doubtfully but not a man hed slip sooner or later it would be far too dangerous i doubt if even a cat would get far and yet you say you thought you saw someone up the towerwall said tinker go on jenny it must have been the shadow of a passing cloud that you saw look up this wall now can you imagine anyone climbing up it at night when it was dark jenny stared up no youre right only a madman would even try well my eyes must have played me up then when i looked out last night but i really did think i saw a dark shadow climbing up the towerwall still its easy to be mistaken at night and i dont believe there was a ladder either there would be marks on the pavingstones of the courtyard if there had been a ladder oh well lets hurry on up to the tower room before your dad decides to go back to it again they went up the spiral stairway all the doors were unlocked so it was plain that the professor was going to come back again after he had read his papers all the same he shouldnt leave the doors unlocked even for a minute said jenny well here we are just look at the inksplashes everywhere and that dear little clock that kept such good time is gone now what would the thief want with a clock id like to know it would be small and neat enough to pop into his pocket said tinker if he was dishonest enough to steal dads papers he would certainly not say no to a nice little clock like that hes probably taken other things too they went right into the room and jenny at once gave a loud exclamation look arent those some of the papers your father was working on on the table there all covered with tiny figures tinker looked closely at them yes theyre his very latest papers he showed me them the other day i remember this diagram jenny how could he leave them on the table with the door unlocked this morning when only last night the thief was here how could he he said he was going to hide them away so carefully because if the thief found them he could use them with the other papers that were stolen but as long as the thief only had half of them they wouldnt be much use and now hes forgotten all about hiding them after all look now tinker lets hide them away ourselves said jenny and not tell him where they are these thieves will have another try for them no doubt about that lets think of some place where theyd be absolutely safe i know said tinker we could hide them on kirrin island somewhere in the old ruined castle nobody would guess they were there now thats a fine idea said jenny id be glad to think they were out of the house she gathered up the papers quickly here you are youd better tell julian and the others and go across to the island with them as soon as you can my what a relief to think theyll be well away from here ill be able to sleep soundly in my bed at nights then tinker stuffed the precious papers under his coat and he and jenny ran at top speed down the spiral stairway they saw the professor not far off and he turned and hailed them tinker jenny i know what youre going to ask me you want to know where ive hidden those papers of mine come here and ill whisper not knowing quite what to say the two went rather guiltily over to tinkers father he whispered loudly ive wrapped them up and put them under the coal at the back of the coalcellar right at the very back and a fine mess youve made of your trousers sir said jenny disgusted and good gracious you must have sat down in the coal yourself you look a right mess come along and let me brush you down not indoors though or the place will be thick with coaldust dont you think it was a good hidingplace jenny asked the professor ha you thought id forget to hide them didnt you he went off looking very pleased with himself jenny chuckled in delight dear old professor hes hidden all his newspapers there but not a single one of his own precious papers and now whatever shall we tell him when he wants the morning papers tinker you cycle out to the papershop and get another lot landsnakes what it is to have a brainy man in the house whatever will he do next chapter thirteen quite a lot of plans after tinker had fetched a new supply of morning papers he decided to go down to the camp in the field and tell the others all that had happened that morning he still felt angry about being ticked off by julian the night before but he simply couldnt wait to tell the others about the robbery and about the grand idea he tinker had of hiding the rest of his fathers papers on kirrin island so off he went with mischief happily on his shoulder holding tightly to his hair the others were all there in the field they had just come back from a shopping expedition and tinkers eyes gleamed when he saw the various tinned meats and tinned fruits fresh rolls tomatoes and apples and bananas that had been brought back from the shops at big hollow julian was glad to see that tinker looked bright and cheerful he was afraid that the boy might have sulked and that would have spoilt things for the others hi said tinker ive got news and he proceeded to tell the others all about the happenings of the night before ending up with his father solemnly going off to hide his morning newspapers under the coal at the back of the coalcellar under the impression that he was hiding the rest of his precious papers but why on earth didnt you tell him he had left his valuable papers behind and hidden his newspapers asked george because if he knew that hed go and hide the precious papers somewhere and forget where hed put them and they might be lost for ever said tinker well what are you going to do with them asked dick ive had rather a brainwave said tinker as modestly as he could er i thought that wed hide them away ourselves where nobody could possibly find them and where is this wonderful hidingplace asked dick on kirrin island said tinker triumphantly whod think of looking there and as we shall all know the hidingplace we cant possibly forget it the papers will be absolutely safe dad can get on with the rest of his ideas without worrying about anything have you told him all this asked julian well no said tinker jenny thought wed better just keep it to ourselves shes pretty certain the thieves will try their hand at breaking in to get the rest of the papers though ha well i vote we scribble some papers ourselves said dick complete with wonderful diagrams and all kinds of peculiar figurings and numberings i feel i could do that very well and wed leave them up in the tower room for the thieves to take theyd think they were the ones theyd missed everyone chuckled ass said julian still its not a bad idea to leave something behind for the thieves that isnt worth a moments look and hide the genuine figures where theyd never dream of finding them on kirrin island when shall we go asked george its ages since ive visited my island and will you believe it last time i rowed over trippers had been there and left their beastly mess everywhere paper bags broken glass lettuce leaves orange peel ugh why do people do that asked anne theyd hate to have to sit in the midst of other peoples mess so why in the world cant they clear up their own oh theyre probably just like that in their own homes said dick all mess and litter and yet it takes so little time to clear up a picnic mess and leave the place decent for the next comers what did you do with all the mess left on kirrin island asked julian i buried it deep in the sand at the back of one of the beaches said george where the tide cant turn it all up again and with every dig of my spade i said blow you you awful trippers without manners blow you and next time you go anywhere may you find someone elses litter to make you feel sick blow you george looked and sounded so very fierce that everyone burst out laughing timmy sat there with his tongue lolling out looking as if he were laughing too and mischief made a funny little noise rather like a giggle good old george she always says straight out what she thinks said julian they sat and talked over their plans for some time dick and julian had better make the fake plans and figures said george theyd be better at that kind of thing than anyone else and tinker can plant them somewhere in his fathers tower room for the thief to take if he goes there again and i bet he will he found it easy enough last night and george could take tinkers fathers papers with the correct figures and plans over to kirrin island said anne not till nighttime though said dick if anyone were on the watch and saw george rowing over there they might guess she was taking something important to hide they might be watching her father too by the way where are these papers you did not leave them behind at home did you tinker i didnt dare to said tinker i felt as if there might be eyes peeping at me watching and hoping id go out and leave the papers behind ive got them under my jersey just here and he patted the top of his stomach oh so thats why you look as if youve had too much breakfast said george well what shall our plans be wed better make out the false papers straight away with figures and diagrams said julian just in case the thieves come sooner than we think tinker wed better go into your house to do those if we go to georges her father might spot us and wonder what on earth we were doing wed probably be sent off anyway because of the scarletfever business well what about my father said tinker he might spot us too anyway hes not keen on my having anyone there this week because hes so busy with his new invention its awfully good and tinker dont start spilling beans again said julian warningly i say it would be best to go to your house what about me going indoors and bringing out dads big drawingboard and some of his paper and his mapping pens and ink and doing the diagrams and things out here in the tent said tinker honestly i never know when dad is going to come into my room hed wonder what on earth we were doing if he found us all there we can have a good look at the papers ive got under my coat and do a whole lot in the same style not the same figures naturally and we could do some fancy diagrams too all right said julian giving way as he saw that tinker was genuinely afraid that his father might see them making the false papers go and get the drawingboard and come back with it and anything else well need you go with him george right said george and she and tinker went up tinkers garden to the house tinker scouted round to see if his father was anywhere about but couldnt see him he found a large drawingboard some big sheets of paper used by his father for working out his figures and a book of odd but easytocopy diagrams he also brought mapping pens indian ink and blotting paper and even remembered drawingpins to pin the sheets of paper to the board george carried half the things and kept a sharp lookout for tinkers father its all right hes asleep somewhere cant you hear that noise asked tinker and sure enough george could a gentle snoring from some room not far off they went back down the garden and over the fence handing everything to the others before they climbed over good said julian now we can produce some beautiful charts of figures that mean absolutely nothing at all and diagrams that will look perfect and not mean a thing either better come into the tent said george if anyone wanders down from the circus camp they might ask us what were doing so they all went into the boys big tent which was the bigger one timmy too and mischief who was delighted to be with the big dog julian soon set to work though he found the space rather cramped they were all watching him in admiration as he set out rows of beautiful meaningless figures when timmy suddenly gave a deep growl and all his hackles rose up on his neck julian turned the drawingboard over at once and sat on it the canvas doorway of the tent was pulled aside and in poked the grinning face of charlie the chimp oh its you charlie said julian well well well and how are you today the chimpanzee grinned even more widely and held out his hand julian shook it solemnly and the chimpanzee went carefully all round the tent shaking hands with everyone sit down charlie said dick i suppose youve let yourself out of your cage as usual and come to see what weve got for our dinner well youll be glad to hear weve got enough for you as well as ourselves charlie squashed himself between timmy and tinker and with much interest watched julian at work with his pen and ink i bet that chimp could draw if you gave him a piece of paper and a pencil said anne so to keep him quiet he was given a pencil and a notebook he at once began to scribble in it very earnestly goodness hes doing a whole lot of funny figures said anne hes trying to copy you ju if hes not careful ill hand the whole job over to him said julian with a chuckle george lets talk about your plans for tonight i think if you are going over to kirrin island to hide those papers youve planned to hide you must take timmy with you oh i will said george not that there will be a single soul on the island but id like old tim just for company ill take the papers straight to the island land and hide them where asked julian oh ill decide that when im there said george somewhere cunning i know my own little island from top to bottom and there those papers will stay until all danger is past well let professor hayling think he has hidden them somewhere himself and forgotten where it will be fun to row across to my island at night with timmy the thieves can make do with my figures and diagrams if they come to the tower room again said julian dont they look professional they certainly did everyone looked at the neat figures and carefully drawn diagrams with admiration timmy suddenly sat up and gave a deep growl again charlie the chimp patted him as if to say whats wrong old boy but timmy took no notice and went on growling he suddenly shot out of the tent and there was a shout from someone outside get off get down get down george swung back the tent opening mr wooh was there looking extremely frightened as timmy growled menacingly round his ankles charlie the chimp ran up to him on all fours and angry because timmy was snarling at his friend showed his teeth suddenly at the big dog george was terrified dont let them fight she cried afraid that timmy would get decidedly the worst of it charlie was jumping up and down in a most alarming way charleee said mr wooh in his deep voice charleee and charlie stopped jumping up and down and making horrible noises and leapt straight on to mr woohs back putting his arms round his neck mr wooh bowed courteously to them all i trust i have not disturbed you my friends he said in his foreignsounding voice i now take a little walk with my friend charleee you come again to see our show i hope yes no probably said dick noticing that the magician had taken a quick and interested look at julians figures and diagrams julian covered them up immediately as if he didnt want the magician to see them he had seen something in the mans eyes that puzzled him could mr wooh possibly have had anything to do with the theft of the papers the night before after all he was a wizard at figures himself he might be able to read the professors figures and diagrams and understand them perfectly well he wouldnt gather much from the ones julian was now doing they were more or less nonsense made up by julian himself to deceive anyone interested in the real ones i interrupt you pardon me said mr wooh and bowed himself politely away from the group in the tent charlie the chimp followed him hoping that mischief would too so that they could have a game but mischief didnt want to he didnt like mr wooh well i didnt realize that anyone from the circus would walk down the field so quietly and be able to hear what we were saying inside the tent said julian worried i didnt like the look in his eyes dick you dont suppose he heard anything we were saying do you would it matter said dick it might said julian do you think he heard what george said about going over to kirrin island with the other papers the valuable ones that the thieves didnt see in the tower room last night i wouldnt let george go if i thought he had heard in fact i think shed better not go she might run into danger dont be silly ju said george i am going and timmy will be with me you heard what i said george you are not to go said julian ill take the papers and hide them on the island ill get them when its dark fairly late ill cycle over to kirrin and untie the boat you keep there and row over to the island all right julian said george astonishingly meekly shall we have a meal now weve only to open the tins and empty the tomatoes and lettuces out of the basket there and the drinks are in that cool corner over there right said julian glad that george had given way to him so easily he would go across in georges boat and find a good hidingplace if danger was about he could deal with it better than george could after all she was only a girl yes julian she is but as youve often said shes just as brave as a boy dont be too sure about tonight chapter fourteen ladders and a lot of fun the children stared after mr wooh and the chimpanzee they saw charlie pick up two empty buckets one in each strong paw and race off to the right with them wheres he going said anne astonished at the rate he was running along i bet hes going to get some water from the stream in those pails and take them to whoever washes down the horses said george she was right charlie soon came back again walking this time holding a heavy pail of water in each hand well i must say that chimpanzee is jolly useful said dick look theres madelon who trains those beautiful horses that paraded round the ring last night shes wearing old trousers this morning she looks quite different there charlie has set the pails of water down beside her i bet that as soon as she wants any more water hell be off again to the stream i rather like old charlie said anne i didnt at first but now i do i wish he didnt belong to mr wooh julian stood up looking down at the paper on which he had so carefully written lines of small figures and drawn many peculiar diagrams i somehow feel this isnt much good now he said i think mr wooh must have guessed it was all a makeup as soon as he saw it he gave himself away a bit thoughi saw him looking at the paper in a rather startled way as if hed seen something very like it very recently indeed so he had the wretch if hed sent someone up to get my dads papers out of the tower room said tinker i say what about having a look round the circus to see if we can spot a ladder anywhere one tall enough to reach the tower room good idea said dick come on well go now chuck that drawingboard and diagram paper over our fence ju i hardly think its worth your while to finish it the five with tinker and mischief wandered down the field to where the circus was encamped dick spotted a ladder lying in the grass and nudged julian julian see that would it reach the tower julian walked over to it it certainly was very very long but would it be long enough no he didnt think it would still he might as well find out who owned it at that moment up came the boneless man walking perfectly he grinned at the children and then suddenly put all his doublejoints to work bent his knees into peculiar positions twisted his head round so that he was looking over his own back and then bent his doublejointed arms the wrong way so that he looked very peculiar indeed dont i dont like it said anne you look so queer and strange why are you called the boneless wonder you arent boneless you just make yourself look as if you were with all those queer doublejoints of yours the boneless man seemed suddenly to lose all his bones and crumpled up on the grass in a funny heap the children couldnt help laughing he didnt look as if he had any bones at all then er can you climb ladders if youre doublejointed asked julian suddenly of course said the boneless man run up them backwards forwards sideways any way you like is that your ladder then asked dick nodding his head towards the ladder in the grass well i use it but so does everyone else said the boneless man turning his head the wrong way round so that it seemed as if it was put on back to front it was odd to speak to someone whose head did that one minute they were talking to his face the next to the back of his head i wish you wouldnt do that said anne it makes me feel giddy do you use that ladder to put the flag on the top of the circus tent asked dick it doesnt look long enough for that it isnt said the boneless man turning his head the right way round much to annes relief theres a much longer one over there it takes three men to carry it its so heavy but the centre circus pole is very tall as you see one man couldnt possibly carry the long ladder the children looked at one another that ruled out the very long ladder too then if it needed three men to carry it jenny would certainly have heard a lot more noise last night are there any more ladders in the circus camp no just the two why thinking of buying one said the boneless man i must go the boss is beckoning to me off he went walking in a most peculiar fashion using his double joints for all he was worth what about the acrobats said julian they must be used to climbing and clambering everywhere i wonder if any of them could have climbed the wall i dont think so said tinker i had a good look at it this morning and although there is a kind of creeper climbing up the wall it stops halfway and above that theres just the stone wall even an acrobat would have to have some help up the tower wall could the clowns have found a way said george no i suppose theyre not as good even as the acrobats at climbing i dont believe the thief could have been anyone from the circus after all look whats that on the ground over there outside that tent they all went over to see it looked like a pile of darkgrey fur george touched it with her toe oh i know what it is the donkeyskin golly so it is cried tinker in delight and picked it up or tried to it was much too heavy for him to hold up all of it in a trice dick and george were inside that donkeyskin dick had the head and found that he could see quite well where he was going for the donkeyneck had neat eyeholes in it the head itself was stuffed with paper george was the back legs and kicked up her feet and made the donkey look extremely lively the others roared with laughter someone shouted loudly hey you leave that donkeyskin alone it was jeremy he came running up looking furious he had a stick in his hand and hit out at the donkeys hind parts giving poor george a good old whack and making her yell hey stop that it hurt tinker looked furiously at jeremy how dare you do that he shouted dick and george are in the donkeyskin put down that stick but jeremy gave the donkeys hind legs another whack and george yelled again tinker gave a shout too and flung himself on jeremy trying to get the stick out of his hand the boy struggled holding on to the stick but tinker gave him a straight blow on the chest and down he went ha i said id knock you down sometime and i have yelled tinker get up and fight ill teach you to hit a girl now stop it tinker said julian how could he have known george was inside come out of the skin you two idiots before old grandad comes up he looks as if hes on his way now jeremy was up now and danced round tinker with doubled fists before either boy could exchange a blow grandads great voice came to them now then stop it jeremy swung his fist at tinker who dodged and then in his turn hit out at jeremy who ran back straight into old grandad who at once clutched him by this time george and dick were out of the donkeyskin looking rather ashamed of themselves old grandad grinned at them still holding on to the furious jeremy fights off said grandad to tinker and jeremy if you want to go on either of you you can fight me not each other however neither of the boys wanted to take on old grandad he might be old but he could still give some mighty slaps as jeremy very well knew they stood staring at one another looking rather sheepish go on shake hands and be friends said grandad quick now or ill do a little fighting myself tinker held out his hand just as jeremy held out his they shook grinning at one another thats right said old grandad no harm done no bones broken youre quits now so no more knocking each other about right grandad said jeremy giving him a friendly punch the old man turned to dick and george and if you want to borrow that donkeyskin youre welcome said old grandad but its manners to ask the owners permission first yes sir sorry sir said dick grinning he wondered what professor hayling and jenny would say if he and george did borrow it and galloped into hollow house at top speed but no he decided reluctantly that jenny might be scared stiff and give notice and that would never do she wouldnt at all like being chased by an apparently mad donkey nor would professor hayling grandad went off and julian spoke to jeremy who wasnt quite sure whether to go or to stay we saw old charlie carrying pails of water for the horses he said my word isnt he strong jeremy grinned glad to be friends again and to be able to stay with the five and tinker they wandered all round the field together looking at the magnificent horses and at deadshot dick doing a little practising at shooting and then watched one small acrobat practising amazing jumps and somersaults mischief the monkey came with them he was absolutely at home with everyone in the circus now man woman or animal he leapt on to the horses backs and they didnt mind he pretended to help charlie the chimp to carry one of the pails of water he ran off with deadshot dicks cap he went into the chimps cage and cuddled up in the straw with him scrabbling about as if the cage belonged to him he even went into grandads tent and came out with a small bottle of lemonade he couldnt get the top off and took it to charlie who was watching near by charlie promptly forced it off with his strong front paws and then to mischiefs disgust tipped up the bottle and drank the lot mischief was very angry indeed he ran to charlies cage which was open and sent the straw flying everywhere charlie sat outside his cage and enjoyed the fun grinning happily come out mischief called tinker youre making a nuisance of yourself let him be said one of the acrobats who was standing near by old charlie enjoys a bit of temper when its someone elses look at him sitting grinning there they watched for a few seconds more to make sure that mischief wasnt annoying the big chimpanzee and then turned to watch monty and winks the clowns having an argument which ended in monty throwing water over winks and winks emptying a basket of rubbish over monty what a pair when they turned to see if mischief was still annoying charlie they saw that the little monkey had left the cage and was tearing down the field to the fence he leapt up and over and disappeared he must think its dinnertime said tinker looking at his watch and golly so it is buck up everyone jenny will be in a fine old fury if were really late its hot dinner today away they all went in a hurry hot dinner over the fence then and up the garden at top speed they mustnt keep a hot dinner waiting or jenny either chapter fifteen a happy day and a shock for julian tinker and the five were two minutes late for their dinner jenny was just taking it in looking a little grim as she had not been able to find the children anywhere ah here you are at last she said i looked down the garden but you were nowhere to be seen its a good thing you came in when you did five minutes more and id have taken the dinner back again dear jenny you know you wouldnt said tinker giving her a sudden squeeze that made her squeal oh how good it smells mmmmmmmmmm you and your mmmmms said jenny pushing tinker away and ive told you before that i dont mind a gentle hug but those squeezes of yours take all my breath away no tinker keep away from me another squeeze like that and ill feel like a lemon everyone laughed at that jenny did say the most amusing things anne felt sorry that she hadnt offered to stay and help her with the dinner oh dear the time went so tremendously quickly once they were all out together the talk at dinnertime was very lively so was mischief the monkey he took bits from everyones plate and handed some of them down to timmy who was lying under the table as usual timmy appreciated these titbits very much well i didnt see a single ladder in the circus camp that was tall enough to reach up to the tower room said george no if there was one it was jolly well hidden said dick pass the mustard someone in front of you ass said julian i must say im beginning to wonder if mr wooh had anything to do with the stealing of your fathers papers tinker i cant somehow see him climbing high ladders hes so so polite and proper said anne actually i cant think of anyone in the circus who would either want the papers or is nasty enough to steal them theyre all so nice i still think mr wooh is the most likely one said julian hes interested in complicated figures and clever inventions but all the same im beginning to think im wrong he could not have got up to the tower room as there is no ladder long enough and i really doubt if hed dare to take a ladder into the courtyard and risk putting it up to the tower he might so easily be caught right well rule him out said tinker but if nobody went up the spiral stairway because all the doors were locked and nobody used a ladder i dont see how those papers disappeared wind took them out of the window perhaps suggested anne would that be possible no for two reasons said julian one is that the window wasnt wide enough open for the wind to blow in with enough strength to blow papers out and secondly wed have been sure to have found some of them down in the courtyard if theyd been blown out but we didnt find a single one there well if nobody got through the three locked doors and nobody got through the window how did those papers get stolen demanded george it would have been a miracle for those papers to have hopped away by themselves and i dont believe in that kind of miracle there was a long silence what a mystery it was i suppose tinkers father couldnt possibly have gone walking in his sleep and taken them could he asked anne well i dont know if a sleepwalker can unlock doors with the right keys and steal his own papers leaving some on the floor and then walk carefully down the spiral stairway still fast asleep locking all the doors behind him and then go to his own bedroom get into bed and then wake up in the morning without remembering a single moment of the whole thing said julian no it cant be possible said dick have you ever known your father to walk in his sleep tinker tinker considered no i cant say i have he said hes a very light sleeper usually no i dont believe dad did all that in his sleep it was somebody else it must have been some sort of miracle man then said george no ordinary person could do it and whoever planned it wanted those papers very very badly or he would never have risked getting them against so many odds and if he wanted them so very badly hell certainly make an effort to get the ones he left behind under the table said julian good thing weve got those he will probably try to get up into the tower the same way as he did before but goodness knows what it was well those papers will be safely out of his way tonight said george on my island yes said julian ill find a most unlikely hidingplace somewhere about the ruined castle i think by the way i hope you havent still got them under your jersey tinker no you dont look fat any more what have you done with them george said id better give them to her to keep in case they slipped out of my jersey said tinker you took them didnt you george yes said george dont lets talk about it any more why not the thiefs not here he cant be listening to us said tinker i believe youre cross george because julian wont let you take the papers yourself oh do shut up tinker said george i shall be jolly cross with you in a minute if you let mischief upset your glass of lemonade again all over my bread take him off the table his manners are getting worse they arent but your temper is said tinker and promptly received a kick under the table from julian he was about to kick back but thought better of it julian could kick very much harder than he could he decided to take mischief off the table in case george smacked him he put the little monkey under the table where timmy was sitting quietly mischief immediately cuddled up to him putting his little furry arms round the big dogs neck timmy sniffed him all over and then gave him two or three licks he was very fond of the naughty little monkey what shall we do this afternoon asked dick when they had all helped jenny to clear away and washup what about a bathe in the sea is it warm enough not really but that doesnt matter we always feel jolly warm when we come out of the water and run about and then rub ourselves down said anne jenny do you feel like a bathe good gracious no said jenny shivering at the thought im a cold mortal i am the thought of going into that cold sea makes me shudder if you want your towels they are all in the airing cupboard and dont you be late for tea if you want any because ive a lot of ironing to do afterwards right jenny said tinker about to give her one of his squeezes but thinking better of it when he saw her warning look julian may i come with you to kirrin island tonight id like a bit of fun you may not said julian anyway there wont be any fun there might be if mr wooh did hear george say she was taking those papers over said tinker hed be waiting on the island and you might be glad to have me with you i should not be glad to have you with me said julian youd just be in the way it would be much easier to look after myself than to see what you were up to all the time i am going by myself please dont scowl at me like that george he got up from the table and went to look out of the window winds died down a bit he said i think ill have a bathe in an hours time if any of you others want to come well go down together they all went down to the beach after a while and bathed except mischief who put one small paw into the water gave a howl and scampered back up the beach as fast as ever he could afraid that tinker might catch him and make him go in timmy went in of course he swam marvellously and even gave tinker a ride on his back diving down when the boy felt heavy so that tinker suddenly found himself sprawling in the water you wretch timmy yelled the boy the waters gone up my nose wait till i catch you ill put you under but he couldnt possibly catch old timmy who really enjoyed the joke the big dog gave a joyful bark and swam after george how he loved being with them all the rest of the day went quickly jenny had a fine tea for them with slices of ham and salad and fruit to end with and said afterwards that she had time to play a game of scrabble with them if they liked mischief sat on the table to watch i dont mind you watching said anne but you are not to scrabble mischief you sent all my little ivory discs on the floor last time we played and i lost the game timmy watched gravely sitting on a chair beside george he simply could not understand what made the children play games like this when they could go for a nice long walk with him they took pity on him when the game was over and went out for a twomile walk along by the sea how timmy loved that i shall cycle to kirrin village as soon as its dark announced julian i suppose your boat is tied up in the usual place george im sorry i cant take you with me but there might be a bit of danger as we said however i wont run into any if i can help it i shant feel comfortable until those secret papers are safely out of the way you can give them to me just before i go george anne suddenly yawned dont start too late or i shall fall asleep she said its getting dark already all that swimming has made me feel tired dick yawned too im jolly sleepy as well he said i shall bed down in our tent as soon as youve gone ju ill see you off safely first papers and all youd better go to your tent too girls you look tired right said anne you coming george well all go said george come on tinker bet you i get over the fence and down to our tents first good night jenny were off she and anne and tinker with timmy running behind went off down the darkening garden dick and julian helped jenny to tidy up and to draw all the curtains well good night jenny said dick all you have to do is to lock the door behind us and go safely up to bed well go down to our tents now sleep well oh i always do said jenny look after yourselves now and dont get into any mischief hide those papers well where nobody can find them julian and dick went off down the garden having heard jenny carefully locking the door behind them tinker and the girls were already over the fence mischief on tinkers shoulder anne spoke anxiously to george i do hope julian will be all right going over to kirrin island she said i wish hed take dick with him if he took anyone it should be me burst out george its my island oh dont be silly george the papers would be much safer with julian said anne it would be an awful business for you cycling by yourself to kirrin getting your boat into the water and rowing over in the dark it would not said george if julian can do it then so could i you go into our tent anne and get ready for bed ill come in a minute after ive taken timmy for a run she waited till anne had disappeared through the tent opening then she went quietly off by herself in the dark timmy trotting beside her rather surprised soon there came the sound of voices as julian and dick reached the fence and leapt over it they went to their tent and found tinker there yawning and getting ready for bed soon the three boys were all rolled up in their rugs mischief cuddled up to tinker after some time julian sat up and looked at his watch and then peeped out of the tent opening quite dark he said but the moons coming up i see i think ill get the papers from george now and set off on my bicyde to kirrin i can easily get it out of the shed you know where george keeps her boat said dick you wont have any difficulty in finding it got your torch ju yes and a new battery said julian look he switched on his torch it gave a good powerful beam shant miss the island if i put this on he said now ill get those papers hey george im coming to your tent for the papers he went over to the girls tent anne was there only half awake she blinked as julians torch shone into her eyes george said julian give me those papers now please hallo i say anne where is george anne started all round the tent georges rugs were there piled in an untidy heap but there was no george and no timmy either oh ju do you know what george has done shes slipped out with the precious papers and taken timmy too she must have gone to fetch her bike and ridden off to kirrin to get her boat and row over to kirrin island julian whatever will happen if she rows over and finds somebody waiting to grab those papers from her poor anne was very near to tears i could shake her said julian very angry indeed going off alone like that in the dark cycling to kirrin rowing over to the island and back she must be mad suppose mr wooh and his friends are waiting there for her the silly little idiot oh julian quick you and dick get your cycles and try to catch her begged anne oh please do anything might happen to her dear silly old george thank goodness timmys gone with her well thats a blessing anyway said julian still angry hell look after her as much as he can my word i could shake george till her teeth rattled i thought she was rather quiet tonight thinking out this plan i suppose he went up to the house with dick and tinker to tell jenny about george and then he and dick at once went to get their bicycles this was serious george had no right to be out alone at night like this and go rowing over to kirrin island especially if there was any chance of someone lying in wait for her jenny was very worried indeed she watched the two boys cycling off in the dark tinker begged her to let him go too but she wouldnt you and mischief would just be nuisances she said oh my word wont i shake that rascal of a george when she gets back what a girl well well thank goodness timmys with her that dogs as good as half a dozen policemen chapter sixteen night on kirrin island it was certainly very dark when the halfmoon went behind the clouds george was glad that her bicycle lamp shone so brightly the shadows in the hedges were deep and mysterious as if they hid people ready to jump out at us she said to timmy but youd go for them at once wouldnt you timmy timmy was too much out of breath to bark an answer george was going pretty fast and he didnt mean to let her get out of sight he was sure she shouldnt be out by herself on a dark night like this he couldnt imagine why she had suddenly taken it into her head to go for a long nightride he raced along panting they met cars with dazzling headlamps and george had to keep pulling to the side she was terribly afraid that timmy might be hit by one of the cars oh dear id never never forgive myself if anything happened to timmy she thought i half wish i hadnt set out now but im not going to let julian hide anything on my island thats my job not his timmy darling please keep on my left side youll be safe then so timmy kept on her left still mystified by this sudden journey out into the night they came at last to kirrin village where windows were still lighted here and there through the village and on to kirrin bay ah there was the bay the halfmoon slid out from behind a cloud and george saw the dark sea shining here and there as the moonlight caught the crests of the waves theres my island look timmy said george feeling a swelling of pride as she looked over the dark heaving sea to a darker stretch which she knew was kirrin island my very own island waiting for me tonight woof said timmy rather quietly because he really hadnt any breath to waste now what was george going to do why had she come out on this lonely ride without the others timmy was puzzled they came to the stretch of beach where boats were kept george rode down a ramp to the beach jumped off her bicycle and put it by a bathinghut in the deep shadows no one would see it there then she went to stare over the sea at her island she had only looked for a moment or two when she clutched timmys collar and gave an exclamation timmy theres a light on my island look to the right there can you see it timmy theres somebody camping there how dare they its my island and i dont allow anyone on it unless they have my permission timmy looked and yes he could see the light too was it made by a campfire or a lantern he couldnt tell all he knew was that he didnt want george to go over there now suppose there were gypsies camping there who would resent george coming to turn them off or a crowd of illmannered young boys who hadnt bothered to find out if they were allowed there they might make things very unpleasant for george he pawed at her trying to make her understand that he wanted her to go back home with him no timmy im not going back till ive found out whos there she said it would be cowardly to turn back now and if its somebody waiting for me to turn up with the papers they can think again look im hiding them here under the tarpaulin in this boat it would be idiotic to try and hide them on the island if theres someone there who might rob me of anything ive got it might be one of the thieves who climbed in to the tower room and left some of the papers behind if hes waiting for me he wont get any papers george stuffed the parcel of papers under the tarpaulin as she spoke its fisherman connells boat called gypsy she said reading the name on the boat by the light of her torch hc wont mind me hiding something in it she covered up the papers with the tarpaulin and then looked over to the island again yes that light was still there anger welled up in george again and she went to look for her own boat which should be somewhere near where they were here it is she said to timmy who leapt in at once she ordered him out for she had to pull the boat down to the water fortunately it was a small light boat and as the tide was almost fully in she didnt have very far to drag it timmy took hold of the rope with his teeth and helped too at last it was on the water bobbing gently about in the dim light of the halfmoon timmy leapt in and soon george was in too though with very wet feet she took the oars and began to pull away from the shore tides almost on the turn she told timmy it wont be too hard a row now we can find those campers and tell them what we think of them youre to bark your very loudest and scare them timmy in fact you can chase them to their boat if you like timmy answered with a small bark he knew quite well that george didnt want him to make much noise he thought it very queer that she was going over to her island tonight all by herself why hadnt she taken the others he was sure that julian would be very cross now dont bark or whine timmy she said in a whisper were almost at my landingplace but im going under those trees there not landing here i want to hide my boat she guided the boat towards some trees whose branches overhung a tiny creek that ran a little way inland she leapt out and flung the mooring rope round the trunk of the nearest tree and made it fast there little boat she said youll be safe there no one will see you come on tim well tackle those campers now she turned to go and then stopped i wonder where their boat is she said lets have a look round timmy it must be here somewhere she soon found the boat lying on the sands its rope thrown round a nearby rock the tide was almost up to it she grinned to herself timmy she whispered im going to untie this boat and set it loose on the tide it will soon be far away ha what will those awful campers say and to timmys amazement she undid the rope from the rock rolled it up and threw the coil inside the boat then she gave the boat a push but it was still embedded in the wet sand never mind she said another ten minutes and the tide will be right under it and then it will turn and take the boat with it she began to make her way up the beach timmy close to her side now lets go after those campers whoever they are she said wheres their light gone i cant see it now but in a minute or two she saw it again its not from a campfire its from a lantern of some sort she whispered to timmy well have to be careful now lets see if we can creep up behind them the two of them made their way silently towards the middle of the little island here there was an old ruined castle and there in the courtyard of the castle sitting in the midst of thick overgrown weeds were two men george had her hand on timmys collar and tugged it gently he knew that meant no barking no growling tim and he stood perfectly still the hackles on his neck rising fast the two men were playing cards by the light of a fairly powerful lantern which they had set on a ruined stone wall timmy couldnt help giving a surprised growl when he saw one of them but george hushed him at once mr wooh the magician from the circus was there dealing out the cards the other man she didnt know he was welldressed and seemed bored he flung down his cards as timmy and george watched from a dark corner of the old castle and spoke to his companion in an irritated voice well whoever it is you said was bringing the rest of those papers here to the island doesnt seem to be turning up the papers youve given me are good very good but of no use without the others this scientist fellow youve stolen them from is a genius if we get the complete set of papers they will be worth a tremendous sum of money which i can get for you but without the other papers there will be no money for you the first set would be useless i tell you someone will be here with them i heard them say so said mr wooh in his stately voice who stole them you asked the other man shuffling the cards quickly no i did not steal them said mr wooh me i keep my hands clean i do not steal the second man laughed no you let other people do your dirty work for you dont you mr wooh the worlds most wonderful magician does not soil his hands he merely uses the hands of others and charges enormous prices for the goods they steal youre a cunning one mr wooh i wouldnt like you for an enemy how did you manage to get the papers by using my eyes and my ears and my cunning answered mr wooh they are better than most peoples so many people are stupid my good friend im not your good friend said the other man ive got to do business with you mr wooh but i wouldnt like to have you for a friend id rather have that chimpanzee of yours i dont even like playing cards with you why doesnt this fellow come george put her mouth to one of timmys ears timmy im going to tell them to clear off my island she whispered furiously to the listening dog fancy fellows like that daring to set foot here rascals and rogues dont come with me wait till i call you then if you have to rescue me come at once leaving a most unwilling timmy standing beside part of the old castle wall she suddenly appeared before the two astonished men by the light of their lantern they leapt to their feet at once its the girl whos come i shouldnt have thought that the boys would have let her said mr wooh astonished i am what are you doing on my island demanded george angrily it belongs to me i saw your light and came over with my dog be careful of him hes big and strong and fierce clear off at once or ill report you to the police easy easy now said mr wooh standing very straight and looking immensely tall so the boys sent you to hide the papers instead of daring to come themselves how cowardly of them where are the papers give them to me ive hidden them said george theyre not very far away you didnt think id be silly enough to come along to you with them in my hands when i saw your light and knew that people were here did you no ive hidden them somewhere on the shore where you wont find them now you just clear off both of you a very brave and determined young lady said mr wooh bowing solemnly to george do you mean to tell me thats a girl said the other man amazed well shes a plucky kid i must say look here kid if youve got those papers hand them over and ill give you a whole lot of money which you can give to professor hayling with my best wishes come and get them said george turning as if to go the two men looked at one another eyebrows raised mr wooh nodded and then winked if george had seen his face she would have known what that wink meant it meant lets humour this silly kid follow her see the hidingplace snatch the papers and clear off in our boat without paying a penny but look out for the dog george led the way timmy walking between her and the two men he was growling all the time deep down in his throat as if to say just you lay a finger on george and ill bite it off the men took care not to go too near him they shone the lantern on him all the time making sure that he was not going to leap at them george led them to the shore to the place where they had left their boat mr wooh gave a cry wheres our boat it was tied to that rock is this it over this ridge called george climbing up a steep bank that overhung the water which was now quite deep with the surging tide the men went to look and then george gave them the surprise of their lives she ran at mr wooh and gave him such a push that he fell right over the high bank into the sea below landing with a yell and a terrific splash george shouted a command to timmy who was now very excited and the big dog did the same to the other man leaping at him and pushing him over he too shot over the ridge and fell into the sea with a splash timmy stood on the little cliff and barked madly as excited as george youll have to swim to the shore of the mainland if you want to escape yelled george the tide has taken away your boat i set it loose youd better not get back on my island yet timmys on the watch for you and hell fly at either of you if you try to set a foot on it again both men could swim though not very well and both were exceedingly angry and very frightened they were sure they could never swim to the mainland but how to get on the island to safety they didnt know that great fierce dog was there barking as if he wanted to bite them into small bits their boat had been set loose there was no way to escape they swam round in circles not knowing what to do im going back to the mainland now yelled george climbing into her boat ill send the police to rescue you in the morning you can get on my island now but youre in for a very cold night goodbye and off went george in her boat with timmy standing at the back watching to make sure those men didnt swim after them he gave george an admiring lick she wasnt afraid of anything hed rather belong to her than to anyone else in the world woof woof woof chapter seventeen and at last the mystery is solved george couldnt help singing loudly as she rowed back to the shore in her boat timmy joined in with a bark now and again he was glad that george was so happy he stood in the prow of the boat wishing it was not nighttime so that he could see clearly where he was going the moon clouded over and the sea looked endless in the dark very few lights showed on the mainland at that time of night just one or two from houses where people were still up wait though what was that bright light suddenly shining out from the mainland was it someone trying to pick out their boat timmy barked at the light and george who of course was rowing with her back to the shore shipped her oars for a moment and looked round its someone on the quay she said maybe a late fisherman good hell be able to help me drag my boat up out of the way of the tide but it wasnt a fisherman it was julian and dick they had arrived about five minutes ago and had looked at once for georges boat and hadnt found it blow were too late to stop her then shes gone over to the island said julian and began to examine all the other tiedup boats to see if he could find one that he could borrow belonging to a friend somehow they must get over to kirrin island and rescue george he felt sure she would be in danger ofsome kind then suddenly the two boys heard the sounds of oars splashing not far out to sea well if that was a fisherman coming home maybe julian could ask him to lend him his boat to go to kirrin island in he could tell him that he was afraid his cousin might be in need of help timmy in georges boat suddenly recognised the two boys when the moon swam out from a cloud and gave a delighted volley of barks george wondering if it was julian and dick rowed as quickly as she could she came into shore jumped out and began to drag in her boat the boys were beside her at once and the boat was soon in its usual place carefully made safe in case the tide was a high one george said julian so overjoyed to see his cousin safe and sound that he couldnt help giving her a bearhug you wicked girl you went to the island just what i said you werent to do you might have found the thieves on the island and then you would have been in trouble i did find them but its they who are in trouble not me said george i saw a light over there took my boat and went over to the island and there they were mr wooh the magician and another man on my island did you ever hear such cheek they asked me for the papers at once oh george did you give them to the men asked dick of course not id already hidden them where those men couldnt possibly find them i wasnt idiotic enough to take them over to hide on the island when i saw somebody was there probably waiting for me and for the papers said george but george if you knew somebody was there why on earth did you risk going over to kirrin island then asked julian puzzled it was a very dangerous thing to do i wanted to turn off whoever it was of course said george as if id allow just anyone on my island its mine my very own and i only allow people on it that i like you know that i just never know what youll do next george said julian patting timmy on the head how did you dare to go and tackle those men oh i know timmy was with you but even so and why in the world didnt the men row after you and ram your boat well you see they couldnt said george i found their boat untied it and set it adrift on the tide its probably half a mile away by now the boys were so astonished that they couldnt even laugh at first but then when they thought of the two men marooned on kirrin island their boat gone goodness knows where they laughed till tears came into their eyes george i dont know how you can think of doing such things said julian werent the men furious i dont know said george i didnt tell them about their boat i pretended that id take them to where id hidden the papers and then when we got on to a nice high ridge overlooking the sea they looked over it to see if their boat was all right and i gave mr wooh a jolly good push and timmy leapt at the man with him and in they went splash splash julian really had to sit down and have another bout of laughing till the stitch in his side grew so bad that he was forced to get up and walk about george suddenly saw the funny side of it all too and she began to laugh as heartily as julian dick joined in as well and timmy barked madly enjoying the fun oh dear said julian feeling weak with laughter and then i suppose you said a polite farewell and left them to their fate well actually i yelled out to tell them id send the police to rescue them in the morning said george im afraid theyll both spend a very uncomfortable night they were soaking wet you see george im beginning to think it was a good thing you went with the papers to the island and not me after all said julian i should never have thought of doing all the things you did pushing the men into the sea really how could you and timmy dare to do such things and setting their boat loose what on earth will the police say when we tell them i dont think wed better tell them had we said george i mean they might think id gone too far anyway why not let the two men kick their heels on the island all night and well decide what to do about the police in the morning its funny i suddenly feel awfully tired i bet you do said dick come on lets get our bikes oh and those precious papers where are they under the tarpaulin in fisherman connells boat said george and suddenly gave the most enormous yawn i hid them there ill get them said julian then off we go back to big hollow house the others will be getting awfully worried by now he found the papers in the fishingboat and then the three of them rode off quickly along the road from kirrin to big hollow timmy running behind them julian kept laughing to himself george should have been a boy not a girl the things she did fancy tackling those two fellows like that pushing them into the water and setting their boat adrift julian was sure he would never have thought of doing such daring things himself at last they were back at the tents and the others crowded round them to hear what had happened anne looked very white jenny was with her comforting her she had just made up her mind to telephone the police and was most relieved to see george again well tell you all the details in the morning said julian but all ill say now is that the papers are safe all right here in my pocket the thieves were probably mr wooh and another man they were on the island tonight waiting for george they had overheard what she said in the tent however george and timmy pushed them both into the water and set their boat adrift so things are settling down nicely they will have to spend the night on the island cold and wet through george did all that said jenny amazed well i never knew she was so dangerous good gracious i feel right down scared of her settle down to sleep in your tent dear you look tired out george was glad to flop down on her rugs now that the excitement was all over she felt too sleepy for words she fell asleep at once but julian and dick didnt they lay awake for some time chuckling over georges deeds of daring what a cousin to have when they were up at the house at breakfast next morning jeremy came up the garden and put his head in at the diningroom window i say he said mr woohs not in his tent this morning hes disappeared and poor old charlie the chimp is too miserable for words ah we can tell you exactly where mr wooh is said julian but wait a bit tinker where are you going you havent finished your but tinker had gone off with jeremy at top speed he was very fond of charlie oh dear would the chimpanzee weep for his master and refuse to take his food tinker called mischief and they both ran down to the fence with jeremy and climbed over it tinker went straight to charlies cage the chimpanzee sat with his head in his hands rocking himself to and fro making sad crying noises lets get into the cage with him said tinker hell like to be comforted he must be missing mr wooh very very much they crawled into the cage and sat down in the straw each putting an arm round the sad chimpanzee old grandad was very surprised to see them both there dont know whats happened to mr wooh he said didnt come home last night here jeremy you come on out i cant spare you to cry over charlie all morning hell soon perk up you can stay with him tinker if you like jeremy crawled out of the cage and went off crossly tinker sat with his arm round charlie wishing he didnt look so terribly sad as he sat there he heard a funny little noise going on all the time tick tick tick ticka ticka tick tick tick tick ticka ticka tick sounds like a watch or something said tinker and scrabbled about in the straw perhaps mr woohs big gold watch had fallen into charlies cage his hand felt something small and round and smooth at the bottom of the cage he rifled away the thick straw and drew out the object underneath it he stared and stared at it in the utmost surprise charlie saw him looking at it snatched it away and hid it in the straw again he made a few growly noises as if he were angry charlie where did you get that little clock said tinker oh charlie well as youre so sad this morning ill give it to you for your very own just to cheer you up but oh charlie i am surprised at you he slid out of the cage and went back over the fence and into his own garden up the path he ran and burst into the diningroom where the others were still finishing their breakfast whats up said dick listen i know who the thief was who climbed in at the tower window i know who he was cried tinker almost shouting in his excitement who said everyone in amazement it was charlie the chimp said tinker why didnt we think of him before he can climb anything it would be quite easy for him to swing himself up that roughstoned tower wall hanging on to the bits of creeper here and there and to the uneven stones and climb through the window into the tower room collect all the papers he could hold and climb down again slither down again probably that must have been the slithering sound i heard said jenny i told you i heard a queer slithering noise and the whispering you heard must have been mr wooh trying to make him go up the tower wall and into the window said julian gosh i bet poor old charlies been taught to get into all sorts of windows and take whatever he sees mr wooh must have known tinkers father worked out all his ideas up in the tower wooh could easily teach him to take papers said julian but there were of course too many for old charlie in the tower room he wouldnt be able to carry them all in his front paws for he needed all his paws to climb down that steep wall so he must have crammed as many as he could into his mouth and dropped the rest under the table charlie the chimp well who would have thought he could be the thief wait a bit how on earth do you know it was charlie said dick nobody saw him it was at night well i do know it was charlie said tinker you remember that dear little clock on the tower room mantelpiece well it disappeared on the night when those papers were stolen and i found it hidden in the straw in charlies cage this morning he snatched it away from me and almost cried so i let him keep it it was ticking loudly just like it always did it was the loud ticking that told me it was there in the cage who wound it up at nights to keep it going said julian at once most astonished charlie i suppose said tinker hes very clever with his paws the clock was quite safe hidden in his cage nobody would be likely to get into the chimps cage and sit there with him but i did this morning and thats how i found it i heard it ticking you see i bet old charlie was clever enough to pop his precious clock into his mouth when he saw any of the men coming to clean out his cage well im blessed said jenny how was it that mr wooh never saw him bringing it along with the papers that night when he stole them well as tinker told you my guess is that old charlie must have put the little clock in his mouth then along with the papers said dick he needed all his four paws climbing or rather slithering down that wall and hes got a jolly big mouth you should see what a lot of food he can stuff into it yes and mr wooh would take the papers of course charlie would just take them from his mouth and hand them to him but hed be artful enough to keep his precious new toy hidden in his mouth poor old charlie cant you see him listening to the clock and cuddling it like a child with a new toy said george he sounded exactly as if he were crying this morning said tinker i couldnt bear it poor old charlie he couldnt understand why mr wooh didnt go and see him today he was so miserable i think well have to get the police along now said julian not only to catch mr wooh and his friend left so conveniently marooned by george on her island but also because mr wooh should be charged with stealing your fathers irreplaceable charts and diagrams tinker goodness knows what else he has taught poor old charlie to steal i bet hes sent the chimp into a lot of houses and up many walls and into many windows yes theres probably been a trail of robberies wherever the circus went said jenny and many innocent people must have been suspected what a shame said anne but oh dear if mr wooh goes to prison whatever will become of poor old charlie the chimp i bet jeremy will take him said tinker he loves him and old charlie adores jeremy hell be all right with jeremy and old grandad well tinker i think youd better go and tell your father all this said jenny i know hes busy he always is but this is a thing he ought to deal with and nobody else if youd like to fetch him george could tell him the whole story and then i rather guess hell ring up the police and mr wooh will find himself in a whole lot of trouble so there goes tinker with mischief on his shoulder to find his father down the hall up the stairs along the landing into his fathers bedroom rrrrrrrrrrrr tinker you sound like a motorscooter going up a steep hill parp parp dont hoot like that youll make your father so angry that he wont listen to a word you say but the professor did listen and soon jenny heard him telephoning the police theyre coming straight away and that means that mr wooh the magician is in for a most unpleasant time and his magic wont help him at all hell have to give back the papers that he made charlie steal and plenty of other things too there he is marooned on the island quite unable to escape waiting fearfully with his companion for the police another adventure over said george with a regretful sigh and a jolly exciting one too im glad you solved the mystery tinker it was clever of you to find the little tower room clock i bet mr wooh wouldnt have let charlie keep it if hed known hed taken it from the tower room poor old charlie the chimp im just wondering if dad would let me keep charlie here while mr wooh is in prison began tinker and stopped as jenny gave a horrified shriek tinker if you so much as mention that idea to your father ill walk straight out of this house and never come back said jenny that chimp would be in my kitchen all day long oh yes he would and things would be disappearing out of my larder and my cupboards and my drawers and hed dance up and down and scream at me if i so much as said a word and all right dear dear jenny i wont ask for charlie honest i wont said tinker i do love you a bit more than id love a chimp but think what a companion he would be for mischief im not thinking anything of the sort said jenny and what about you taking a bit of notice of that monkey of yours bless us all if he hasnt helped himself to half that jar of jam just look at his sticky face oh what a week this has been what with chimps and monkeys and children and robberies and george disappearing and all dear old jenny

hear what you and the others will be up to next how we wish we could join you goodbye for now and take care of yourselves five good luck
