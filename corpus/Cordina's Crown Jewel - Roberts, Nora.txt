cordinaвђs crown jewel prologue she was a princess born bred and meticulously trained her deportment was flawless her speech impeccable and her manners unimpeachable the image she presented was one of youth confidence and grace all wrapped up in a lovely and carefully polished package such things she knew were expected of a member of cordinas royal familyвђat least in the public arena the charity gala in washington dc was a very public arena so she did her duty greeting guests who had paid handsomely for the opportunity to rub elbows with royalty she watched her mother her serene highness gabriella de cordina glide effortlessly through the process at least her mother made it seem effortless though she had worked as brutally hard as her daughter on this event she saw her fatherвђso wonderfully handsome and steadyвђand her eldest brother who was serving as her escort for the evening mingle smoothly with the crowd a crowd that included politicians celebrities and the very wealthy when it was time her royal highness camilla de cordina took her seat for the first portion of the evenings entertainment her hair was dressed in a complicated twist that left her slender neck bare but for the glitter of emeralds her dress was an elegant black that was designed to accent her willowy frame a frame both she and her dressmaker knew was in danger of slipping to downright thin her appetite was not what it had been her face was composed her posture perfect a headache raged like a firestorm behind her eyes she was a princess but she was also a woman on the edge she applauded she smiled she laughed it was nearly midnightвђeighteen hours into her official dayвђwhen her mother managed a private word by sliding an arm around camillas waist and dipping her head close darling you dont look well it took a mothers sharp eyes to see the exhaustion and gabriellas eyes were sharp indeed im a bit tired thats all go go back to the hotel dont argue she murmured youve been working too hard much too hard i should have insisted you take a few weeks at the farm theres been so much to do and youve done enough ive already told marian to alert security and see to your car your father and i will be leaving within the hour ourselves gabriella glanced over noted her son was entertainingвђ and being entertained byвђa popular american singer do you want kristian with you no it was a sign of her fatigue that she didnt argue no hes enjoying himself wiser to slip out separately anyway and quietly she hoped the americans love you perhaps a little too much with a smile gabriella kissed her daughters cheek go get some rest well talk in the morning but it was not to be a quiet escape despite the decoy car the security precautions the tedium of winding through the building to a side entrance the press had scented her she had no more than stepped out into the night when she was blinded by the flash of cameras the shouts rained over her pounded in her head she sensed the surge of movement felt the tug of hands and was appalled to feel her legs tremble as her bodyguards rushed her to the waiting limo unable to see to think she fought to maintain her composure as she was swept through the stampede bodyguards pressed on either side of her rushing her forward it was so horribly hot so horribly close surely that was why she felt ill ill and weak and stupidly frightened she wasnt sure if she fell was pushed or simply dived in to the car as the door slammed behind her and the shouts were like the roar of the sea outside the steel and glass she shivered her teeth almost chattering in the sudden wash of cool airconditioned air closed her eyes your highness are you all right she heard dimly the concerned voice of one of her guards yes thank you yes im fine but she knew she wasnt chapter one whatever might and undoubtedly would be said it hadnt been an impulsive decision her royal highness camilla de cordina was not an impulsive woman she was however a desperate one desperation she was forced to admit had been building in her for months on this hot sticky endless june night it had reached despite her efforts to deny it a fever pitch the wild hive of paparazzi that had swarmed after her when shed tried to slip out of the charity gala mat evening had been the final straw even as security had worked to block them as shed managed to slide into her limo with some remnants of dignity her mind had been screaming let me breathe for pitys sake give me some space now two hours later temper excitement nerves and frustration continued to swirl around her as she paced the floor of the sumptuous suite high over washington dc less than three hours to the south was the farm where shed spent part of her childhood several thousand miles east across the ocean was the tiny country where shed spent the other part her life had been divided between those two worlds though she loved both equally she wondered if she would ever find her own place in either it was time past time she found it somewhere to do that she had to find herself first and how could she do that when she was forever surrounded worse she thought when she was beginning to feel continually hounded perhaps if she hadnt been the eldest of the three young women of the new generation of cordinian princessesвђand for the past few years the most accessible due to her american father and time spent in the statesвђit would have been different but she was so it wasnt just now it seemed her entire existence was bound up in politics protocol and press requests demands appointments obligations shed completed her duty as cochair for the aid to children with disabilities benefitвђa task shed shared with her mother she believed in what she was doing knew the duty was required important but did the price have to be so high it had taken weeks of organizing and effort and the pleasure of seeing all that work bear fruit had been spoiled by her own bonedeep weariness how they crowded her she thought all those cameras all those faces even her family god love them seemed to crowd her too much these days trying to explain her feelings to her personal assistant seemed disloyal ungrateful and impossible but the assistant was also her oldest and dearest friend im sick of seeing my face on the cover of magazines of reading about my supposed romances inside them marian im just so tired of having other people define me royalty beauty and sex sell magazines combine the three and you cant print them fast enough marian breen was a practical woman and her tone reflected that as shed known camilla since childhood it also reflected more amusement than respect i know tonight was horrid and i dont blame you for being shaken by it if we find out who leaked your exit routeвђ its done what does it matter who they were like a pack of hounds marian muttered still youre a princess of cordinaвђa place that makes americans in particular think of fairy tales you look like your mother which means youre stunning and you attract men like an out of business sale attracts bargain hunters the press particularly the more aggressive element feed on that the royalty is a product of birth as are my looks as for the menвђ camilla dismissed the entire gender with an imperious flick of the wrist none of them are attracted to me but to the packageвђthe same one that sells the idiotic magazines in the first place catch since camilla was keeping her up marian nibbled on the grapes from the impressive fruit bowl that had been sent up by the hotel management outwardly calm inwardly she was worried her friend was far too pale and she looked like shed lost weight it was nothing she assured herself that a few quiet days in virginia wouldnt put right the farm was as secure as the palace in cordina camillas father had made certain of it i know its a pain to have bodyguards and paparazzi surrounding you every time you take a step in public she continued but whatre you going to do run away from home yes chuckling marian plucked another grape then it spurted out of her fingers as she caught the steely gleam in camillas tawny eyes obviously you had too much champagne at the benefit i had one glass camilla said evenly and i didnt even finish it it mustve been some glass listen im going back to my room like a good girl and im going to let you sleep off this mood ive been thinking about it for weeks toying with the idea she admitted fantasizing about it tonight she was going to make it happen i need your help marian non non cest impossible cest completement fou marian rarely slid into french she was at the core american as apple pie her parents had settled in cordina when shed been tenвђand she and camilla had been fast friends ever since a small woman with her honeybrown hair still upswept from the evening she responded in the language of her adopted country as she began to panic her eyes a warm soft blue were wide with alarm she knew the look on her friends face and feared it its neither impossible nor crazy camilla responded easily its both possible and sane i need time a few weeks and im going to take them as camilla macgee not as camilla de cordina ive lived with the title almost without rest since grandpereвђ she trailed off it hurt still nearly four years since his death and it still grieved inside her he was our rock she continued drawing together her composure even though hed passed so much of the control already to his son to uncle alex he still ruled since his death the familys had to contribute moreвђto pull together i wouldnt have wanted it otherwise ive been happy to do more in an official capacity but resigned now marian lowered herself to perch on the arm of the sofa i need to get away from the hunt thats how i feel camilla said pressing a hand to her heart hunted i cant step out on the street without photographers dogging me im losing myself in it i dont know what i am anymore there are times too many times now i cant feel me anymore you need a rest you need a break yes but its more its more complicated than that marian i dont know what i want for me for myself look at adrienne she continued speaking of her younger sister married at twentyone she set eyes on phillipe when she was six and that was that she knew what she wantedвђto marry him to raise pretty babies in cordina my brothers are like two halves of my father one the farmer one the security expert i have no direction marian no skills thats not true you were brilliant in school your minds like a damn computer when you find something that sparks it youre a spectacular hostess you work tirelessly for worthwhile causes duties camilla murmured i excel at them and for pleasure i can play piano sing a little paint a little fence a little wheres my passion she crossed her hands between her breasts im going to find itвђor at least spend a few weeks without the bodyguards without the protocol without the damn pressвђtrying to find it if i dont get away from the press she said quietly im afraidвђvery afraidвђ ill just break into pieces talk to your parents cam theyd understand mama would im not sure about daddy but she smiled as she said it adriennes been married three years and he still hasnt gotten over losing his baby and mamaвђshe was my age when she married another one who knew what she wanted but before thatвђ she shook her head as she began to pace again the kidnapping and the assassination attempts on my family passages in history books now but still very real and immediate for us i cant blame my parents for sheltering their children id have done the same but im not a child anymore and i needвђ something of my own a holiday then no a quest she moved to marian took her hands you rented a car yes i needed toвђoh oh camilla give me the keys you can call the agency and extend the rental you cant just drive out of washington im a very good driver think you drop out of sight your family will go mad and the press id never let my family worry ill call my parents first thing in the morning and the press will be told im taking that holidayвђin an undisclosed location youll leak europe so theyll hardly be hunting around for me in the us shall i point out that what started this madness was you being annoyed by having your face splashed all over magazines marian plucked one from the coffee table held it up you have one of the most famous images in the world cam you dont blend i will though she knew it was foolish camillas stomach jumped as she walked to the desk pulled open a drawer and removed a pair of scissors princess camilla she shook her waistlength fall of dark red hair and sucked in her breath is about it get a whole new look horror so huge it wouldve been comical if camilla hadnt felt an echo of it inside herself spread over marians face you dont mean it camilla you cant justвђjust whack off your hair your beautiful hair youre right camilla held out the scissors you do it me oh noвђabsolutely not instantly marian whipped her hands behind her back what were going to do is sit down have a nice glass of wine and wait for this insanity to pass youll feel better tomorrow camilla was afraid of that afraid it would pass and shed go on just as she was doing her duty fulfilling her obligations sliding back into the bright lights and the undeniable comfort of her life the unbearable fleeing from the media if she didnt do somethingвђsomethingвђnow would she ever or would she as the media continued to predict marry one of the glossy men deemed suitable for someone in her position and rank and justвђgo on she set her jaw lifted it in a way that made her friend gasp and taking a long lock of hair snipped it off oh god weak at the knees marian folded herself into a chair oh camilla its just hair but her hand trembled a little her hair had become so much a part of her image of her life that one snip was like cutting off a hand she stared at the long length of gilded red that dangled from her fingers im going in the bathroom to do the rest i could use some help with the back in the end marian came through as friends do by the time they were finished the floor was littered with hanks of hair and camillas vision of herself with long flowing hair had to be completely adjusted a snip here a snip there a glass of wine for fortification another snip to even things up and shed ended up with a cap short as a boys with long spiky bangs to balance it out its awfullyвђwellвђdifferent camilla managed to say im going to cry no youre not and neither camilla vowed was she i need to change and pack some things im already behind schedule she packed what she felt were essentials and was both surprised and a bit ashamed that they filled a suitcase and an enormous tote to bursting she put on jeans boots a sweater and topped them all with a long black coat she considered sunglasses and a hat but decided the addition would make her look like she was in disguise rather than letting her pass unnoticed how do i look she demanded not like you marian shook her head and walked two slow circles around camilla the short hair was a dramatic change and to marians surprise an intriguing one it made camillas goldenbrown eyes seem bigger and somehow more vulnerable the bangs concealed the regal forehead and added a youthful edge without makeup her face was rose and cream maybe a bit paler than it should be the high cheekbones stood out and the long mouth seemed fuller rather than cool aloof and elegant she looked young careless and just a little reckless not like you at all marian said again id recognize you but it would take me a minute and a second look thats good enough she checked her watch if i leave now i can be well away before morning camilla where are you going to go anywhere she took her friend by the shoulders kissed both marians cheeks dont worry about me ill keep in touch i promise even a princess is entitled to a little adventure her long mouth bowed up in a smile maybe especially a princess promise me you wont say anything to anyone before eight in the morningвђand then only to my family i dont like it but i promise thanks she hefted the tote then walked over to pick up the suitcase wait dont walk like that baffled camilla turned back like what like a princess slouch a little swing your hips a little i dont know cam walk like a girl dont glide oh adjusting the strap of the tote she practiced like this better marian tapped a finger on her lips try taking the steel rod out of your backbone she worked on it a bit trying for a looser easier gait ill practice she promised but i have to go now ill call in the morning marian rushed after her as camilla headed for the bedroom door oh god be careful dont talk to strangers lock the car doors umвђ do you have money your phone have youвђ dont worry at the door camilla turned shot out one brilliant smile i have everything i need a bientot but when the door shut behind her marian wrung her hands oh boy bonne chance mamie after ten days camilla sang along with the radio she loved american music she loved driving she loved doing and going exactly what and where she wanted not that the interlude had been without its snags she knew her parents were concerned especially her father she mused there was too much cop in him she supposed for him not to imagine every possible pitfall and disaster that could befall a young woman alone especially when the young woman was his daughter hed insisted she call every day shed been firm on offering a onceaweek checkin and her motherвђas always the balanceвђhad negotiated between the two for every three days she loved them so much loved what they were to her to each other what they were to the world but it was so much to live up to and she knew they would be appalled that she felt so strongly she had to live up to anything anyone but herself other snags were more practical than emotional it had struck her the first time shed checked into a motelвђand what an experience that had beenвђthat she couldnt risk using a credit card if any clever clerk tagged the name camilla macgee and realized who she was with one call to the local papers she would beвђas her brother dorian would sayвђbusted as a result her cash was dwindling quickly pride stubbornness and sheer annoyance at her own lack of foresight prevented her from asking her parents to front her the means to continue with her journey it would after all negate one of the purposes a few precious weeks of total independence she wondered how one went about pawning an item her watch was worth several thousand dollars that would be more than enough to see her through perhaps shed look into it at her next stop but for now it was glorious to simply drive shed headed north and west from washington and had enjoyed exploring parts of west virginia and pennsylvania shed eaten in fastfood restaurants slept in lumpy beds in highway motels shed strolled the streets of small towns and larger cities had been jostled rudely in crowds and once had been ignored then snapped at by a convenience store clerk when shed stopped for a soft drink it had been marvelous no oneвђabsolutely no oneвђhad taken her picture when shed wandered through a little park in upstate new york shed seen two old men playing chess she stopped to watch and found herself being drawn in to their discussion of world politics it had been both fascinating and delightful shed loved watching summer burst over new england it was all so different from her homes in cordina and virginia it was all soвђliberating to simply drift where no one knew her where no one expected anything of her or caught her between the crosshairs of a camera lens she found herself doing something she did only with family and the most intimate of friends relaxing each night for her own pleasure she recounted the days events and her observations in a journal very tired now but pleasantly so shed written last tomorrow ill cross into vermont from there i must decide whether to continue east to the coast or turn america is so big none of the books the lessons none of the trips ive taken with family or on official business had really shown me the size the diversity the extraordinary beauty of the country itself or the people in it im half american have always found pride in that part of my heritage oddly the longer im on my own here the more foreign i feel i have i see neglected this part of my blood but no more im in a small motel off the interstate in the adirondack mountains they are spectacular i cant apply the same description to my room its clean but very cramped amenities run to a cake of soap the size of a us quarter and two towels rough as sandpaper but theres a soft drink machine just outside my door should i want one id love a good glass of wine but my budget doesnt run to such luxuries just now i called home this evening mama and daddy are in virginia at the farm as are kristian and dorian i miss them the comfort and reliability they represent but im so happy im finding out who i am and that i can be alone i believe im fairly selfsufficient and more daring than id imagined i have a good eye for detail an excellent sense of direction and am easier in my own company than i thought i might be i have no idea what any of this means in the grand scheme but its all very nice to know perhaps if the bottom drops out of the princess market i could get work as a trail guide she adored vermont she loved the high green mountains the many lakes the winding rivers rather than cut through toward maine or turn west back into new york state she took a rambling route through the state leaving the interstate for roads through tidy new england towns through forest and farmland she forgot about trying to sell her watch and put off scouting out a motel she had the windows open to the warm summer air the radio up and munched on the fastfood fries in the bag tucked in her lap it didnt concern her when the sky clouded over it added such an interesting light to the tall trees lining the road and gave the air blowing in her windows a faint electric edge she didnt particularly mind when rain began to splatter the windshield though it meant winding up the windows or getting soaked and when lightning slashed over the sky she enjoyed the show but when the rain began to pound the wind to howl and those lights in the sky became blinding she decided it was time to make her way back to the interstate and find shelter ten minutes later she was cursing herself and struggling to see the road through the curtain of rain the windshield wipers washed rapidly from side to side her own fault she thought grimly she was now driving into the teeth of the storm rather than away from it and she was afraid in the dark in the driving rain shed missedвђor would miss her turn she could see nothing but the dark gleam of asphalt pierced by her own headlights the thick wall of trees on either side thunder blasted and the wind rocked the car under her she considered pulling over waiting it out but the stubborn streakвђthe one her brothers loved to tease her aboutвђpushed her on just a couple more miles she told herself shed be back on the main road then shed find a motel and be inside safe and dry and be able to enjoy the storm something streaked out of the trees and leaped in front of the car she had an instant to see the deers eyes gleam in her headlights another to jerk the wheel the car fishtailed spun in a complete circle on the slick road and ended upвђwith a jolt and an ominous squeal of metalвђfrontfirst in a ditch for the next few minutes there was no sound but the hard drum of rain and her own ragged breathing then a flash of lightning slapped her clear of shock she drew in breath slowly released it again repeating this three times usually served to calm her but this time that third breath came out with an oath she slapped the wheel gritted her teeth then slammed the car in reverse when she hit the gas her wheels spun and dug their way deeper she tried rocking the carвђforward reverse forward reverse for every inch she gained she lost two giving up muttering insults at herself she climbed out in the pouring rain to take stock she couldnt see any body damage beyond a scraped fenderвђbut it was dark darker yet she noted as one of her headlights was smashed the car was not only half on half off the road but the front tires were sunk deep shivering now as the rain soaked through her shirt she climbed back into the car and dug out her cell phone shed need to call a tow truck and hadnt a clue how to go about it but she imagined the operator would be able to connect her camilla turned on the phone then stared at the display no service perfect she thought in disgust just perfect i drive into the middle of nowhere because the trees are pretty sing my way into a vicious summer storm and end up getting run off the road and into a ditch by an idiotic deer in the one place in the world where theres no damn mobile phone service it appeared the next part of her adventure would be to spend the night soaking wet in her car after ten minutes the discomfort sent her back into the rain and around to the trunk for her suitcase next adventure changing into dry clothes in a car on the side of the road as she started to drag the case out she caught the faint gleam of headlights piercing through the rain she didnt hesitate but rushed back around to the drivers side reached in and blasted the horn three times she slipped nearly ended up facedown in the ditch then scrambled back up to the road where she waved her arms frantically no white charger had ever looked as magnificent as the battered truck that rumbled up and eased to a stop beside her no knight in shining armor had ever looked as heroic as the dark figure who rolled down the window and stared out at her she couldnt see the color of his eyes or even gauge his age in the poor light and drenching rain she saw only the vague shape of his face a tousled head of hair as she ran over i had some trouble she began no kidding she saw his eyes nowвђthey were green as glass and sharply annoyed under dark brows that were knitted together in a scowl they passed over her as if she were a minor inconvenienceвђa fact that had her hackles rising even as she struggled to be gratefulвђ and studied the car you shouldve pulled onto the shoulder during a storm like this he shouted over the wind not driven your car off it thats certainly helpful advice her tone went frigid and horribly politeвђa skill that had goaded her brothers into dubbing her princess prissy his eyes flicked back to her with a gleam that might have been humor or temper id very much appreciate it if youd help me get it back on the road bet you would his voice was deep rough and just a little weary but since i left my super power suit on krypton im afraid youre out of luck she sent him one long stare he had a strong face she could see that now it was raw boned and shadowed by what seemed to be two or three days worth of beard his mouth was hard and set in stern lines professorial lines she thought the kind that might just lecture she was hardly in the mood she fought off a shudder from the chill fought to maintain her dignity there must be something that can be done yeah his sigh told her he wasnt too happy about it get in well go to my place call for a tow in the car with him dont talk to strangers marians warning echoed in her ears of course shed ignored that advice a dozen times over the last week and a half but get into the car with one on a deserted road still if hed meant her harm he didnt need her to get into the car he could simply climb out bash her on the head and be done with it so faced with spending hours in her disabled car or taking a chance on him and finding a dry spot andвђgod willingвђhot coffee she nodded my bags are in the trunk she told him fine go get them at this she blinked then when he simply continued to scowl at her set her teeth shining knight her butt she fumed as she trudged through the rain to retrieve her bags he was a rude miserable illmannered boor but if he had a telephone and a coffeepot she could overlook it she heaved her bags in the back then climbed in beside him it was then she saw that his right arm was in a sling strapped close to his body immediately guilt swamped her naturally he couldnt help with the car or her bags if he was injured and he was likely impolite due to discomfort to make up for her hard thoughts she sent him a brilliant smile thanks so much for helping me i was afraid id have to spend the night in the carвђsoaking wet wouldnt be wet if youd stayed in the car something wanted to hiss out between her teeth but she swallowed it diplomacy even when it wasnt deserved was part of her training true still i appreciate you stopping mrвђ caine delaney caine mr caine she pushed at her wet hair as he drove through the storm im camillaвђ she broke off the briefest of hesitations when she realized shed been about to say macgee the episode had rattled her more than shed realized breen she finished giving marians last name as her own how did you hurt your arm look lets just ditch the small talk he was driving one handed through a wailing bitch of a storm and the woman wanted to chat amazing we both just want to get out of the rain and put you back on the road to wherever the hell youre going make that illmannered swine she decided very well she turned her head and stared out the side window one advantage she decided the man hadnt looked at her twiceвђhad barely managed once she wouldnt have to worry about him identifying the damsel in distress as a princess chapter two oh hed looked at her all right it might have been dark she might have been wet and spitting mad but that kind of beauty managed to punch through every obstacle hed seen a long slender soaked woman in shirt and jeans that had clung to every subtle curve hed seen a pale oval face dominated by gold eyes and a wide mobile mouth and crowned by a sleek cap of hair that was dark fire with rain hed heard a voice that hinted of the south and of france simultaneously it was a classy cultured combination that whispered upper crust hed noticed the slight hesitation over her name and had known she lied he just didnt happen to give a damn about that or any of the rest of it she was at the moment no more than a nuisance he wanted to get home to be alone to pop some of the medication that would ease the throbbing of his shoulder and ribs the damp and the rain were killing him he had work to do damn it and dealing with her was likely to cut a good hour out of his evening schedule on top of it all shed actually wanted to chatter at him what was it with people and their constant need to hear voices particularly their own the one benefit of having to leave the dig in florida and recover at home was being home alone no amateurs trying to horn in on the site no students battering him with questions no press wheedling for an interview of course the downside was he hadnt realized how problematic it would be to try to deal with paperwork with cataloging with every damn thing essentially onehanded but he was managing mostly it was just an hour or so he reminded himself he couldnt have left the woman stranded on the side of the road in the middle of a storm okay hed considered itвђbut only for a couple seconds a minute max brooding he didnt notice her shivering on the seat beside him but he did notice when she huffed irritably and leaned over to turn up the heat he only grunted and kept driving baboon camilla thought delaney caine was rapidly descending the evolutionary chain in her mind when he turned into a narrow rainrutted bonejarring lane that had her bouncing on the seat she decided he didnt deserve whole mammal status and regulated him to horses ass cold miserable fuming she tried to make out the shape of the structure ahead of them it was nestled in the woods and looked to be some sort of cabin she assumed it was woodвђit was certainly dark she caught a glimpse of an overgrown lawn and a sagging front porch as he muscled the truck around what was hardly more than a mudpacked path to the back of the building there a yellow unshielded iightbulb was burning beside a door youвђlive here sometimes he shoved open his door grab what you need leave the rest and with that he stomped through the rain toward the back door since she needed more than breath to change into dry warm clothes camilla dragged her cases out and lugged them toward the cabin she had to maneuver to open the door as he hadnt bothered to wait for her or hold it open as any neanderthal with even half a pea for a brain would have out of breath she shoved through into a tiny mudroom that lived up to its name it was in a word filthyвђas was everything in it boots coats hats gloves buckets small shovels under a heap of pails trowels and laundry were she assumed a small washer and dryer unit cochon she thought the man was a complete pig the opinion wasnt swayed when she walked through and into the kitchen the sink was full of dishes the small table covered with more along with papers a pair of glasses an open bag of cookies and several pencil stubs her feet stuck to the floor and made little sucking sounds as she walked i see soap and water are rare commodities in vermont she said it sweetly with a polite smile he only shrugged i fired the cleaning lady wouldnt leave my stuff alone how i wonder could she find it under the dirt tow truck he muttered and dug out an ancient phone book at least he seemed to be fairly clean camilla mused that was something at least he was roughly dressed and his boots were scarred but his hands and hairвђthough it was long wet and unkemptвђwere clean she thought his face might even be handsomeвђof a typeвђunder that untidy beard it was a hard face and somewhat remote but the eyes were striking and looked fairly intelligent she waited with admirable patience she thought while he found the number then he picked up the phone started to punch in a button swore phones out no she thought fate couldnt be so cruel are you sure on this planet no dial tone equals no phone they stared at each other with equal levels of dismay and annoyance her teeth wanted to chatter perhaps you could drive me to the nearest inn or motel he glanced toward the window as the next blast of lightning lit the glass twenty miles in thisвђflash flooding high winds he rubbed his aching shoulder absently two good arms he might have tried it just to get rid of her but with one it wasnt worth it i dont think so what would you suggest id suggest you get on some dry clothes before you end up sickвђwhich would just cap things for me here then well see if we can find something to eat in this place and make the best of it mr caine that is incredibly gracious of you but i wouldnt want toвђ she sneezed three times in rapid succession down the hall he told her pointing up the stairs bathrooms all the way at the end ill make coffee too chilled to argue or think of an alternative she picked up her suitcases again struggled with them down the short hall and up the stairs like a horse with blinders heading toward the finish line she kept her gaze straight ahead and closed herself in the bathroom locked the door there were towels on the floor toothpasteвђsans capвђon the counter on a small white sink that while not gleaming at least appeared to have been rinsed sometime within the last six months there was also she soon discovered hot water the minute she stepped into the shower the glory of it wiped out every other sensation she let it beat on her flood over her head she very nearly danced in it when the warmth reached her bones she simply closed her eyes and sighed it was with some regret that she turned off the taps stepped out locating a reasonably cleanlooking towel on the rack she wrapped herself in it as she dug out a shirt and trousers she was standing in her underwear when the lights went out she screamed she couldnt help it and ended up ramming her hip sharply against the sink before she controlled herself her hands shook and her temper spiked as she fought to dress herself in the dark mr caine she shouted for him as she inched out of the bath the place was pitchblack yeah yeah dont blow a gasket she heard him tromping up the stairs saw the narrow beam of light bobbing with him powers out he told her i never wouldve guessed perfect time for sarcasm he muttered just stay put he and the light disappeared into another room he came back with the flashlight and offered her a flickering candle you done in there he gestured with his head toward the bathroom yes thank you fine he started back down and the next boom of thunder had her hurrying after him what do we do now we build a fire drink coffee heat up some soup and wish you were someplace else i dont see any reason to be rude its hardly my fault theres a storm she tripped over a pair of shoes and rapped into his back damn it the jar had his shoulder singing watch it will you i beg your pardon if you didnt live like a pig i wouldnt trip over your mess look just go in there he pointed to the front room of the cabin sit down stay out of the way gladly she sailed into the room then spoiled the effect by letting out a muffled shriek are thoseвђ she lifted a hand weakly toward what her light had picked out on a littered table bones del shined the flashlight over the bones sealed in airtight plastic yeah human mostly he said it matteroffactly as he headed toward the fireplace dont worry he crouched and set kindling i didnt kill anyone oh really she was edging back wondering what she might use for a weapon the original owner died about seven thousand years agoвђbut not in the fall that fractured a number of those bones anyway she doesnt miss them he set the kindling to light why do you have them i found themвђon a dig in florida he set logs to blaze and stood the fire snapped at his back shooting light around him youвђdig graves she managed to ask the horror only a hint in her voice for the first time he smiled it was a flash as bright as the lightning that shot across the sky in a manner of speaking relaxвђwhat was your name she moistened her lips camilla right well relax camilla im an archaeologist not a mad scientist im going for the coffee dont touch my bonesвђor anything else for that matter i wouldnt dream of it she also wouldnt dream of staying alone in the dark room on a storm ravaged night with a pile of human bones no matter how carefully packaged or old they might be ill give you a hand because she wanted to cover her unease she smiled you look like you could use one i yeah i guess the injury still irritated him in more ways than one look theres a spare room upstairs you might as well figure on bunking there well deal with your car in the morning thanks she was warm she was dry and the coffee smelled wonderful things mightve been a great deal worse i really do appreciate it mr caine caine just caine or del when he walked straight back to the mudroom she followed him where are you going what he paused in the act of struggling into a slicker he just wasnt used to explaining his moves were going to need water rain water bucket he said picking up one and theres a generator in the shed i might be able to get it going dont mess with my stuff he added and walked back into the storm not without a tetanus shot believe me she muttered as the door slammed behind him afraid of what she might find she eased open a cupboard then another and another as the first three were empty she found what she assumed were the only clean dishes in the cabin in the last one she poured coffee into a chipped mug and took the first wary sip she was delighted and stunned that the man made superior coffee braced by it she took stock of the kitchen she couldnt just stand around in this sty and do nothing if they were going to eat she was going to have to figure out how to cook under these conditions there were plenty of cans in the pantry among them two cans of condensed tomato soup it was something cheered she cracked open the refrigerator while it wasnt filthy perhaps worse it was very nearly empty she frowned over three eggs a hunk of very old cheese a sixpack of beerвђminus twoвђ and to her delight a bottle of excellent pinot noir things were looking up there was a quart of milk whichвђafter a testing sniffвђproved to be fresh and a half gallon of bottled water rolling up her sleeves princess camilla got to work fifteen minutes later armed with a pail of her own she stepped outside she could barely make out the shed through the rain but over its drumming she heard plenty of cursing and crashing deciding del would be busy for a while yet she switched his halffilled pail with her own and hauled the water back inside if hed had some damn light del thought as he kicked the little generator again he could see to fix the stupid son of a bitch the problem was to get some damn light he needed to fix it which meant he wasnt going to get it up and running before morning which meant he thought sourly hed wasted the best part of an hour fumbling around in a cramped shed and had bumped his miserable shoulder countless times every inch of his body hurt in one way or the other and he was still wet cold and in the dark if it had been just himself he wouldnt have bothered with the generator in the first place hed have opened a can eaten a cold dinner and worked a bit by candlelight but there was the woman to think about he hated having to think of a woman under the best of circumstancesвђand these were far from the best fancy piece too he muttered shining the flashlight around the shed to see if there was anything he could use in the cabin on the run from something probably a rich husband who didnt buy her enough sparkles to suit her none of his business he reminded himself shed be out of his hair the next day and he could get back to work without interruptions he turned caught his shin on the generator jerked and literally saw stars as he aggravated his broken collarbone sweat slicked over his face so that he had to slap his good hand against the wall and wait for the dizzy sickness to pass his injuries were the reason he wasnt still on site at the florida digвђone that had been his baby since the beginning three seasons before he could handle that someone had to do the written reports the journals the cataloging and lab work he preferred that someone be himself but he hated the damn inconvenience of the injuries and the weakness that dogged him behind the pain he could barely dress himself without jarring the broken bone the dislocated shoulder the bruised ribs he couldnt even tie his own damn shoes it was a hell of a situation steady enough to brood over his unsteadiness he picked up the flashlight hed dropped and made his way back to the cabin he stopped to pick up the pail of rainwater and swore viciously as even that weight strained his resources in the mudroom he set down the bucket ditched the slicker then headed straight for a mug in the kitchen when he reached for the coffeepot he saw it wasnt there it took him a minute del didnt notice details unless he meant to notice them not only was the coffee missing but so were all the dishes that had been piled in the sink over the table and counters he didnt remember washing them it wasnt a chore he bothered with until all options were exhausted baffled he opened a cupboard and studied the pile of clean dishes the counters were clean and the table he snarled reflexively when he saw his notes and papers tidily stacked but even as he marched through the cabin prepared to skin some of that soft rosy skin off his unwelcome visitor the scent of coffeeвђand foodвђhit him and hit hard it reminded him he hadnt eaten in hours and buried the leading edge of his temper under appetite there she was stirring a saucepot over the fire he noted shed juryrigged a grillвђprobably one of the oven racksвђbracing the ends of it with stacks of bricks he recalled the bricks had been piled on the front porch but had no idea why resourceful he admittedвђgrudginglyвђand noted that for a skinny woman she had an excellent backside i told you not to touch my stuff she didnt jolt he clumped through the cabin like a herd of elephants shed known he was there im hungry i refuse to cook or to eat in a sty the papers in the kitchen are relatively undisturbed itвђs the filth i dispensed with and the papers she thought were fascinating what she could read of his handwriting in any case i knew where everything was well she straightened turned to face him now youll have to find where it all is now which is in two ordered stacks i have no idea how youвђ she broke off as she saw the blood dripping from his hand oh what have you done he glanced down noticed the shallow slice in the back of his good hand and sighed hell whats one more but she was rushing to him taking the wounded hand and clucking over the cut like a mother hen over a chick back in the kitchen she ordered youre bleeding all over the place it was hardly a major wound no one had ever fussed over his cuts and scrapesвђnot even his mother he supposed that was due to the fact shed always had plenty of her own taken off guard he let himself be pulled back into the kitchen where she stuck his bleeding hand into the sink stay she ordered as she might have said he mused to a pet or worseвђa servant she unearthed a rag dumped it in the pail of water and proceeded to wash off his hand what did you cut it on i dont know it was dark she clucked again as she examined the cleaned cut do you have a firstaid kit antiseptic its just a scratch he began but gave up and rolled his eyes at her fulminating stare back there he gestured vaguely she went into the mudroom and he heard her slamming cabinet doorsвђand muttering vous etes un espece de cochon et gauche aussi if youre going to curse at me do it in english i said youre a pig of a man and clumsy as well she sailed back in with a firstaid kit busied herself digging out antiseptic he started to tell her he knew what shed called him then stopped himself why ruin what small amount of amusement he might unearth during this ordeal im not clumsy hah that explains why your arms in a sling and your hand is bleeding this is a workrelated injury he began but as she turned to doctor his hand he sneezed that basic bodily reaction to a dousing in a rainstorm had his vision wavering he swayed fighting for breath as his ribs screamed and his stomach pitched she looked up saw the pain turn his eyes glassy his cheeks sheet pale what is it without thinking she slid her arms around his waist to support him as his body shuddered you should sit justвђ trying to steady himself he nudged her back his vision was still gray at the edges and he willed it to clear some bruised ribs he managed to say when he got his breath back at her expression of guilt and horror he bared his teeth dislocated shoulder broken clavicleвђworkrelated oh you poor man sympathy overwhelmed everything else come ill help you upstairs you need dry clothes im making soup so youll have a hot meal you shouldve told me you were seriously hurt im notвђ he trailed off again she smelled fabulousвђand she was cooking and feeling sorry for him why be an idiot its not so bad men are so foolish about admitting theyre hurt well need the flashlight in my back pocket ah she managed to brace him shift her body he didnt mind not really when her nice firm breast nestled against his good side or when her long narrow fingers slid over his butt to pull the flashlight out of his jeans pocket he really couldnt say he minded and it took his mind off the pain he let her help him upstairs where he eased down to sit on the side of his unmade bed from there he could watch her bustling around finding more candles to light dry clothes she said and started going through his dresser he opened his mouth to object but she turned with jeans and a sweatshirt in her arms and looked at him with a bolstering smile do you need me to help youвђum change he thought about it he knew he shouldntвђit was one step too far but he figured if a man didnt at least think of being undressed by a beautiful woman he might as well be shot in the head and end it all вђno thanks i can manage it all right then im going down to see to the soup just call if you need help she hurried downstairs again to stir the soup and berate herself shed called him a pig the poor man couldnt possibly do for himself when he was hurt and in pain it shamed her how impatient how unsympathetic and ungrateful shed been at least she could make him as comfortable as possible now give him a hot bowl of soup she went over to plump the sprung cushions of the sofaвђand coughed violently at the dust that plumed up it made her scowl again really she thought the entire place needed to be turned upside down and shaken out hed said hed fired his cleaning service because theyвђsheвђhad touched his things she didnt doubt that for a minute the man had an obviously prickly temperament but she also imagined finances could be a problem being an archaeologist he probably subsisted on grants and that sort of thing shed have to find a way to send him payment for the nights lodgingвђafter she sold her watch when he came back down she had bowls and cups and folded paper towels in lieu of napkins on the scarred coffee table there was candlelight and the glow from the fire and the good scent of hot soup she smiledвђthen stared for just a moment his hair was dry now and she could see it wasnt brown or not merely brown as shed assumed it was all shot through with lighter streaks bleached out she imagined from the sun it curled a bit a deep and streaky oak tone over the neck of the sweatshirt a gorgeous head of hair she could admit with a rough and tumbled style that somehow suited those bottlegreen eyes youll feel better when you eat he was already feeling marginally better after swallowing one of his pain pills the throbbing was down to an irritating ache he was counting on the hot food smoothing that away hed have killed for a hot shower but a man couldnt have everything whats for dinner potage she gave it a deliberately elegant sound creme de tomate avec pomme de terre laughing she tapped her spoon against the pot you had plenty of cans so i mixed the soup with canned potatoes and used some of your milk itd be a great deal better with some herbs but your pantry didnt run to them sit down relax ill serve under normal circumstances he didnt care to be pampered at least he didnt think so he couldnt actually remember ever having been pampered regardless it wasnt what anyone could call a normal evening and he might as well enjoy it you dont look like the type whod cookвђmore like the type who has a cook that made her frown she thought she looked like a very normal very average woman im a very good cook she spooned up soup because it had interested her shed taken private lessons with a cordon bleu chef though this is my first attempt over an open fire looks like you managed smells like it too it was his idea of praiseвђas his anticipatory grunt was his idea of thanks when she handed him his bowl i wasnt sure what youd like to drink coffee or the milk theres beerвђand wine coffee i took some meds so id better back off the alcohol he was already applying himself to the soup when she simply stood in front of him waiting he spared her a glance what she bit back a sigh since the man didnt have the courtesy to offer shed have to ask id enjoy a glass of wine if you wouldnt mind i dont care thank you keeping her teeth gritted she poured his coffee then headed to the kitchen how she wondered did a man get through life with no manners whatsoever she opened the wine and after a brief hesitation brought the bottle back with her shed have two glasses she decided and send him the cost of the bottle along with the money for lodging since hed already scraped down to the bottom of the bowl she served him a second took one for herself then settled down she had suffered through countless tedious dinner parties official events and functions surely she could get through a single stormy evening with delaney caine so you must travel considerably in your work thats part of it you enjoy it itd be stupid to do it otherwise wouldnt it she pasted on her diplomats expression and sipped her wine some have little choice in certain areas of their lives their work where they live how they live im afraid i know little about your field you studyвђ bones sometimes he shrugged slightly when she lifted an eyebrow chitchat he thought hed never seen the point of it civilizations architecture habits traditions religions culture lapping over into anthropology and bones because theyre part of whats left of those civilizations whatre you looking for in your studies answers she nodded at that she always wanted answers to what questions all of them she rose to pour him another mug of coffee youre ambitious no curious when her lips curved this time it wasnt her polite smile it was generous and warm and slid beautifully over her face into her eyes and made his stomach tighten thats much better than ambition you think absolutely ambition can beвђusually isвђnarrow curiosity is broad and liberated and open to possibilities what do your bones tell you she laughed again then gestured to the cluttered side table before she sat again those bones what the hell he thought he had to write it up anyway it wouldnt hurt to talk it throughвђin a limited fashion that she was about fortyfive years old when she died he began she thats right native american female shed had several fracturesвђleg and arm probably from that fallвђseveral years before she died which indicates that her culture was less nomadic than previously thought and that the sick and injured were tended treated well of course they would tend to her theres no of course about it in some cultures injuries of that type the type that would incapacitate and prevent the wounded from pulling her weight in the tribe would have resulted in abandonment ah well cruelty is nothing new she murmured no and neither is efficiency or survival of the fittest but in this case the tribe cared for the sick and injured and buried their dead with respect and ceremony probably buried within a day she and others unearthed in the project were wrapped in a kind of yarn made from native plants complex weave he continued thinking aloud now rather than talking to camilla had to have a loom had to take considerable time couldnt have moved nomadically semipermanent site plenty of game thereвђand seeds nuts roots wood for fires and huts seafood you know all this from a few bones what she saw actually saw him click back to her the way his eyes focused again clouded with vague annoyance you learned this from a few bones she repeated it was barely the surface of what hed learnedвђ and theorized we got more than a few and findings other than bones the more you learn the more you understand how they lived why they did things what came from their lives and what was lost you look forвђis this rightвђhow they built their homes cooked their food how they raised their children buried their dead what deities they worshiped and battles they fought and in the end how we evolved from that it was he admitted a nice summary for a layman there was a brain inside the classy package thats close enough perhaps the women cooked soup over an open fire the glint of humor caught him had him nearly smiling back women have been copping kitchen duty since the start youve got to figure theres a reason for that oh i do men are more inclined to beat their chests and pick fights than see to the more basic and less heroic tasks there you go he rose despite the coffee he was dragging it was the main reason he skipped the pain pills as often as possible im going up spare beds in the first room left of the stairs without a thankyou a goodnight or even one of his occasional grunts he left camilla alone in front of the fire chapter three dont know what to make of my host camilla wrote it was late now and shed opted to huddle on the miserable sofa in front of the fire as the spare room upstairs had been chilly and dampвђand dark she hadnt heard a sound out of del and though shed tried both the lights and the phone shed gotten nothing out of them either ive decided to attribute his lack of social skills to the fact that his line of work puts him more in company with the long dead than the living and to season this with some sympathy over his injuries but i suspect hes every bit as brusque and unpardonably rude when in full robust health in any case hes interestingвђand spending time with people who will treat me as they treat anyone is part of this experiment as a lovely side benefit of his apparently hermit lifestyle there is no television in the cabin imagine that an american home without a single television set i saw no current newspapers or magazines either though some may very well be buried in the refuse heap he lives in the chances of such a man recognizing me even under these oddly intimate conditions are slim to none its very reassuring despite his odd choice of living arrangements when not actively working on a dig hes obviously intelligent when he spoke of his workвђhowever brieflyвђ there was a spark there a sense of curiosity of seeking answers that appeals to me very much perhaps because im seeking something myself within myself though i know it was not entirely appropriate behavior i read through more of his papers when i was certain he was in his room upstairs its the most fascinating work as i understand from the scribbles hes part of a team which has discovered a site in southcentral florida deep in the black peat that was being dug for a pond in a development the bones from an ancient peopleвђtests show seven thousand years ancientвђwere unearthed his notes and papers are so disordered im unable to follow the exact procedure but the bardville research project began from this discovery and delaney has worked on it for three years their discoveries are amazing to me a toddler buried with her toys artifacts of bone antler and wood some of them inscribed with patterns a strong sense of ritual and appreciation of beauty there are sketchesвђ wonder if he did them himself quite intricate and welldone sketches there are so many notes and papers and pieces honestly theyre spread willynilly over the cabin i would love to organize them all and read about the entire project from its inception through to the present but its impossible given the state of things not to mention my departure in the morning for myself im progressing im sleeping better night by night my appetites returned and ive indulged it perhaps a little more than i should today after a long drive and a minor accident i spent a considerable amount of time on elemental domestic chores fairly physical less than two weeks ago the most mundane task seemed to sap all my energyвђ physically emotionally mentally yet after this day i feel strong almost energized this time this freedom to simply be was exactly the remedy i needed im taking more a few weeks more before camilla macgee blends back into camilla de cordina again in the morning the bright bold sunlight slanted directly across dels eyes he shifted seeking the dark and the rather amazing dream involving a lanky redhead with a sexy voice and gilded eyes and rolled on his bad side he woke cursing when his mind cleared he remembered the lanky redhead was real the fact that she was real and sleeping under the same roof made him a little uneasy about the dream he also remembered the reason the classy dish was in the spare bed was that her car was in a ditch and the power and phones were out that meant rather than a hot shower he was going to take a dip in a cold pond he gathered what he needed and started downstairs he stopped when he heard her singing the pretty voice with its faintly exotic accent seemed out of place in his cabin but he couldnt fault the aroma of fresh coffee the coffee was heating on the fire and she was in the kitchen rooting around in the pantry he saw that the floor had been washed he had no idea it had any shine left in it but shed managed to draw it out there were wildflowers stuck in a tumbler on the kitchen table she had opened the kitchen window the door to the mudroom and the door beyond that so the fresh and balmy air circled through she stepped back a small can of mushrooms in her handвђand muffled a short scream when she saw him behind her he hadnt clomped this time he was barefoot and barechested clad only in a ragged pair of sweatpants and his sling his shoulders were broad and his skinвђapparently all of itвђwas tanned a dusky gold the sweatpants hung loose over narrow hips revealing a hard defined abdomen there were fascinating ropy muscles on his uninjured arm she felt the instinctive female approval purr through her an instant before she saw the sunburst of bruises over his right rib cage my god she wanted to touch to soothe and barely stopped herself that must be very painful its not so bad whatre you doing planning breakfast ive been up a couple of hours so im ready for it why because im hungry no he turned away to find a mug if he didnt have caffeine immediately he was going to disintegrate why have you been up a couple of hours habit she knew most peoples fantasies of a princess and the reality of the life were dramatically different in official mode it was rare for her to sleep beyond am not that delaney caine knew she had an official mode bad habit he muttered and strode back to the coffeepot she got her own mug and went back with him i took a walk earlier she began its a gorgeous day and a beautiful spot the forest is lovely simply lovely and theres a pond i saw deer watering and theres foxglove and wild columbine in bloom it answered the question for me why anyone would live here now i wonder how you can bear to leave it its still here whenever i get back he drank the first mug of coffee the way a man wandering in the desert drank water then closing his eyes he breathed again thank you god the powers still out we have three eggsвђwhich well have scrambled with cheese and mushrooms whatever ive got to wash up he picked up his travel kit again then just stopped and stared at her what is it del shook his head youve got some looks sister some looks he repeated with a mutter and strode out it hadnt sounded like a compliment she thought regardless her stomach fluttered and kept fluttering when she went back to the kitchen to mix the eggs he ate the eggs with a singlemindedness that made her wonder why shed worried about flavor the fact was he was in serious heaven eating something he hadnt thrown together himself something that actually tasted like food happy enough that he didnt mention hed noticed that his papers in the living room had been shuffled into tidy piles she earned extra points by not chattering at him he hated having someone yammering away before hed gotten started on the day if her looks hadnt been such a distraction he might have offered her a temporary job cleaning the cabin cooking a few meals but when a woman looked like thatвђand managed to sneak into your dreams only hours after youd laid eyes on herвђshe was trouble the sooner she was out and gone the better all around as if shed read his mind she got to her feet and began to clear the table she spoke for the first time since theyd sat down i know ive been an inconvenience and i appreciate your help and hospitality but ill need to ask another favor im afraid could you possibly drive me to the nearest phone or town or garage whichever is simpler for you he glanced up camilla whatever the rest of her real name was had class as well as looks he didnt like the fact that her easy grace made him feel nasty for wanting to boot her along sure no problem even as he spoke he heard the sound of a car bumping down his lane rising he went out to see who the hell else was going to bother him camilla walked to the window the instant she saw the car marked sheriff she backed up again police she thought uneasily were trained observers she preferred avoiding direct contact del caught her quick move out of the corner of his eye frowned over it then stepped outside hey there del sheriff larry risener was middleaged athletic and softspoken del had known him since hed been a boy sheriff just doing a check whopping storm last night power and phones are out for most of the county including here any word when well have it back well risener smiled scratched his cheek you know yeah i know saw a compact sedan in a ditch a few miles down the road here rental car looks like somebody had some trouble in the storm thats right del leaned on the doorjamb of the mudroom i came along just after it happened couldnt call for a tow driver bunked here last night i was about to drive down to carls see what he can do about it all right then didnt want to think some tourist was wandering around in the woods somewhere i can radio carls place give him the location save you a trip that way and he can swing by and let you know whats what id appreciate that okay then howre you doing the shoulder and all its better only hurts like a bitch about half the time now bet you hear from your folks not in about a week you give them my regards when you do risener said as he strolled back to his cruisermy youngest still prizes those fossils your mother gave him ill do that del waited until the cruiser eased down the lane and out of sight then he simply turned aware camilla had stepped into the mudroom behind him are you in trouble with the law no surprise at the question had her voice jumping just a little no of course not she added firmly when he turned those green eyes were sharp fully focused on her face dont string me along she folded her hands calmed herself i havent broken any laws im not in trouble with or wanted by any authorities im simply traveling thats all and prefer not to explain to the police that i dont have any particular destination her voice was steady now and her gaze clear and level if she was a liar del thought she was a champ at the moment it was easier to take her word all right itll take carl a good hour to get to your car and swing by here find something to do ive got work delaney she knew she should thank him for taking her word but part of her was still insulted hed questioned it still she owed him for what hed doneвђand she always paid her debts i imagine its difficult for you to compile your notes and papers onehanded i have two and id be happy to lend them out for an hour he didnt want her underfoot that was number one but the fact was he wasnt getting a hell of a lot done on his own and if he had his eye on her she couldnt go around tidying up his papers behind his back can you use a keyboard yes he frowned at her hands soft he thought the kind that were accustomed to weekly manicures he doubted theyd do him much good but it was frustrating to try to transcribe with only five working fingers all right justвђsit down or something and dont touch anything he added as he walked out of the room he came back with a laptop computer batterys good for a couple of hours ive got backups but we wont need them he set it down started to fight to open it i can do it she brushed him away dont do anything else he ordered and walked out again he came back struggling a bit with a box he simply snarled when she popped up to take it from him ive got it damn it she inclined her headвђregally he thought its frustrating im sure to be physically hampered but stop snapping at me when she sat again folding her hands coolly he dug into the box and muttered youre just going to type thats it i dont need any comments questions or lectures he dumped a pile of loose papers clippings photos and notebooks on the table pawed through them briefly need to open the document she simply sat there hands folded mouth firmly shut i thought you could use a keyboard i can but as youve just ordered me not to ask questions im unable to ask which document you might like me to open out of which program he snarled again then leaning over her and started hitting keys himself his nose ended up nearly buried in her hairвђwhich annoyed him it was soft shiny fragrant female enough to have the juices churning instinctively he beetled his eyebrows and concentrated on bringing up the document he wanted without thinking she turned her head her mouth all but brushed his shocking them both into jerking back he shot her a fulminating frustrated glare and stuck his good hand into his pocket thats the one there oh she had to swallow hard and fight the urge to clear her throat she took quiet calming breaths instead his eyes were so green she thought you have to page down to the end hed nearly stepped forward again to do it himself before he remembered hed be on top of her again i need to pick it up there she did so with a casual efficiency that satisfied him cautious now he circled around her for his reading glasses then plucked from the disordered pile the precise notes he needed his eyes she thought looked even more green even more intense when he wore those hornrims interred with the remains are plant materials he began then scowled at her are you going to sit there or hit the damn keys she bit back an angry remarkвђshe would not sink to his level and started to type its probable the plants such as the intact prickly pear pad which was retrieved were food offerings buried with the dead a number of seeds were found in the stomach areas of articulated skeletons she typed quickly falling into the rhythm of his voice a very nice voice she thought when it wasnt snarling and snapping almost melodious he spoke of gourds recovered in another burial theorizing that the plant specimen may have been grown locally from seeds brought from central or south america he made her see it she realized that was his gift she began to form a picture in her mind of these people who had traveled to the riverbank and made a home tended their children cared for their sick and buried their dead with respect and ceremony in the rich peaty soil chestnut trees she stopped turned to him breaking his rhythm with her enthusiasm you can tell from pollen samples that there were chestnut trees there nine thousand years ago but how can youвђ look im not teaching a class here he saw the spark in her eyes wink out turning them cool and blank and felt like a total jerk jeez okay theres a good twelve feet of peat it took eleven thousand years since the last ice age to build up to that point he dug through his papers again and came up with photos and sketches you take samplesвђdifferent depths different samples and you run tests it shows the types of plants in the area changes in climate how does it show changes in climate by the types of plants cold warm cold warm he tapped the sketches were talking eons here so were talking a lot of climatic variations leaves seeds pollen fall into the pond the peat preserves themвђit creates an anaerobic atmosphereвђshuts out the oxygen he explained no oxygen no bacterial or fungi growth slows decay why would they have buried their dead in a pond couldve been a religious thing theres swamp gas and itd cause the pond to glow at night methane bubbles up it gives the illusionвђif youre into that stuffвђthat the water breathes death stops breath poetic she thought so they might have chosen it to bring breath back to their dead thats lovely yeah or it couldve been because without shovels for digging it was easier to plug a hole in the muck i like the first explanation better and she smiled at him beautifully yeah well since her smile tended to make his throat go dry he turned away to pour coffee and was momentarily baffled not to see the pot its in the other room she said reading his expression perfectly would you like me to put on a fresh pot yeah great fine he looked down at his watch then remembered he wasnt wearing one whats the time its just after eleven alone he paced the kitchen then stopped to glance over what had been transcribed he was forced to admit it was moreвђa great deal moreвђthan hed have managed on his own with his injuries a couple of weeks at this pace and he could have the articles doneвђthe most irritating of his tasksвђ while still giving an adequate amount of attention to organizing lab reports and cataloging a couple of weeks he thought giving his shoulder a testing roll the doctors had said it would take a couple more weeks for him to have his mobility back the fact was theyd said it would be more like four weeks before hed be able to really pull his own weight again but in his opinion doctors were always pessimistic he should hire a temp typist or something probably should but jeez he hated having some stranger in his hair better to invest in a voiceactivated computer he wondered how long it would take him to get one set it up and get used to it coffeell take a few minutes camilla sat back down placed her fingers over the keys where were we staring out the kitchen window he picked up precisely where he left off within minutes hed forgotten she was there the quiet click of the keys barely registered as he talked of cabbage palms and cattail roots hed segued into fish and game when the sound of tires interrupted puzzled he pulled off his glasses and frowned at the red tow truck that drove up his lane what the hell was carl doing here is that the garage he blinked turned his mind shifted back and with it a vague irritation right yeah carl was fat as a hippo and wheezed as he levered himself out of the cab of the wrecker he took off his cap scratched his widening bald spot nodded as del came outside del carl hows the folks good last i heard good carls eyes squinted behind the lenses of amber lensed sunglasses when he spotted camilla that your car down the road a piece miss yes were you able to get it out not as yet took a look at it for you got a busted headlight wrecked your oil pan left front tires flat as a pancake looks to me like you bent the wheel some too gonna have to replace all that before youre back on the road i see will you be able to fix it yep send for the parts once i get it in the shop shouldnt take moren a couple days a couple of days she readjusted her plans to drive on by evening oh all right towing parts labor gonna run you about three hundred distress flickered over her face before she could stop it though she did manage to swallow the sound of it that rose up in her throat three hundred was twenty more than she had left in cash the interlude she realized as she gnawed over it was going to leave her flat broke she couldnt call the car rental company as she wasnt on their records and that left her no option but to call home for funds the idea of it made her feel like a failure her silence and the worried look in her eyes had carl shifting his feet ahвђi can do with a hundred down you can pay the balance when the works done ill just go get the money shed work something out camilla promised herself as she went back inside and upstairs for her wallet there had to be a way she could sell the watchвђ or somethingвђwithin the next day or two she had enough for a motel for food until the car was repaired as long as she was careful shed figure something out in the meantime she was good at solving problems but her stomach was busy sinking as she counted out the hundred dollars it was she discovered lowering to need money an experience shed never had beforeвђand she acknowledged likely one that was good for her a hundredeighty and some change left she mused tucked into a wallet that had cost more than twice that let that be a lesson to you she ordered herself and went back downstairs del was in the kitchen again going through more notes i thought id ask the towtruck operator to give me a lift into town hes gone gone she rushed to the window stared out where to deal with your car but i havent paid him yet he put it on my account are you going to get that coffee on your account embarrassed pride stiffened her spine no i have the money good you can pay me when your cars up and running i want some damn coffee he grabbed a mug and strode off she marched right after him here take this he ignored her and the money she held out instead going through the process of taking the pot off the fire carrying it to fee table so he could pour it into the mug carrying it back again then picking up the mug the woman was quivering with temper he noted which was pretty interesting he gave her points for being pissed she wasnt used to being obligated he decided or being in financial straights there was money somewhereвђshe was wearing a few grand in that slim swiss efficiency on her wrist but at the moment it wasnt in her wallet that was a puzzle but he wasnt going to make it his business to solve it hed felt sorry for herвђnot a usual reaction in himвђwhen hed seen all that worry cross her face and hed admired her quick control of it she hadnt fluttered or whined or used her looks to soften carl up and cut a better deal shed sucked it up that he respected and it had occurred to him he could give her a hand and solve one of his own problems without making either of them feel uptight about it i figure you earned about twenty this morning he told her figuring ten bucks an hour for the work ill give you that for the keyboarding and you can earn off the bed and meals by cleaning this place up doing the cooking if carl says a couple days you figure four in four days youll have a place to stay and pay off the repair bill she stared at him let it sink in you want me to work for you toвђdo your housekeeping been doing it anyway havent you you get a bunk for four days i dont lose time with my work and we part square at the end of it she turned away in what he assumed was embarrassment hed have been surprised and confused to see she had a huge grin and was fighting off laughter oh what the media would do with it camilla thought as she bit back chuckles camilla of cordina paying for a roof over her head by scrubbing floors heating up cans of soup and typing up notes on bones and elderberry seeds how the princess spent her summer vacation she could see the headline now she had to squeeze her eyes shut and bite her lip to keep the laughter from tumbling out she should refuse of course give him the hundred dollars beg a ride to town where she could contact her parents for a small loan or pawn the watch but lord it was so delicious and so wonderfully out of character wasnt that precisely the purpose of this quest no televisions no newspapers with her image on them interesting work in a beautiful part of the country shed never spent time in learning things she found far more compelling than anything shed studied in school and knowing she was making a positive impact solely on her own skills not because of who she was or any obligations or favorsвђbut most importantly because it was her choice no she couldnt possibly walk away from the opportunity that had just fallen into her lap im very grateful her voice trembled a bit with suppressed humorвђwhich he mistook for the onset of tears nothing could have frightened him more its a fair deal thats all dont get all sloppy about it a very fair deal she turned back eyes shining and struggled to keep her tone casual and brisk accepted she added and held out a hand he ignored the hand because hed added a personal stipulation to the deal he would not in any way shape or form touch her im going to get the generator started in case we dont get the power back clean something up just dont touch my stuff camilla waited until she heard the rear doors slam behind him before she sat down and let the gales of laughter roll chapter four an hour later thoroughly appalled with the state of the cabin now that she had given it a thorough assessment camilla sailed into the shed she was armed with a long list you need supplies hand me that damn wrench she picked up the tool and considered herself beyond civilized for not simply bashing him over the head with it your home is an abomination ill require cleaning suppliesвђpreferably industrial strength and if you want a decent meal ill need some food to stock the kitchen you have to go into town he battled the bolt into submission shoved the switch on and got nothing but a wheezy chuckle out of the generator i dont have time to go into town if you want food for your belly and clean sheets on which to sleep youll make time he used the wrench to beat viciously at the generator then gave it three solid kicks much too accustomed to the male response to irritating inanimate objects to be surprised camilla simply stood where she was list in hand when hed finished cursing she angled her head ive always wondered why men refer to uncooperative machines with crude female euphemisms because they fit like a glove he leaned over slapped on the switch and grunted with satisfaction as the generator let out a loud belch and began to run now that youve accomplished that amazing feat youll want to clean up before you go fill this list eyes narrowed on her face he picked up the wrench again weighed it consideringly in his hand the implication wasnt lost on her she simply stuck out her chin he tossed the wrench aside snatched the list and smeared it with the motor oil on his fingers i hate bossy women i cant stand crude men well both just have to live with it since im currently washing your underwear the faintest glint of humor flicked into his eyes youve got plenty of starch just dont use any on my shorts they started for the door at the same time and ended up jammed together her hand went automatically to his chest where she felt the surprised kick of his heart match hers youre going to have to keep out of my way he told her youll have to watch where youre going then she saw with reluctant excitement his gaze lower and linger on her mouth in response her lips parted on one quiet and catchy breath you got that right sister he muttered and squeezed out of the door well she breathed out rubbing her finger experimentally over lips that felt just a little too warm well well she was angry exhausted and energizedвђin a way she hadnt been in a very long time alive whole healthy and she realized interested it was something to think about del discovered very quickly he didnt care to be an errand boy shopping cut deeply into his day and half the items on her list had him scratching his head in frustration what the hell was chervil and why did it have to be fresh what the devil did she need with two dozen eggs and three gallons of bleach maybe she was going to poison him with it he mused as he drove back to the cabin shed looked mad enough to behind that cool queentopeasant stare she tended to aim at him that was some face she had he reflected the kind that kicked a man right in the gut then you added on the voice those legs that seemed to go straight up to her ears and you had one dangerous female he was starting to regret that hed felt sorry for her still he knew how to be careful around dangerous packages and she was after all no more than a handy tool for the next few days so hed give her a wide berth when they werent actively working keep his hands to himself at all times and do his best to think of her as a nonsexual entity then when he pulled up behind the cabin and she came running out his heart all but stopped nonsexual a tool the woman was a weaponвђand a lethal one at that he decided she was laughing her face flushed with it as she pulled open the door and began to haul out grocery bags the power came back on i never thought id be so delighted with something as basic as a working light switch still no phone service but im sure thats next he snagged a bag and followed her inside she walked across the dirt and gravel he thought as if she were gliding across the polished marble floor of a ballroom he decided it had something to do with all that leg which he wasnt of course paying any attention to whatsoever how many people are you planning to feed for the next few days oh dont be cranky she waved him off and began to unload supplies ill make you a sandwich as soon as these are put away she knew how to make a sandwich he had to give her that he ate and ate well in his now spotless kitchen his mood improving as he scanned the next batch of notes his ribs ached a bit but the discomfort had eased to tolerable with just aspirin when he was done he dictated for another three hours while she transcribed she interrupted now and then but her questions didnt bother him as much the fact was they were good questions the kind that made him think he did classroom duty from time to time though it was never his first choice he was forced to admit that the majority of students professing a desire to make a career in the field didnt have as quick an understanding of the point as she did he caught himself studying the long line of her neck the graceful curve and arch of it mortified he turned away pushed himself back into his notes and forgot her she knew hed been staring just as she knew hed switched her off again as easily as a finger flicked a light from on to off she found she liked itвђall the aspects his interest his annoyance with it and the focus that allowed him to dismiss it his interest had nothing to do with her family her blood or her rank it was the first time in her life shed been utterly sure of that and the response inside her was quick and pleased as to the annoyance she could sense him feeling that was purely satisfying he saw her as a woman first and last not an image not a title and that made her feel like a woman he was attracted to her and didnt want to be that gave her a lovely edge of controlвђan essential female control that wasnt weighed down with royal command and his focus well that attracted her it was a kind of skill she respected and stemmed from willpower intellect and passion for his work it also challenged her though she knew it would be wise to resist that challenge she was after all essentially alone with himвђa man she knew little aboutвђand flirting with that focus trying to undermine it for her own curiosity and satisfaction might haveвђ consequences then again what was a quest without consequences when he paused long enough she rolled her stiff shoulders smiled over at him would you mind if we took a break she watched him come back to the present back to the room buck to her felt his gaze sexy and scholarly behind his reading glasses slide over her as she rose to stretch im not finished he told her we can pick it up again after dinner if you like she kept her smile easy i could use a walk before i start cooking do you ever walk in the woods del there was the faintest hum of invitation in her voice he was sureвђdamn sureвђit was deliberate it packed a hell of a punch he hated to think what she could do if she took a good solid shot at a man go ahead ive got stuff to do he picked up more notes dismissing her he waited until shed passed into the mudroom before he called out watch out for snakes the hesitation in her stride the faintest gasp gave him a great deal of satisfaction he woke in the middle of the night with his ribs aching and his mind blurry hed been dreaming of her again damn it this time theyd been in the kitchen working on his notes shed sat at the keyboard stupendously naked the fantasy was juvenile enough to embarrass him the problem with women was they could get to you just by breathing he lay there a moment willing his ribs to settle and his blood to cool hed gotten through the day and the evening hadnt he holding on to his stipulation hed never touched her not once it wouldve been easy to a finger trailed down that pretty nape while shed typed a brush of his hand when shed passed him the salt over dinner easy as easy as grabbing her onehanded diving in and finding out what that long mobile mouth tasted like but he hadnt points for him still it made him a little nervous that he kept thinking about doing it and she was flirting with him hed ignored evaded or moved in on flirtations often enough to recognize one especially when the woman wasnt being particularly subtle hed had studentsвђor the occasional groupie who hung around digsвђput moves on him mostly in his estimation because theyd dreamed up some romantic image about the field he put the blame squarely on indiana jones for that though those movies had been so damned entertaining he couldnt be sore about it he dismissed the flirtations or fell in with them depending on the timing the woman and his mood but as far as serious relationships went hed managed to avoid that boggy complication the redhead had complication written all over her so fun and games were out of the question he should get her a room in town pay for it move her out then he thought of the pile of neatly typed pages and the intensity of his annoyance went way down she was a miracle worker not only did her help mean he didnt need to fight his way through the material on his own but her questions her interest and her organizational ability was actually getting him to deliver the best material hed ever done not that he was going to mention that he thought of the meal shed put on the table he hadnt a clue what shed done to that humble chicken but shed turned it into a feast he began to revise his notion that she had a rich irritated husband or lover stashed somewhere she was too efficient too clever in the kitchen to be somebodys spoiled and pampered tootsie which was a good thing as fantasizing about another mans woman was too close to fooling around with another mans woman and that was on his short list of unbreakable rules if he moved her out hed be back to square one if he moved her out hed be admitting he couldnt keep his hands off her if he admitted that well where was he giving up he roseвђremembered at the last minute to tug on sweatsвђand went down the hall to the bathroom he didnt notice the sparkling tiles and neatly hung fresh towels any more than hed have noticed soap scum and damp heaps but the scent caught him because it was hers and it tightened every muscle in his body he yanked his pain medication from the cabinet then shoved it back again damn pills made him stupid hed rather toss back a handful of overthecounter stuff and a short neat whiskey he didnt allow himself to so much as glance at her bedroom door to thinkвђeven for an instantвђof her lying in bed behind it a minute later he realized that fantasy wouldve been wasted because she wasnt in bed he heard her voice the quiet murmur of it coming from the kitchen eyes narrowed he paused listened he couldnt quite make out the words but the tone was soft full of affection it set his teeth on edge who the hell was she talking to he moved forward and caught the end of her conversation jetaime aussi bonne nuit the quiet click of the phone on the receiver came an instant before he hit the lights she stumbled back bit off a scream and slapped both hands to her mouth mon dieu vous mavez fait peur she let out a shaky breath shook the french out of her head you frightened me what are you doing down here in the dark shed crept down to check the phone and finding it working had called home to reassure her family she kept the lights off and her voice low to avoid exactly what was happening now explanations the phones back on yeah answer the question her shoulders went back her chin went up i didnt realize i was meant to stay in my room like a child after bedtime she tossed back im repaying you for the lodging and assumed i was free to make use of the house i dont give a damn if you dance a tango in the moonlight i want to know why youre sneaking around and whispering on the phone in the dark she gave him the truth and coated it with ice i couldnt sleep i came down for a drink and checked the phone when i discovered it was in order i made a call dont worry i reversed the charges if my mobile worked in thisвђbackwater i wouldnt have presumed to use yours and having the courtesy to be quiet when another person in the house was presumably sleeping isnt sneaking it was reasonable it rang true so he nodded slowly fine you want to check in with your husband or boyfriend go ahead but dont prowl around like a thief her color bloomed her eyes went burning gold i was not prowling and i dont have a husband if you must know i spoke with my mother to reassure her i was well is this inquisition over he hated feeling stupid so he said nothing and stepped to the cabinet for aspirin i shouldve known with an impatient huff she took down a glass to fill it with water youre only more impossible when youre in pain here i dont want water he moved around her to root at the bottle of whiskey from the pantry have the water first youll spoil the taste of the whiskey otherwise she got down another glass took the bottle from him and poured a tidy three fingers i imagine it should help the discomfort is it your shoulder or your ribs ribs mostly i suppose they hurt more as they heal why dont you sit and ill make you an ice pack for them i dont need a nurse stop being such a hardhead she filled a small plastic bag with ice then wrapped it in a thin dishcloth sit drink your whiskey tell me about one of your other digs something foreign and exotic it amused her pleased her to hear her mother in her voice the brisk indulgence of it the tone shed used to soothe and distract her children during illness go away the order didnt have much punch behind it and he sat down when i was cleaning i noticed some correspondence to dr caine i was impressed she sat holding the cloth to her cheek and waiting for it to cool where did you study she was wearing a robe the color of copper he figured it had to be silk and from the way it clung shifted that she had little to nothing on under it in defense he closed his eyes and let the whiskey slide down his throat oxford вђў now im more impressed delaney caine a doctorate degree from oxford how did you know you were an archaeologist it was an odd way to phrase it he thought not how did you become or when did you decide but how did you know and it was exactly right i always wanted to know how and why and when and who whenever id go on a dig with my parentsвђ ah theyre archaeologists too paleontologists dinosaurs he kept his eyes closed knowing between will and whiskey the ache would ease i liked the digs but it seemed more exciting to me when theyd dig up something human pieces of pottery or tools or weapons something that said man walked there he hissed a bit through his teeth when the cooled cloth made contact with his ribs poor thing she thought sympathetically so angry at the pain my brothers went through a fascination with dinosaurs i think all boys do she saw the strain go out of his face as the ice numbed the ache were they disappointed your parents that you didnt go into their field why would they be he let himself relax inch by inch an owl hooted long slow calls from the woods beyond the cabin her scent drifted over him like a gentle stroke of hands oh tradition i suppose its comforting isnt it to have parents who understandвђat least try to understandвђwhen you have to test yourself try your own direction some of us wait too long to do so fearing disapproval or failure he was relaxed she thought drifting toward sleep odd he looked no less formidable now than he did when he was alert maybe it was the bones of his face or that prickly shadow of beard whatever it was it had a snake of arousal twining through her to look at him really look at him when he was unaware then his eyes opened and that interesting face was very close to hers she nearly eased back with instinctive courtesy but there was a wariness in those deep green depths an intriguing awareness that nudged her to test her power she stayed close very close and lifted a hand to give the rough stubble on his face a testing and flirtatious rub you need a shave dr caine he could smell her all fresh and dewy despite the lateness of the hour her breath fanned lightly over his skin and made his mouth water cut it out itd be tricky to shave onehanded she trailed a fingertip along his jaw down his throat i could do it for you in the morning i dont want a shave and i dont like you touching me oh you like me touching you surely this lust that was curling around in her belly wasnt all onesided youre just afraid of it and annoyed that im not afraid of you he grabbed her wrist with his good hand and his fingers tightened warningly if youre not afraid youre stupid deliberately he raked his gaze over her an insulting pass down her body and back up again were alone out here and youve got no place to hide i may have only one good arm but if i decided to help myself you couldnt stop me anger danced up her spine but there was no fear in it no one had ever laid hands on her unless shed allowed it she didnt intend for that to change youre wrong about that i dont hide i confront im not weak or helpless he tightened his grip on her wrist fully aware his fingers would likely leave marks he hoped they did and she remembered it for both their sakes youre a woman and i outweigh you by close to a hundred pounds a lot of men would use that advantage to take a sample of you whether you were to their taste or not im more particular and sister you dont appeal to me really her anger was fullblown now a state she worked to avoid when she was angry overcome with anger she knew she could be incredibly rash she did her best to cool down to take the reins of her temper in hand thats fortunate for both of us then she eased back tugged her arm free when his grip on her loosened she saw something flicker in his eyesвђrelief or disdain she wasnt sure but either way it fanned the flames again but its a lie she was angry rashвђand she supposed incredibly stupid but the reins of temper slipped and she fisted both hands in his hair and crushed her mouth to his her first reaction was satisfaction pure and simple when she heard his quick indrawn breath she went with it using her lips and tongue to get a good taste of him and as that taste filled her pumped inside her with an unexpected wave of heat it led to her second reaction a slow and slippery meltdown she hadnt been prepared for it not for need to burn through anger every layer of it and pull the hair trigger of her own passion she made a little sound both surprise and pleasure and slid into him his mouth was hard his face rough and his hair as thick and soft as mink pelt she could feel the jackhammer of his heart and the grip of his handвђthis time vised on her nape his teeth then his tongue met hers all she could think was give me more his reflexes were sluggish it was the only excuse he could give for not shoving her away before she slid into him and he was only human that was the only reason he could find for his hand liftingвђnot to push her off but to clamp over her neck to keep her just where she was all over him the soft greedy sounds she made had his blood surging drove him to fight to deepen the kiss even as it reached depths he wasnt sure he could stand he wanted to swallow her wholeвђone wild voracious bite he wanted it wanted her more than he wanted his next breath he shifted struggling to wrap his other arm around her drag her onto his lap the sudden careless move had bright blinding pain smothering passion she jerked back shed felt his body go rigid heard him fight to catch his breath knew shed hurt him concern apologies nearly fell off her tongue before his vicious glare stopped them stay the hell away from me he couldnt pull in any air and his head swam he cursed because he knew it had every bit as much to do with his bodys reaction to her as it did to the pain let me helpвђ i said stay the hell away his chair crashed to the floor as he pushed himself upright when his vision blurred he nearly swayed and the weakness only added to his fury you want a quick roll go somewhere else im not in the market he strode out of the house the two doors slamming like bullets at his back she was thoroughly ashamed of herself and had barely slept all night for cringing every time she replayed the scene in her head shed pushed herself on him all but forced herself on him it meant nothing that shed been angry and insulted and aroused all at once why if a man had behaved as she had camilla would have been first in line to condemn him as a brute and a barbarian shed made him kiss her taking advantage of the situation and her physical advantage that was unconscionable she would have to apologize and accept whatever payment he wanted for the offense if that meant booting her out of the house on her ear he had a perfect right to do so she hoped it wouldnt come to that it might have been an embarrassingly female clichг but she stationed herself in the kitchen only an hour after dawn and prepared to fix him a lovely breakfast to soften him up of course she might have to adjust that to lunch as he hadnt come back into the house until after three in the morning when she heard him come in she hadnt started breathing again for ten minutes half expecting him to burst into her room haul her out of bed and pitch her out of the window then and there not that he hadnt responded to her advance she reminded herself as shame continued to prick hed all but devoured her like a man starving and if he hadnt tried to drag her closer and caused himself painвђ well she supposed it was best not to think of that she had coffee brewed juice chilling shed made batter and filling for applecinnamon crepes from scratch and had a generous slice of country ham waiting now if the bear would only lumber out of his cave minutes later she heard the creak overhead that told her he was up and about she had to wipe suddenly damp palms on her slacks before she turned to heat the griddle for his breakfast because del was also replaying the scene in his head he was in the foulest of moods as he showered part of him was furious with the woman for putting him in such an impossible position the other stood back in amazed disgust at his reaction hed had a beautiful woman come on to him in a staggeringly open and avid way a gorgeous sexy unattached woman had grabbed him in the middle of the night and kissed his brains out and hed stormed out of the house in a huff what was he crazy careful he corrected annoyed with the internal debate he had no problem with casual healthy sex between consenting adults but if there was a casual bone in camillas body hed dance a jig naked in the middle of the road to town the woman breathed complications besides the fact he reminded himself as he dressed he didnt have time for fun and games he had work to do and when he did have time he made the damn moves not that it hadnt beenвђinteresting to have that step taken out of his hands momentarily the woman had a mouth like a goddess he thought hot persuasive and potent better not to think about it much better to decide what the hell to do about it as far as he could see there were two choices he could pretend it never happened or he could fire her drive her into town and dump her the latter it seemed to him was the safest bet all around he was halfway down the stairs when he smelled coffee the sirens scent of it weakened his resolve he could count on the fingers of one hand the number of times in his adult life hed woken to the aroma of fresh coffee then he caught the scent of grilling meat plays dirty he noted just like a female the minute he stepped into the kitchen she turned coffee mug in hand rather than hand it to him she set it on the table she didnt smile but her eyes met his and stayed level i want to apologize for my behavior the tone judgesober threw him off stride he figured the best move was to keep his mouth shutвђand drink the coffee it was she continued completely indefensible i took advantage of the situation and abused your hospitality i couldnt be more sorry for it youd be perfectly justified in throwing me out i hope you wont but i wont argue if thats what youve decided to do did he think she played dirty he mused eyeing her over the rim of his cup as she stood solemn and patient with ham sizzling at her back a heavyweight champ wouldnt last a full round with her lets just forget it relief trickled through her but she couldnt relax until shed finished thats very generous of you she shifted to pick up the kitchen fork and turn the meat id like to tell you ive never done anything like that before he thought of the kiss the smoldering punch of it like what before pushed myself on a man the memory of it had hot color washing into her cheeks but she continued to cook with a steady hand it occurred to me afterward that if the situation had been reversedвђif you had pushed yourself on me particularly when i was incapacitatedвђ im not incapacitated irritated he swallowed coffee then went for more wellвђin any case it occurred to me that it wouldve been contemptible perhaps even criminal soвђ we locked lips beginning and end he snapped out growing more and more uncomfortable its not a big damn deal she slid her gaze toward him then away again the deal big or otherwise had kept him out of his own house most of the night so she would finish groveling a sexual act of any kind must be mutual or its harassment worst molestation the day some skinnyassed woman can molest me is the day pigs go into orbit im not skinny assed or otherwise but to finish i was angry and im attracted to youвђgod knows whyвђand both those reactions as well as the simple curiosity i felt are my responsibility to control i appreciate your acceptance of my apology now if youd like to sit down im going to make crepes she stabbed the ham dumped it on a plate before she could turn to the crepe batter he spun her around clamped his hand over her throat and lifting her to her toes closed his mouth over hers the fork she still held clattered to the counter her arms fell helplessly to her sides it was an assault a glorious one that made her weakkneed lightheaded and hotblooded all at once even as she started to sway toward him he gave her a light shove stepped back there that clears the slate he said then picking up his coffee again sat what kind of crepes chapter five the beard irritated him so did the woman his ribs were a constant dull ache as was his libido work helped such nagging and unwelcome distractions hed always been able to lose himself in workвђin fact he figured anyone who couldnt just wasnt in the right field he had to admit she didnt annoy him when she was helping transcribe and organize his notes the fact was she was such an enormous help he wondered how the devil he would get anything done when she was gone he considered playing on her gratitude and wheedling another couple of weeks out of her then hed be distracted by something as ridiculous as the way the light hit her hair as she sat at the keyboard or the way her eyes took on a glint when she looked over at him with a question or comment then hed start thinking about her who she was where she was from why the hell she was sitting in his kitchen in the first place she spoke french like a native cooked like a gift from god and over it all was a glossy sheen of class he hated asking people questions about themselves because they invariably answered them at length but he had a lot of questions about camilla he began to calculate how he could get some information without seeming to ask the questions she was smart too he thought as she painstakingly filed and labeled onsite photographs while he pretended to study more notes not just educated but there was plenty of that if he had to guess hed say private schools all the wayвђand with that whiff of france in her voice hed put money on some kind of swiss finishing school in any case wherever shed been educated she was smart enough to let the whole matter of that little sexual snap drop shed simply nodded when hed said they were even and had made her fancy breakfast crepes he admired that the way shed accepted the tit for tat and had gone back to business as usual there was moneyвђor there had been money pricey swiss watch silk robe and it had been silk he could still feel the way it had floated and slithered over his bare skin when shed wrapped herself around him damn it still she was no stranger to work she actually seemed to like cooking it was almost beyond his comprehension plus shed sit at the keyboard for hours without complaint her typing was neat and quick her posture perfect and her hands as elegant as a queens breeding he thought the woman had breeding the kind that gave you spine as well as a sense of fair play and she had the most incredible mouth so how did it all add up he caught himself scratching at the beard again and was struck with inspiration could use a shave he said it casually waited for her to glance his way im sorry a shave he repeated i could use one because she considered it a friendly overture she smiled can you manage it or do you want help he frowned a little to show he was reluctant you ever shave a man no she pursed her lips angled her head but ive seen my father and my brothers shave how hard can it be brothers yes two thoughtful she stepped to him bending a bit to study the terrain of his face a lot of angles she mused dips and planes there certainly wasnt anything smooth or simple about it but that only made it challenging i dont see why i couldnt do it its my flesh and blood on the line sister still he lifted a hand rubbed irritably lets do it she took the job seriously after some debate she decided the best spot for the event was the front porch theyd get a little fresh air and shed be able to maneuver a full three hundred and sixty degrees around his chair as she couldnt in the tiny upstairs bathroom she dragged out a small table and set up her tools the wide shallow bowl filled with hot water the can of shaving cream the towels the razor part of her wished it was a straight rather than a safety razor it wouldve been fun to strop it sharp when he sat she tied a towel around his neck i could trim your hair while im at it leave the hair alone she couldnt blame him it was a marvelous head of hair wonderfully streaky and tumbled in any case her one attempt at cutting hairвђher ownвђhad proved she had no hidden talent for it all right just relax she covered his face with a warm damp towel ive seen this in movies i believe it softens the beard when he gave a muffled grunt and relaxed she looked out at the woods they were so green so thick dappled with light and shadows she could hear birdsong and caught the quick flash of a cardinalвђa red bullet into a green target no one was huddled in those shadows waiting for her to make some move that would earn them a fee for a new photograph there were no stoic guards standing by to protect her the peace of it was like a balm its beautiful out today absently she laid a hand on his shoulder she wanted to share this lovely feeling of freedom with someone all blue and green with summer hot but not oppressive in virginia wed be drenched in humidity by now aha he knew hed tagged a touch of the south in her voice whats in virginia oh my family some of them she thought our farm as she took the towel away his eyesвђsharp and full of doubtвђmet hers youre telling me youre a farmers daughter give me a break we have a farm vaguely irritated she picked up the shaving cream two farms she thought one in each of her countries my father grows soy beans corn and so on and raises both cattle and horses you never hoed a row with those hands kid she lifted a brow as she smoothed on the shaving cream theres been a marvelous new invention called a tractor and yes i can drive one she added with some asperity hard to picture you out on the back forty i dont spend much time with the crops but i know a turnip from a potato brows knitted she lifted his chin and took the first careful swipe with the razor my parents expected their children to be productive and useful to make a contribution to the world my sister works with underprivileged children you said you had brothers one sister two brothers we are four she rinsed the razor in the bowl meticulously scraped off more cream and stubble what do you do back on the farm a great many things she muttered calculating the angle from jaw to throat is that what youre running away from hey as the nick welled blood she dabbed at it its just a scratchвђwhich i wouldnt have made if youd just stop talking you say nothing for hours at a time and now you dont shut up amused and intrigued that hed apparently hit a nerveвђhe shrugged his shoulder maybe im nervous ive never had a woman come at me with a sharp implement that is surprising considering your personality tagging you as rebecca of sunnybrook farms surprising considering yours if you grew up in virginia wheres the french pastry part come from her brows lifted above eyes lit with humor french pastry is it my mother she said ignoring the little twist of guilt that came from not being completely honest because of it she gave him more truthвђif not specifics we spend part of our time in europeвђand have a small farm there as well do this she drew her top lip over her teeth he couldnt stop the grin show me how to do that again now hes full of jokes but she laughed then stepped between his legs bent down and slowly shaved the area between his nose and mouth he wanted to touch her to run his hand over some part of her any part of her he wanted he realized to kiss her again whoever the hell she was her thumb brushed his mouth held his lip in place then slid away but her gaze lingered there before it tracked up to his and she saw desire the dangerous burn of it in his eyes felt it stab inside her like the fired edge of a blade why is this do you think she murmured he didnt pretend to misunderstand he didnt believe in pretense i havent got a clueвђother than you being a tasty treat for the eyes she nearly smiled at that and turned to rinse the razor again even attraction should have more im not sure we even like each other very much i dont have anything against you particularly why delaney youre so smooth she laughed because it eased some of the tension inside her a woman hasnt a prayer against such poetry such charm you want poetry read a book i think i do like you she considered as she came back to finish the shave on some odd level i enjoy your irascibility old men are irascible im young yet so im just rude precisely but you also have an interesting mind and i find it attractive im intrigued by your work she turned his face to the side eased in close again and your passion for it i came looking for passionвђnot the sexual sort but for some emotionalвђ some intellectual passion how strange that i should find it here and in old bones and broken pots my field takes more than passion and intellect yes hard work sacrifice sweat perhaps some blood she angled her head if you think im a stranger to such things youre wrong youre not a slacker she smiled again there now youve flattered me my heart pounds and youve got a smart mouth sister maybe on some odd level i enjoy your sarcasm thats handy why dont you ever use my name she stepped back to pick up a fresh towel and wipe the smears of shaving cream left on his face it is my name she said quietly camilla my mother enjoys flowers and there were camellias on my fathers farm when he took her there for the first time so you only lied about the last name yes testingly she ran her fingers over his cheeks i think i did a fine job and you have a nice if complicated face better by far without the scraggly beard she walked to the table wiped her hands i only want a few weeks for myself she murmured a few weeks to be myself without restrictions responsibilities demands expectations havent you ever just needed to breathe yeah and something in her tone something in her eyesвђboth hauntedвђtold him that at least was perfect truth well theres plenty of air around here he touched his face rubbed a hand over his freshly shaved chin your carll be ready in a couple days probably you can take off then or you can stay a week or two and well keep things the way they are tears stung her eyes though she had no idea why maybe a few days longer thank you id like to know more about your project id like to know more about you lets just keep things the way they are until they change nice shaveвђcamilla she smiled to herself as the screen door slammed behind him to demonstrate her gratitude camilla did her best not to annoy him for an entire day and a half she had the cabin scrubbed to a gleam his photographs and sketches labeled and filed the neatly typed pages from his notes and dictation now comprised two thick stacks it was time she decided for a change in routine you need fresh supplies she told him i just bought supplies days ago and the key word is fresh youre out of fruit low on vegetables and i want lemons ill make lemonade you drink entirely too much coffee without coffee coma and youre nearly out of that as well so unless youd like to be comatose we have to go into town for supplies for the first time he spared her a look taking off his reading glasses to frown at her we yes i can check on the status of my car as your carl only makes mumbling noises over the phone when i call to ask about it she was already checking the contents of her purse taking out her sunglasses so well go to town i want to finish this section we can finish when we get back im happy to drive if your shoulders troubling you too much in point of fact his shoulder barely troubled him at all now hed put the hours he spent restless and awake in his room at night to good use by carefully exercising it his ribs were still miserable but he was about ready to ditch the sling sure ill just let you behind the wheel of my truck since youve proven what a good driver you are im a perfectly good driver if the deer hadntвђ yeah yeah well you can forget driving my truck kid since he knew her well enough now to be sure shed nag and push for the next hour he decided to save time and aggravation and just go ill driveвђ but you do the grocery thing when he simply stood frowning she angled her head if youre trying to remember where you put your keys theyre in the ignition of your precious truck where you left them i knew that he muttered and started out are we going or not as pleased as if shed been offered a night on the town she hurried after him is there a department store i could use someвђ hold it he stopped short at the back door so that she bumped solidly into him no theres not and dont get the idea were going on some spree you want lemons well get some damn lemons but youre not dragging me off on some girl safari looking for shoes and earrings and god knows she had a smallвђand perfectly harmlessвђweakness for earrings her mouth moved into something perilously close to a pout i merely want some eye cream he tugged her sunglasses down her nose gave her eyes a hard look theyre fine she rolled them at his back as he continued toward the truck but she decided not to push the issue until they were in town now it was better to distract him i wonder she began as she hitched herself into the cab of the truck if you could tell me how radiocarbon dating works you want a workshopвђ yes yes take a course but just a thumbnail explanation i do better with the transcribing if i have a picture in my head his sigh was longsuffering as the truck bumped along the lane toward the main road carbons in the atmosphere you got trillions of atoms of carbon to every one atom of radioactive carbon plants absorb carbon animals absorb it byвђ eating the plants she finished pleased with herself he shot her a look and other animals absorbed it starts to disintegrate it gets replenished from the atmosphere or from food until whatevers absorbed it dies anyway in a plant or an animal it gives off about fifteen disintegration rays every minute and they can be detected by a geiger counter the rest is just math the dead source loses radioactivity at a rateвђ why am i talking to myself what she dragged her attention back im sorry its just so beautiful i missed so much in the storm its so green and gorgeous a bit like ireland really with all those hills she caught the glint that could only be sun flashing off water and a lake all the lovely trees its all so still and quiet thats why most people live in this part of vermont we dont like crowds and noise you want those you dont come to the nek you go west to lake champlain the nek northeast kingdom the name made her smile so she thought shed slipped away from a principality for a time and landed in a kingdom have you always lived here off and on she gave a little cry of delight as they approached a covered bridge oh its charming it gets you over the stream del said but her pleasure was infectious sometimes he forgot to look around to take satisfaction in the pretty piece of the world where he often made his home they rattled over the bridge toward the white church spires that rose over the trees she thought it was like a book some brilliant and deeply american story the green roll of hills the white churches and tidy houses with their tidy lawns and the town itself was laid out as neatly as a game board with straight streets a small park and weathered brick buildings tucked in with faded clapboard she wanted to stroll those streets wander the shops watch the people as they went about their day perhaps have lunch in one of the little restaurants or better she thought stroll about with an icecream cone del pulled into a parking lot grocery store he informed her as he dragged out his wallet he pushed several bills into her hand get what you need ill go check on your car youve got thirty minutes oh but couldnt weвђ and get some cookies or something he added along with a meaningful shove eyes narrowed behind her shaded glasses she climbed down then stood with her hands on her hips as he pulled out of the lot again the man was a complete blockhead ordering her pushing her cutting her off before she completed a sentence shed never been treated so rudely so carelessly in her life it was beyond her comprehension why she enjoyed it regardless shed be damned if she wouldnt see something of the town before he hauled her back to the cave for another week squaring her shoulders she headed off to explore the pristine and practical new england village didnt run to pawnshops but she did find a lovely jewelry store with a fine selection of estate pieces and the earrings were tempting still she controlled herself and earmarked the shop as a possibility for selling her watch should it become necessary she wandered into a drugstore though the choices of eye cream didnt include her usual brand she settled for what she could get she also picked up some very nice scented candles a few bags of potpourri an antique store proved a treasure trove it pained her to have to pass up the crystalandsilver inkwell it wouldve made a lovely gift for her uncle alexвђ but was beyond her current budget unless she risked the credit card still she found some interesting old bottles for a reasonable price and snapped them up theyd be perfect for wildflowers and twigs and would perk up the cabin considerably the clerk was a woman about camillas age with dark blond hair worn in a sleek ponytail and sharp blue eyes that had noted her customer lingering over the inkwell she smiled as she wrapped the bottles in protective paper that inkwells nineteenth century its a nice piece for a collectorвђat a good price yes its lovely you have a very nice shop we take a lot of pride in it visiting the area yes if youre staying at one of the registered b bs we offer a ten percent discount on purchases over a hundred dollars oh well noвђno im not she glanced back to the desk where the inkwell was displayed her uncles birthday was only three months away i wonder would you take a small deposit to hold it for me the clerk considered giving camilla a careful measure you could put twenty down ill hold it for you for two weeks thanks camilla took the bill from her dwindling supply no problem the clerk began to write out a receipt for the deposit your name myвђbreen ill put a hold tag on it for you miss breen you can come in anytime within the next two weeks with the balance camilla fingered her watch and a glance at it widened her eyes im late delaneys going to be furious delaney caine yes i was supposed to meet him five minutes ago camilla gathered her bags and rushed toward the door miss wait the clerk bolted after her your receipt oh sorry hes just so easily annoyed yes i know the womans eyes danced with a combination of laughter and curiosity we went out once or twice oh im not sure if i should congratulate you or offer my sympathies so she offered a smile im working for him temporarily in the cabin then ill offer you my sympathies tell him sarah lattimer sends her best i will i have to run or ill be hiking back to the cabin you got that right sarah mused as she watched camilla dash away del wasnt a man known for his patience still she sighed a little remembering how shed nearly convinced herself she could change himвђtame himвђwhen shed been twenty she shook her head at the idea as she walked back to put the hold tag on the inkwell she wished the pretty redhead plenty of luck funny she thought now the woman had looked familiar somehow like a movie star or celebrity or something sarah shrugged it would nag at her until she figured out just who dels new assistant resembled but shed get it eventually juggling bags camilla made it to the parking lot at a full run she grimaced when she spotted the truck then just wrenched open the door and shoved her purchases inside have to pick up a few things she said gaily ill just be another minute before he could open his mouthвђto snarl she was sureвђshe was rushing inside the market snagging a cart she set off toward produce at a smart pace but the process of selecting fresh fruits and vegetables simply could not be rushed she bagged lemons delicately squeezed tomatoes pursed her lips over the endive the supermarket was such a novelty for her she lingered longer than she intended over fresh seafood over the baked items she liked the colors the scents the textures the big bold signs announcing specials and truly horrible canned music numbers playing over the loud speaker interrupted only by voices calling for price checks and cleanups she shivered in frozen foods deciding the chances of talking del into an icecream cone now were nil so she bought the makings for them delighted with the variety of choices she loaded the cart then wheeled it to checkout if she were a housewife she thought she would do this every week it probably wouldnt be nearly as much fun just another obligation she thought and that was a shame she came back to reality with a thud when she moved up in line and saw her own face staring out from the cover of a tabloid princess camillas heartbreak why they had her in grieving seclusion camilla saw with growing irritation over an aborted romance with a french actor one shed never even met imbeciles menteurs what right did they have to tell lies about her personal life wasnt it enough to report every move she made to use their telephoto lenses to snap pictures of her night and day she started to reach for the paper for the sheer pleasure of ripping it to pieces what the hell are you doing in here del demanded she jumped like a thief and instinctively whirled around to block the paper with her body fury which shed considered a healthy reaction became a sick trembling in her stomach if she was unmasked here now it would all be over people would crowd around her gawking the media would be on her scent like hounds on a rabbit imвђwaiting in line to pay what is all this stuff food she worked up a smile as a cold sweat slid down her back for what army she glanced at the cart winced i may have gotten a little carried away i can put some of it back why dont you go outside andвђ just get through the damn line he stepped forward and certain hed see the tabloid she dug in her heels dont push me again im not pushing you im pushing the stupid cart when he moved past the newspaper rack without a glance camilla nearly went limp hey del didnt expect to see you back in here so soon the cashier began ringing up the things del began pulling out of the cart and dumping on the conveyer belt neither did i the woman a plump brunette whose name tag identified her as joyce winked at camilla dont let him scare you honey barks worse than his bite not so far camilla muttered but was relieved that he was at the wrong angle now to see the grainy photograph of her still she put her sunglasses back on before turning her face toward the cashier but he doesnt scare me glad to hear it this ones always needed a woman with plenty of spine and sass to stand up to him nice to see you finally found one del she just works for me uhhuh joyce winked at camilla again you hear from your mom lately couple weeks back shes fine you tell her i said hiвђand that im keeping my eye on her boy she rang up the total and had camilla wincing again i think i might need a little more money damn expensive lemons resigned del took what hed given her added more bills she helped him load the bags into the truck then sat with her hands folded in her lap shed overreacted to the tabloid she told herself still her initial spurt of anger had been liberating regardless shed recovered well and a lot more quickly than she might have done just a week or two before that meant she was stronger steadier didnt that serve to prove she was doing the right thing now it was time to put that issue away again and deal with the moment im sorry i took so long but i dont think its unreasonable for me to want to see something of the town your car should be ready tomorrow maybe the next day seeing as carls claiming to be backedup and overworked next time you want to play tourist do it on your own time be sure i will sarah lattimer at the antique store said to give you her best i wonder that anyone so wellspoken and courteous could have ever gone out with you she was young and stupid at the time how fortunate for her that she matured and wisedup you got that right he caught her soft chuckle whats so funny its hard to insult you when you agree with me it was hard to brood about a silly photograph in a trashy newspaper when he was so much more interesting i like you that makes you young and stupid doesnt it she grinned then amused at both of them leaned over and kissed his cheek apparently chapter six im having the most wonderful time it wasnt the plan to stay in one place so long or to do one thing for any length of time but its such a beautiful place and such an exciting thing to do archaeology is truly fascinating so much more interesting and layered to me than the history i enjoyed and was taught in school or the sociology classes i took more fascinating i find than anything ive studied or explored who where and why how people lived married raised their children treated their elderly what they ate how they cooked it their ceremonies and rituals oh so much more and all of it society after society tribe by tribe speaks doesnt it to our own he knows so much and so much of what he knows is almost casual to him in the way a true scholar can be not that knowledge itself is casual to him he seeks it every day he wants to know find that passion admirable enviable and i find it alluring im attracted to his mind to all those complex angles working withвђall right forвђhim is hard and demanding sometimes physically exhausting despite his injuries the man has astounding stamina its impressive the way he can lose himself hours at a go in his work its also an absolute thrill for me to do so as well ive studied bone fragments that are centuries old sealed of course in plastic i wonder how they might feel in my hands if anyone had told me id actually want to handle human bones even two weeks ago id have thought them mad how i wish i could go to the digвђor wet archeological siteвђand actually see the work being done there though delaney paints a very clear picture when he speaks of it its not the same as seeing it for myself this is something i want to see and do for myself i intend to look into classes and what delaney somewhat disdainfully refers to as knapins when im home again i believe ive found an avocation that could become a vocation on a personal level hes not as annoyed by me as he pretends to me at least not half the time its odd and very educational to have someone treat me as he would anyone elseвђwithout that filter of manners and respect demanded by rank not that i appreciate rudeness of course but once you get to know the man you can see beneath the rough exterior hes a genius and though courtesy is never out of place the brilliant among us are often less polished find him so attractive in my life ive never been so physically drawn to a man its exciting on one level terribly frustrating on another i was raised in a loving family one which taught me that sex is not a game but a joyвђand a responsibilityвђto be shared with someone you care for someone you respect and who affords you those same emotions my position in the world adds another complex and cautious layer to that basic belief i cannot risk taking a lover casually but i want him for a lover i want to know what its like to have that fire inside him burn through me i want to know if mine can match it the tabloid in the supermarket reminded me of what id nearly let myself forget what its like to be watched constantly pursued for an image on newsprint speculated about the fatigue of that the unease the discomfort gauging how i feel now against how i felt the night i left washington i understand i was very close to breaking down in some way i can look back and remember that hunted feeling feel the nerves that had begun to dance always so very close to the surface much of that is my own fault i see now for not giving myself more personal time toвђwell decompress i supposeвђsince grandpere died and everything else im doing so now and none too soon my time here is well out of time i suppose i feel its been well spent i feelвђperhaps renewed is an exaggeration refreshed then and more energized than i have felt in so many months before i leave and take up my duties again ill learn all i can about the science of archeology enough that i might in some way pursue it myself ill learn all i can about camilla macgeeвђseparate from camilla de cordina and i might consider seducing the temperamental dr delaney caine the cabin smelled like a woodland meadow since it was a nice change from the musty gym sock aroma hed gotten used to before camilla it was tough to complain and he wasnt running out of socks anymore or having to scavenge in the kitchen for a can of something for his dinner his papersвђafter a few rounds of shouts and threatsвђwere always exactly as he left them a good third of his notes were typed and the articles needed for the trade journals and the sites web page were nearly finished and they were good the coffee was always fresh and so were the towels and so he thought with some admiration was camilla not just the way she looked or the pithy remarks that she aimed regularly in his direction but her brain he hadnt considered just how much a fresh mind could add to his outlook and his angle on the project he liked the way she sang in the mornings when she cooked breakfast and how rosy she looked when she came out of the woods after one of her breaks breaks he recalled theyd negotiated with some bitterness he couldnt say he objected to the candles and bowls of smelly stuff shed set around the place he didnt really mind the fancy soaps shed put out in the bathroom or coming across her little tubes and pots of creams in his medicine cabinet hed only opened them for a sniff out of curiosity he even liked the way she curled up on the sofa in the evening with a glass of wine and grilled him about his work until he gave in and talked about it alone in the kitchen he did slow curls with a twopound can of baked beans with his weak arm it was coming back he decided and he was burning that damn sling his muscles tended to throb at odd times but he could live with that mostly it just felt so good to move his arm again the ribs would take longerвђ the doctors had warned him about that and the collarbone would probably trouble him for some time yet but he didnt feel so frustratingly helpless now maybe hed see if camilla could give him a neck and shoulder massage just to loosen things up she had small hands but they were capable besides it was a good way to get them back on him again shed taken his orders to back off just a little more seriously than he discovered hed wanted he paused set down the can with a little thump god he was getting used to her he realized with some horror getting used to having her around and worse to wanting her around and that he was sure was the beginning of the end a man started wanting a woman around then she expected him to be around no more coming and going as you pleased no more heading off to some dig for months on end without a concern about what you left back home scowling he looked around the kitchen again bottles of wildflowers a bowl of fresh fruit scrubbed counters and cookies in a glass jar the woman had snuck around and made the cabin a home instead of a place you left a place whenever the hell you wanted but homeвђwhen you left home it was always with a wrench when you left a woman it was with a careless kiss and a wave when you left the woman he suspected it would rip you to pieces she came out of the woods as he thought of her her face glowing white wildflowers in her hand how the devil had she come so close to becoming the woman he asked himself with a spurt of panic they hadnt known each other for long had they he ran a hand through his hair as he realized hed lost track of time what the hell day was it how long had she been there what in gods name was he going to do with himself when she left she came in full of smiles well he could fix that youre late he snapped at her calmly she glanced at her watch no im not i am in fact two minutes early i had a lovely walk and fed the ducks who live on the pond she moved over to the bottle working her new flowers in with the old but its clouding up i think its going to rain i want to finish the section on brain tissue i cant do if youre out feeding a bunch of ducks then well get started as soon as i pour us some lemonade dont placate me sister that would be beyond even my masterly capabilities whats wrong del are you hurting she turned the pitcher in her hand and nearly bobbled it when she focused on him your arm youve taken off the sling quickly she set the pitcher aside and went to him to ran a hand along his arm he said nothing because god help him he wanted her to touch him i suppose i expected it to be thin and wan its not her lips pursed as she tested the muscle a bit paler than the rest of you and i imagine it feels odd and weak its all right it just needsвђow the jolt made his eyes water when she pressed down firmly on his shoulder hey watch it miss de sade im sorry still tender more gently she kneaded it youre all knotted up so would you be if youd had one arm strapped against you for the best part of two weeks youre right of course maybe some liniment she considered my mother would rub some on my father when he overdid and ive helped treat some of the horses that way i saw some witch hazel upstairs after dinner i can put some on your shoulder then youll get a good nights sleep he had a feeling having her rub himвђanywhereвђ wasnt going to insure quiet dreams but he figured it was a good tradeoff laboratory tests proved that the substance found inside the recovered skull was indeed human brain tissue in total during the three sixmonth field studies preserved brain tissue was found in ninetyfive of the recovered skulls twentyeight contained complete brains albeit shrunken to approximately a third of their normal size the find is completely unique with significant scientific impact and potential this will give scientists a neverbefore possible opportunity to study brain matter which is more than seven thousand years old with its hemispheres and convolutions intact the dna the basic human building block can be cloned from tissue older than any previously available cloned camillas fingers stopped you want to clone one of the tribe we can get into a debate on cloning later but no the purpose would be to studyвђdisease life expectancy physical and intellectual potential you can go back to your science fiction novel after were done theyve cloned sheep camilla muttered he gave her a mild look behind the lenses of his reading glasses thats not my field dna research isnt my area im just outlining the potential and import of the find we have intact human brains seven millenniums old people thought with them reacted with them developed language and motor skills they used those brains to build their village to hunt their food and prepare it they used these minds to interact to raise their children to find a mate and for survival what about their hearts what about them didnt their hearts tell them how to tend their childrenвђhow to make those children in the first place one doesnt happen without the other does it he took off the darkframed glasses and tossed them aside these people cared for their young and had interpersonal relationships but procreation is also an instinctвђone of the most basic without young there would be no one to care for the old no replacement for the dead thered be no tribe man mates for the same reason he eats he has to that certainly takes the romance out of it romance is an invention a tool likeвђ he picked up the scarred head of an old crudely fashioned hammer like this romance is a human need like companionship like music those are luxuries to survive we need food water shelter and to insure continued survival we need to procreate manвђbeing manвђcame up with tools and means to make meeting those needs easier and often more pleasant and being man he devised ways to make a profit from those needs to compete for them to steal for them even to kill for them she enjoyed him like thisвђenjoyed the casually lecturing mode when he discussed ideas with her as he might with a bright student or perhaps an associate that doesnt say much about man she commented on the contrary he touched the jaw of a old bleachedout skull it says man himself is a complex ingenious and constantly evolving invention he builds and destroys with nearly the same skill and enthusiasm and is constantly remaking himself so what have you made yourself she asked him he turned the hammer head over in his hand then set it down again hungry when are we going to eat she wasnt giving up on the discussion but she didnt mind taking the time to think about it while she finished fixing dinner she slid pasta into boiling water tossed the salad sprinkled herbs on oil for the thick slices of bread she poured wine lighted candles and looking at the cozy kitchen hearing the rain patter gently on the roof she realized she hadвђunwittinglyвђemployed a tool tonight the scene shed created was unquestionably a romantic one shed simply intended to make it attractive and comfortable instinct must have kicked in she decided maybe for a certain type of person particularly when that person was sexually attracted to anotherвђcreating romance was instinctive she found she liked knowing that about herself romanceвђto her thinkingвђwas warm and generous it took the other partys comfort and pleasure into account it was not she decided as she drained the pasta a damn hammer a hammer she declared to del when he stepped in implies force or a threat what a hammer she said again testily now romance is not a hammer okay he reached for a piece of bread and had his hand slapped aside for his trouble sit down first prove youve evolved into a civilized human being and dont say okay just because youre bored with the subject and want to stuff your face getting pretty strict around here he muttered im saying that your tribe demonstrated human emotions compassion loveвђhate certainly as you did find remains that showed evidence of violent injury or death emotions make us human dont they she demanded as she served the salad if it was only instinct that drove us we wouldnt have art music even science we wouldnt have progressed far enough that wed build a village near a pond create rituals to share and love enough that wed bury our child with her toys okay i mean okay he insisted when she narrowed her eyes he wanted the food in his belly and not dumped on his head its a good pointвђand you could do an interesting paper on it i imagine she blinked at him really the field isnt cutanddried it isnt only about facts and artifacts there has to be room for speculations for theory for wonder edge over into anthropology and youre dealing with cultures out of cultures you get traditions traditions stem from necessity superstition or some facet of emotion take our tribe mollified she offered him the basket of bread how do you know a man didnt woo a woman by bringing her wildflowers or a cup of fresh elderberries i dont but i dont know that he did either no evidence either way but dont you think there was a ritual of some sort isnt there always even with animals theres a mating dance oui so surely there had to be some courtship procedure sure he dipped the bread grinned at her sometimes it just meant picking up a really big rock and beating some other sap over the head with it loser gets the concussion winner gets the girl only because she either had no choice or more likely she understood that the man strong enough passionate enough to smash his rival over the head to win her would protect her and the children they made together from harm exactly pleased with the tidy logic of her mind he wagged a chunk of bread at her sexual urge to procreation procreation to survival in its own very primitive way thats romantic however the remains youve studied to date dont show a high enough percentage of violent injury to support the theory that head bashing was this tribes usual courtship ritual thats good admiring the way shed spun his example back to prove her point he gestured with his fork and youre right del do you think eventually there might be a way for me to visit the site he frowned thoughtfully now as she served the pasta why id like to see it firsthand well youve got six months what do you mean in six months if the articles and reports im putting together dont beat the right drum and shake out a couple million in grants the site closes closes you mean youd be finished with the dig finished he scooped up pasta not by a long shot but the state cantвђor wontвђallocate more funds bureaucrats he muttered not enough media attention after three seasons to keep them smiling for the cameras and handing over grants the universitys tapped out theres enough private money for another six months after that were shut down and thats it the idea of the site closing was so appalling she couldnt get her mind around it that cant be it if youre not done money talks sister and hed sunk all he could afford of his own into that dark peat then youll get more anyone who reads your work will want to keep the project going if not from the incredible archaeological significance of such amazingly rich findings then for the completely unique scientific opportunities i couldвђ she broke off she was an expert fundraiser people paid and dearly to see princess camilla at a charity function media attention that was never a problem more she had connections her thoughts went instantly to her godmother the former christine hamilton now the wife of a united states senator from texas both were avid supporters of arts and science you got an extra million or so weighing you down just pass it my way del reached for the wine bottle stretching his healing shoulder a little too far a little too fast and cursed she snapped back to the moment be careful you dont want to overtax yourself im afraid i dont have a million on me she smiled as she topped off his wineglass but i have ideas im very good with ideas ill think of something you do that she let it go and he forgot about it when dinner was finished he vanished it was a talent of his to disappear when dishes were involved camilla was forced to admire it she couldnt claim the washing up pleased her nearly so much as making the mess in the first place cooking was a kind of art washing dishes a mindless chore shed have been happy to pass along to someone else in the cabin however she was the someone else in any case she knew he wouldnt come near the back of the house until they were done it gave her the opportunity to call home she kept one eye and one ear on the doorway while the connection to virginia went through her youngest brother dorian answered and though normally shed have been delighted to chat to catch up on family news to just hear his voice she was pressed for time i really need to talk to mama you take off like a gypsy and now you cant give me the time of day when i get back ill bore your ears off with everything ive done i miss you dorian she laughed quietly i never thought id actually say that but i do i miss all of you but youre having a great time i can hear it in your voice i am so youre not pining away for the french guy she huffed out a breath dorian considered teasing a royal duty i take back that i miss you wheres mama ill get her but id better warn you shes got her hands full keeping dad from sending out a searchandrescue youre going to have to dance doubletime to smooth things out with him i know it im sorry but im not a child thats what mama said and he saidвђat the top of his lungsвђthat you were his child keep that in mind hang on she knew he might tease but dorian was good as gold hed find a way to get their mother on the line without letting her father know where would mama be now she wondered and brought the image of the big sprawling house in virginia into her mind in her sitting room perhaps no more likely out in the gardens enjoying the evening was it raining there too maybe she was entertaining but no dorian would have said so as the silence on the line grew lengthy camilla began to fret then she heard her mothers voice camilla im so glad you called we were just talking about you is daddy still very upset hesвђadjusting slowly im sorry mama i just had toвђ you dont have to explain to me i remember what its like we just want to know youre safe and happy im both i told you about the cabin about delaney his work is so important so interesting to me mamaвђ she reverted to french as english seemed too ordinary to explain her excitement in the project you sound like a scientist gabriella laughed i feel like a student one who cant learn enough fast enough tonight i learned something distressing she explained about the project deadline as quickly as possible thats difficult your professor must be very concerned id like to help i thought perhaps you could use your connections to find out what can be done how much is needed i was thinkingвђcould you contact aunt christine im good at raising money for causes but shes even better finally ive found something thats really interestingвђsomething mats personally important to me i just need an idea of the right wallets to open i can make some inquiries florida is it the bardville research project dr delaney caine give me a few days thanks thank you mama you will be discreet id just as soon he didnt know right now that her serene highness gabriella de cordina had taken an interest in his work its so nice just being camilla i dont want to take a chance on anyone making the connection not just yet dont worry the familys leaving for cordina in a few days camilla id hoped you might be ready to go with us another few weeks please ill contact you there and make arrangements to fly directly over when iвђwhen i leave here take care of my baby we love her she loves you too ill see you soon mama i have so much to tell you after she hung up camilla hummed as she set the kitchen to rights in so short a time she thought shed accomplished much of what shed set out to do she was content with herselfвђand that had been something missing the past several months shed done ordinary thingsвђtoo many of which had slipped away from her since adulthood and she realized much of that had been her own doing when shed been a child her parents had made certain she had a normal life or as normal as possible theyd done everything they could to keep her and her siblings out of the spotlight but there had been duties a gradual escalation of them as shed grown then the media had focused on her cordinas crown jewel theyd dubbed her and normality had begun to erode around the edges until the fabric of it was frayed it had been flattering at first exciting even amusing then mildly annoying after nearly a decade of constant attention of speculative and outright fabricated articles of being seen as a commodity never as a human being it had become smothering but now she could breathe again and she knew she would go back to her life stronger more capable and less vulnerable to the barrage shed found a passion and would now find a way to embrace it this was the balance shed seen and envied in her mother in her aunts duty was never shirked but each pursued a life full of interests and richness as a woman so could she so would she one day shed go on a dig and be part of a team that discovered that sought knowledge and celebrated it let the media come she thought as she prepared fresh coffee the attention while it lasted would only generate interest in the field and that meant funding it was unthinkable to allow their project to come to a premature end because of money and it was their project now she thought with a dreamy sigh hers and delaneys they shared it as they did the cabin with each bringing their own stamp their own mind their own talents to the whole it wasвђ marvelous her excitement and passion might even be responsible for sparking the imagination of a generation of young women bringing archaeology the study of past peoples cultures and customs into fashion she stopped laughing at herself never satisfied with little steps she thought she always wanted more she filled two mugs and carried them into the living area there he was sitting on the horrible little sofa his eyes intense behind his reading glasses papers scattered over his lap and across the sprung cushions what leaped inside her was a wild and wonderful mixture of lust and longing and she discovered with a slow warm sigh love why she was in love with him she thought with surprise wasnt thatвђfascinating somewhere during this complicated and problematic interlude shed slid headlong into love with a badtempered irritable roughmannered scientist who was more likely to snarl at her than smile he was rude demanding easily annoyed impatient and brilliant passionate reluctantly kind it was a captivating mix that made him uniquely himself she wouldnt change a single thing about him more she thought leaning against the wall to watch him he had one of the most essential traits she wanted in a friend and in a lover he had honor they were alone here yet hed never tried to take advantage of that in fact he rarely touched her even in the most casual way though he was attractedвђ she knew she wasnt wrong about thatвђhis personal code wouldnt allow him to exploit the situation her lips twitched in a smile that made him under it all a gentleman how he would hate to be termed so so she was in love with an illtempered gentleman who wouldnt allow himself to seduce his temporary assistant that meant it was going to be up to her to seduce him the idea only an interesting fantasy until now became more intriguing more exciting now her heart was engaged love she thought gave her a marvelous advantage youre going to have to deal with me now she decided and you dr delaney caine dont have a prayer she nearly went back to the kitchen to exchange the coffee for wine but she reasoned the caffeine would be moreвђ stimulating the plan of attack should be simple and subtle she walked to him held out the coffee which area has you snagged huh which area she repeated gesturing toward the scattered papers has you snagged i just need to think it through get this damn paperwork done i need to get back to the site he rolled his shoulder testing it into the lab she felt the quick hitch in her throat if he was starting to think about going back she couldnt afford to be subtle for long because when he went back she intended to go with him as his student his associate as his lover the work youre doing here is just as important just as essential though im sure its not as rewarding for you im not an administrator he said it as though it were something foul which made her smile youll soon be back in the field you just need a little more time to finish here and to heal he shifted experimenting by stretching his torso his ribs sang an hour on the dig would have him crawling like a baby he thought in disgust but the labвђ lets get some of this down he began and rose too quickly he had to grit his teeth as his body objected tell you what gently she took the coffee out of his hand ill give you that rubdown first it should help youre always more uncomfortable first thing in the morning and after a long day lets loosen you up again then if you still want to work tonight well work im fine youre not and if you dont take care of yourself youll just delay your recovery and your return to the dig keeping her voice brisk she started toward the stairs carrying both mugs come on well just consider it physical therapy he hurt and that irritated him he could take a pillвђwhich would end up putting him to sleep and wasting work hours he could put the damn sling back on which would irritate him more or he could give the lubricant a try all he had to do was handle her rubbing her hands over him and a man ought to have enough willpower to deal with that besides she had the coffee he had to follow her upstairs we can do it down here easier up here she called back smirking the sofas a torture board and too small in any case no point in being uncomfortable just sit down on your bed take your shirt off words he thought most men dreamed of hearing he wasnt going to think along those lines he reminded himself he was going to consider the entire experience a kind of therapeutic medicine chapter seven one made a quick detour into her own bedroom and dabbed on perfume undid another two buttons of her shirt if the man thought of romance as a tool she was going in fully equipped she gathered the witch hazel some fresh towels and some of the scented candles it was conniving she admitted but surely a woman in love was allowed some ploys just as she thought as she stepped into his bedroom and saw every available light blazing a wary man was allowed to try for some defense she found his safety precautions wonderfully sweet and easily foiled lets have a look she circled around the bed where he sat then instantly lost her calculation in her sympathy oh del you really did a job on yourself didnt you its better im sure butвђ the shoulder which had been hidden behind shirt or sling up till now was visibly swollen still the bruising was a sickly yellow and green pattern that matched the clouds that ran along his ribs she wanted more than anything else now to simply nurse him to ease his hurts i didnt think about the swelling she murmured gently touching his shoulder its nearly gone he moved his shoulder as much to test it as to dislodge her hand he wasnt he realized quite ready to have her touch him regardless we shouldve been icing this down recalling what had happened before when shed tried that particularly kind of medical attention had her pulse dancing she wanted to nurse him and soothe but that wasnt all she wanted for either of them well just relax and well see what we can do about making you moreвђcomfortable she turned away started to arrange and to light the candles whatre you doing with those the wariness in his voice had her lips curving havent you ever heard of aromatherapy just get as comfortable as you can and well start on the shoulder first you never told me how you were hurt i was stupid enough to let some idiot kid drive from the lab some people just cant handle a wet road he added with a bland stare he flipped the jeep flipped horror for him replaced any need to defend her own driving skills my god youre lucky you werent killed he walked away with a couple scratches del said bitterly hes lucky i didnt snap his neck like a twig this has put me on the dl over three weeks already she walked over to turn off lights dl no baseball in your world sister disabled list hed just think about baseballвђsports were goodвђ or work or world politics anything but the way she looked in candlelight howre you going to see if you turn off the lights i can see perfectly well you wont relax with lights shining in your eyes she wished he had a radio a stereo system something but theyd just have to cope without it she climbed onto the bed behind him knelt the give of the mattress had his stomach muscles fumbling into knotsвђand his body bracing as if for battle now dont be stoic she said tell me if i hurt you id say youre healing remarkably well if its only been three weeks and that youve carved through an impressive amount of work while youve been here she rubbed the lubricant in her hands to warm it then began to gently stroke it over the bruises i think we can all use a change of routine now and again to step away from what weve become steeped in so that we can have a clearer vision of the whole picture maybe it was true enough that since hed come back to the cabin hed been able to look at the project from angles hed missed or ignored when hed been in the middle of it such as the money problem dont tense up she murmured just close your eyes her fingers stroked gently kneaded let your mind drift did you play in the woods here as a boy sure baseball he was going to think about baseball how was he supposed to keep a box score in his head when she kept talking in that exotic sexy voice swim in the pond fish my mother likes to fish really because the image of her wearing one of her ugly hats stout boots ragged shirt and trousers with a pole in her hand made him smile he closed his eyes surely thinking of your mother was as good a way to control your glands as sports probably better she never could get me or my father into it bores both of us crazy im afraid i have the clichгd girl response to fishing camilla confessed fish are slimy and they wriggle i prefer them sautгed in a nice herbed butter you dont have brothers sisters no feel this knot here she discovered one at the base of his neck you carry too much worry thats why youre so irritable im not irritable no youve a sunny disposition candy sweet ow sorry oh the man had a back she thought with sheer delight broad and tanned with intriguing scars marring any hope of perfection a warriors back she thought strong and male she wanted badly to slide her lips down the length of it nibble her way along the ridges but it wasnt quite the time to abandon subtlety in any case she wanted to help wanted to ease his discomfort then jump him distractions she decided as much for herself as for him the book there the mystery novel ive read that author before but not that book is it good yeah its not bad you have a small selection of books here but its quite eclectic okay theyd talk literature he decided talking was fine books instead of baseball same thing novels can relax the mind or stimulate it at the moment he couldnt decide which she was doing to him her hands were like heaven soft and strong soothing and arousing his blood warmed despite his efforts to control it yet at the same time the aches and stiffness eased bit by bit the scent of candles the scent of her the sound of her voiceвђlow and soft as she spoke of booksвђrelaxed him until his mind as shed ordered began to drift he felt the bed give as she changed position then that smooth glide of her fingers her palm on the front of his shoulder her breast brushed against his back pressed cozily against him as she worked he wondered dreamily now how it would feel in his hand firm small smooth how it would taste in his mouth warm and sweet and essentially female her free hand moved to his other shoulder kneading until tension melted away the rain pattered quietly on the roof and the candlelight flickered warm and red against his closed lids lie down it was a murmur in his ear hmm her lips curved maybe he was a little too relaxed she thought she didnt want him nodding off on her the more she touched him the more she looked at him the more she wanted desire was a tightening ball in her belly lie down she repeated and resistedвђbarelyвђ the urge to nip at his earlobe shed never in her life craved the taste of flesh so much so i can reach his eyes blinked open his mind tried to focus lying down wasnt a good idea he started to say so but she was already nudging him back and it felt so good so damn good to ease down your ribs are still a mess arent they well get to them i suppose its lucky you didnt break any yeah it was my lucky day he started to tell her shed done enoughвђgod he was so stirred up he could barely keep two thoughts togetherвђbut when she leaned over him stretching out for the bottle shed set on the bedside table those pretty breasts blocked his vision and then even those thoughts scattered like ants it would have been worse she poured more lubricant into her palms her eyes on his as she rubbed it warm but youre in such good shape you have a strong healthy body she laid her palms on his bruised ribs she was counting on the healthy part how old are you delaney thirty no thirtyone how the hell was he supposed to remember when she was smiling down at him young strong healthy mmm she sighed and it wasnt all calculation as she carefully straddled him thats why youve made such a quick recovery he didnt feel recovered he felt weak and stupid tension of a much different sort was pumping through him she had her weight on her knees and was slowly rhythmically moving in a way that made him imagine her naked made him imagine himself inside her he curled his fingers into fists before he reached up and just grabbed that tight sexy bottom thats enough his voice was a croak a thin one god help him she just kept her eyes on his his had gone dark gone hot and his breath had quickened i havent finished she trailed fingers down to the waistband of his jeans up again and felt his stomach quiver theres a lot of you isnt there all hard andвђ tough he swore but he couldnt work any venom into it get off youre killing me am i she only shifted it was a very satisfying thing to hear the first time she set out deliberately to seduce a man ill just kiss it make it better her gaze was a gold gleam under her lashes as she lowered her head hesitated then slowly rubbed her lips over his chest she felt his heart kick like a stallion better she trailed her lips up his throat over his jaw then drew back inches only when she heard him bite off a moan this is nuts he managed to say how long do you expect me to keep my hands off you when youre climbing all over me who said i expect you to keep them off me she closed her teeth lightly over his chin who said i want you to i thinkвђ she brushed her lips teasingly at the corner of his mouth im making it very clear what i expect what i want youre making a mistake maybe she felt his hand grip her calf then run firmly up to her thigh and triumph lit her eyes so what he couldnt come up with an answer not when his system was screaming for her he slid his hand over her hip until he could mold that lovely bottom youre taking advantage of me i certainly am she brought her mouth a breath closer do you want me to stop now or do you wantвђ she nipped her teeth teasingly into his lower lip chewed gently released more either way it was probably going to kill him but if he was going to die hed damn well die happy all or nothing all then she agreed and closed her mouth over his the first flash of heat stole his breath it bolted through him a lightning strike of power and electricity hed have sworn he felt every circuit in his brain fry the hand on her dug in reflexively then clawed up to her back and fisted in her shirt impatient nearly desperate he yanked and the jolt of pain had him swearing no no let me just let me she all but crooned it running her lips over his face his throat bringing them back to his for a deep and drowning kiss im mad for your body his groan had nothing to do with pain as she ranged hot kisses over his chest down to his belly and back again her low humming sounds of approval seemed to vibrate from her and into him until he was trapped somewhere between pleasure and pain aching to touch her he worked his hands between their bodies to find her breasts breath unsteady she sat back shivered once then that slow female smile spread over her face watching him watching her she reached for the buttons of her shirt flipping them open one by one by one im in charge this time she told him and slowly peeled off the shirt youll just have to lie there and take it you got me up here for this didnt you she tilted her head reached behind to unclasp her bra yes so as the bra fell away and those lovely white breasts spilled out he let out a long breath so i appreciate it good touch me ive spent hours at night wanting you to touch me he skimmed his fingers over her saw her eyes cloud i wasnt going to let this happen i wasnt going to give you any choice oh mon dieu tes mains his hands his wonderful hands big and strong and rough with calluses she was rosepetal soft just as hed imagined he wanted to be gentle careful with her but he couldnt stop himself and when she leaned over bracing her weight on her arms to mate her mouth with his again his hands took more took greedily he shifted swore again as he fought against the protest of his ribs i needвђi wantвђ his weight on her his mouth on her and though his side throbbed at the move he managed to roll over wait youll hurt yourself shut up shut up shut up half mad for her he scraped his teeth over the curve of her shoulder breathed in her skin like a wolf scenting its mate and had them both moaning when his mouth roamed down to her breast so hot she thought as sensations battered her his mouth his skin so hot against hers as if they both raged with fever his heartbeat was a gallop and so was hers as they raced to take more of each other the weight of him was glorious sinking her into the thin mattress and making her think of swimming beneath thunderous clouds to want and be wanted like this for only herself made her giddy and strong and so very sure the thrill of it had her hands combing restlessly through his hair digging urgently into his back as his muscles bunched beneath them the bed creaked overhead the rain drummed incessantly on the roof candlelight danced in the damp breeze that whispered through the open window and denim strained against denim as she arched beneath him this time she quivered as he fought with the button of her jeans so soft so tasty and so ready he thought breathless as he fought her zipper down she was already moving against him those sexy little whimpers sounding in her throat his mind was full of her the scent the shape the flavor and he wanted more his fingers slid down over the thin barrier of cotton under it to the heat her whimpers became moans and moans became quick mindless gasps when she erupted beneath him he pressed his face to her belly and shuddered with her when his mouth roamed lower she gripped the bedspread and prepared for the next onslaught on her senses her mind was hazed her body a churning mass of needs and pleasures as sensations tumbled over and through her it was staggering to feel so much and still crave more he tugged the jeans over her hips greedy for the next flash of flesh and his bad shoulder gave out from under him she let out a yelp of surprise when he collapsed on her and while he cursed violently she began to laugh its all right its all right merde my heads spinning let me help let me do it just a damn minute i cant wait a minute still laughing she wriggled writhed and managed to drag herself free half naked and vibrating she shoved and pulled until he rolled on his back again his face was fierce with frustration and temper and only made her laugh harder when i get my breath back im going to whallop you yes yes im terrified she scooted around on the bed then had saliva pooling in his mouth as she wiggled out of the jeans temper he admitted as she slipped off her panties seemed a waste of time under the circumstances come back here i intend to but now she reached over unbuttoned his jeans lets just get these out of the way my hands are trembling she said with a half laugh holding them out its yours that have made them unsteady i love the way they feel on me she yanked and tugged pulling off jeans and shorts at the same time then her gaze roamed over him lingered oh my she drew in then let out a long breath well i did say there was a lot of you her eyes glinted with a combination of amusement and desire as she slid her body over his put your hands on me again del kiss me again bossy arent you but he cupped a hand at her nape and brought her mouth down to his she wallowed in the kiss and it went slow and soft and deep and when his hands moved over her she felt the kiss edge over to urgent tell me you want me she murmured say my name say my name and that you want me camilla her name echoed again and again in his head i want you she shifted rose over him and with her pulse pounding took him inside her the first jolt of awareness had her bowing back holding holding to absorb every drop of sensation until her system felt it might burst from the glory of it his hands slid up her closed over her breasts pressing her hands to his she began to move to rock to push them both toward madness she was beautiful he didnt know how to tell her slim and white with that bloom of rose under the milk of her skin her hair was like a sleek cap of goldshot fire and the candlelight flickered gold on gold in eyes blurred with pleasure he couldnt breathe without breathing her he watched unspeakably aroused as she crested to another peak and that long lovely body pressed against his sparking sensation after sensation he wanted his arms around her wanted to wrap them around her like chains but he was pinned by his own injuries and the relentless demands of her body he fought to cling to reason another minute then one more but his system screamed for the grand insanity of release and his body plunged toward it through it as her head fell back on a low cry of triumph a cat licking the last drop of a quart of cream from her whiskers could not have felt more selfsatisfied that was camillas thought as she basked in the afterglow of lovemaking everything about him she decided was completely delicious she wished she could stretch her body over his and just wallow but he was lying so still he might have been a dead man but for the regular sound of his breath she settled for slithering over to his good side and pressing a kiss on his shoulder did i hurt you he hurt literally everywhere his bruises were throbbing like a nest of demons dancing under his skin at the moment pain and gratification were so mixed he wasnt certain hed ever be able to tell the difference but he only grunted arching eyebrows she lifted herself on an elbow and stared down at his face she shouldve helped him shave again she mused though thered been something oddly erotic about having that stubble rub over her naked skin he opened his eyes what youre trying to be annoyed this happened it wont work later he decided hed think about if he were amused or uneasy that the woman read him so well why not im good at being annoyed yes you should get an award but youre going to want me again as soon as youve recovered so you wont be able to be annoyed about it defeats the purpose awfully damn sure of yourself arent you about some things she leaned down and kissed him about this well it so happens youre wrong smart mouth because she was frowning at him she didnt see the direction of his hand until it closed possessively over her breast i already want you again and i might never recover from round one i think you will but im sorry youre hurting i think ill go down and make you an ice pack i think you should settle down and be quiet for five minutes to help her out he pushed her elbow out from under her so her head bounced on his good shoulder you have a body like a rock she muttered dont try to get me going again sister im going to sleep for a half hour just let meвђ shh this time he solved the problem by wrapping an arm around her and clamping a hand over her mouth she narrowed her eyes considered biting before she could decide his fingers went lax his breathing evened out she saw to her astonishment that he was as good as his word he was in ten seconds flat sound asleep thirty minutes later shortly after shed drifted from consternation into sleep herself he woke her with a mindnumbing kiss she shot to the surface floundered there then was dragged under again later when she lay sprawled on the bed feeling dazed and used and gloriously ravished he rolled over onto his good side muttered something about blowing out the damn candles and went instantly back to sleep for a long time after camilla stared up at the ceiling grinning foolishly shed found another passion she realized and his name was delaney caine the man she was going to marry whether he liked it or not she was as always up before him in the morning routinely she brewed coffee then decided to take the first cup with her on a walk to the pond she felt del deserved to sleep in they would of course have to juggle their time between vermont digs virginia and cordina it was going to make for a full busy and she thought very rich life hed like her family and they him after they got to know each other she thought nibbling on her lip she didnt suppose hed care for the protocol and formality demanded by her duties to cordina as a princess and niece to the king but surely he could adjust there marriage was after all give and take naturally she was going to have to convince him he wanted to marry her first and before that shed have to convince him he was in love with her he had to be in love with her she couldnt have all this feeling inside her for someone who didnt return at least a part of it she wandered through the woods watching the early sun slant quivering rays through the boughs for now she reminded herself she would simply appreciate the moment this time with him and with herself without a past or future time to enjoy the discoveries the courtship and romance just because shed fallen in love quickly didnt obligate him to rush and it didnt mean she couldnt drift a bit and savor the sensation of being a woman in love when she reached the pond she sat on a stump shed have to see that they found a nice weathered old bench to put here she thought and maybe shed sink some containers of water lilies along the edge of the water small changes subtle ones she mused nothing major just as she didnt intend to try to change anything vital and elemental where del was concerned shed put her mark on the cabin hadnt she while respecting its basic personality and charm she would hardly afford the man less respect than she did his home no she liked him the way he was her lips curved as she lifted the coffee cup just exactly as he was when they were both more accustomed to this new stage of their relationship shed find a way to tell him about her birthright in another week she decided surely she was entitled to one more week shed have to find the right way to present things she could start with her father she mused casually mentioning that hed once been a cop and had gone into private security buying the land in virginia because hed wanted to farm how her paternal and maternal grandfathers had been friends that was why when her mother was in trouble her grandfather had reached out to the son of his old friend for help a bit confusing camilla supposed but it was a good start then she could say something likeвђoh did i mention my mothers from cordina that should hopefully open the door a bit wider with any luck del would comment or have some minor question so she could slide into a casual mention that her uncle her mothers brother was his royal highness alexander de cordina hed probably laugh at that say something like sure sister and youre the queen of the may she could laugh back treating it all very lightly no no just a mere princess on a short stolen holiday and that she decided would never work she cursed in frustration and in french and propped her chin on her fist you come all the way out here to swear at the ducks she yelped spilling coffee onto the back of her hand she sprang up and whirled to face del i like it better when you clumped around like an elephant and hed liked it better when he hadnt kept thinking how very beautiful she was hed woken reaching for her it seemed to him if the woman was going to slip into his bed the least she could do was stay there then hed panicked because she hadnt been in the house the thought of her gone had sent him out in a ribjarring run until hed calmed himself down now it was worse a hundred times worse because she wasnt gone she was standing there the sun and water at her back looking like something out of a storybook the light played over that sleek cap of hair like jewels in a crown her eyes were more gold than brown and seemed impossibly rich against the cool clear skin she had a half smile on her mouthвђthat long lovely mouth he wanted as hed wanted the night before to wrap his arms around her to hold her exactly as she was and that was crazy i didnt smell any breakfast because i havent started it yet i thought youd sleep awhile longer we said wed start early today so we did now she smiled fully i wasnt sure that still held after last night since he wasnt coming to her she stepped to him lifted a hand to brush at his hair how do you feel im okay listen about last nightвђ yes she rose on her toes touched her lips lightly to his and wound his stomach muscles into knots we didnt lay out any of theвђ look there are no strings here a little bubble of temper rose to her throat but she swallowed it did i try to tie any on you while you slept im not sayingвђ he hated being made to feel defensive i just want us to be clear since we didnt get into any of it last night we enjoy each other well keep it simple and when its over its done thats very clear it would be undignified to strike him and she didnt believe in resorting to physical violence particularly against the mentally deficient instead she smiled easily then theres nothing to worry about is there with her expression pleasant even patient she ran her hands up his chest lightly over his shoulders and into his hair and fixed her mouth on his in a long smoldering kiss she waited for his hand to fist in the back of her shirt then nimbly stepped away and left him vibrating ill fix omelets then well get to work her eyes sparked with temper and challenge as she started up the path and smiled in the friendliest of manners as she turned held out her hand baboon she thoughtвђwith some affectionвђas he took her hand to walk back to the cabin youre in for one hell of a fight chapter eight hey had a week of relative peace camilla decided peace would always be relative when delaney was involved his grumpiness was just one of the things about him shed come to count on in fact it was part of his charm she raided his books on archaeology though he muttered about her messing with his things she knew he was pleased she had a sincere interest in the field when she asked questions he answered themвђand in more and more detail it became routine for them to discuss what she had read even for him to suggest offhandedly another book or section she might want to study when he gave her a small acheulean hand ax from his collection she treasured the crude ancient tool more than diamonds it was more than a gift she thought much more than a token it was to her mind a symbol he hardly complained at all about driving her back into town to pick up her car and he took it for granted that whatever her plans had been before mobile or not she was staying awhile they were camilla thought making progress shed managed to peel a layer or two away as well she learned his father was english also oxford educated and had met his mother an american on a dig the senior dr caine had headed in montana so hed spent some of his childhood in england some in vermont and the bulk of it in trailers and tents on various sites all over the world the hand ax hed given her was from kent and one hed unearthed when hed been a boy it made the gift doubly precious to her he could read sanskrit and greek and had once been bitten by a coral snake the scar just beneath his left shoulder blade was from a knife wielded by a drunk in a bar in cairo however foolish it was camilla found all of this fabulously romantic she drove into town to mail off the first of his reports and correspondence their reports she corrected smugly shed contributed more than typing skills and hed managed to indicate just that with a few approving grunts when shed suggested a change or another angle of approach they made a good team when they made love it seemed there was nothing and no one in the world but the two of them past future were distant and irrelevant in that intense and eager present she knew by the way he looked at her when they joined the way his eyes would stay so vivid on hers that it was the same for him none of the men who had touched her life had brought this kind of impact to her heart her body her mind she hopedвђneeded to knowвђthat she brought the same to him no strings she thought with a quick snort typical if he wanted no strings why had he begun to take walks with her in the woods why did he answer patientlyвђwell patiently for himвђwhen she asked questions why did she sometimes catch him looking at her the way he did so intense and direct as if she were a puzzle he was trying to figure out and why did he at the oddest moments simply lean over and capture her mouth in a kiss that sizzled her brain the man was in love with her and that was that he was just too boneheaded to realize it or at least to admit it shed give him a little more time then shed tell him she was in love with him when he got used to the idea shed explain about the other part of her life it all seemed so reasonable as she ran her errands her mood was mellow when she strolled into the antique shop she would try sarah first regarding the watch she decided it was mortifying to be so low on cash and have del hand her money every time something was needed for the cabin besides if she could pay her way a bit more she could fairly demand that he pull more weight on domestic chores it was time he washed a few dishes good morning she beamed a smile at sarah as she wound her way through the antiques sarah turned over the magazine shed been paging through good morning ahвђmiss breen i noticed you have a selection of secondhand jewelry and watches yes sarah answered cautiously as she studied camillas face i wonder if youd be interested in this camilla took off her watch held it out its lovely umвђ hesitantly sarah turned the watch over she ran her fingers over the smooth gold watched the tiny diamonds wink its not the sort of thing we usuallyвђ she trailed off then simply stared at camilla its all right i thought id see if you might be interested in buying it ill try the jeweler you are her sarah barely breathed it her eyes wide and dazzled there was a hard clutching in camillas throat but her face remained perfectly calm i beg your pardon i thoughtвђwhen you were in the other dayвђi knew you looked like somebody everyone looks like someone with a steady hand camilla reached for her watch thank you anyway princess camilla sarah pressed her fingertips to her lips i cant believe it princess camilla in my shop youre right here and and here triumphantly now she flipped the magazine over and there camilla saw with a sinking heart was her own face being touted as one of the most beautiful in the world you cut your hair all that fabulous hair yes well resigned camilla sighed it was time for a change you look wonderful even better thanвђ catching herself sarah paled oh excuse me um your highness she dipped in a quick curtsy that had her blond tail of hair bouncing dont please struggling to smile camilla glanced toward the door and prayed no other customers would come in im traveling very quietly at the moment id really prefer keeping it that way i taped that documentary on the royal family after you were in last week i kept thinking and thinking and then it hit me i watched it again but i thought i had to be wrong cordinas crown jewel doesnt just drop in to my store for old bottles but here you are yes here i am sarahвђ that del overwhelmed sarah babbled on i know you have to pry news out of him with a crowbar but this is taking it too far hes got royalty staying at his cabin and he doesnt say a word he doesnt know and id prefer to keep things that way as well at least untilвђ oh sarah having a princess in her shop was one thing having one who looked so miserably distressed was another golly biting her lip sarah hurried around the counter but stopped short of taking camillas arm she didnt think it was done would you like something to drink your highness yes yes thank you i would ive got jeez im so flustered i have some iced tea in my office thats very kind of you its nothing just let me boyвђv put the closed sign on she hurried to the door and back again then wrung her hands and couldnt stop herself from doing another curtsy behind the counter its not much id love something cool she followed sarah into the little office and took a seat on a swivel chair while sarah fumbled with the door of a small refrigerator please dont be nervous im no different than i was the first time i came in i beg your pardon your highness but you are of course you are you neednt address me by my title camilla said wearily madam or maam is sufficient and in this case id prefer you just use my name i dont think i can you see ive read about you and your family since i was a kid were almost the same age and i used to imagine myself living in a palace wearing all those beautiful clothes being a princess i guess most little girls do she turned back to camilla eyes shining is it wonderful it can be sarah i have a great favor to ask you anything anything at all would you not tell anyone sarah blinked anyone at all just for a little while please sarah it can be wonderful being a princess but there were times you see when i was a little girl that i dreamed of being just that just an ordinary girl i want time now to live that dream really it sounded beautifully romantic i guess we always want what we dont have she handed camilla a glass of iced tea i wont tell anyone itll kill me she admitted with a wry laugh but i wont could you would you mind ah madam signing my magazine id be happy to thank you very much youre nicer than i thought youd be i always imagined princesses would be well snobby oh we can be camilla smiled sipped depending maybe but excuse me but you seem soвђnormal the smile warmed as did her eyes thats the nicest thing you could say to me classier of course i noticed that right off too butвђ sarahs eyes popped wide again del doesnt know guilt circled nibbled at the back of her neck it hasnt come up its just like him oblivious sarah threw up her hands the mans oblivious when we were dating i think he forgot my name half the time and forget noticing the color of my eyes used to make me so mad then hed smile at me or say something to make me laugh and i wouldnt mind so much i know what you mean hes so smart about some things and so lame about others she picked up her own glass then nearly bobbled it when she caught the dreamy expression on camillas face holy cow are you in love with him yes i am and i need a little more time to convince him he likes the idea it was just like a movie sarah thought thats nice really nice and its perfect really when you think about it it is for me camilla admitted then rose im in your debt sarah and i wont forget it when she held out a hand sarah quickly wiped her own on her slacks before taking it im glad to help ill come in and see you again before i leave camilla promised as she started back into the shop when she picked up her watch from the counter sarah bit her lip again your highness maam do you really want to sell that watch yes actually im embarrassingly short of liquid funds just now i cant give you what its worth not even close but i couldвђi could lend you five hundred and well you could have the inkwell you liked so much camilla looked over at her the woman she thought was nervous intimidated and confused but it didnt stop her from wanting to help another gift camilla thought she would treasure when i started out on this quest of mine i wanted to discoverвђ to find parts of myself as well as seeвђ im not sure what nowвђmaybe just things from a different perspective its such a wonderful bonus to have found a friend take the watch well consider it a trade between friends del walked out on the front porch and stared at the rutted lane again how long did it take to run a few errands that was the trouble with women they turned a couple errands into some sort of pilgrimage he wanted his lunch and a fresh pot of coffee and to answer the halfdozen emails that had come through his laptop that morning all of which he was forced to admit he could handle for himself had always handled for himself what he wanted damn it was her his life he thought jamming his hands into his pockets was completely screwed shed messed everything up scattered his focus ruined his routine he shouldve left her stranded in the rain that night then everything would be the way it had been before he wouldnt have some woman cluttering up his space cluttering up his mind who the hell was she there were secrets tucked inside that sharp complicated brain of hers if she was in trouble why didnt she just tell him so he could deal with it he needed for her to tell him to confide in him to depend on him to help her and when the hell had he started seeing himself as some knight on a white charger it was ridiculous totally out of character but he wanted to fix whatever was wrong more he realized much more he needed her to trust him enough to tell him trust him enough to fix it because hed tripped over his own unspoken rule and fallen flat on his face in love with her and he didnt much care for the way it felt he mused rubbing a hand over his heart it was a lot more uncomfortable than a few bruised ribs and he feared a lot more permanent hed had to go and say no strings hadnt he of course shed had no problem with that he thought now bitterly that was just fine and dandy with her well if he was going to have to adjust then so was she besides no strings didnt mean no faith did it if she didnt believe in him enough to even tell him her full name where were they he paced into the house then back out again maybe he should go check on her shed been gone nearly two hours shed already had one accident which meant she could easily have another she might be sprawled over the wheel of her car bleeding orвђ just as he was working himself into a fine state of agitation he heard the sound of her engine disgusted with himself he slipped back into the house before she could catch him keeping an eye out for her he circled the living room twice then paused and considered adjustments romance that was something she appeared to believe was vital in any culture cultures were made up of relationships rituals and romance maybe he should try a small foray into that and see where it got him he strolled into the kitchen as she set a bag of groceries on the table i have your receipts for the overnight mail i sent she told him good since he wanted to anyway he brushed a hand over her hair she gave him an absent smile and turned away to put a quart of milk in the refrigerator there were some letters in your post office box frowning she rubbed at her temple where a tension headache nagged i must have left them in the car no problem he leaned down to sniff the side of her neck you smell great i what oh she patted his shoulder reached for the bag of new potatoes shed bought for dinner thank you determined to make an impression he dug a little deeper what was it women alwaysвђah have you lost weight he asked feeling truly inspired i doubt it probably gained a couple if anything she took coffee out of the cupboard and prepared to brew a fresh pot behind her back del narrowed his eyes since words werent getting him anywhere hed move straight to deeds he scooped her off her feet and started out of the kitchen what are you doing taking you to bed well really you might askвђand i havent finished putting the groceries away del paused at the bottom of the steps and stopped her mouth with his in certain cultures he said when he eased back women indicate their desire for intimacy by stocking the pantry im merely picking up on traditional signals amusement nudged at the gnawing worry inside her what cultures she demanded as he continued up the steps mine its a new tradition thats so cute she nuzzled at the side of his throat i think you missed me missed you did you go somewhere when she huffed out a breath he tossed her on the bed when she bounced he rolled his shoulder got a twinge from hauling you up maybe you have gained a couple pounds she shoved herself up on her elbows oh really thats okay well work it off and he dived on her her first reaction was laughter playfulness wasnt his usual style and it caught her off guard as he rolled her over the bed she forgot to be worried youre heavy she shoved at him and you havent shaved you have your boots on my clean linens nag nag nag he said and dragging her hands over her head took her mouth with his he felt her pulse jump then race and her hands go limp in his her body gloriously pliant he skimmed his lips over her jaw you were saying shut up and kiss me he cuffed her wrists with one hand used the other to unbutton her shirt so are you indicating your desire for intimacy he trailed a fingertip down the center of her body toyed with the hook of her slacks as he watched her face just want to get my signals straight her breath was already backing up in her lungs your pantrys been stocked since i got here hasnt it thats a good point he lowered the zipper brushing his knuckles over the exposed skin had the hots for me all along havent you if youre going to be arrogantвђ maybe you were hoping id come into your room one night he continued and traced the dip between her center and her thigh and do this i neverвђ her hips arched her breath hissed out as he cupped her lord del let me show you what i thought about doing keeping her hands pinned he touched her unerringly shooting her up into an intense climax muffling her shocked cry with his mouth as her body bucked when her breath sobbed he closed his teeth over her breast torturing the sensitized point through the cotton of her bra he nudged the straps down nibbled his way over the slope of her shoulders almost delicately while his hand roamed exploited and plundered she went wet and wild beneath him unable to find her balance she shuddered then spiked then floated down again only to have him fling her ruthlessly over the edge one more time her hands strained against his grip and the helplessness added a layer of panicked excitement over shattered senses her body was molten and she trembled from the heat that slathered her skin and burned in the blood still she arched to him desperate for more she heard his voice the words thick and soft ill owe you for this he said and snapped the bra in two with one rough tug then his mouth his teeth his tongue found flesh the moan wrenched from her gut as her system erupted let me go let go of my hands i need to touch you not yet not yet it would end too soon if she touched him now he hadnt known he could arouse himself to a frenzy just by arousing her he wanted her weak and wrecked and wailing and he wanted to take take take when he felt her go fluid beneath him when he felt release pour through her and leave her lax it still wasnt enough he tore the panties away feeling a dark satisfaction at hearing the delicate fabric rip then he drove her back to madness with his mouth finally when she thought there could be no more he filled her her hands slipped off his damp shoulders her mouth lifted urgently to his and she wrapped herself around him like a vine mon amour mon coeur she murmured mindlessly as they tumbled over the brink toujours mon amour they slept sprawled over each other like exhausted children and when they woke steamed the walls in his narrow shower as they took each other again under the hot spray realizing he was taking an unprecedented stepвђa day offвђcamilla packed a picnic and cajoled him into sharing a very late lunch by the pond she didnt have to do much cajoling picnics he thought were romantic and romance was the current name of the game she looked happy he mused relaxed her face glowed her eyes were soft if hed been an artist hed have painted her now and titled it camilla content he didnt feel foolishвђor not veryвђtelling her so thats just what i am i love this place she stretched out on the bank stared up at the powderpuff clouds its so quiet it seems as though theres no one else in the world she turned her head to smile at him perfect for a hermit im not a hermit he polished off the last of the fancy triangular shaped sandwiches shed put together i just dont like people around i like people she rolled onto her stomach theyre often so much kinder than you expect she added thinking of sarah but sometimes if you dont have a place to be aloneвђor to be quietвђyou forget that and only see the demands the responsibilities the obligations people mete out if you dont have a place to be alone you dont get anything done you have such purpose your own purpose thats a gift not everyone does her eyes clouded some of us fumble around looking for one and end up with so many we realize all at once we havent got any at all you dont strike me as a fumbler hmm sometimes efficiency is just as much of a flaw without that quiet time you stop seeing the flaws and the virtues you can forget not just who you are but who you want to be she smiled up at him then turned over again to rest her head on his lap so i like this spot because its helped me remember and who are you camilla she understood he wanted an answerвђa real one but she found she couldnt speak and irrevocably change this moment so she evaded a woman who wont forget again she picked up a plum took a bite then held it up to him i like being alone with you delaney and she would give them the rest of the lovely lazy day before camilla de cordina joined them he wanted to be patient but patience wasnt his best skill hed thought been sure shed been ready to confide in him what did a man have to do to pry that woman open he wondered most people spilled their guts at the least provocation but she just made vague philosophical statements an occasional wistful one and clammed up it was grating but he was going to have to press to do that he was going to have to make it clear that they wereвђthat he wasвђ hed never in his life told a woman he loved her hed gotten through his entire adult life without it being an issue much less a problem now it was both he could march into the kitchen and blurt it out and be done with it he equated it to ripping off a bandage in one painful jerk or he could ease them both into it stage by stageвђlike lowering yourself into a cold pool inch by inch so your body adjusted to the shock i like having you around he could say maybe you should just plan on staying he could let that settle awhile then move up to the icareaboutyou level shed have something to say about that she always had something to say who would have believed hed like listening to her so much but in any case he thought drawing himself back to the point when theyd finished hashing through all that he could just finish it off i love you he winced at his own muttered voice shot a look toward the kitchen it didnt even sound like him he decided the words didnt seem to fit his mouth i love you he tried again and exhaled easier that time now tell me what kind of trouble youre in ill take care of it and well move on simple he decided direct and supportive women liked supportive god he was going to need a good shot of whiskey to get through it i know its late cocking the receiver on her shoulder camilla looked down at her wrist before she remembered her watch was gone a quick glance at the kitchen clock had her calculating that it was after one in the morning in cordina no wonder shed woken marian no problem i was only sleeping im sorry really i just had to tell someone okay let me pull myself together are you coming home soon i promise you missed the first fitting for your ball gown your dressmaker is seriously displeased ball gown she drew a blank before it clicked in oh the autumn ball theres plenty of time marian im in love you say that now but if youd heard the woman gnashing her teeth youdвђwhat what im in love its wonderful its terrifying its the most incredible thing thats ever happened to me hes perfect oh hes the most irritating man half the time but i like that and hes so smart and so funnyвђ and very committed to his work camilla and hes very attractive i know thats just surface but isnt it nice to fall in love with the inner man and have the outer man be gorgeous camilla hes in love with me too hes coming around to that though it might take just a little while longer toвђ camilla yes who is he oh hes the man ive been working for here delaney caine the archaeologist you fell for indiana jones im serious marian well does he at least look like indiana jones no hmm actually perhaps a little but thats not the point this isnt a game or a movie its my life and this is something i want something that feels very right i can hear that cam im so happy for you when will i meet him i dont know exactly gnawing over the question she wrapped the phone cord around her fingers thats part of the problem after i explain things then i hope we can make arrangements for him to meet the family explain things there was a long pause you mean you havent told him who you are not yet i didnt expect this to happen did i i couldnt anticipate it and then i wantedвђ she trailed off warily as she heard del heading into the kitchen camilla how could you let things go so far and not tell him if the mans in love with youвђ i dont know that she murmured in french not for certain i didnt intend for it to be complicated she cleared her throat as del took the whiskey bottle from the pantry it wasnt possible to ask him to hurry or to cut marian off so she continued the conversation in french keeping her voice as mild as she could manage marian i had a right to my privacy i could hardly stay here if id announced i was a member of the royal family the whole point of this was not to be camilla de cordina for a few weeks the point seems to have changed yes i know that but id hardly be staying here if people knew who i was the cabin would be surrounded by the media and that if you recall was what sent me off in the first place if you think the man would call reportersвђ no no of course i dont think that and i didnt call to argue with you marian i did what i had to do what i thought best for me as to the rest she slanted a look toward del as he poured whiskey into a glass ill deal with it im your friend camilla i love you i just dont want to see you hurt or disappointed or exploited i dont intend to be tell the family ill be home soon and your dressmaker camilla sighed inform madam monique that her highness will not disgrace her at the autumn ball go back to sleep marian she hung up opened the refrigerator for a cold drink while del stood swirling his whiskey in the glass i hope you dont mind me using the phone no i dont mind i reversed the charges good id probably have gotten a jolt if id noticed a call to cordina on my phone bill next month yes i imagine so iвђ she trailed off and the hand that had lifted for a glass fell to her side again je parle francais aussi del lifted the whiskey to his lips as she turned to face him your highness chapter nine he knew her color faded she could feel it drain and leave her face cold and stiff just as she could feel her heart leap into her throat and fill it with pounding because of it she instinctively straightened her spine i see you didnt mention it mustve slipped my mind he said evenly like being a member of the royal family of cordina slipped yours just one of those stray details my lineage never slips my mind it isnt allowed to delaneyвђ so whats all this he gestured with the glass your little version of the princess and the pauper taking a few weeks slumming with the hoi polloi you know better you cant think that lets see what should i think he lifted the whiskey again splashed more in the glass he couldnt precisely pinpoint why he wanted to heave the bottle against the wall or more why he resisted what are you hiding out from a lover one a little too anxious to get his hands on the crown jewels thats unfair i have no lover but you not for the past couple of weeks anyway you shouldve told me i was having sex with a princess it mightve added a nice flair her lips wanted to tremble so she firmed them into a hard line and thats unkind you want fair you want kind his voice changed from dangerously soft to viciously sharp youve got the wrong guy sister somebody plays me for a fool i get pissed i didnt play you i never intended toвђ to what cut the crap camilla you dont do anything you dont intend you came in here because you wanted to play pretend for a while and amuse yourself with the locals while you were at it thats not true her temper started to build to match his and it insults both of us youre insulted he slammed the glass down before he did throw it you come into my place and pretend to be someone youre not you lie about who you are about what you are virginia farm girl my ass my father has a farm in virginia she shouted back because she was too frightened to do otherwise ive lived there half the year all of my life and the other half in the palace well i guess the tiara suits you better than a straw hat yes no struggling through the anger and panic she dragged a hand through her hair we have a farm in cordina my motherвђ your french mother he said coolly you said france i said europe but it was weak and she knew it delaney im exactly the same person i was ten minutes ago i only wanted the privacy ofвђ privacy give me a break you slept with me you made damn certain youd sleep with me what looking for a change of pace from the purebreds you get points for nailing stray americans on your little adventure her color came up now flaming into her cheek how dare you youre crude and vile and its despicable to turn something lovely into something cheap i wont have this discussion nor explain myself to you while youre in this impossible mood move aside you dont give commands here princess he grabbed her arm before she could stalk by him you used me no tears wanted to brim wanted to fall not the way you mean del i only wanted a place to be i only wanted some time you got a hell of a lot more didnt you playtimes over your highness youre going to do more than explain yourself let me go she drew on all of her composure and command and eyed him coldly i have nothing more to say to you now let me go oh i will all the way i guess weve said all there is you can pack your bags and run away since that seems to be your pattern the temper and shame that warred within her were no match for the grief you want me to go you got what you came for didnt you ill make it easy for you and get the hell out of your way her breath hitched as he started for the door del please dont i love you the pain stabbed through him the words snarled out of him as he tossed them at her though they were pure truth youre breaking my heart sister he said try that line on someone whos stupid enough to believe it and get the hell away from me he left and slammed the door behind him he tromped through the forest for an hour thinking vicious thoughts and cursing all women he stalked the woods another hour as the flames of his temper banked to a smoldering rage in love with him what a crock she had a lot of nerve pulling that routine on him shed been about to pour on the tears too hed seen that coming thank god hed gotten out of there before the floods hit he just couldnt stand weeping females well shed pulled every other trick out of her hat excuse me he thought bitterly make that crown why not tears and for what so she could have a couple weeks to indulge herself cinderella in the wilderness he stopped rubbing at the ache in his gut as he stared out over the pond love this place he could hear her saying it see the easy pleasure in her face as she lay on the grass beside him so she had an appreciation of nature big deal havent you ever needed to just breathe he remembered her saying that too that first day standing beside him with all that tension in her face in her voice as if shed been standing on the edge of something and fighting to hold her ground instead of leaping over okay so maybe she had some problems who didnt but that didnt excuse what shed done it had all been a pretense right from the beginning and shed let him fall in love with herвђlet him fall into that cage without warning him it had a trap door to nowhere she had to pay for that he turned headed back toward the cabin okay hed let her explainвђnot that he was buying any of it thenвђ then hed figure out what the hell to do next with his head down and his hands in his pockets he didnt notice her car was gone until he was nearly at the back door for nearly a full minute he stared blankly at the spot where it had last been parked then he was bolting into the cabin charging up the stairs her clothes were gone he flung open both closets as if she might have put them back in the spare room just to make him sweat shed even taken the pots and tubes from the medicine cabinet on a tearing fury he searched the cabin for a note but there was nothing he couldnt say shed gone without a trace shed left the candles the little bottles springing with wildflowers her scent everywhere was already haunting him so shed pulled up stakes he thought just because hed yelled at her and told her she could pack and run away if the woman couldnt stand up to a fightвђ no better this way he reminded himself no point in dragging it out she was heading back to where she belonged to where shed been headed all along and he could get back to work without having her distract him every five minutes he prowled over to his notes picked up one at random after tossing it down again he dropped onto the couch to brood shed come back he talked himself into that particularly when he got just a little drunk she was just off in a snit that was all women had snits didnt they his two hours stomping through the woods was a natural expression of justifiable aggravation he didnt go off in snits in the morning suffering from a surprisingly nasty hangover he convinced himself he didnt want her to come back he liked his life the way it had been before shed plunged into it and he didnt like not one damn bit this sensation of loss and misery which was no question about it completely her fault by the second day he was edgy and busily working himself into a temper again she had absolutely no business running off before hed finished yelling at her but it was just like her wasnt it to stick that chin out shoot that nose in the air and flounce off he shouldve recognized it as princess behavior from the getgo when she cooled off and came back he had a great deal to say to her why the hell hadnt she come back didnt matter to him he reminded himself and struggled to concentrate on his work he had plenty to do to keep himself occupied while she was off sulking in fact maybe hed just pack up and take himself back to the dig it was where he belonged anyway and it gave him a hard rude jolt to realize hed planned to take her with him hed wanted to show her the place to watch that interest and intellect shine in her eyes when she got her first look at his pet project hed wanted to share that with herвђand that was terrifying hed wanted to share everything with her he couldnt believe how much that hurt just as he sat unsteady in the knowledge that she really wasnt coming back he heard a car coming down the lane he knew it he sprang up fueled with relief pleasure fury and had reached the door in one leap before he stopped himself this was not the way to handle it he decided or her hed wander out casually then hed let her apologize feeling smug and generous he stepped outside everything inside him sank when he saw it wasnt camilla climbing out of the car it was his parents surprise alice caine ran toward the porch in her ancient and sturdy boots her hair a streaky mess of mousebrown and gray was as always falling untidily from beneath a scarred bush hat she was trim as a girl with a face splattered with freckles and lined from a life in the sun she leaped on her son gave him a slurpy smacking kiss on the cheek then immediately turned to her husband niles let the boy get the bags whats the point in having a big strong son if you cant use him as slave labor hows the shoulder del she asked him and the rest of it fine its fine i wasnt expecting you if you had been it wouldnt be a surprise she tipped down her dark wirerim glasses though she grinned she was sharp enough to have seen her sons shocked disappointment when hed stepped out on the sagging porch got some coffee sure sure ashamed of himself he bent downвђshe was such a little thingвђand gave her a quick hug drove three hundred fifteen miles today mumbling in his public school english accent niles caine finished noting the mileage in his tattered book as he crossed to his son made good time he was a big man tall and dashingly handsome at sixtyseven his hair a mop of it had gone shining silver and his eyes green as his sons were jewel sharp in his tanned face he tucked the book into the pocket of his faded shirt then gave del a crushing bear hug hows the shoulder fine better whats up with your dig oh were just taking a break clear the mind alice said it airily one warning look at her husband as she strode into the house she stopped dead fisted her hands on her narrow hips del youve got a woman what look at this flowers she arched her brow at the wildflowers tucked into bottles scents she added sniffing a bowl of potpourri clean she ran a fingertip over a tabletop definitely a female on the premises where is she shes not here ah alice thought poor baby niles my hero would you run into town and get me some ice cream run into town he stared at her ive just got here i havent so much as sat down yet you can sit down in the car on the drive to town woman if you wanted ice cream why didnt you say so when we were still in the bloody car i didnt want any then something with chocolate she rose on her toes to kiss his scowling mouth ive such a yen for chocolate flighty fluttering females he muttered and stomped back out to the car alice simply walked to the couch sat and propped her boots on the table smiling she patted the cushion beside her sit coffee can wait tell me about the woman theres nothing to tell she was here she was a constant annoyance now shes gone cranky wounded bear she thought indulgently just like his father sit her voice firmedвђshe knew how to handle her men why did she leave you she didnt leave me his pride pricked he dropped onto the couch she was just working for me temporarily very temporarily he muttered and at his mothers long patient silence he cracked i kicked her out if shes too stubborn to come backвђi dont need her underfoot anyway there now she patted his head tell mommy all about the horrible girl cut it out but his lips twitched was she ugly no stupid then he sighed no a cheap floozy now he laughed mom thats it then she slapped a hand on his thigh a cheap floozy taking advantage of my poor sweetnatured naive little boy why ill fix her wagon whats her name ill hunt her down like a dog shes fairly easy to find he murmured her names camilla her royal highness camilla de cordina i could strangle her alice tossed her sunglasses and her hat on the table tell me she said so he did she listened while he worked himself back and forth through temper into misery and back into temper again so often she noted he had to leap up to pace the room just to keep up with himself his description of camillaвђexcept for the irritating interfering nuisance portionвђjibed with the lovely note shed received some days before from her serene highness gabriella a graciousвђand cleverвђnote alice mused one that acknowledged gabriellas gratitude to delaney for his hospitality to her daughter alice hadnt been sure if having anyone consider her son hospitable was more of a surprise than learning he was being so with a member of cordinas royal family but she was a woman accustomed to thinking on her feet and adjusting in midstride when necessary the contents of the note had caused alice to drag her husband from the arizona dig and head home to see for herself just what was what now that shed seen she had a very good idea just what was what what came through in huge neon letters to her mothers view was that her son was completely pitifully in love and it was about damn time so she left del finished thats for the best all around probably so alice agreed calmly it was shortsighted of her to deceive you certainly she shouldve felt comfortableвђfrankly even obligedвђto be forthcoming with you after you told her your own lineage huh obviously a viscount is lower in rankвђconsiderablyвђfrom a princess but she shouldve had the courtesy to trust you as you trusted her delighted by her sons blank face alice crossed her booted feet at the ankle you did tell her your father is earl of brigstonвђand you are viscount brigston it didnt come up delaney said then added with more heat why would i as his mother simply watched him coolly who remembers anyway i never use it unless it suits you alice thought but it was enough she decided that shed planted that little seed theres your father back with the ice cream lets have some with our coffee she gave her son a day partly because she simply enjoyed him and partly because she knew he had to chew on things she debated how shed tell him shed been in communication with camillas mother he might get his back up all over again she mused as she cast her line into the pond it would be so like him at her husbands grunt she turned to where he sat papers scattered over his lap and the ground pay attention niles hmm what damn it alice im working your sons work just leave him alone a man should handle his own affairs without any interference hah so you said to me thirtythree years ago this coming winter look where it got you got me you didnt it she grinned out over the water two peas in a pod she decided her men were two very stubborn peas before she could decide how best to handle things the matter was taken out of her hands del swooped through the woods making enough racket to scare away every fish for ten miles and scooped her right off her feet weve got new funding good thing because were not getting any fish for dinner still she hugged him thats wonderful del who i dont have the detailsвђjust got the call from the university ive got to get back to the dig sorry to run out on you like this dont be she tucked her tongue in her cheek she saw how it would work now perfectly give us a call once youre settled will have to pack that evening while her son wasвђvery likelyвђ steaming over the idea that his funding was being generated by the interest and influence of a young princess alice sat and composed a tidy and formal note to her serene highness gabriella de cordina the earl and countess of brigston along with their son lord delaney viscount of brigston were very pleased to accept her gracious invitation to the autumn ball in cordina its insulting camilla waved the latest communication from del rude and insulting and just like him gabriella sat calmly fixing simple pearls at her ears guests who had been invited to stay at the palace for a time before and after the ball would be arriving shortly it sounded perfectly polite and informative to me darling and she found it very telling that in the month shed been back in cordina her daughter had lost none of the heat where delaney caine was concerned thats because you dont know him camilla raged on insufferable is what it is reporting to me as if i were some sort of accountant dollars and cents thats all he doesnt tell me anything about the findsвђthe things hed know id want to know and see how he signs them dr delaney caine as if we were strangers hes detestable so youve said gabriella turned on the chair of her dressing table her hair was swept back from a face her husband told her grew more lovely with each year she didnt believe him but it was nice to hear her eyes the same tawny gold as her daughters were quietly sober and showed none of the humor and anticipation she felt im sure hes grateful for your help in funding the project camilla you parted on such bad terms he probably feels awkward as well he should feel awkward he should feel sorry and small she whirled around her mothers lovely room stared out the window at the stunning view of the gardens the bright blue sea beyond i didnt get the funding for him in any case i got it for the project the works the priority its an important find and it deserves to be completed and her daughters interest in the work hadnt waned in the weeks since shed been back if anything gabriella reflected it had increased shed spent hours with books had gone to the university to speak to professors who were knowledgeable had raided their library for more books and documents on archaeology shed neglected none of her duties it simply wasnt in camillas makeup to do so there were times gabriella wished she were less dedicated even though shed been worried shed been pleased when camilla had taken those weeks for herself her own heart had hurt when her little girl had come home with hers broken she was grateful their relationship was such that camilla had confided in her about falling in loveвђand becoming delaneys lover it helped a woman gabriella knew to talk to a woman and now though she knew her daughter suffered part of her rejoiced that camillas heart was constant she was still very much in love her mother with a little help intended to see she got what she wanted even if it meant a littleвђvery little she assured herselfвђfinagling she rose crossing to her daughter to lay her hands on her shoulders a kiss on the back of her head love isnt always polite he doesnt love me camilla hurt still sharply mama he looked at me with such contempt turned me out of his life with less compassion than you would a stray dog and should answer for it gabriella thought fiercely she was counting on her daughter to see that he did you werent honest with him i was trying to be honest with myself if i was wrong there still shouldve been room forвђ it doesnt matter she straightened her shoulders i have my interests and duties and he has his i wish this ball were over and done when it is youll go on your first dig itll be exciting for you my minds full of it ruthlessly she folded dels formal letter set it aside as she would she promised herself set thoughts of him aside imagine me studying artifacts from the lower paleolithic in france dr lesuer has been so generous so forthcoming ill enjoy working with his team and learning from him but now im behind schedule sarah lattimer will be here in a couple hours i believe i told you about sarahвђthe

entertaining them in the gold parlor on arrival yes i remember she glanced at her watch i dont suppose you could have adrienne fill in for me your sisters in the nursery with young armand and the baby i wont keep you above fifteen minutes gabriella promised ill be there ill just adjust a few things in my schedule she started out came back and picked up dels letter i need to have this filed she murmured and hurried away exactly twentynine minutes later camilla dashed down the main staircase preparations for the autumn ballвђand all the events leading up to and following itвђwere well underway the regisseur the palace manager would overlook no details and should he her aunts eagle eye would scope them out her royal highness princess eve de cordina was chatelaine of the palace and a woman who stood beside her husband as he ruled the country but she often had her own opinions about matters of state and had her own career apart from her royal duties her hamilton company of players was a worldrenowned theatrical group and she was also a respected playwright her example served to remind camilla that with ambition work and brains a woman could do anything even be on timeвђbarelyвђto meet guests when her plate was overfull she was nearly at the base of the steps when the man jogging up to her caught her by the shoulders he was handsome as sin and smelled comfortably of horses whats the hurry uncle bennett i didnt even know youd arrived she kissed her mothers youngest brother on the cheek and already visited the stables bry and thadd are still out there he said referring to his two young sons hannahs around here somewhere she wanted to talk to eve and look at you he ruffled her short hair very chic how was your trip to england successful i found the perfect mare to breed with my stallion i want to see her and all the rest of youвђbut later im late whats this about some american who needs a good asskicking she rolled her eyes youve already seen my father on the way in from the stables i volunteered to hold his coat i dont think youll have the chance i dont see the ass hed like to kick being within striking distance any time in the near future a bientot butвђ puzzled bennett watched her dash off someone had their information skewed he mused then began to smile as he climbed up the steps hoping to search out his brother and harass him for details knowing reeve macgee bennett doubted that camillas father had the wrong data camilla slowed to a dignified if brisk walk as she moved through the palace flowers fresh and elaborate speared and spilled out of vases and urns her heels clicked efficiently on the sparkling marble floors the occasional servant paused to bow or curtsy she greeted most by name but continued on she hated being late by the time she made it to the gold parlor she was by six minutes because she heard the low murmur of voices she took another moment to smooth her skirt her hair take a breath and fix a welcoming smile on her face when she stepped in she saw her mother was already seated in one of the conversation areas pouring tea from one of the miessen china pots into cups for a middleaged couple the woman caught her attention first such an intriguing look camilla thought lovely in a unique way and casually disheveled she wouldnt have called the baggy tweeds fashionable but they certainly suited the woman the man rose as she approached she started to speak to apologize for her tardiness in greeting them then couldnt speak at all he was she thought stunned an older and more distinguished version of del she needed to find a way to get the man off her mind she ordered herself when she started seeing pieces of him in dashing and dignified english earls camilla id like to introduce you to the earl and countess of brigston lord and lady brigston my daughter her royal highness camilla de cordina lord and lady brigston i apologize for not being here with my mother to welcome you to cordina please sit and be comfortable i hope you enjoyed your trip were delighted to be here your highness alice smiled as she curtseyed then shook hands with camilla as is our son may i present lord delaney viscount brigston her thoughts whirled as del moved from the far window and crossed the room toward her her heart beat too quicklyвђfirst with the sheer joy of seeing him and then with confusion and lastly with anger viscount brigston she thought what was this how did the american scientist become a british aristocrat the nerve of him she inclined her head coolly then lifted her chin my lord she said in a tone frigid as winter madam he returned and with annoyance clear in his eyes took her offered hand and kissed it she got through it camilla was too proud and too innately well mannered not to but the following thirty minutes were torture she held up her part in conversation which was more she thought darkly than del managed he barely grumbled monosyllables and only when directly addressed why did he have to look so big and handsome and male the suit and tie should have dwarfed him somehow or tamed him by a few degrees it did neither my son alice said at one point is delighted and grateful for your assistance in funding the bardville project madam isnt that right del he shifted in his chair ive relayed my appreciation and the teams to her highness via letters and reports yes i received one of yourвђletters just this morning lord delaney camilla smiled with her eyes frosted how odd you didnt mention youd be traveling and so soon to cordina he wouldnt have been here if hed had any choice he thought his mother had hounded him like a shewolf and all but dragged him to the plane by his ear i wasnt entirely sure my schedule would permit the trip were so pleased it did gabriella broke in warned by the battlelight in her daughters eyes when camillas temper rose too high her tongue could be lethal and rash so that we can in some small way repay you for the hospitality you offered camilla in your home in vermont a lovely part of america im told i regret never having seen it for myself it was a tossup gabriella decided who looked more shocked by her easy mention of their prior relationship the princess or the viscount both gaped at her while she sipped her tea she thoughtвђwas nearly certainвђshe heard the countess muffle a squeak of laughter now she would see how long the two of them could manage to continue to behave like polite strangers camilla has developed a keen interest in your field my lord gabriella continued its always rewarding for a mother to see her child so enthusiastic and equally rewarding for a child to entertain her mother camilla said with a perfectly pleasant smileвђone with an edge only her mother could see what anвђinteresting surprise for you to have invited lord delaney and his parents without mentioning the plans to me i hoped it would be and that youd be pleased to offer cordinian hospitality it was said lightly but with underlying firmness of course nothing could please me more than repaying lord delaney forвђeverything im sure youd like to rest a bit after your journey gabriella said to niles and alice as she rose camilla perhaps you could show lord delaney the gardens im notвђ del began then ground his teeth at his mothers killing glare i wouldnt want to put you out its no trouble at all gabriella laid a hand a heavy one on camillas shoulder as she passed trapped camilla got to her feet braced herself as her mother breezily led dels parents away then turned to face him first let me make it perfectly clear that i had no idea you would be here and if i had i would have done everything possible to be absent from this welcoming party thats clear if i couldve gotten out of making this trip i would have believe me second she continued in the same cool and mannered tone i have no more desire to show you the gardens than you have to see them however ive less desire to distress my mother or your parents ten minutes should do it im sure we can tolerate each other for that length of time my lord she said in a hiss dont start on me he rose as well then found himself talking to her back as she strode to the terrace doors on the other side of the room when she sailed out he jammed his hands into his pockets and followed it was going to be he thought a very long four days chapter ten in the third floor guest wing alice paused at the entrance to the suite of rooms theyd been given for their stay in cordina it was time she decided to test her impressions and instincts regarding gabriella de cordina i wonder maam if i might have a moment of your time in private of course gabriella had been calculating her options and considering how best to handle her guest since shed first set eyes on the woman in her opinion alice caine preferred the direct approach and so when possible did she well use my sitting room its very comfortable very private as she led alice through the palace to the family quarters she spoke of the history of the building the art collection she kept up the polite tour chatter until they were comfortably behind closed doors in her elegant rose and blue sitting room may i offer you some refreshment lady brigston no maam thank you alice took a seat folded her hands we are obviously both aware of the relationship between our children and the unfortunate way that relationship was left late last summer she began yes your son was very kind to provide my daughter with shelter i beg your pardon but thats nonsense he didnt do it out of kindness or at least only partially he isnt unkind hes just boneheaded gabriella sat back lady brigstonвђalice she responded warmly pleased that her judgment about the woman had been on target i wasnt certain i was doing the right thing for camilla by inviting your familyвђand by not telling her of the invitation or about your sons title it was selfserving of me i wanted to give her time to search her heart and i wanted to gauge her reaction for myself when she saw your son again the minute i did i knew id done the right thing after all you saw the way they looked at each otherвђ well before their backs went up yes i did they love each other and theyre both letting pride get in the way its more than pride with del hes so much like his father toss him some old bones and he can give you chapter and verse on the woman who owned them three thousand years ago give him a flesh and blood female and hes clueless its not that hes stupid maamвђ brie gabriella interrupted alice took a breath settled more comfortably in the chair like her son she knew the formalities of protocolвђand like her son found them mildly foolish she was glad her serene highness felt the same way brie hes not stupid hes just a caine through and through i dont like to interfere in the lives of my children gabriella began neither do i technically they said nothing for a moment then both began to smile why dont we have a small glass of brandy gabriella suggested it helped alice thought when you could see the woman your son loved in her mothers eyes and you liked them both oh why dont we pleased gabriella rose to fetch the decanter and pour the snifters herself i do have an idea which while notвђtechnicallyвђinterfering may help things along a bit my sons would call it doubleteaming im all ears ten minutes later alice nodded i like your style good thing since were going to be inlaws she glanced toward the window when she heard raised voices thats delвђbooms like a bull when hes mad they rose together moved out to the balcony in tune they linked arms as they looked down on their children theyre arguing gabriella said with emotion thickening her voice its great isnt it we shouldnt eavesdrop were just standing here taking some air we cant help it if theyre shouting at each other i suppose not even as she inched out a bit more gabriella heard her sitting room door open and slam shut is that jackass caine here yet mortified gabriella closed her eyes then turned back as her husband came to the open doorway reeve she murmured you must be camillas father delighted alice stepped forward pumped his hand im the jackasss mother we were just pretending not to eavesdrop while they yell at each other in the garden care to join us he stared a tall man with silver shot black hair as his wife began to laugh helplessly well hell was all he said she hadnt intended to argue in fact camilla had ordered herself not to rise to any bait he might cast the jackass she swept him along garden paths as if they were on a forced march and took none of the pleasure she normally did in the scents the textures the charm were particularly proud of our rose garden there are more than fifty varieties represented including the climbing specimens trained on the fifteen arbors in what is called la promenade de rose the less formal beds at the far edges add charm i think to elegance i dont give a hang about the roses very well well continue on to the walled garden its a particularly lovely spot whereвђ lets just cut it out he took her arm pulled her around i have not given you leave to touch me sir tell that to somebody who hasnt seen you naked her color came upвђfire under creamвђbut her voice remained cold nor do i care to be reminded of my previous poor judgment is that what it comes down to poor judgment on your part youre the one who ended it youre the one who took off you told me to go like you ever listened to a damn thing i said if youd been honest with me from the beginningвђ you dare incensed she yanked her arm free honesty lord delaney he had the grace to flush that has nothing to do with anything i didnt tell you i had chicken pox when i was ten either and its just as relevant your title is hardly a rash its just a title something i inherited from my father it doesntвђ ah titles lineages dont count when theyre yours only when their mine you asinine jerk just watch it just watch it he ordered its not the same and you know it i dont think of myself that way i dont use the damn thing and dont remember its there half the time i dont live in a palace andвђ neither do i i live on a farm this is my uncles home you say you dont think of your title half the time i have no choice but to think of mine every dayвђwith every public move and most private ones i wanted time a little time to live as you live to have what you take for granted freedom so i took it she said passionately right or wrong i took what i needed because i was afraid i mightвђ afraid of what it doesnt matter now its no longer an issue well consider it bad luck all around that i ended up where i ended up during that storm she drew herself in now i wont embarrass my uncle or the rest of my family by arguing with one of his guests however insufferable while youre here i suggest we do our best to stay out of each others way she turned her back on him i have nothing more to say to you some hospitalityвђcordinian style shocked to the bone she whirled back my motherвђ she nearly choked my mother offered you and your family an invitation to our country to her brothers home you will receive every courtesyвђpubliclyвђfrom my family and from me in privateвђ what hissed through her teeth was an insult more usually heard in a french gutter than a palace garden del only raised his eyebrows nice mouth your highness and now there is nothing more to be said between us ive got plenty to say to you sister his tone the term made sentimental tears want to rise in her throat turning her back on him she did what she could to force them back sir you are dismissed oh stuff a sock in it out of patience he spun her back around then froze when he saw the sparkle of tears what are you doing stop that if you think youre going to pull out the waterworks to make me feel like a heel think again he took a deliberate step back from her as he searched his pockets look god i dont have a handkerchief so snuffle it back go away she was no less appalled than he when a tear spilled over go inside go back to america or go to hell but go away camilla undone he stepped toward her again your highness formal in company and avidly curious marian stepped onto the garden path i beg your pardon but miss lattimer has arrived shes been shown to her rooms sarah surprised del stared at camilla you invited sarah to the palace yes ill be right in marian thank you if youd please show lord delaney to his rooms or anywhere else hed like to go please excuse me my lord my lord marian studied him carefully when camilla walked quickly away she was torn between wanting to level him for hurting her dearest friend and sighing with sympathy over the misery so plain on his face may i show you the rest of the gardens no thanks unless youve got a handy pond or fountain i can soak my head in marian only smiled im sure we can accommodate you he wondered if hed be doing everyone a favor if he did leave his mother would be furious his father baffled and they would both be embarrassed but camilla would obviously be relieved and he wouldnt have to see her look at her and try not to remember how shed looked wearing jeans and a tshirt while she fried up eggs not that she looked anything like that now she was polished and sparkling and elegant as the diamonds hed seen winking at her ears and just he tried to convince himself as cold but it occurred to him that he couldnt let her chase him offвђthe way hed chased her hed stay if for no other reason than to prove to her what spine was it wasnt hard not to get in her way the palace was a far cry from a fiveroom cabin in the vermont woods and he couldnt claim not to be enjoying himself on some level he liked her brothers her cousins it was like watching a pack of handsome elegant wolves run just short of wild as an only child hed never been exposed to big boisterous families which he soon discovered was what they were under the titles and polish a family closely knit enough that he had trouble remembering who was sibling who was cousin several of them talked him into going down to the stablesвђand a hell of a horse palace it was the minute they discovered he could ride he was mounted up that was how he met alexander cordinas ruler and his brother prince bennett camillas uncles and her father reeve macgee sir one of the young menвђhe thought it was dorianвђgrinned and made formal introductions del shifted in the saddle hed been taught of course but monthsвђyearsвђpassed without him needing the protocol he didnt like having to dig it upвђand cared less for the sensation of being dissected by three pair of coolly measuring eyes welcome to cordina lord brigston alex said in a smooth faintly aloof voice and my home thank you sir del managed what passed for a bow while mounted on a skittish horse were pleased to have you and to repay you in some way for the hospitality you showed my niece there was a subtle and keen edge under the courtesy alex made certain of it that horse wants a run bennett said because he felt a tug of sympathy poor bastard he thought outnumbered you look like you can handle him del felt the quick slice of alexs wordsвђlike a nick from a honed fencing sword he preferred shifting his gaze to the more friendly brother hes a beauty well let you enjoy your ride id be interested to speak with you regarding your work alexander added as its become so much a passion of princess camillas at your convenience sir alex nodded then continued to walk his mount toward the stables after a glance of some pity bennett followed behind him reeve turned his mount until he was side by side with del you he said pointing at his sons his nephews take off then turning to del he continued its time you and i had a little chat he said as the echo of hooves faded in the race up the hill im wondering if you can come up with a good reason why i shouldnt just snap your neck well del thought at least there was no need for protocol and politics now the man looked like he could give the necksnapping a good shot he was fit broadshouldered and his hands appeared to be rough and ready and he looked to del more like a soldier than any farmer hed ever come across i doubt it del decided you want to do it here or somewhere more secluded where you can dump me in a shallow grave reeves smile was thin lets take a ride you make a habit out of taking stray young women into your house caine no she was the first i can promise shell be the last the day was warm but breezy del hated the fact that he was sweating the man had eyes like lasers you want me to believe you took her in out of the goodness of your heart you had no idea who she wasвђeven though her face is plastered on magazine covers in newspapers on television screens all over the world you had no intention of exploiting her of using her influence for your own gain or of trading off the press with stories about how you took her to bed just a damn minute del reined to a stop and now it was his gaze that bored heat i dont use women i sure as hell couldnt have used her if id tried because shed have kicked me in the teeth for it i dont have time for gossip magazines or television and i wasnt expecting to find some runaway princess stranded on the side of the road in a storm she said she was low on funds so i gave her a place to stay and a job i didnt ask her a lot of questions or pay much attention well enough attention apparently to take her to bed thats right and thats nobodys business but ours you want to kick my ass over that you go ahead but you start accusing me of taking what we had between us and turning it into some cheap splash for the media im kicking yours right back right answer reeve thought exactly right he shifted in the saddle the boy had guts he decided pleased but that was no reason not to torture him what are your intentions toward my daughter the angry flush faded until del was sheet pale myвђmyвђ what you heard the question son roll your tongue back in your mouth and answer it i dont have any she wont even speak to me im staying out of her way just when i was beginning to think you werent a complete jackass after all reeve swung his mount around again give that horse a good gallop he advised and dont fall off and break your stiff neck as he rode back to the stables reeve thought the conversation might not have been precisely what his wife had meant when shed asked him to have a mantoman talk with del but it had certainly been satisfying camilla would have enjoyed a good gallop herself but the ladies tea required her attention and her presence as the weather was fine the party was spread over the south terrace and the rose garden so that guests could enjoy the views of the mediterranean and the fragrance of flowers her aunt had opted for casual elegance so the pretty tables were covered with warm peach cloths and set with glass dishes of deep cobalt more flowers cheerful tropical blooms spilled out of shallow bowls while whitecoated staff poured flutes of champagne as well as cups of tea each lady was presented with a silver compact etched with the royal seal a harpist plucked strings quietly in the shade of an arbor tumbled with white roses her aunt eve camilla thought knew how to set her stage women in floaty dresses wandered the garden or gathered in groups knowing her duty camilla moved through the guests while she nursed a single glass of champagne she smiled exchanged pleasantries chatted and shoved all thoughts of del into a corner of her mind then ruthlessly locked it ive barely had a moment with you eve slid an arm through camillas and drew her aside she was a small woman with a lovely tumble of raven hair that provided a exquisite frame for her diamondshaped face her eyes a deep and bold blue sparkled as she nudged camilla toward the terrace wall not enough time now she said in a voice that still carried a hint of her native texas drawl but later i want to hear about your adventure every little detail mothers already told you of course with a laugh eve kissed camillas cheek gabriella had done more then tell herвђshe had enlisted eves help in the matter of prying and poking but thats secondhand information i like going to the source ive been waiting for uncle alex to call me out on the carpet eve lifted an eyebrow that worries you i hate upsetting him if i worried about that id spend my life biting my nails lips pursed eve glanced at her perfect manicure nope he has to be what he is she added more soberly and looked out to the sea that lay blue against the edges of her adopted country so much responsibility he was born for itвђand bred for it as youve been honey but he trusts youвђcompletely and hes very interested in your young man hes not my young man ah well she remembered very well when shed tried to convince herself alex heir to cordina wasnt hers lets say hes interested in lord delaneys workвђand your interest in that work aunt chris was a tremendous help camilla added glancing over toward eves older sister she wasnt technically camillas aunt but their family was a very inclusive one nothing she likes better than a good campaign that comes from marrying the gentleman from texas the senator was very pleased to discuss the bardville research project with his associates in florida after aunt chris talked him into it and im very grateful to her she looks wonderful by the way like a newly wed eve agreed after five years of marriage she always said she was holding out for the perfect man im glad she found him whether it takes fifty years or five minutes she said giving camillas hand a quick squeeze when its right you know it and when you know it and youre smart you dont take no for an answer something like that is worth fighting for well back to work camilla stopped by the tables found a precious three minutes to speak with her young cousin marissa she watched her sister adrienne sit and with apparently good cheer talk with an elderly italian countess who was deaf as a post hannah her uncle bennetts wife gestured her over to a shady table where she sat enjoying tea and scones with dels mother lady brigston and i have a number of mutual acquaintances hannah explained ive been badgering her about her work and now im dreaming about running off to dig for dinosaur bones there had been a time when as a british agent adventure had been hannahs lifework but as a princess and mother of two active sons shed traded one kind of adventure for another as an agent shed had to deliberately downplay her looks and bury her love of fashion now she could indulge them her dark blond hair was sleeked back in a twist her sleeveless tea dress showed off athletic arms and was the same vivid green as her eyes id like that myself smiling camilla obeyed hannahs signal and sat though i imagine its hard tedious work you must love it she said to alice its what i always wanted to doвђeven as a child other girls collected dolls i collected fossils its so rewarding camilla commented to know always what you want and be able to work toward it indeed alice inclined her head and tremendously exciting id think to discover an advocation along the wayвђand work toward it oh would you excuse me a moment recognizing her cue hannah rose i need to speak with mrs cartwright she exchanged a quick and telling look with aliceвђand got out of the way your family if i may say so your highness is wonderful thank you i agree with you im as a rule more comfortable in the company of men simply dont have much in common with females so fussy about the oddest things to my mind the hand she waved had nails that were short and unpainted she wore only a simple gold band on her ring finger but i feel very much at home with your mother your aunts she went on its no wonder im already so fond of you thank you camilla said again a little flustered thats very kind are you very angry with my son not that i blame you alice went on before camilla could formulate a diplomatic answer he can be such aвђwhats the word im looking for oh yes bonehead such a bonehead he gets it from his father so he really cant help it he mustve given you a terrible time no not at all no need to be tactful she patted camillas hand its just we two and i know my boy in and out terrible mannersвђpartially my fault i cant deny it i never was one to bother about the niceties outrageous temperвђthats his fathersвђalways booming around forgets why half the time after the explosionвђwhich is annoying and frustrating to the other party dont you think yesвђ with a half laugh camilla shook her head lady brigston youre putting me in an awkward position let me say i admire your sons workвђ his approach to it and his passion for it on a personal level we have what you might call a conflict in styles you have been well raised havent you gabriella had warned her it wouldnt be easy to chip through the composure do you mind if i tell you a little story there was once a young american girl barely twentyone with her college degree hot in her hand she had a fire in her belly one burning ambition paleontology most thought her mad she added with a twinkle after all what was a young woman doing fiddling around with dinosaur bones she wheedled her way onto a digвђthis particular dig because the man in charge was someone whos workвђhis approach to it and his passion for itвђshe admired she paused smiled and sipped her tea she read his books read articles on or by him he was to her a great hero imagine her reaction when he turned out to be this big irritable impatient man who barely acknowledged her existenceвђand then mostly to complain about it he is like his father camilla murmured oh the spitting image alice acknowledged with some pride they sniped at each other this rude man and this brash young woman she did most of the sniping as he was so thickheaded most of her best shots just bounced off his skull it was utterly infuriating yes camilla said almost to herself infuriating he was fascinating so brilliant so handsome soвђapparentlyвђdisinterested in her though he began to soften just a little toward her as she was damn good at the work and had a sharp seeking mind caine men admire a sharp seeking mind apparently she fell madly in love with him and after getting over being annoyed with herself over that she put that sharp mind to work she pursued him which flustered him he found all manner of reasons why this shouldnt be he was fifteen years older he didnt have time for females and so on she had a few quibbles herself this earl of brigston business just didnt fit into her yankee system very well it might have discouraged her but she was stubbornвђand she knew in her heart he had feelings for her and since the title came with the man and she wanted the man she decided she could live with it so what could she do but seduce him because alice looked at camilla for agreement camilla nodded obediently naturally he stammered and stuttered and looked for a delightful few moments like a panicked horse caught in a stable fire but she had her way with him and three weeks later they were married it seems to be working out well she added with a little smile she was an admirable young woman yes she was and she gave birth to an admirable if knotheaded son do you love him lady brigstonвђ oh please call me alice i look at you and i see a young woman so bright so fresh so unhappy i know my place but im looking at camilla not her royal highness he sees the title and forgets the woman who holds it if you want him dont let him forget you put flowers in his house she said quietly now i never remember to do that sort of thing myself you know he kept them after youd gone tears swam into her eyes he just didnt notice them yes he did part of him wants to step away from you and bury himself in his work again i imagine both of youвђbeing strong capable young peopleвђ will do very well if you go your separate ways but i wonder what the two of you might do might make if you break through this barrier of pride and hurt and come together dont you yes camilla thought constantly i told him i loved him she murmured and he turned me away with a hiss of breath alice sat back what an ass well then i have one piece of advice camilla make him crawl a littleвђitll be good for himвђbefore he tells you the same i have no doubt you can manage it del suffered through a formal and to his mind interminable dinner party he was seated between the deaf italian countess and camillas sister adrienne the single advantage was that camillas father was seated well across the enormous dining room it would he decided be more difficult for her dad to stab him with his dinner knife that way by the time the main course was served hed reversed his initial impression of adrienne as a vapid if ornamental girl she was he realized simply an incredibly sweetnatured woman who was both blissfully happy and quietly charming her help with the countess saved his sanity and when adrienne glanced at him a quick sparkle in her eyes he saw some of camillas sly humor he found himself telling her about some of his work as she asked questions specifically designed to encourage it it didnt occur to him until later that her talent was in drawing people out no wonder camillas so fascinated adrienne smiled she had hed noted her mothers soothing voice and her fathers sizzling blue eyes she always enjoyed puzzlesвђand thats your work really isnt it a complex puzzle i was never very good at them will you go back to florida soon yes very soon he shouldnt be here at all he told himself when my children are a bit older well take them there to disney world she looked across the table at her husband it was that look hed think of later as well the sheer contentment in it the look that had been missing from camillas face he thought except for the briefest of times it had been there he remembered it being there when shed stretched out on the bank of his pond camilla content hed called her and then shed been gone chapter eleven for a princess she worked like a horse it made it difficult for a man to manage five minutes alone with her to apologize del wasnt sure exactly what he was apologizing for but he was beginning to think she had one coming guiltвђa taste he didnt care forвђhad been stuck in his throat since hed seen that tear run down her cheek adding to it were various members of her family who were so bloody friendly or graciousвђor both at the same timeвђhe was beginning to feel like a jackass even her mother had cornered him if that was an acceptable definition of being taken gently aside to be given a warm and graceful expression of her gratitude for opening his home to her daughter i know shes a grown woman gabriella said as she stood with him on a rise overlooking the gemblue waters of the mediterranean and a capable one but im a mother and we tend to worry yes madam he agreed though hed never considered his mother much of a worrier i worried less when i knew she was with someone trustworthy and kindвђwho she obviously respected gabriella continued to smile even when heвђquite visiblyвђwinced id been concerned about her for some time concerned shed been working too hard for too long since the death of my father and her own blossoming you could say there have been more demands on her time her energies your daughter has considerable energy yes as a rule im afraid shes been more exposed to the appetites of the media in the last year or two than anyone could be prepared for could he understand gabriella wondered could anyone who hadnt lived it she hoped he could shes lovely as you know and vibrantвђas well as the oldest female of her generation of the family the medias pursuit of her has been voracious and im afraid it cost her emotionally even physically i know what its like i used to slip away myself there are times the need to be away even from something dear to your heart is overwhelming dont you think yes i have vermont her face went soft and bright yes she thought he could understand and i had my little farm until i think very recently camilla hadnt found her place to be away to be quiet even if it was just inside her mind thank you she rose up and kissed his cheek thank you for helping her find it he might have felt lower del thought when they parted if he crawled on his belly and left a slimy trail behind him he had to talk to camilla reasonably rationally there were questions now and he wanted them answered it seemed only right a man should have some answers before he did that crawling but every time he made some subtle inquiry about her he was told she was in a meeting taking an appointment engaged with her personal assistant he wanted to think all this meant manicures or shopping or whatnot until adrienne corrected him im sorry were you looking for camilla no it felt awkward lying to that soft pretty smile not exactly madam i havent seen her this morning adrienne cuddled her baby daughter shes doing double duty im afraid my oldest isnt feeling quite well and i dont like to leave him shes filling in for me at the hospital i was scheduled to visit the pediatric ward but with little armand so fussy i wanted to be close ahвђi hope hes all right hes napping now and seems much better i thought id bring the baby out for some sunshine before i went back up to check on him but camilla should be back in an hour no she corrected she has an appointment with mama regarding the art center afterward i know she normally deals with correspondence midafternoon though where shell find the time today is beyond me she kept the soft smile on her face and the delighted laughter inside the poor man she thought was so frustrated and so in love with her sister is there something i can do for you no no madam thank you i believe dorian escaped down to the stables she said kindly several of the guests are making use of the horses if youd like to join them he didnt but wished he had when he was summoned by prince alexander lord brigston i hope you havent been neglected since your arrival not at all your highness the office reflected the man del thought both were elegant male and polished by tradition the prince exuded power along with dignity his hair was black as night and threaded with silver his aristocratic face was honed to sharp angles dark his eyes were equally sharp and very direct since the princess camilla has expressed such a keen interest ive studied some of your work my familys interests he said in a tone smooth as a polished dagger are mine tell me more about this current project of yours though he resented being made to feel like a student auditioning del obliged he understood perfectly and knew he was meant to understand that he was being measured and judged when in twenty minutes he was graciously dismissed del wasnt certain if hed passed the audition or if he should keep a wary eye out for the executioner but he did know the back of his neck prickled as the image of an ax poised above it hovered in his mind any man he decided who consideredвђhowever remotely consideredвђbecoming involved with a member of the royal family of cordina needed his head examined while it was still safely on his shoulders del had always considered himself perfectly sane to stay that way he decided to escape for a couple of hours it wasnt a simple matter a man couldnt just call a damn cab to come pick him up at the palace there was procedure protocol policy in the end camillas older brother kristian casually offered him the use of a carвђand a driver if he liked del took the car and skipped the driver and came as close to falling in love with a place not his own as hed ever in his life there was something stunning about itвђthe tiny country on the sea it made him think of jewelsвђold and precious ones passed down from generation to generation the land rose in tiers of hills from the lap of the sea houses pink and white and dull gold tumbled up and down those rises jutted out on the promontory as if theyd been carved there flowersвђhed been paying more attention to them since camillaвђgrew in abundance and with such a free and casual air they added immense charm to the drama of rock and cliff the fronds of regal palms fluttered in a constant balmy breeze the sense of age appealed to him generation by generation century by century this small gem had survived and gleamed and clung to its heart without giving way to the frenzied rush of urbanity without exploiting its vast and staggering views with skyscrapers he imagined it had changed here and there over time no place remained the same and that was the beauty of man and when man had wisdom along with invention he managed to find a way to preserve the heart while feeding the mind the bissets who had ruled here for four centuries had obviously been wise he stopped on the drive back along the winding rising road to study the place of princes it was only just he supposed that the palace stood on the highest point it faced the sea its white stones rising from the cliff it spread even rambled with its battlements its parapets and towers harking proudly back to another age another time wars he thought and royalty historic bedfellows even in modern times a small ugly little war had been fought here when hed been a boy a selfstyled terrorist had attempted to assassinate members of the royal family camillas mother had been kidnapped her aunt then simply eve hamilton had been shot he realized now that he hadnt considered that or how such a history so close to the heart could and did affect camilla still she hadnt let it stop her from striking out on her own alone he thought now it didnt stop her from coming back here to the castle on the hill and taking up her family duties the country the family was at peace now but peace was a fragile thing he imagined those who lived inside understood the palace had been built for defense and his archaeologists eye could see how cagey the design there could be no attack from the sea no force that could breech the sheer rock walls of the cliffs and the height the hills made it all but impregnable its port made it rich it had also been built for beauty he considered the quest for beauty a very human need standing where he was he wouldnt have thought of it as a home but only as a symbol but he had been inside beyond those iron gates however powerful or symbolic or aesthetically potent it was a home perhaps she lived a part of her life on a farm in virginia but this place this palace this country was very much her home it had to be obvious to both of them that it couldnt be his when he drove back through the gates passed the bold red uniforms of the palace guards a cloud of depression came with him hes in a horrible mood alice confided to gabriella when they stole five minutes in the music room they huddled close as conspirators should apparently he went out for a drive and came back brooding and snarly its a good sign camillas been distracted and out of sorts all afternoon its going perfectly oh and my spies tell me delaney asked about her several times this morning the best thing was her being so busy and unavailable give that boy time to think he wont be able to think when he sees her tonight oh alice she looks so beautiful in her gown i was at her last fitting and shes just spectacular theyre going to make us beautiful grandchildren alice said with a sigh he didnt like wearing black tie there were so many pieces to it why a man needed all those pieces where a shirt and pants did the job was beyond him but hed made up his mind to leave in the morning so that was something hed already come up with the necessary excuse for his early departureвђan urgent email from the site no one would know the difference hed fulfill his obligation tonightвђfor his parentsвђfind a way to apologize or at least come to terms with camilla and then get back to reality as soon as possible he wasnt a man for palaces digging under one maybeвђnow that could be interesting all he had to do was survive the sticky formality of one more evening he was sure he could manage to slip out early from that event as well in the morning hed pay his respects to his hosts then get the hell out of dodge only one little chore had to be done first he had toвђin all good conscienceвђexpress his appreciation for the help in funding to camilla facetoface and without the stiffness hed fallen back on in correspondence that had been small of him and unworthy of her gesture dressed and wanting nothing more than to get the entire ordeal over with he joined his parents in their sitting room well hell look at you it was a rare event to see his mother elegantly attired he grinned circling his finger so that she turned the simple black gown showed off her trim athletic figure and the brigston pearls added panache youre a babe he decided and made her laugh i figure i can stand these shoes for about an hour and a half after that its anybodys guess she walked over to straighten her husbands formal tie dont fuss alice im getting rid of the damn thing at the first opportunity still niles smiled as he leaned down to kiss her cheek but the boys right you are a babe this do will be crawling with babes speaking of which alice said casually to her son have you seen camilla today no ah well youll see her tonight right with hundreds of people around he thought how the hell would he manage to say what he had to sayвђonce he figured out what that wasвђ when they were surrounded lets get this over with del suggested god just like your father resigned alice took each of her men by the arm guests were formally announced then escorted to the receiving line the bows and curtsies went on endlessly in dels estimation then he got his first look at camilla and forgot everything else she wore a gown the same tawny gold as her eyes in it she was iridescent luminous it left her shoulders bare nipped in to a tiny waist then simply flowed out with what seemed like miles of skirt that shimmered like sundrenched water in the elegant light of countless chandeliers white and yellow diamonds sparkled at her ears dripped in complex tiers toward the swell of her breast and fired in the tiara set on the glossy cap of her hair she was in that moment the embodiment of the fairytale princess beauty grace and elegance and all of them bonedeep he had never felt so much the frog but he thoughtвђhopedвђhed managed to roll his eyes back into his head by the time he reached her my lord madam he took the hand she offered sliding his thumb over her knuckles had this woman actually scrambled eggs for him if this was reality maybe all the rest had been some complex fantasy i hope youll enjoy your evening i wasnt planning on it her polite smile never wavered then i hope you dont find it overly tedious i need five minutes he murmured im afraid this is an inconvenient time let go of my hand she said in an undertone as his grip tightened people are watching five minutes he said again and their eyes locked then he reluctantly moved up the line her heart might have raced but she continued to stand smile and greet guests the combination of willpower and breeding stopped her from giving into the towering urge to crane her neck and find del in the crowd moving into the ballroom curiosity pierced with a splinter of hope made her almost ill by the time her aunt and uncle opened cordinas autumn ball hed looked at herвђhadnt heвђas he had at odd moments in the cabin as if she were the center of his thoughts but as she and her cousin luc crossed the floor for their first dance she had no time for private thoughts when the palace opened its doors for a ball it opened them wide and with brilliant ceremony glamour was allowed full sway here and given the satin edge of pomp waterfalls of chandeliers showered light on dazzling gowns glittering jewels banks of sumptuous flowers frothy champagne bubbled in crystal on the terrace beyond there was the seductive glow of candles and torcheres hundreds of antique mirrors lined the walls and threw back reflection after reflection of gorgeously gowned women and elegantly garbed men as they spun around the polished floor jewels flashed and music soared camilla danced for duty and for pleasure and then for love with her father i watched you and mama watched us what dancing just a bit ago and i thought look at them she pressed her cheek to his how can anyone look anywhere but at them theyre so beautiful did i ever tell you about the first time i saw her camilla leaned back to laugh into his eyes a million times tell me again it was her sixteenth birthday a ball very much like this she wore a pale green dress not so different from what youre wearing now all those billowing skirts that make a woman look like a fantasy diamonds in her hair the way theyre in yours tonight i fell in love with her on the spot though i didnt see her again for ten years she was the most exquisite thing id ever laid eyes on he looked down at her daughter now im dancing with the second most exquisite thing daddy she took her hand from his shoulder to touch his face i love you so much im sorry you were mad at me i wasnt mad baby worried but not mad now as far as that jackass you were withвђ daddy the warning light in her eye had him glaring right back at her i have one thing to say about him he has potential you dont really knowвђ she broke off narrowed her eyes suspiciously is this a trap i used to worry that some slicktalking pretty boy was going to come along and sweep you off before you realized he was a jerk well you certainly cant call caine slicktalking or pretty no indeed and since you already know hes a jerk youre in good shape he added making her laugh i want you happy cam even more than i want to keep my little girl all to myself youre going to make me cry no you wont cry he drew her close again youre made of sterner stuff than that i love him daddy i know reeves eyes met dels across the crowds of dancers poor son of a bitch doesnt have a prayer you go get him honey and if he doesnt come around quick enough let me know id still like a reason to kick his ass make up your mind delaney about what alice took the wine shed asked him to fetch whether youre just going to scowl at camilla half the night or ask her to dance she hasnt stopped dancing for two minutes all night has she its part of her job or do you think she likes dancing with that pizzafaced young man with the buck teeth whos stepping all over her feet go dance with her if you think im lining up with half the men in this placeвђ id say youd lost your wits alice finished go cut in another minute with that clumsy boy and shell have a permanent limp all right all right put that way it was like doing her a favor sort of like riding to the rescue he decided as he sawвђquite clearlyвђthe wince flicker over her face as her feet were stomped on again feeling more heroic with each step del threaded through the dancers he tapped camillas partner on the shoulder and moved in so smoothly he surprised himself cutting in he whirled camilla away before the boy could do more than gawk and stammer that was rude did the trick howre your feet her lips twitched other than a few broken toes holding up thank you you dance quite well my lord been a while but it comes back to you madam either way i couldnt be worse than your last partner figured you needed a break rescuing the damsel in distress she arched her eyebrows really twice in one lifetime be careful or youll make it a habit you said you needed five minutes with meвђand that was nearly two hours ago did you change your mind no but he was no longer clear on what to do with five minutes not now that he was holding her again i wanted toвђ about the project the funding ah disappointment sank into her belly if its business ill see that marian schedules an appointment for you tomorrow camilla i wanted to thank you she softened just a little youre welcome the projects important to me too you know i guess i get that now he had only to angle his head dip it a little and his mouth could be on hers he wanted more than anything to have one long taste of her again even if it was the last time camillaвђ the dance is finished but her gaze stayed locked with his and her voice was thick you have to let me go he knew that he knew exactly that but not quite yet i need to talk to you not here for heavens sake if you dont let me go youll have your name splashed all over the papers tomorrow she smiled gaily i dont give a damn you havent lived with it all your life as i have please step back if you want to talk well go out on the terrace when he relaxed his grip she eased away then spoke clearly and in the friendliest of tones for all the pricked ears nearby its warm i wonder lord delaney if youd join me for some fresh air and id love a glass of champagne no problem she slid an arm through his as they walked off the dance floor my brothers tell me you ride very well i hope youll continue to enjoy the stables while youre here she kept up the casual chatter as he lifted a flute of champagne from a silver tray and offered it do you ride madam certainly she sipped strolled toward the open terrace doors my father breeds horses on his farm ive ridden all my life a number of other guests had spilled out onto the terrace before camilla could walk to the rail del simply tugged her arm the wine sloshing to the rim of her glass as he steered her briskly toward the wide stone steps slow down she paused at the top i cant jog down stairs in this dress ill break my neck he took her glass from her then stood restlessly by as she gracefully lifted her billowing skirts with her free hand at the base of the steps he set the champagneвђbarely touchedвђon the closest table then continued to pull her down one of the garden paths stop dragging me along she hissed people willвђ oh lighten up he snapped she grit her teeth as she struggled to maintain her dignity see how light you are when gossipmongers in ten countries are tossing your name around tomorrow in any case im wearing threeinch heels and five miles of skirt just slow down i dont listen to gossip so i wont hear them tossing my name around and if i slow down too long somebodys going to jump out of some corner with something for you to do or to fawn and scrape or just say something so they can say theyve spoken to you i want five damn minutes alone with you the retort that rose to her lips faded away sparkling silver luminaries lighted a path that was already streamed with moonlight she could smell the romance of night jasmine and roses hear it in the pulse and pound of the sea and her own heart her lover wanted to be alone with her he didnt stop until the music was barely more than a murmur in the distance camilla she held her breath delaney i wanted toвђ she wore moonlight like pearls he thought too dazzled to be astonished by the poetic turn of mind her skin was sheened with it her eyes glowed the diamonds in her hair sparked reminding him there was heat inside the elegance he tried again i wanted to apologize forвђ to tell youвђ she didnt know who moved first it didnt seem to matter all that mattered was they were in each others arms their mouths met once twice frantically then a third time long and deep i missed you he pulled her closer rocking when she was locked against him god i missed you the words seemed to pour into her dont let go dont let me go i didnt think id ever see you again he turned his head to race kisses over her face i didnt mean to ever see you again i wasnt ever going to see you again first she said with a laugh oh i was so angry when i got that letter that stiff formal nasty letter we of the bardville research project wish to express our sincere appreciation i couldve murdered you you shouldve seen the first draft he eased back enough to grin at her it was a lotвђpithier id probably have preferred it she threw her arms around his neck oh im so happy ive been trying to figure out how to live without you now i wont have to after were married you can teach me how to read one of those lab reports with all those symbols i never couldвђ she trailed off because hed gone so completely still her soaring heart fell back to earth with a rude and painful thud you dont love me her voice was quiet scrupulously calm as she eased out of his arms you dont want to marry me lets just slow down okay marriageвђ his throat closed up on the word lets be sensible camilla of course all right lets now her tone was terrifyingly pleasant why dont you go first there areвђ there are issues here he began frantically trying to clear his jumbled brain long enough to think very well she folded her hands issue number one cut that out you just cut that out he paced down the path back again i have a very demanding timeconsuming profession yes when im in the field i usually live in a trailer that makes the cabin look like a fivestar hotel yes he bared his teeth but snagged his temper back at the last minute you cant stand there with that palace at your back while youre wearing a damn crown and tell me you dont see theres a problem so issue one is our different lifestyles and separate responsibilities in a nutshell and neatly glossing over the tiaras and glass slippers yeah glass slippers that snapped it is that how you see me and my lifeвђas one ball after the next one magic pumpkin ride i have just as vital a role in the world in my glass slippers as you do in your work boots im not saying you dont thats the whole point he tugged his formal tie loose and dragged it off this isnt what i do i cant strap myself up like a penguin every time i turn around because you have a social obligation but you should have someone who would and im not asking you to chuck your diamonds to live in camp in the middle of nowhere its ridiculous it would never work thats where youre wrong my father was a cop who wanted to farm who wanted more than anything peace and quiet and to work on the land my mother wasвђisвђa princess when they met she was the chatelaine of this place she had taken up the responsibility as hostess as ambassador as symbolic female head of this country when her mother died but you see they loved each other so they found a way to give to each other what they needed to accept the responsibilities and obligations each brought with them and to make a life together her chin was up now her eyes glittering they make me proud and im determined to be every bit the woman my mother is but you you with your excuses and your pitiful issues youre not half the man my father is he had courage and spine and romance he isnt intimidated by a crown because he respects and understands the woman who wears it she swept up her skirts again i would have lived in your trailer and still have been a princess my duty to my nameвђand yoursвђwould never be shirked its you who doubt you could live in this palace and still be a man chapter twelve he hated one single fact the most she was right under all the issues and trappings and complications hed beenвђwell he didnt like the term intimidated leery he decided as he stalked around the gardens as he was wont to stalk around his forest in vermont he was leery of linking himself with the princess hed been paying attention in the weeks theyd been apart hed seen her face and name splashed over the media hed read the stories about her personal life the speculations about her romantic liaisons he knew damn well she wasnt and hadnt been having some hot affair with a french actor as all the articles had trumpeted shed been too busy having one with a halfamerican archaeologist besides anyone who knew her could see the actor wasnt her type too smooth for camilla and that was part of it the stories the innuendoes the outright fabrications were for the most part written by people who didnt know her who didnt understand how hard she was willing to work or her devotion to her mothers country her great love of her family and theirs for her they saw an image the same one hed let himself be blinded by but damn it all to hell and back the woman had leaped from possible tentative relationship into marriage so quickly it had been like a sucker punch to the jaw she didnt give a guy a chance to test his footing all or nothing with her he thought darkly as he jammed his hands into his pockets and reviewed the situation first he finally figures out hes in love with her then he gets poked in the eye with the fact shes been lying to him before he can clear his vision on that shes long gone so what that hed told her to go now after hed realized the whole situation was totally impossible she had to stand there looking like something out of a dream and make him see just how much hed be losing and just when hed started to think maybe maybe with time and effort they could get back what theyd had she kicked him square in the teeth with marriage yeah give her a month in a trailer in florida toss in a few tropical storms kneedeep mud bugs the size of baseballs andвђ shed be great he stopped dead in his tracks shed be fantastic she was the kind of woman you could plunk down anywhere in any situation and shed find a way she just kept hacking and prodding and fiddling until she found the way because that was camilla hed fallen for that he realized before hed fallen for the looks the style the heat hed lost his head over her sheer determination to find the answers and he was letting a minor detail like royal blood stand in his way he wanted the woman and the princess came along with her not half the man her father was oh shed tried to slice him up with that one he didnt have courage backbone he had no romance hed give her some romance that would knock her out of her glass slippers he turned stormed halfway back to the ballroom before he stopped himself that he realized was just the sort of thing he was going to have to avoid if this relationship was going to have a chance in hell of working he was going to have to think ahead a man went charging into a palace ball tossed a princess over his shoulder and started carting her off he was going to get them both exactly the sort of press she hated and likely end up tossed in some dark damp dungeon for his trouble what a man had to do was work out a clear rational planвђand carry it out where there were no witnesses so he sat down on a marble bench and began to do precisely that he got rope at the stables there were times he was forced to admit where being a viscount came in handy stable hands were too polite to question the eccentricities of lord delaney he had to wait until the last waltz was over and guests were tucked in to bed or were on the other side of the palace gates that only gave him more time to work out logisticsвђand to wonder what his parents would do if he ended up breaking his idiotic neck he knew where her room was now that had been a simple matter of subtly pumping adrienne he could only be grateful her windows overlooked the gardens where there were plenty of shadows though he doubted any guards who patrolled the area would be looking for a man dangling several stories up by a rope even when that man swore bitterly when he swung nearly face first into those white stone walls rapelling down from the parapet had seemed a lot easier in theory than in fact he was fairly proficient at it from his work but climbing down a building at night was considerably different the cold reality had him swinging in the wind with scraped knuckles and strained temper he didnt mind the height so much unless he thought about the possibility of it being his last view and all he mused as he tried for a foothold on a stone balcony rail because shed pinched at his ego just couldnt wait until morning oh no he thought as his foot skidded and he went swinging again that wouldve been too easy too ordinary too sane why have a civilized conversation in broad daylight and tell a woman you love her and want to marry her when you can do something really stupid like commit suicide on the bricks below her bedroom window that made a statement he managed to settle his weight on the rail and catch his breath and the rising wind swept in a brisk september rain perfect he glanced up to the heavens that just caps it while the sudden downpour had rain streaming into his eyes he swung out again kicked lightly off the wall and worked his way down to camillas private terrace the first bolt of lightning crashed over the sea as he dropped down thankfully to solid stone he fought with the knot of the thoroughly wet rope hed looped around it took him two drenching minutes to free himself dumping the rope he pushed his sopping hair out of his eyes and marched to her terrace doors found them locked for a moment he only stood staring at them what the hell did she lock the balcony doors for he wondered with rising irritation she was three stories up in a damn palace with guards everywhere how often did she have some idiot climb down the wall and drop on her terrace shed drawn the curtains too so he couldnt see a bloody thing he considered with a spurt of cheerfulness the satisfaction of kicking in the doors there was a certain style to that he thought a certain panache however that would likely be squashed when alarms started to scream here he was wet as a drowned rat on her terrace and the only way to get in was to knock it was mortifying so he didnt knock so much as hammer inside camilla was using a book as an excuse not to sleep every fifteen minutes or so she actually read a sentence for the most part one single fact played over and over in her head shed handled everything badly there was no way around it when she stepped back to look at the big picture del had reacted exactly as shed expect him to react she had leaped heart first into an assumption of marriage shed have been insulted if hed been the one doing the assuming did love make everyone stupid and careless or was it just her she sighed turned a page in the book without particular interest shed bungled everything she decided right from the beginning oh hed helped he was such aвђwhat had his mother said bonehead yes he was such a boneheadвђbut she loved that about him but the blame was squarely on her head she hadnt been honest with him and her reasons for holding back now seemed weak and selfish his anger and yes his hurt had so shattered her that shed turned tail and run rather than standing her ground then hed come to her was she so steeped in her own selfpity that she refused to acknowledge that no matter how much pressure had been put on him hed never have traveled to cordina unless hed wanted to see her even tonight hed taken a step instead of taking one in return shed recklessly leaped shed taken for granted that hed simply fall in line obviously she was too used to people doing so wasnt that one of the reasons shed taken a holiday from being the princess had she learned nothing from those weeks as just plain camilla it wasnt just marriage that had caused him to balk it was the package that came with it she closed her eyes she could do nothing about thatвђwould do nothing even if she could her family her blood her heritage were essential parts of her and yet she wouldnt want a man who shrugged off the complexities of her life she couldnt love a man who enjoyed the fact that theyd be hounded by the press so where did that leave her alone she thought looking around her lovely lonely room because shed pushed away the only man she loved the only man she wanted by demanding too much too fast no she slammed the book shut she wouldnt accept that accepting defeat was what had sent her running from the cabin she wasnt going to do that again there had to be an answer there had to be a compromise she wouldвђno she took a deep breath they would find it she tossed the covers aside shed go to his room now she decided shed apologize for the things shed said to him and tell himвђask him if there was a way they could start again before she could leap out of bed the pounding on her terrace doors had her jumping back with her heart in her throat she grabbed the georgian silver candlestick from her nightstand as a weapon and was on the point of snatching up the phone to call security open the damn door she heard the voice boom out followed by a vicious crack of thunder astonished still gripping her makeshift weapon she crossed to the doors and nudged the curtains aside she saw him in a flash of lightning the furious face the dripping hair the sopping tuxedo shirt for a moment she could do nothing but stare with her mouth open open the damn door he repeated loudly or i kick it in too stunned to do otherwise she fumbled with latch and lock then she staggered back three steps when he pushed the doors open what she could do no more than croak it out as he stood glaring at her and dripping on the priceless rug you want romance sister he grabbed the candlestick out of her numb fingers and tossed it aside it looked a little too heavy to risk any accidents and he had enough bruises for one night del she backed up another two steps as he stepped forward delaney how did youвђyour hands bleeding you want backbone you want adventure maybe a little insanity thrown in he grabbed her shoulders lifted her straight to her toes hows this youre all wet was all she could say you try climbing down the side of a castle in a rainstorm see what shape you end up in climb she barely registered being pushed across the room you climbed down the wall have you lost your mind damn right and you know what the guy gets when he breaches the castle walls he gets the princess you cant justвђ but he could she discovered very quickly that he could before she could clear sheer shock from her system his mouth was hot on hers and shock didnt have a chance against need a thrill swept through her as he dragged herвђoh myвђto the bed he was wet and bleeding and in a towering temper and he was all hers she locked her arms around his neck slid her fingers into that wonderful and dripping hair and gladly offered him the spoils of war her mouth moved under his answering his violent kiss with all the joy all the longing that raged inside her the storm burst through the open doors as she released him long enough to tug at his sodden shirt it landed somewhere with a wet plop he was surprised his clothes didnt simply steam off him the heat of his temper paled with the fire that she brought to his blood so soft so fragrant so wonderfully willing her face was wet now with the rain hed brought in with him he couldve lapped itвђand herвђup like cream undone he buried his face against her throat i need you damn it i cant get past it then have me her breath hitched as his hands roamed over her take me he lifted his head looked down at her her eyes were dark now tawny as a cats and as her hands came up to frame his face she smiled ive waited so long for you she murmured and i didnt even know to prove it she drew his mouth down to hers again everything he felt for her about her from her bloomed in the kiss she trembled from it and the quiet hum in her throat had his pulse bounding that long white throat fascinated him the strong slope of her shoulders was a wonder damp with rain now the thin night slip she wore clung provocatively to her body he took his mouth his hands over the wet silk first then the hot damp flesh beneath she moved under him a graceful arch a quick shiver slowly first savoring first he explored exploited excited when her breathing was thick her eyes dreamily closed he dragged her to her knees and ravaged hed catapulted her from quiet pleasure to reckless demand so that she floundered drowned in him those hard hands that had been so blissfully gentle were now erotically rough bowing back she surrendered to that hungry mouth moaned his name as he tore reason to shreds she went wild in his arms as her need pitched to meet his she tore and tugged at his clothes kneeling on the bed they clung flesh to flesh heart raging against heart once more in a flash of lightning their eyes met held in his at last she saw all she needed to see and it was she who shifted taking him in wrapping her legs around him to take him deep until they both trembled jetaime she said it clearly though her body quaked i love you i cant help myself before he could speak her mouth covered his what was left of his control snapped whipping his body toward frenzy she met him beat for frantic beat when she closed around him he swallowed her cry of release and emptied himself camilla he couldnt think past her name even as he slid down her body to nestle between her breasts he felt her fingers stroke through his hair and wanted nothing more than to close his eyes and stay steeped in her for the rest of his life but his gaze skimmed toward the terraceвђand the rain cheerfully blowing in the open doors and soaking floor and rug i didnt close the doors were starting to flood just stay as he rolled away she watched him lazily then she bolted up as he started to cross the room no wait she scrambled out of bed snatched the robe that had been draped over the curved back of her settee someone might see she muttered then with her robe modestly closed hurried to close the doors herself control he thought as he watched her draw the drapes even now a princess couldnt walk around naked in front of the windowsвђnot even her own and certainly couldnt have a man do so she turned saw him eyeing her speculatively the guards guests she began then dropped her gaze ill get some towels while she walked into the adjoining bath he untangled his damp tuxedo pants they were ruined he decided and would be miserably uncomfortable but if they were going to have a conversation he wanted to be wearing something besides his heart on his sleeve she came back got down on her hands and knees and began mopping the floor it made him smile made him remember her in his cabin i have to be practical delaney his brows drew together at the strained edge in her voice i understand that do you she hated herself for wanting to weep now yes i do i admire the way you manage to be practical selfsufficientвђand royal her head came up slowly she eased back to sit on her heels and the look of surprise on her face was enough to have him shoving his hands in his wet pockets i admire you he said again im not good with words these kinds of words damn it do you think im an idiot that i dont have a clue what kind of juggling act youвђyour whole familyвђhas to perform to be who you are and manage to have any sort of life along with it no looking away from him again she folded the damp portion of the rug back then dried the floor beneath it no i believe you understandвђas much as you can maybe more than another man might i think thats why in some ways were at odds why dont you look at me when you talk to me struggling for composure she pressed her lips together but her gaze was level when she lifted her head again its difficult for me excuse me a moment she rose and shoulders straight as a soldiers carried the damp towels back to the bath women del thought were a hell of a lot of work she came back went to a small cabinet and took out a decanter i think some brandy would help i was wrong she began as she poured two snifters tonight in the garden i was wrong to say those things to you i apologize oh shut up out of patience he snatched a snifter out of her hand cant you at least pretend to be gracious not when youre being stupid if i want an apology youll know it shed beat him to the damn apology wasnt it just like her he paced away and though he didnt care for it took a slug of the brandy when youre wrong ill let you know it he spun back temper alive on his face you hurt me it infuriated him to admit it i know the things i saidвђ not that that just pissed me off he dragged a hand through his hair you lied to me camilla or the next thing to it i started counting on you and i dont mean to clean up after me i started thinking about youвђabout usвђa certain way then it all blew up in my face i handled it badly it was selfishвђi was selfish she corrected i wanted some timeвђthen more timeвђto just be i ran i told myself it wasnt running away but it was last summer it was all suddenly too heavy too close i couldntвђ just be i couldnt just be she said quietly last summer there was an incident with the press not much more really no less than so many others the past few years but it had been building up inside me all of it until it just got to be too much i couldnt eat i wasnt sleeping well i couldnt concentrate on what i was meant to do iвђ no dont stop tell me this incident she said carefully wasnt so different from others but while it was happening i could hear myself screaming inside i thoughtвђi knewвђ that unless i got away for a while the next time it happened the screams wouldnt be just inside i was afraid i was having some sort of breakdown camilla for gods sake i shouldve spoken with my family she looked back at him because shed heard that unspoken question in his shocked tone they would have understood supported me given me time and room but i just couldnt bring myself to confess such a weakness poor camilla whos been given every privilege in life and moreвђso much moreвђthe unquestioning love from family is suddenly too delicate too fragile to deal with the responsibilities and difficulties of her rank and position thats malarkey the term made her laugh a little and steadied her it didnt feel like it at the time it felt desperate i was losing myself i dont know if you can understand that because you know yourself so intimately but i felt hounded and hunted and at the same time so unsteady about who i was inside what i wanted to do with my life beyond what i was supposed to do beyond duty i had no passion for anything and theres a horrible kind of emptiness to that he could imagine itвђthe pressures the demandsвђ and the nerves of steel it took to be who she was the courage he thought it had taken to break from all that to find the woman inside so you took off with a couple suitcases in a rental car to find it more or less and i did find it though as i said in the end i handled it badly we handled it badly he corrected i was over my head with you and that was when i thought you were a weird rich chick in some kind of trouble when i found out i figured youd used me for some kind of a lark she paled it was neverвђ i know that now i know it i had feelings for you ive never had for anyone else id worked myself up to tell youвђand came into the kitchen and heard you talking on the phone to marian eyes closed camilla let out a long breath the timing she murmured couldnt have been worse im surprised you didnt throw me out bodily thought about it he waited until her eyes opened met his again it felt better when i sat around feeling sorry for myself it took me a while to start considering what its like for you the people the press the protocol its pretty rough its not all that bad its just that sometimes you have toвђ breathe he finished yes tears swam into her eyes yes dont do that i cant have a rational conversation if you start dripping look i mean it plug the dam ive never told a woman i love her and im sure as hell not going to do it for the first time when shes blubbering im not blubbering but her voice broke on a sob as joy leaped into her she yanked open a drawer tugged out a lacetrimmed hankie and wiped at tears she wanted to leap again just leap but this time she knew to keep quiet so tell me ill get to it youre not fragile camilla not as a rule no cordinas crown jewel ive been catching up on some magazines he said when she stared at him a jewel has to have substance to keep its shine youve got substance that she managed to say is the most flattering thing youve ever said to me thats just because youre used to men telling you youre beautiful and i like your family my family yeah your mothers an amazing woman i like your brothers your cousins still havent quite figured outвђfor sureвђwhich is which but i like them and your sisters sweet he paused i meant that in a good way yes camilla smiled a little she is very sweet your aunts uncles theyre interesting people admirable i guess thats where you get it had some trouble with your father but i figure if i had a daughter and some guy wasвђ well its natural for him to want to kick my ass for putting hands on whats his he likes you hed like to roast me over a slow fire he thinks you have potential del snorted paced then glanced back at her does he yes of course if you make me unhappy that slow fire could still be arranged but i dont mean to pressure you youre a clever girl princess sharp sexy mind i could get past that face of yours but your mind kept hooking me in he gestured to the thick book on archaeology resting on her nightstand so you stayed interested yes i want to learn i really loved working with you i know i find the work fascinating not just because of you you know i want to learn for me first i needed something for myself something that pulled at me from the inside something beyond whats expectedвђmust be expected of me because of my position i wanted to find my passion and thanks to you i did im making arrangements to join dr lesuer on a project in france yeah lower paleolithic del shrugged hes good hell of a teacher too hes got patience i dont itd probably be less complicated to work with him then again itd be a shame for you to miss following through on bardville she took a deep breath are you suggesting that i join the project ive been thinking about outfitting a new site trailer the old ones a dump and i need to oversee a lot of lab work itd probably be practical to rent a house near the university maybe buy something the pressure in her chest was unbearable it was wonderful its understood in my family that when one of us takes a career or makes a personal commitment his or her official duties can be adjusted tell me listen im going to complain every time i have to gear up in some fancy suitвђand youll probably throw my own title in my face when i do he said walking to her naturally but ill carry my weight on what you bring to the deal and youll carry yours on what i bring she closed her eyes briefly are you asking me to maвђ he cut her off with a quick warning sound youve got some looks dont you he lifted her chin and cupped her face some fabulous looks you know i dont care how many times this face of yours is splashed over magazines i dont care about the gossip and bull written in them either that kind of stuff doesnt matter to me we know who we are tears clogged her throat shimmered in her eyes again nothing nothing he might have said could have told her more clearly he believed in her oh delaney i dont have a ring for you right now i dont care about that i do funny he thought as he lifted her hand studied those elegant fingers that he would feel it was important i want you to wear my ring his gaze shifted to hers and held if you dont want me to cry again youll hurry up okay okay try to give a woman a little romance you climbing down the palace walls is about all the romance i can take for one night thanks all the same he grinned im crazy about you every bit of you but especially your smart mouth thats lovely but i could probably stand just a little more romance than that if you can manage it i love you he took her face in his hands this time when a tear slid down her cheek he didnt mind camilla i love who you are i love who we are when were together i love the woman who mopped my kitchen floor and i love the woman i waltzed with tonight joy soared inside her both sides of that woman love all the sides of you you make me happy marry me make a life with me you wont always be comfortable but you sure as hell wont be bored ill marry you she touched her lips to his cheek and work with you and the other live with you and love you always she murmured as their lips met come back with me he pulled her close and just held on well work out the detailsвђwhatever has to be done i dont want to go back without you yes ill arrange it she tightened her grip well arrange it ill carve out some time offвђwhatever we need to deal with whatever we have to deal with dont worry here she thought was her passion her contentment and her love all wrapped in one well work it all out when theres a question well find the answer she rested her head on his shoulder smiling as she felt his lips brush over her hair the most important question she thought had been asked and answered
