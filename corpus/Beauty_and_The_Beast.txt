bayard taylors beauty and the beast beauty and the beast a story of old russia i we are about to relate a story of mingled fact and fancy the facts are borrowed from the russian author petjerski the fancy is our own our task will chiefly be to soften the outlines of incidents almost too sharp and rugged for literary use to supply them with the necessary coloring and sentiment and to give a coherent and proportioned shape to the irregular fragments of an old chronicle we know something from other sources of the customs described something of the character of the people from personal observation and may therefore the more freely take such liberties as we choose with the rude vigorous sketches of the russian original one who happens to have read the work of villebois can easily comprehend the existence of a state of society on the banks of the volga a hundred years ago which is now impossible and will soon become incredible what is strangest in our narrative has been declared to be true ii we are in kinesma a small town on the volga between kostroma and nijninovgorod the time is about the middle of the last century and the month october there was trouble one day in the palace of prince alexis of kinesma this edifice with its massive white walls and its pyramidal roofs of green copper stood upon a gentle mound to the eastward of the town overlooking it a broad stretch of the volga and the opposite shore on a similar hill to the westward stood the church glittering with its dozen bulging golden domes these two establishments divided the sovereignty of kinesma between them prince alexis owned the bodies of the inhabitants with the exception of a few merchants and tradesmen and the archimandrite sergius owned their souls but the shadow of the former stretched also over other villages far beyond the ring of the wooded horizon the number of his serfs was ten thousand and his rule over them was even less disputed than theirs over their domestic animals the inhabitants of the place had noticed with dismay that the slumberflag had not been hoisted on the castle although it was half an hour after the usual time so rare a circumstance betokened sudden wrath or disaster on the part of prince alexis long experience had prepared the people for anything that might happen and they were consequently not astonished at the singular event which presently transpired the fact is that in the first place the dinner had been prolonged full ten minutes beyond its accustomed limit owing to a discussion between the prince his wife the princess martha and their son prince boris the last was to leave for st petersburg in a fortnight and wished to have his departure preceded by a festival at the castle the princess martha was always ready to second the desires of her only child between the two they had pressed some twenty or thirty thousand rubles out of the old prince for the winter diversions of the young one the festival to be sure would have been a slight expenditure for a noble of such immense wealth as prince alexis but he never liked his wife and he took a stubborn pleasure in thwarting her wishes it was no satisfaction that boris resembled her in character that weak successor to the sovereignty of kinesma preferred a game of cards to a bear hunt and could never drink more than a quart of vodki without becoming dizzy and sick ugh prince alexis would cry with a shudder of disgust the whelp barks after the dam a state dinner he might give but a festival with dances dramatic representations burning tarbarrels and cannon no he knitted his heavy brows and drank deeply and his fiery gray eyes shot such incessant glances from side to side that boris and the princess martha could not exchange a single wink of silent advice the pet bear mishka plied with strong wines which prince alexis poured out for him into a golden basin became at last comically drunk and in endeavoring to execute a dance lost his balance and fell at full length on his back the prince burst into a yelling shrieking fit of laughter instantly the yellowhaired serfs in waiting the calmucks at the halldoor and the halfwitted dwarf who crawled around the table in his tow shirt began laughing in chorus as violently as they could the princess martha and prince boris laughed also and while the old mans eyes were dimmed with streaming tears of mirth quickly exchanged nods the sound extended all over the castle and was heard outside of the walls father said boris let us have the festival and mishka shall perform again prince paul of kostroma would strangle if he could see him good by st vladimir exclaimed prince alexis thou shalt have it my borka wheres simon petrovitch may the devil scorch that vagabond if he doesnt do better than the last time sasha little boris a broadshouldered serf stepped forward and stood with bowed head lock up simon petrovitch in the southwestern tower send the tailor and the girls to him to learn their parts search every one of them before they go in and if any one dares to carry vodki to the beast twentyfive lashes on the back sasha bowed again and departed simon petrovitch was the courtpoet of kinesma he had a mechanical knack of preparing allegorical diversions which suited the conventional taste of society at that time but he had also a failing he was rarely sober enough to write prince alexis therefore was in the habit of locking him up and placing a guard over him until the inspiration had done its work the most comely young serfs of both sexes were selected to perform the parts and the courttailor arranged for them the appropriate dresses it depended very much upon accident that is to say the mood of prince alexis whether simon petrovitch was rewarded with stripes or rubles the matter thus settled the prince rose from the table and walked out upon an overhanging balcony where an immense reclining armchair of stuffed leather was ready for his siesta he preferred this indulgence in the open air and although the weather was rapidly growing cold a pelisse of sables enabled him to slumber sweetly in the face of the north wind an attendant stood with the pelisse outspread another held the halyards to which was attached the great red slumberflag ready to run it up and announce to all kinesma that the noises of the town must cease a few seconds more and all things would have been fixed in their regular daily courses the prince in fact was just straightening his shoulders to receive the sables his eyelids were dropping and his eyes sinking mechanically with them fell upon the riverroad at the foot of the hill along this road walked a man wearing the long cloth caftan of a merchant prince alexis started and all slumber vanished out of his eyes he leaned forward for a moment with a quick eager expression then a loud roar like that of an enraged wild beast burst from his mouth he gave a stamp that shook the balcony dog he cried to the trembling attendent my cap my whip the sables fell upon the floor the cap and whip appeared in a twinkling and the red slumberflag was folded up again for the first time in several years as the prince stormed out of the castle the traveller below had heard the cry for it might have been heard half a mile he seemed to have a presentiment of evil for he had already set off towards the town at full speed to explain the occurence we must mention one of the princes many peculiar habits this was to invite strangers or merchants of the neighborhood to dine with him and after regaling them bountifully to take his pay in subjecting them to all sorts of outrageous tricks with the help of his band of willing domestics now this particular merchant had been invited and had attended but being a very wideawake shrewd person he saw what was coming and dexterously slipped away from the banquet without being perceived the prince vowed vengeance on discovering the escape and he was not a man to forget his word impelled by such opposite passions both parties ran with astonishing speed the merchant was the taller but his long caftan hastily ungirdled swung behind him and dragged in the air the short booted legs of the prince beat quicker time and he grasped his short heavy leathern whip more tightly as he saw the space diminishing they dashed into the town of kinesma a hundred yards apart the merchant entered the main street or bazaar looking rapidly to right and left as he ran in the hope of espying some place of refuge the terrible voice behind him cried stop scoundrel i have a crow to pick with you and the tradesmen in their shops looked on and laughed as well they might being unconcerned spectators of the fun the fugitive therefore kept straight on notwithstanding a pond of water glittered across the farther end of the street although prince alexis had gained considerably in the race such violent exercise after a heavy dinner deprived him of breath he again cried stop but the merchant answered no highness you may come to me but i will not go to you oh the villian growled the prince in a hoarse whisper for he had no more voice the pond cut of all further pursuit hastily kicking off his loose boots the merchant plunged into the water rather than encounter the princely whip which already began to crack and snap in fierce anticipation prince alexis kicked off his boots and followed the pond gradually deepened and in a minute the tall merchant stood up to his chin in the icy water and his short pursuer likewise but out of striking distance the latter coaxed and entreated but the victim kept his ground you lie highness he said boldly if you want me come to me ahhh roared the prince with chattering teeth what a stubborn rascal you are come here and i give you my word that i will not hurt you nay seeing that the man did not move you shall dine with me as often as you please you shall be my friend by st vladimir i like you make the sign of the cross and swear it by all the saints said the merchant composedly with a grim smile on his face the prince stepped back and shiveringly obeyed both then waded out sat down upon the ground and pulled on their boots and presently the people of kinesma beheld the dripping pair walking side by side up the street conversing in the most cordial manner the merchant dried his clothes from within at the castle table a fresh keg of old cognac was opened and although the slumberflag was not unfurled that afternoon it flew from the staff and hushed the town nearly all the next day iii the festival granted on behalf of prince boris was one of the grandest ever given at the castle in character it was a singular cross between the old muscovite revel and the french entertainments which were then introduced by the empress elizabeth all the nobility for fifty versts around including prince paul and the chief families of kostroma were invited simon petrovitch had been so carefully guarded that his work was actually completed and the parts distributed his superintendence of the performance however was still a matter of doubt as it was necessary to release him from the tower and after several days of forced abstinence he always manifested a raging appetite prince alexis in spite of this doubt had been assured by boris that the dramatic part of the entertainment would not be a failure when he questioned sasha the poets strongshouldered guard the latter winked familiarly and answered with a proverb i sit on the shore and wait for the wind which was as much as to say that sasha had little fear of the result the tables were spread in the great hall where places for one hundred chosen guests were arranged on the floor while the three or four hundred of minor importance were provided for in the galleries above by noon the whole party were assembled the halls and passages of the castle were already permeated with rich and unctuous smells and a delicate nose might have picked out and arranged by their finer or coarser vapors the dishes preparing for the upper and lower tables one of the parasites of prince alexis a dilapidated nobleman officiated as grand marshal an office which more than compensated for the savage charity he received for it was performed in continual fear and trembling the prince had felt the stick of the great peter upon his own back and was ready enough to imitate any custom of the famous monarch an orchestra composed principally of horns and brass instruments occupied a separate gallery at one end of the dininghall the guests were assembled in the adjoining apartments according to their rank and when the first loud blast of the instruments announced the beginning of the banquet two very differently attired and freighted processions of servants made their appearance at the same time those intended for the princely table numbered two hundred two for each guest they were the handsomest young men among the ten thousand serfs clothed in loose white trousers and shirts of pink or lilac silk their soft golden hair parted in the middle fell upon their shoulders and a band of goldthread about the brow prevented it from sweeping the dishes they carried they entered the receptionroom bearing huge trays of sculptured silver upon which were anchovies the finest finnish caviar sliced oranges cheese and crystal flagons of cognac rum and kummel there were fewer servants for the remaining guests who were gathered in a separate chamber and regaled with the common black caviar onions bread and vodki at the second blast of trumpets the two companies set themselves in motion and entered the dininghall at opposite ends our business however is only with the principal personages so we will allow the common crowd quietly to mount to the galleries and satisfy their senses with the coarser viands while their imagination is stimulated by the sight of the splendor and luxury below prince alexis entered first with a pompous mincing gait leading the princess martha by the tips of her fingers he wore a caftan of green velvet laced with gold a huge vest of crimson brocade and breeches of yellow satin a wig resembling clouds boiling in the confluence of opposing winds surged from his low broad forehead and flowed upon his shoulders as his small fiery eyes swept the hall every servant trembled he was as severe at the commencement as he was reckless at the close of a banquet the princess martha wore a robe of pink satin embroidered with flowers made of small pearls and a train and headdress of crimson velvet her emeralds were the finest outside of moscow and she wore them all her pale weak frightened face was quenched in the dazzle of the green fires which shot from her forehead ears and bosom as she moved prince paul of kostroma and the princess nadejda followed but on reaching the table the gentlemen took their seats at the head while the ladies marched down to the foot their seats were determined by their relative rank and woe to him who was so ignorant or so absentminded as to make a mistake the servants had been carefully trained in advance by the grand marshal and whoever took a place above his rank or importance found when he came to sit down that his chair had miraculously disappeared or not noticing the fact seated himself absurdly and violently upon the floor the prince at the head of the table and the princess at the foot with their nearest guests of equal rank ate from dishes of massive gold the others from silver as soon as the last of the company had entered the hall a crowd of jugglers tumblers dwarfs and calmucks followed crowding themselves into the corners under the galleries where they awaited the conclusion of the banquet to display their tricks and scolded and pummelled each other in the mean time on one side of prince alexis the bear mishka took his station by order of prince boris he had been kept from wine for several days and his small eyes were keener and hungrier than usual as he rose now and then impatiently and sat upon his hind legs he formed a curious contrast to the princes other supporter the idiot who sat also in his towshirt with a large pewter basin in his hand it was difficult to say whether the beast was most man or the man most beast they eyed each other and watched the motions of their lord with equal jealousy and the dismal whine of the bear found an echo in the drawling slavering laugh of the idiot the prince glanced form one to the other they put him in a capital humor which was not lessened as he perceived an expression of envy pass over the face of prince paul the dinner commenced with a botvinia something between a soup and a salad of wonderful composition it contained cucumbers cherries salt fish melons bread salt pepper and wine while it was being served four huge fishermen dressed to represent mermen of the volga naked to the waist with hair crowned with reeds legs finned with silver tissue from the knees downward and preposterous scaly tails which dragged helplessly upon the floor entered the hall bearing a broad shallow tank of silver in the tank flapped and swam four superb sterlets their ridgy backs rising out of the water like those of alligators great applause welcomed this new and classical adaptation of the old custom of showing the living fish before cooking them to the guests at the table the invention was due to simon petrovitch and was if the truth must be confessed the result of certain carefully measured supplies of brandy which prince boris himself had carried to the imprisoned poet after the sterlets had melted away to their backbones and the roasted geese had shrunk into drumsticks and breastplates and here and there a guests ears began to redden with more rapid blood prince alexis judged that the time for diversion had arrived he first filled up the idiots basin with fragments of all the dishes within his reach fish stewed fruits goose fat bread boiled cabbage and beer the idiot grinning with delight all the while and singing ne uyesjai golubchik moi dont go away my little pigeon between the handfuls which he crammed into his mouth the guests roared with laughter especially when a juggler or calmuck stole out from under the gallery and pretended to have designs upon the basin mishka the bear had also been well fed and greedily drank ripe old malaga from the golden dish but alas he would not dance sitting up on his hind legs with his fore paws hanging before him he cast a drunken languishing eye upon the company lolled out his tongue and whined with an almost human voice the domestics secretly incited by the grand marshal exhausted their ingenuity in coaxing him but in vain finally one of them took a goblet of wine in one hand and embracing mishka with the other began to waltz the bear stretched out his paw and clumsily followed the movements whirling round and round after the enticing goblet the orchestra struck up and the spectacle though not exactly what prince alexis wished was comical enough to divert the company immensely but the close of the performance was not upon the programme the impatient bear getting no nearer his goblet hugged the man violently with the other paw striking his claws through the thin shirt the dancemeasure was lost the legs of the two tangled and they fell to the floor the bear undermost with a growl of rage and disappointment he brought his teeth together through the mans arm and it might have fared badly with the latter had not the goblet been refilled by some one and held to the animals nose then releasing his hold he sat up again drank another bottle and staggered out of the hall now the health of prince alexis was drunk by the guests on the floor of the hall in champagne by those in the galleries in kislischi and hydromel the orchestra played a choir of serfs sang an ode by simon petrovitch in which the departure of prince boris was mentioned the tumblers began to posture the jugglers came forth and played their tricks and the cannon on the ramparts announced to all kinesma and far up and down the volga that the company were rising from the table half an hour later the great red slumberflag floated over the castle all slept except the serf with the wounded arm the nervous grand marshal and simon petrovich with his band of dramatists guarded by the indefatigable sasha all others slept and the curious crowd outside listening to the music stole silently away down in kinesma the mothers ceased to scold their children and the merchants whispered to each other in the bazaar the captains of vessels floating on the volga directed their men by gestures the mechanics laid aside hammer and axe and lighted their pipes great silence fell upon the land and continued unbroken so long as prince alexis and his guests slept the sleep of the just and the tipsy by night however they were all awake and busily preparing for the diversions of the evening the ballroom was illuminated by thousands of waxlights so connected with inflammable threads that the wicks could all be kindled in a moment a pyramid of tarbarrels had been erected on each side of the castlegate and every hill or mound on the opposite bank of the volga was similarly crowned when to a stately march the musicians blowing their loudest prince alexis and princess martha led the way to the ballroom the signal was given candles and tarbarres burst into flame and not only within the castle but over the landscape for five or six versts around everything was bright and clear in the fiery day then the noises of kinesma were not only permitted but encouraged mead and qvass flowed in the very streets and the castle trumpets could not be heard for the sound of troikas and balalaikas after the polonaise and a few stately minuets copied from the court of elizabeth the company were ushered into the theatre the hour of simon petrovitch had struck with the inspiration smuggled to him by prince boris he had arranged a performance which he felt to be his masterpiece anxiety as to its reception kept him sober the overture had ceased the spectators were all in their seats and now the curtain rose the background was a growth of enormous sickly toadstools supposed to be clouds on the stage stood a girl of eighteen the handsomest in kinesma in hoops and satin petticoat powdered hair patches and highheeled shoes she held a fan in one hand and a bunch of marigolds in the other after a deep and graceful curtsy to the company she came forward and said i am the goddess venus i have come to olympus to ask some questions of jupiter thunder was heard and a car rolled upon the stage jupiter sat therein in a blue coat yellow vest ruffled shirt and threecornered hat one hand held a bunch of thunderbolts which he occasionally lifted and shook the other a goldheaded cane here am i jupiter said he what does venus desire a poetical dialogue then followed to the effect that the favorite of the goddess prince alexis of kinesma was about sending his son prince boris into the gay world wherein himself had already displayed all the gifts of all the divinities of olympus he claimed from her venus like favors for his son was it possible to grant them jupiter dropped his head and meditated he could not answer the question at once apollo the graces and the muses must be consulted there were few precedents where the son had succeeded in rivalling the father yet the fathers pious wishes could not be overlooked venus said what i asked for prince alexis was for his sake what i ask for the son is for the fathers sake jupiter shook his thunderbolt and called apollo instantly the stage was covered with explosive and coruscating fires red blue and golden and amid smoke and glare and fizzing noises and strong chemical smells apollo dropped down from above he was accustomed to heat and smoke being the cooks assistant and was sweated down to a weight capable of being supported by the invisible wires he wore a yellow caftan and wide blue silk trousers his yellow hair was twisted around and glued fast to gilded sticks which stood out from his head in a circle and represented rays of light he first bowed to prince alexis then to the guests then to jupiter then to venus the matter was explained to him he promised to do what he could towards favoring the world with a second generation of the beauty grace intellect and nobility of character which had already won his regard he thought however that their gifts were unnecessary since the model was already in existence and nothing more could be done than to imitate it here there was another meaning bow towards prince alexis a bow in which jupiter and venus joined this was the great point of the evening in the opinion of simon petrovitch he peeped through a hole in one of the clouds and seeing the delight of prince alexis and the congratulations of his friends immediately took a large glass of cognac the graces were then summoned and after them the muses all in hoops powder and paint their songs had the same burden intense admiration of the father and goodwill for the son underlaid with a delicate doubt the close was a chorus of all the deities and semideities in praise of the old prince with the accompaniment of fireworks apollo rose through the air like a frog with his blue legs and yellow arms wide apart jupiters chariot rolled off venus bowed herself back against a mouldy cloud and the muses came forward in a bunch with a wreath of laurel which they placed upon the venerated head sasha was dispatched to bring the poet that he might receive his wellearned praise and reward but alas for simon petrovitch his legs had already doubled under him he was awarded fifty rubles and a new caftan which he was not in a condition to accept until several days afterward the supper which followed resembled the dinner except that there were fewer dishes and more bottles when the closing course of sweatmeats had either been consumed or transferred to the pockets of the guests the princess martha retired with the ladies the guests of lower rank followed and there remained only some fifteen or twenty who were thereupon conducted by prince alexis to a smaller chamber where he pulled off his coat lit his pipe and called for brandy the others followed his example and their revelry wore out the night such was the festival which preceded the departure of prince boris for st petersburg iv before following the young prince and his fortunes in the capital we must relate two incidents which somewhat disturbed the ordered course of life in the castle of kinesma during the first month or two after his departure it must be stated as one favorable trait in the character of prince alexis that however brutally he treated his serfs he allowed no other man to oppress them all they had and were their services bodies lives belonged to him hence injustice towards them was disrespect towards their lord under the fear which his barbarity inspired lurked a brutelike attachment kept alive by the recognition of this quality one day it was reported to him that gregor a merchant in the bazaar at kinesma had cheated the wife of one of his serfs in the purchase of a piece of cloth mounting his horse he rode at once to gregors booth called for the cloth and sent the entire piece to the woman in the merchants name as a confessed act of reparation now gregor my child said he as he turned his horses head have a care in future and play me no more dishonest tricks do you hear i shall come and take your business in hand myself if the like happens again not ten days passed before the like or something fully as bad did happen gregor must have been a new comer in kinesma or he would not have tried the experiment in an hour from the time it was announced prince alexis appeared in the bazaar with a short whip under his arm he dismounted at the booth with an ironical smile on his face which chilled the very marrow in the merchants bones ah gregor my child he shouted you have already forgotten my commands holy st nicholas what a bad memory the boy has why he cant be trusted to do business i must attend to the shop myself out of the way march he swung his terrible whip and gregor with his two assistants darted under the counter and made their escape the prince then entered the booth took up a yardstick and cried out in a voice which could be heard from one end of the town to the other ladies and gentlemen have the kindness to come and examine our stock of goods we have silks and satins and all kinds of ladies wear also velvet cloth cotton and linen for the gentlemen will your lordships deign to choose here are stockings and handkerchiefs of the finest we understand how to measure your lordships and we sell cheap we give no change and take no small money whoever has no cash may have credit every thing sold below cost on account of closing up the establishment ladies and gentlemen give us a call everybody in kinesma flocked to the booth and for three hours prince alexis measured and sold either for scant cash or long credit until the last article had been disposed of and the shelves were empty there was great rejoicing in the community over the bargains made that day when all was over gregor was summoned and the cash received paid into his hands it wont take you long to count it said the prince but here is a list of debts to be collected which will furnish you with pleasant occupation and enable you to exercise your memory would your worship condescend to take dinner today with your humble assistant he would esteem it a favor to be permitted to wait upon you with whatever his poor house can supply gregor gave a glance at the whip under the princes arm and begged to be excused but the latter would take no denial and carried out the comedy to the end by giving the merchant the place of honor at his table and dismissing him with the present of a fine pup of his favorite breed perhaps the animal acted as a mnemonic symbol for gregor was never afterwards accused of forgetfulness if this trick put the prince in a good humor some thing presently occurred which carried him to the opposite extreme while taking his customary siesta one afternoon a wild young fellow one of his noble poor relations who sponged at the castle happened to pass along a corridor outside of the very hall where his highness was snoring two ladies in waiting looked down from an upper window the young fellow perceived them and made signs to attract their attention having succeeded in this he attempted by all sorts of antics and grimaces to make them laugh or speak but he failed for the slumberflag waved over them and its fear was upon them then in a freak of incredible rashness he sang in a loud voice the first line of a popular ditty and took to his heels no one had ever before dared to insult the sacred quiet the prince was on his feet in a moment and rushed into the corridor dropping his mantle of sables by the way shouting bring me the wretch who sang the domestics scattered before him for his face was terrible to look upon some of them had heard the voice indeed but not one of them had seen the culprit who al ready lay upon a heap of hay in one of the stables and appeared to be sunk in innocent sleep who was it who was it yelled the prince foaming at the mouth with rage as he rushed from chamber to chamber at last he halted at the top of the great flight of steps leading into the courtyard and repeated his demand in a voice of thunder the servants trembling kept at a safe distance and some of them ventured to state that the offender could not be discovered the prince turned and entered one of the state apartments whence came the sound of porcelain smashed on the floor and mirrors shivered on the walls whenever they heard that sound the immates of the castle knew that a hurricane was let loose they deliberated hurriedly and anxiously what was to be done in his fits of blind animal rage there was nothing of which the prince was not capable and the fit could be allayed only by finding a victim no one however was willing to be a curtius for the others and meanwhile the storm was increasing from minute to minute some of the more active and shrewd of the household pitched upon the leader of the band a simpleminded goodnatured serf named waska they entreated him to take upon himself the crime of having sung offering to have his punishment mitigated in every possible way he was proof against their tears but not against the money which they finally offered in order to avert the storm the agreement was made although waska both scratched his head and shook it as he reflected upon the probable result the prince after his work of destruction again appeared upon the steps and with hoarse voice and flashing eyes began to announce that every soul in the castle should receive a hundred lashes when a noise was heard in the court and amid cries of here he is weve got him highness the poor waska bound hand and foot was brought forward they placed him at the bottom of the steps the prince descended until the two stood face to face the others looked on from courtyard door and window a pause ensued during which no one dared to breathe at last prince alexis spoke in a loud and terrible voice it was you who sang it yes your highness it was i waska replied in a scarcely audible tone dropping his head and mechanically drawing his shoulders together as if shrinking from the coming blow it was full three minutes before the prince again spoke he still held the whip in his hand his eyes fixed and the muscles of his face rigid all at once the spell seemed to dissolve his hand fell and he said in his ordinary voice you sing remarkably well go now you shall have ten rubles and an embroidered caftan for your singing but any one would have made a great mistake who dared to awaken prince alexis a second time in the same manner v prince boris in st petersburg adopted the usual habits of his class he dressed elegantly he drove a dashing troika he played and lost more frequently than he won he took no special pains to shun any form of fashionable dissipation his money went fast it is true but twentyfive thousand rubles was a large sum in those days and boris did not inherit his fathers expensive constitution he was presented to the empress but his thin face and mild melancholy eyes did not make much impression upon that ponderous woman he frequented the salons of the nobility but saw no face so beautiful as that of parashka the serfmaiden who personated venus for simon petrovitch the fact is he had a dim undeveloped instinct of culture and a crude halfconscious worship of beauty both of which qualities found just enough nourishment in the life of the capital to tantalize and never satisfy his nature he was excited by his new experience but hardly happier athough but threeandtwenty he would never know the rich vital glow with which youth rushes to clasp all forms of sensation he had seen almost daily in his fathers castle excess in its most excessive development it had grown to be repulsive and he knew not how to fill the void in his life with a single spark of genius and a little more culture he might have become a passable author or artist but he was doomed to be one of those deaf and dumb natures that see the movements of the lips of others yet have no conception of sound no wonder his savage old father looked upon him with contempt for even his vices were without strength or character the dark winter days passed by one by one and the first week of lent had already arrived to subdue the glittering festivities of the court when the only genuine adventure of the season happened to the young prince for adventures in the conventional sense of the word he was not distinguished whatever came to him must come by its own force or the force of destiny one raw gloomy evening as dusk was setting in he saw a female figure in a droschky which was about turning from the great morskoi into the gorokhovaya pea street he noticed listlessly that the lady was dressed in black closely veiled and appeared to be urging the istvostchik driver to make better speed the latter cut his horse sharply it sprang forward just at the turning and the droschky striking a lamppost was instantly overturned the lady hurled with great force upon the solidly frozen snow lay motionless which the driver observing he righted the sled and drove off at full speed without looking behind him it was not inhumanity but fear of the knout that hurried him away prince boris looked up and down the morskoi but perceived no one near at hand he then knelt upon the snow lifted the ladys head to his knee and threw back her veil a face so lovely in spite of its deadly pallor he had never before seen never had he even imagined so perfect an oval such a sweet fair forehead such delicately pencilled brows so fine and straight a nose such wonderful beauty of mouth and chin it was fortunate that she was not very severely stunned for prince boris was not only ignorant of the usual modes of restoration in such cases but he totally forgot their necessity in his rapt contemplation of the ladys face presently she opened her eyes and they dwelt expressionless but bewildering in their darkness and depth upon his own while her consciousness of things slowly returned she strove to rise and boris gently lifted and supported her she would have withdrawn from his helping arm but was still too weak from the shock he also was confused and strange to say embarrassed but he had selfpossession enough to shout davei here at random the call was answered from the admiralty square a sled dashed up the gorokhovaya and halted beside him taking the single seat he lifted her gently upon his lap and held her very tenderly in his arms where asked the istvostchik boris was about to answer anywhere but the lady whispered in a voice of silver sweetness the name of a remote street near the smolnoi church as the prince wrapped the ends of his sable pelisse about her he noticed that her furs were of the common foxskin worn by the middle classes they with her heavy boots and the threadbare cloth of her garments by no means justified his first suspicion that she was a grande dame engaged in some romantic adventure she was not more than nineteen or twenty years of age and he felt without knowing what it was the atmosphere of sweet womanly purity and innocence which surrounded her the shyness of a lost boyhood surprised him by the time they had reached the litenie she had fully recovered her consciousness and a portion of her strength she drew away from him as much as the narrow sled would allow you have been very kind sir and i thank you she said but i am now able to go home without your further assistance by no means lady said the prince the streets are rough and here are no lamps if a second accident were to happen you would be helpless will you not allow me to protect you she looked him in the face in the dusky light she saw not the peevish weary features of the worldling but only the imploring softness of his eyes the full and perfect honesty of his present emotion she made no further objection perhaps she was glad that she could trust the elegant stranger boris never before at a loss for words even in the presence of the empress was astonished to find how awkward were his attempts at conversation she was presently the more selfpossessed of the two and nothing was ever so sweet to his ears as the few commonplace remarks she uttered in spite of the darkness and the chilly air the sled seemed to fly like lightning before he supposed they had made half the way she gave a sign to the istvostchik and they drew up before a plain house of squared logs the two lower windows were lighted and the dark figure of an old man with a skullcap upon his head was framed in one of them it vanished as the sled stopped the door was thrown open and the man came forth hurriedly followed by a russian nurse with a lantern helena my child art thou come at last what has befallen thee he would evidently have said more but the sight of prince boris caused him to pause while a quick shade of suspicion and alarm passed over his face the prince stepped forward instantly relieved of his unaccustomed timidity and rapidly described the accident the old nurse katinka had meanwhile assisted the lovely helena into the house the old man turned to follow shivering in the nightair suddenly recollecting himself he begged the prince to enter and take some refreshments but with the air and tone of a man who hopes that his invitation will not be accepted if such was really his hope he was disappointed for boris instantly commanded the istvostchik to wait for him and entered the humble dwelling the apartment into which he was ushered was spacious and plainly yet not shabbily furnished a violoncello and clavichord with several portfolios of music and scattered sheets of ruled paper proclaimed the profession or the taste of the occupant having excused himself a moment to look after his daughters condition the old man on his return found boris turning over the leaves of a musical work you see my profession he said i teach music do you not compose asked the prince that was once my ambition i was a pupil of sebastian bach but circumstances necessity brought me here other lives changed the direction of mine it was right you mean your daughters the prince gently suggested hers and her mothers our story was well known in st petersburg twenty years ago but i suppose no one recollects it now my wife was the daughter of a baron von plauen and loved music and myself better than her home and a titled bridegroom she escaped we united our lives suffered and were happy together and she died that is all further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of helena with steaming glasses of tea she was even lovelier than before her closefitting dress revealed the symmetry of her form and the quiet unstudied grace of her movements although her garments were of wellworn material the lace which covered her bosom was genuine point dalencon of an old and rare pattern boris felt that her air and manner were thoroughly noble he rose and saluted her with the profoundest respect in spite of the singular delight which her presence occasioned him he was careful not to prolong his visit beyond the limits of strict etiquette his name boris alexeivitch only revealed to his guests the name of his father without his rank and when he stated that he was employed in one of the departments which was true in a measure for he was a staff officer they could only look upon him as being at best a member of some family whose recent elevation to the nobility did not release them from the necessity of government service of course he employed the usual pretext of wishing to study music and either by that or some other stratagem managed to leave matters in such a shape that a second visit could not occasion surprise as the sled glided homewards over the crackling snow he was obliged to confess the existence of a new and powerful excitement was it the chance of an adventure such as certain of his comrades were continually seeking he thought not no decidedly not was it could it be love he really could not tell he had not the slightset idea what love was like vi it was something at least that the plastic and not unvirtuous nature of the young man was directed towards a definite object the elements out of which he was made although somewhat diluted were active enough to make him uncomfortable so long as they remained in a confused state he had very little power of introversion but he was sensible that his temperament was changing that he grew more cheerful and contented with life that a chasm somewhere was filling up just in proportion as his acquaintance with the old musicmaster and his daughter became more familiar his visits were made so brief were so adroitly timed and accounted for by circumstances that by the close of lent he could feel justified in making the easter call of a friend and claim its attendant privileges without fear of being repulsed that easter call was an era in his life at the risk of his wealth and rank being suspected he dressed himself in new and rich garments and hurried away towards the smolnoi the old nurse katinka in her scarlet gown opened the door for him and was the first to say christ is arisen what could he do but give her the usual kiss formerly he had kissed hundreds of serfs men and women on the sacred anniversary with a passive goodwill but katinkas kiss seemed bitter and he secretly rubbed his mouth after it the musicmaster came next grisly though he might be he was the st peter who stood at the gate of heaven then entered helena in white like an angel he took her hand pronounced the easter greeting and scarcely waited for the answer truly he has arisen before his lips found the way to hers for a second they warmly trembled and glowed together and in another second some new and sweet and subtle relation seemed to be established between their natures that night prince boris wrote a long letter to his chere maman in piquantly misspelt french giving her the gossip of the court and such family news as she usually craved the purport of the letter however was only disclosed in the final paragraph and then in so negative a way that it is doubtful whether the princess martha fully understood it poing de mariajes pour moix he wrote but we will drop the original i dont think of such a thing yet pashkoff dropped a hint the other day but i kept my eyes shut perhaps you remember her fat thick lips and crooked teeth natalie d said to me have you ever been in love prince have i maman i did not know what answer to make what is love how does one feel when one has it they laugh at it here and of course i should not wish to do what is laughable give me a hint forewarned is forearmed you know etc etc perhaps the princess martha did suspect something perhaps some word in her sons letter touched a secret spot far back in her memory and renewed a dim if not very intelligible pain she answered his question at length in the style of the popular french romances of that day she had much to say of dew and roses turtledoves and the arrows of cupid ask thyself she wrote whether felicity comes with her presence and distraction with her absence whether her eyes make the morning brighter for thee and her tears fall upon thy heart like molten lava whether heaven would be black and dismal without her company and the flames of hell turn into roses under her feet it was very evident that the good princess martha had never felt nay did not comprehend a passion such as she described prince boris however whose veneration for his mother was unbounded took her words literally and applied the questions to himself although he found it difficult in good faith and sincerity to answer all of them affirmatively he was puzzled for instance to know the sensation of molten lava falling upon the heart yet the general conclusion was inevitable helena was necessary to his happiness instead of returning to kinesma for the summer as had been arranged he determined to remain in st petersburg under the pretence of devoting himself to military studies this change of plan occasioned more disappointment to the princess martha than vexation to prince alexis the latter only growled at the prospect of being called upon to advance a further supply of rubles slightly comforting himself with the muttered reflection perhaps the brat will make a man of himself after all it was not many weeks in fact before the expected petition came to hand the princess martha had also foreseen it and instructed her son how to attack his fathers weak side the latter was furiously jealous of certain other noblemen of nearly equal wealth who were with him at the court of peter the great as their sons now were at that of elizabeth boris compared the splendor of these young noblemen with his own moderate estate fabled a few adventures and drinkingbouts and announced his determination of doing honor to the name which prince alexis of kinesma had left behind him in the capital there was cursing at the castle when the letter arrived many serfs felt the sting of the short whip the slumberflag was hoisted five minutes later than usual and the consumption of cognac was alarming but no mirror was smashed and when prince alexis read the letter to his poor relations he even chuckled over some portions of it boris had boldly demanded twenty thousand rubles in the desperate hope of receiving half that amount and he had calculated correctly before midsummer he was helenas accepted lover not however until then when her father had given his consent to their marriage in the autumn did he disclose his true rank the old mans face lighted up with a glow of selfish satisfaction but helena quietly took her lovers hand and said whatever you are boris i will be faithful to you vii leaving boris to discover the exact form and substance of the passion of love we will return for a time to the castle of kinesma whether the princess martha conjectured what had transpired in st petersburg or was partially informed of it by her son cannot now be ascertained she was sufficiently weak timid and nervous to be troubled with the knowledge of the stratagem in which she had assisted in order to procure money and that the everpresent consciousness thereof would betray itself to the sharp eyes of her husband certain it is that the demeanor of the latter towards her and his household began to change about the end of the summer he seemed to have a haunting suspicion that in some way he had been or was about to be overreached he grew peevish suspicious and more violent than ever in his excesses when mishka the dissipated bear already described bit off one of the ears of basil a hunter belonging to the castle and basil drew his knife and plunged it into mishkas heart prince alexis punished the hunter by cutting off his other ear and sending him away to a distant estate a serf detected in eating a few of the pickled cherries intended for the princes botvinia was placed in a cask and pickled cherries packed around him up to the chin there he was kept until almost flayed by the acid it was ordered that these two delinquents should never afterwards be called by any other names than cropear and cherry but the princes severest joke which strange to say in no wise lessened his popularity among the serfs occurred a month or two later one of his leading passions was the chase especially the chase in his own forests with from one to two hundred men and no one to dispute his lordship on such occasions a huge barrel of wine mounted upon a sled always accompanied the crowd and the quantity which the hunters received depended upon the satisfaction of prince alexis with the game they collected winter had set in early and suddenly and one day as the prince and his retainers emerged from the forest with their forenoons spoil and found themselves on the bank of the volga the water was already covered with a thin sheet of ice fires were kindled a score or two of hares and a brace of deer were skinned and the flesh placed on sticks to broil skins of mead foamed and hissed into the wooden bowls and the cask of unbroached wine towered in the midst prince alexis had a good appetite the meal was after his heart and by the time he had eaten a hare and half a flank of venison followed by several bowls of fiery wine he was in the humor for sport he ordered a hole cut in the upper side of the barrel as it lay then getting astride of it like a grisly bacchus he dipped out the liquor with a ladle and plied his thirsty serfs until they became as recklessly savage as he they were scattered over a slope gently falling from the dark dense firforest towards the volga where it terminated in a rocky palisade ten to fifteen feet in height the fires blazed and crackled merrily in the frosty air the yells and songs of the carousers were echoed back from the opposite shore of the river the chill atmosphere the lowering sky and the approaching night could not touch the blood of that wild crowd their faces glowed and their eyes sparkled they were ready for any deviltry which their lord might suggest some began to amuse themselves by flinging the cleanpicked bones of deer and hare along the glassy ice of the volga prince alexis perceiving this diverson cried out in ecstasy oh by st nicholas the miracleworker ill give you better sport than that ye knaves heres the very place for a reisak do you hear me children a reisak could there be better ice and then the rocks to jump from come children come waska ivan daniel you dogs over with you now the reisak was a gymnastic performance peculiar to old russia and therefore needs to be described it could become popular only among a people of strong physical qualities and in a country where swift rivers freeze rapidly from sudden cold hence we are of the opinion that it will not be introduced into our own winter diversions a spot is selected where the water is deep and the current tolerably strong the ice must be about half an inch in thickness the performer leaps head foremost from a rock or platform bursts through the ice is carried under by the current comes up some distance below and bursts through again both skill and strength are required to do the feat successfully waska ivan daniel and a number of others sprang to the brink of the rocks and looked over the wall was not quite perpendicular some large fragments having fallen from above and lodged along the base it would therefore require a bold leap to clear the rocks and strike the smooth ice they hesitated and no wonder prince alexis howled with rage and disappointment the devil take you for a pack of whimpering hounds he cried holy saints they are afraid to make a reisak ivan crossed himself and sprang he cleared the rocks but instead of bursting through the ice with his head fell at full length upon his back o knave yelled the prince not to know where his head is thinks its his back give him fifteen stripes which was instantly done the second attempt was partially successful one of the hunters broke through the ice head foremost going down but he failed to come up again so the feat was only half performed the prince became more furiously excited this is the way im treated he cried he forgets all about finishing the reisak and goes to chasing sterlet may the carps eat him up for an ungrateful vagabond here you beggars addressing the poor relations take your turn and let me see whether you are men only one of the frightened parasites had the courage to obey on reaching the brink he shut his eyes in mortal fear and made a leap at random the next moment he lay on the edge of the ice with one leg broken against a fragment of rock this capped the climax of the princes wrath he fell into a state bordering on despair tore his hair gnashed his teeth and wept bitterly they will be the death of me was his lament not a man among them it wasnt so in the old times such beautiful reisaks as i have seen but the people are becoming women hares chickens skunks villains will you force me to kill you you have dishonored and disgraced me i am ashamed to look my neighbors in the face was ever a man so treated the serfs hung down their heads feeling somehow responsible for their masters misery some of them wept out of a stupid sympathy with his tears all at once he sprang down from the cask crying in a gay triumphant tone i have it bring me cropear hes the fellow for a reisak he can make three one after another one of the boldest ventured to suggest that cropear had been sent away in disgrace to another of the princes estates bring him here i say take horses and dont draw rein going or coming i will not stir from this spot until cropear comes with these words he mounted the barrel and recommenced ladling out the wine huge fires were made for the night was falling and the cold had become intense fresh game was skewered and set to broil and the tragic interlude of the revel was soon forgotten towards midnight the sound of hoofs was heard and the messengers arrived with cropear but although the latter had lost his ears he was not inclined to split his head the ice meanwhile had become so strong that a cannonball would have made no impression upon it cropear simply threw down a stone heavier than himself and as it bounced and slid along the solid floor said to prince alexis am i to go back highness or stay here here my son thourt a man come hither to me taking the serfs head in his hands he kissed him on both cheeks then he rode homeward through the dark iron woods seated astride on the barrel and steadying himself with his arms around cropears and waskas necks viii the health of the princess martha always delicate now began to fail rapidly she was less and less able to endure her husbands savage humors and lived almost exclusively in her own apartments she never mentioned the name of boris in his presence for it was sure to throw him into a paroxysm of fury floating rumors in regard to the young prince had reached him from the capital and nothing would convince him that his wife was not cognizant of her sons doings the poor princess clung to her boy as to all that was left her of life and tried to prop her failing strength with the hope of his speedy return she was now too helpless to thwart his wishes in any way but she dreaded more than death the terrible something which would surely take place between father and son if her conjectures should prove to be true one day in the early part of november she received a letter from boris announcing his marriage she had barely strength and presence of mind enough to conceal the paper in her bosom before sinking in a swoon by some means or other the young prince had succeeded in overcoming all the obstacles to such a step probably the favor of the empress was courted in order to obtain her consent the money he had received he wrote would be sufficient to maintain them for a few months though not in a style befitting their rank he was proud and happy the princess helena would be the reigning beauty of the court when he should present her but he desired the sanction of his parents to the marriage before taking his place in society he would write immediately to his father and hoped that if the news brought a storm mishka might be on hand to divert its force as on a former occasion under the weight of this imminent secret the princess martha could neither eat nor sleep her body wasted to a shadow at every noise in the castle she started and listened in terror fearing that the news had arrived prince boris no doubt found his courage fail him when he set about writing the promised letter for a fortnight elapsed before it made its appearance prince alexis received it on his return from the chase he read it hastily through uttered a prolonged roar like that of a wounded bull and rushed into the castle the sound of breaking furniture of crashing porcelain and shivered glass came from the state apartments the domestics fell on their knees and prayed the princess who heard the noise and knew what it portended became almost insensible from fright one of the upper servants entered a chamber as the prince was in the act of demolishing a splendid malachite table which had escaped all his previous attacks he was immediately greeted with a cry of send the princess to me her highness is not able to leave her chamber the man replied how it happened he could never afterwards describe but he found himself lying in a corner of the room when he arose there seemed to be a singular cavity in his mouth his upper front teeth were wanting we will not narrate what took place in the chamber of the princess the nerves of the unfortunate woman had been so wrought upon by her fears that her husbands brutal rage familiar to her from long experience now possessed a new and alarming significance his threats were terrible to hear she fell into convulsions and before morning her tormented life was at an end there was now something else to think of and the smashing of porcelain and cracking of whips came to an end the archimandrite was summoned and preparations both religious and secular were made for a funeral worthy the rank of the deceased thousands flocked to kinesma and when the immense procession moved away from the castle although very few of the persons had ever known or cared in the least for the princess martha all without exception shed profuse tears yes there was one exception one bare dry rock rising alone out of the universal deluge prince alexis himself who walked behind the coffin his eyes fixed and his features rigid as stone they remarked that his face was haggard and that the fiery tinge on his cheeks and nose had faded into livid purple the only sign of emotion which he gave was a convulsive shudder which from time to time passed over his whole body three archimandrites abbotsand one hundred priests headed the solemn funeral procession from the castle to the church on the opposite hill there the mass for the dead was chanted the responses being sung by a choir of silvery boyish voices all the appointments were of the costliest character not only all those within the church but the thousands outside spared not their tears but wept until the fountains were exhausted notice was given at the close of the services that baked meats would be furnished to the multitude and that all beggars who came to kinesma would be charitably fed for the space of six weeks thus by her death the amiable princess martha was enabled to dispense more charity than had been permitted to her life at the funeral banquet which followed prince alexis placed the abbot sergius at his right hand and conversed with him in the most edifying manner upon the necessity of leading a pure and godly life his remarks upon the duty of a christian upon brotherly love humility and selfsacrifice brought tears into the eyes of the listening priests he expressed his conviction that the departed princess by the piety of her life had attained unto salvation and added that his own life had now no further value unless he should devote it to religious exercises can you not give me a place in your monastery he asked turning to the abbot i will endow it with a gift of forty thousand rubles for the privilege of occupying a monks cell pray do not decide too hastily highness the abbot replied you have yet a son what yelled prince alexis with flashing eyes every trace of humility and renunciation vanishing like smoke what borka the infamous wretch who has ruined me killed his mother and brought disgrace upon our name do you know that he has married a wench of no family and without a farthing who would be honored if i should allow her to feed my hogs live for him live for him ahrrr this outbreak terminated in a sound between a snarl and a bellow the priests turned pale but the abbot devoutly remarked encompassed by sorrows prince you should humbly submit to the will of the lord submit to borka the prince scornfully laughed i know what ill do theres time enough yet for a wife and another child ay a dozen children i can have my pick in the province and if i couldnt id sooner take masha the goosegirl than leave borka the hope of stepping into my shoes beggars they shall be beggars what further he might have said was interrupted by the priests rising to chant the blajennon uspennie blessed be the dead after which the trisna a drink composed of mead wine and rum was emptied to the health of the departed soul every one stood during this ceremony except prince alexis who fell suddenly prostrate before the consecrated pictures and sobbed so passionately that the tears of the guests flowed for the third time there he lay until night for whenever any one dared to touch him he struck out furiously with fists and feet finally he fell asleep on the floor and the servants then bore him to his sleeping apartment for several days afterward his grief continued to be so violent that the occupants of the castle were obliged to keep out of his way the whip was never out of his hand and he used it very recklessly not always selecting the right person the parasitic poor relations found their situation so uncomfortable that they decided one and all to detach themselves from the tree upon which they fed and fattened even at the risk of withering on a barren soil night and morning the serfs prayed upon their knees with many tears and groans that the saints might send consolation in any form to their desperate lord the saints graciously heard and answered the prayer word came that a huge bear had been seen in the forest stretching towards juriewetz the sorrowing prince pricked up his ears threw down his whip and ordered a chase sasha the broadshouldered the cunning the ready the untiring companion of his master secretly ordered a cask of vodki to follow the crowd of hunters and serfs there was a steelbright sky a low yellow sun and a brisk easterly wind from the heights of the ural as the crisp snow began to crunch under the princes sled his followers saw the old expression come back to his face with song and halloo and blast of horns they swept away into the forest saint john the hunter must have been on guard over russia that day the great bear was tracked and after a long and exciting chase fell by the hand of prince alexis himself halt was made in an open space in the forest logs were piled together and kindled on the snow and just at the right moment which no one knew better than sasha the cask of vodki rolled into its place when the serfs saw the prince mount astride of it with his ladle in his hand they burst into shouts of extravagant joy slava bogu glory be to god came fervently from the bearded lips of those hard rough obedient children they tumbled headlong over each other in their efforts to drink first from the ladle to clasp the knees or kiss the hands of the restored prince and the dawn was glimmering against the eastern stars as they took the way to the castle making the ghostly firwoods ring with shout and choric song nevertheless prince alexis was no longer the same man his giant strength and furious appetite were broken he was ever ready as formerly for the chase and the drinkingbout but his jovial mood no longer grew into a crisis which only utter physical exhaustion or the stupidity of drunkenness could overcome frequently while astride the cask his shouts of laughter would suddenly cease the ladle would drop from his hand and he would sit motionless staring into vacancy for five minutes at a time then the serfs too became silent and stood still awaiting a change the gloomy mood passed away as suddenly he would start look about him and say in a melancholy voice have i frightened you my children it seems to me that i am getting old ah yes we must all die one day but we need not think about it until the time comes the devil take me for putting it into my head why how now cant you sing children then he would strike up some ditty which they all knew a hundred voices joined in the strain and the hills once more rang with revelry since the day when the princess martha was buried the prince had not again spoken of marriage no one of course dared to mention the name of boris in his presence ix the young prince had in reality become the happy husband of helena his love for her had grown to be a shaping and organizing influence without which his nature would have fallen into its former confusion if a thought of a less honorable relation had ever entered his mind it was presently banished by the respect which a nearer intimacy inspired and thus helena magnetically drawing to the surface only his best qualities loved unconsciously to herself her own work in him ere long she saw that she might balance the advantages he had conferred upon her in their marriage by the support and encouragement which she was able to impart to him and this knowledge removing all painful sense of obligation made her both happy and secure in her new position the princess martha under some presentiment of her approaching death had intrusted one of the ladies in attendance upon her with the secret of her sons marriage in addition to a tender maternal message and such presents of money and jewelry as she was able to procure without her husbands knowledge these presents reached boris very opportunely for although helena developed a wonderful skill in regulating his expenses the spring was approaching and even the limited circle of society in which they had moved during the gay season had made heavy demands upon his purse he became restless and abstracted until his wife who by this time clearly comprehended the nature of his trouble had secretly decided how it must be met the slender hoard of the old musicmaster with a few thousand rubles from prince boris sufficed for his modest maintenance being now free from the charge of his daughter he determined to visit germany and if circumstances were propitious to secure a refuge for his old age in his favorite leipsic summer was at hand and the court had already removed to oranienbaum in a few weeks the capital would be deserted shall we go to germany with your father asked boris as he sat at a window with helena enjoying the long twilight no my boris she answered we will go to kinesma but helena golubchik mon ange are you in earnest yes my boris the last letter from your our cousin nadejda convinces me that the step must be taken prince alexis has grown much older since your mothers death he is lonely and unhappy he may not welcome us but he will surely suffer us to come to him and we must then begin the work of reconciliation reflect my boris that you have keenly wounded him in the tenderest part his pride and you must therefore cast away your own pride and humbly and respectfully as becomes a son solicit his pardon yes said he hesitatingly you are right but i know his violence and recklessness as you do not for myself alone i am willing to meet him yet i fear for your sake would you not tremble to encounter a maddened and brutal mujik then how much more to meet alexis pavlovitch of kinesma i do not and shall not tremble she replied it is not your marriage that has estranged your father but your marriage with me having been unconsciously the cause of the trouble i shall deliberately and as a sacred duty attempt to remove it let us go to kinesma as humble penitent children and cast ourselves upon your fathers mercy at the worst he can but reject us and you will have given me the consolation of knowing that i have tried as your wife to annul the sacrifice you have made for my sake be it so then cried boris with a mingled feeling of relief and anxiety he was not unwilling that the attempt should be made especially since it was his wifes desire but he knew his father too well to anticipate immediate success all threatening possibilities suggested themselves to his mind all forms of insult and outrage which he had seen perpetrated at kinesma filled his memory the suspense became at last worse than any probable reality he wrote to his father announcing a speedy visit from himself and his wife and two days afterwards the pair left st petersburg in a large travelling kibitka x when prince alexis received his sons letter an expression of fierce cruel delight crept over his face and there remained horribly illuminating its haggard features the orders given for swimming horses in the volga one of his summer diversions were immediately countermanded he paced around the parapet of the castlewall until near midnight followed by sasha with a stone jug of vodki the latter had the useful habit notwithstanding his stupid face of picking up the fragments of soliloquy which the prince dropped and answering them as if talking to himself thus he improved upon and perfected many a hint of cruelty and was too discreet ever to dispute his masters claim to the invention sasha we may be sure was busy with his devils work that night the next morning the stewards and agents of prince alexis in castle village and field were summoned to his presence hark ye said he borka and his trumpery wife send me word that they will be here tomorrow see to it that every man woman and child for ten versts out on the moskovskoi road knows of their coming let it be known that whoever uncovers his head before them shall uncover his back for a hundred lashes whomsoever they greet may bark like a dog meeouw like a cat or bray like an ass as much as he chooses but if he speaks a decent word his tongue shall be silenced with stripes whoever shall insult them has my pardon in advance oh let them come ay let them come come they may but how they go away again the prince alexis suddenly stopped shook his head and walked up and down the hall muttering to himself his eyes were bloodshot and sparkled with a strange light what the stewards had heard was plain enough but that something more terrible than insult was yet held in reserve they did not doubt it was safe therefore not only to fulfil but to exceed the letter of their instructions before night the whole population were acquainted with their duties and an unusual mood of expectancy not unmixed with brutish glee fell upon kinesma by the middle of the next forenoon boris and his wife seated in the open kibitka drawn by posthorses reached the boundaries of the estate a few versts from the village they were both silent and slightly pale at first but now began to exchange mechanical remarks to divert each others thoughts from the coming reception here are the fields of kinesma at last exclaimed prince boris we shall see the church and castle from the top of that hill in the distance and there is peter my playmate herding the cattle peter goodday brotherkin peter looked saw the carriage close upon him and after a moment of hesitation let his arms drop stiffly by his sides and began howling like a mastiff by moonlight helena laughed heartily at this singular response to the greeting but boris after the first astonishment was over looked terrified that was done by order said he with a bitter smile the old bear stretches his claws out dare you try his hug i do not fear she answered her face was calm every serf they passed obeyed the order of prince alexis according to his own idea of disrespect one turned his back another made contemptuous grimaces and noises another sang a vulgar song another spat upon the ground or held his nostrils nowhere was a cap raised or the stealthy welcome of a friendly glance given the princess helena met these insults with a calm proud indifference boris felt them more keenly for the fields and hills were prospectively his property and so also were the brutish peasants it was a form of chastisement which he had never before experienced and knew not how to resist the affront of an entire community was an offence against which he felt himself to be helpless as they approached the town the demonstrations of insolence were redoubled about two hundred boys between the ages of ten and fourteen awaited them on the hill below the church forming themselves into files on either side of the road these imps had been instructed to stick out their tongues in derision and howl as the carriage passed between them at the entrance of the long main street of kinesma they were obliged to pass under a mock triumphal arch hung with dead dogs and drowned cats and from this point the reception assumed an outrageous character howls hootings and hisses were heard on all sides bouquets of nettles and vile weeds were flung to them even wreaths of spoiled fish dropped from the windows the women were the most eager and uproarious in this carnival of insult they beat their saucepans threw pails of dirty water upon the horses pelted the coachman with rotten cabbages and filled the air with screeching and foul words it was impossible to pass through this ordeal with indifference boris finding that his kindly greetings were thrown away that even his old acquaintances in the bazaar howled like the rest sat with head bowed and despair in his heart the beautiful eyes of helena were heavy with tears but she no longer trembled for she knew the crisis was yet to come as the kibitka slowly climbed the hill on its way to the castlegate prince alexis who had heard and enjoyed the noises in the village from a balcony on the western tower made his appearance on the head of the steps which led from the courtyard to the state apartments the dreaded whip was in his hand his eyes seemed about to start from their sockets in their wild eager hungry gaze the veins stood out like cords on his forehead and his lips twitching involuntarily revealed the glare of his set teeth a frightened hush filled the castle some of the domestics were on their knees others watching pale and breathless from the windows for all felt that a greater storm than they had ever experienced was about to burst sasha and the castlesteward had taken the wise precaution to summon a physician and a priest provided with the utensils for extreme unction both of these persons had been smuggled in through a rear entrance and were kept concealed until their services should be required the noise of wheels was heard outside the gate which stood invitingly open prince alexis clutched his whip with iron fingers and unconsciously took the attitude of a wild beast about to spring from its ambush now the hard clatter of hoofs and the rumbling of wheels echoed from the archway and the kibitka rolled into the courtyard it stopped near the foot of the grand staircase boris who sat upon the farther side rose to alight in order to hand down his wife but no sooner had he made a movement than prince alexis with lifted whip and face flashing fire rushed down the steps helena rose threw back her veil let her mantle which boris had grasped in his anxiety to restrain her action fall behind her and stepped upon the pavement prince alexis had already reached the last step and but a few feet separated them he stopped as if struck by lightning his body still retaining in every limb the impress of motion the whip was in his uplifted fist one foot was on the pavement of the court and the other upon the edge of the last step his head was bent forward his mouth open and his eyes fastened upon the princess helenas face she too stood motionless a form of simple and perfect grace and met his gaze with soft imploring yet courageous and trustful eyes the women who watched the scene from the galleries above always declared that an invisible saint stood beside her in that moment and surrounded her with a dazzling glory the few moments during which the suspense of a hundred hearts hung upon those encountering eyes seemed an eternity prince alexis did not move but he began to tremble from head to foot his fingers relaxed and the whip fell ringing upon the pavement the wild fire of his eyes changed from wrath into an ecstasy as intense and a piercing cry of mingled wonder admiration and delight burst from his throat at that cry boris rushed forward and knelt at his feet helena clasping her fairest hands sank beside her husband with upturned face as if seeking the old mans eyes and perfect the miracle she had wrought the sight of that sweet face so near his own tamed the last lurking ferocity of the beast his tears burst forth in a shower he lifted and embraced the princess kissing her brow her cheeks her chin and her hands calling her his darling daughter his little white dove his lambkin and father my boris too said she the pure liquid voice sent thrills of exquisite delight through his whole frame he embraced and blessed boris and then throwing an arm around each held them to his breast and wept passionately upon their heads by this time the whole castle overflowed with weeping tears fell from every window and gallery they hissed upon the hot saucepans of the cooks they moistened the oats in the manger they took the starch out of the ladies ruffles and weakened the wine in the goblets of the guests insult was changed into tenderness in a moment those who had barked or stuck out their tongues at boris rushed up to kiss his boots a thousand terms of endearment were showered upon him still clasping his children to his breast prince alexis mounted the steps with them at the top he turned cleared his throat husky from sobbing and shouted a feast a feast for all kinesma let there be rivers of vodki wine and hydromel proclaim it everywhere that my dear son boris and my dear daughter helena have arrived and whoever fails to welcome them to kinesma shall be punished with a hundred stripes off ye scoundrels ye vagabonds and spread the news it was not an hour before the whole sweep of the circling hills resounded with the clang of bells the blare of horns and the songs and shouts of the rejoicing multitude the triumphal arch of unsavory animals was whirled into the volga all signs of the recent reception vanished like magic festive firboughs adorned the houses and the gardens and windowpots were stripped of their choicest flowers to make wreaths of welcome the two hundred boys not old enough to comprehend this sudden bouleversement of sentiment did not immediately desist from sticking out their tongues whereupon they were dismissed with a box on the ear by the middle of the afternoon all kinesma was eating drinking and singing and every song was sung and every glass emptied in honor of the dear good prince boris and the dear beautiful princess helena by night all kinesma was drunk xi in the castle a superb banquet was improvised music guests and rare dishes were brought together with wonderful speed and the choicest wines of the cellar were drawn upon prince boris bewildered by this sudden and incredible change in his fortunes sat at his fathers right hand while the princess filled but with much more beauty and dignity the ancient place of the princess martha the golden dishes were set before her and the famous family emeralds in accordance with the command of prince alexis gleamed among her dark hair and flashed around her milkwhite throat her beauty was of a kind so rare in russia that it silenced all question and bore down all rivalry every one acknowledged that so lovely a creature had never before been seen faith the boy has eyes the old prince constantly repeated as he turned away from a new stare of admiration down the table the guests noticed a change in the character of the entertainment the idiot in his tow shirt had been crammed to repletion in the kitchen and was now asleep in the stable razboi the new bear the successor of the slaughtered mishka was chained up out of hearing the jugglers tumblers and calmucks still occupied their old place under the gallery but their performances were of a highly decorous character at the leastsign of a relapse into certain old tricks more grotesque than refined the brows of prince alexis would grow dark and a sharp glance at sasha was sufficient to correct the indiscretion every one found this natural enough for they were equally impressed with the elegance and purity of the young wife after the healths had been drunk and the slumberflag was raised over the castle boris led her into the splendid apartments of his mother now her own and knelt at her feet have i done my part my boris she asked you are an angel he cried it was a miracle my life was not worth a copek and i feared for yours if it will only last if it will only last it will said she you have taken me from poverty and given me rank wealth and a proud place in the world let it be my work to keep the peace which god has permitted me to establish between you and your father the change in the old prince in fact was more radical than any one who knew his former ways of life would have considered possible he stormed and swore occasionally flourished his whip to some purpose and rode home from the chase not outside of a brandy cask as once but with too much of its contents inside of him but these mild excesses were comparative virtues his accesses of blind rage seemed to be at an end a powerful unaccustomed feeling of content subdued his strong nature and left its impress on his voice and features he joked and sang with his children but not with the wild recklessness of the days of reisaks and indiscriminate floggings both his exactions and his favors diminished in quantity week after week passed by and there was no sign of any return to his savage courses nothing annoyed him so much as a reference to his former way of life in the presence of the princess helena if her gentle questioning eyes happened to rest on him at such times something very like a blush rose into his face and the babbler was silenced with a terribly significant look it was enough for her to say when he threatened an act of cruelty and injustice father is that right he confusedly retracted his orders rather than bear the sorrow of her face the promise of another event added to his happiness helena would soon become a mother as the time drew near he stationed guards at the distance of a verst around the castle that no clattering vehicles should pass no dogs bark loudly nor any other disturbance occur which might agitate the princess the choicest sweetmeats and wines flowers from moscow and fruits from astrakhan were procured for her and it was a wonder that the midwife performed her duty for she had the fear of death before her eyes when the important day at last arrived the slumberflag was instantly hoisted and no mouse dared to squeak in kinesma until the cannon announced the advent of a new soul that night prince alexis lay down in the corridor outside of helenas door he glared fiercely at the nurse as she entered with the birthposset for the young mother no one else was allowed to pass that night nor the next four days afterwards sasha having a message to the princess and supposing the old man to be asleep attempted to step noiselessly over his body in a twinkle the princes teeth fastened themselves in the serfs leg and held him with the tenacity of a bulldog sasha did not dare to cry out he stood writhing with pain until the strong jaws grew weary of their hold and then crawled away to dress the bleeding wound after that no one tried to break the princes guard the christening was on a magnificent scale prince paul of kostroma was godfather and gave the babe the name of alexis as the prince had paid his respects to helena just before the ceremony it may be presumed that the name was not of his own inspiration the father and mother were not allowed to be present but they learned that the grandfather had comported himself throughout with great dignity and propriety the archimandrite sergius obtained from the metropolitan at moscow a very minute fragment of the true cross which was encased in a hollow bead of crystal and hung around the infants neck by a fine gold chain as a precious amulet prince alexis was never tired of gazing at his grandson and namesake he has more of his mother than of boris he would say so much the better strong dark eyes like the great peter and what a goodly leg for a babe ha he makes a tight little fist already fit to handle a whip or seeing the expression of helenas face or a sword hell be a proper prince of kinesma my daughter and we owe it to you helena smiled and gave him a grateful glance in return she had had her secret fears as to the complete conversion of prince alexis but now she saw in this babe a new spell whereby he might be bound slight as was her knowledge of men she yet guessed the tyranny of longcontinued habits and only her faith powerful in proportion as it was ignorant gave her confidence in the result of the difficult work she had undertaken xii alas the proud predictions of prince alexis and the protection of the sacred amulet were alike unavailing the babe sickened wasted away and died in less than two months after its birth there was great and genuine sorrow among the serfs of kinesma each had received a shining ruble of silver at the christening and moreover they were now beginning to appreciate the milder regime of their lord which this blow might suddenly terminate sorrow in such natures as his exasperates instead of chastening they knew him well enough to recognize the danger at first the old mans grief appeared to be of a stubborn harmless nature as soon as the funeral ceremonies were over he betook himself to his bed and there lay for two days and nights without eating a morsel of food the poor princess helena almost prostrated by the blow mourned alone or with boris in her own apartments her influence no longer kept alive by her constant presence as formerly began to decline when the old prince aroused somewhat from his stupor it was not meat that he demanded but drink and he drank to angry excess day after day the habit resumed its ancient sway and the whip and the wildbeast yell returned with it the serfs even began to tremble as they never had done so long as his vices were simply those of a strong man for now a fiendish element seemed to be slowly creeping in he became horribly profane they shuddered when he cursed the venerable metropolitan of moscow declaring that the old sinner had deliberately killed his grandson by sending to him instead of the true cross of the saviour a piece of the tree to which the impenitent thief was nailed boris would have spared his wife the knowledge of this miserable relapse in her present sorrow but the information soon reached her in other ways she saw the necessity of regaining by a powerful effort what she had lost she therefore took her accustomed place at the table and resumed her inspection of household matters prince alexis as if determined to cast off the yoke which her beauty and gentleness had laid upon him avoided looking at her face or speaking to her as much as possible when he did so his manner was cold and unfriendly during her few days of sad retirement he had brought back the bear razboi and the idiot to his table and vodki was habitually poured out to him and his favorite serfs in such a measure that the nights became hideous with drunken tumult the princess helena felt that her beauty no longer possessed the potency of its first surprise it must now be a contest of nature with nature spiritual with animal power the struggle would be perilous she foresaw but she did not shrink she rather sought the earliest occasion to provoke it that occasion came some slight disappointment brought on one of the old paroxysms of rage and the oxlike bellow of prince alexis rang through the castle boris was absent but helena delayed not a moment to venture into his fathers presence she found him in a hall overlooking the courtyard with his terrible whip in his hand giving orders for the brutal punishment of some scores of serfs the sight of her coming thus unexpectedly upon him did not seem to produce the least effect father she cried in an earnest piteous tone what is it you do away witch he yelled i am the master in kinesma not thou away or the fierceness with which he swung and cracked the whip was more threatening than any words perhaps she grew a shade paler perhaps her hands were tightly clasped in order that they might not tremble but she did not flinch from the encounter she moved a step nearer fixed her gaze upon his flashing eyes and said in a low firm voice it is true father you are master here it is easy to rule over those poor submissive slaves but you are not master over yourself you are lashed and trampled upon by evil passions and as much a slave as any of these be not weak my father but strong an expression of bewilderment came into his face no such words had ever before been addressed to him and he knew not how to reply to them the princess helena followed up the effect she was not sure that it was an advantage by an appeal to the simple childish nature which she believed to exist under his ferocious exterior for a minute it seemed as if she were about to reestablish her ascendancy then the stubborn resistance of the beast returned among the portraits in the hall was one of the deceased princess martha pointing to this helena cried see my father here are the features of your sainted wife think that she looks down from her place among the blessed sees you listens to your words prays that your hard heart may be softened remember her last farewell to you on earth her hope of meeting you a cry of savage wrath checked her stretching one huge bony hand as if to close her lips trembling with rage and pain livid and convulsed in every feature of his face prince alexis reversed the whip in his right hand and weighed its thick heavy butt for one crashing fatal blow life and death were evenly balanced for an instant the princess became deadly pale and a sickening fear shot through her heart she could not understand the effect of her words her mind was paralyzed and what followed came without her conscious volition not retreating a step not removing her eyes from the terrible picture before her she suddenly opened her lips and sang her voice of exquisite purity power and sweetness filled the old hall and overflowed it throbbing in scarcely weakened vibrations through courtyard and castle the melody was a prayer the cry of a tortured heart for pardon and repose and she sang it with almost supernatural expression every sound in the castle was hushed the serfs outside knelt and uncovered their heads the princess could never afterwards describe or more than dimly recall the exaltation of that moment she sang in an inspired trance from the utterance of the first note the horror of the imminent fate sank out of sight her eyes were fixed upon the convulsed face but she beheld it not all the concentrated forces of her life flowed into the music she remembered however that prince alexis looked alternately from her face to the portrait of his wife that he at last shuddered and grew pale and that when with the closing note her own strength suddenly dissolved he groaned and fell upon the floor she sat down beside him and took his head upon her lap for a long time he was silent only shivering as if in fever father she finally whispered let me take you away he sat up on the floor and looked around but as his eyes encountered the portrait he gave a loud howl and covered his face with his hands she turns her head he cried take her away she follows me with her eyes paint her head black and cover it up with some difficulty he was borne to his bed but he would not rest until assured that his orders had been obeyed and the painting covered for the time with a coat of lampblack a low prolonged attack of fever followed during which the presence of helena was indispensable to his comfort she ventured to leave the room only while he slept he was like a child in her hands and when she commended his patience or his good resolutions his face beamed with joy and gratitude he determined in good faith this time to enter a monastery and devote the rest of his life to pious works but even after his recovery he was still too weak and dependent on his childrens attentions to carry out this resolution he banished from the castle all those of his poor relations who were unable to drink vodki in moderation he kept careful watch over his serfs and those who became intoxicated unless they concealed the fact in the stables and outhouses were severely punished all excess disappeared and a reign of peace and gentleness descended upon kinesma in another year another alexis was born and lived and soon grew strong enough to give his grandfather the greatest satisfaction he had ever known in his life by tugging at his gray locks and digging the small fingers into his tamed and merry eyes many years after prince alexis was dead the serfs used to relate how they had seen him in the bright summer afternoons asleep in his armchair on the balcony with the rosy babe asleep on his bosom and the slumberflag waving over both legends of the princes hunts reisaks and brutal revels are still current along the volga but they are now linked to fairer and more gracious stories and the free russian farmers no longer serfs are never tired of relating incidents of the beauty the courage the benevolence and the saintly piety of the good lady of kinesma tales of home the strange friend it would have required an intimate familiarity with the habitual demeanor of the people of londongrove to detect in them an access of interest we dare not say excitement of whatever kind expression with them was pitched to so low a key that its changes might be compared to the slight variations in the drabs and grays in which they were clothed yet that there was a moderate decorously subdued curiosity present in the minds of many of them on one of the firstdays of the ninthmonth in the year was as clearly apparent to a resident of the neighborhood as are the indications of a fire or a riot to the member of a city mob the agitations of the war which had so recently come to an end had hardly touched this quiet and peaceful community they had stoutly borne their testimony and faced the question where it could not be evaded and although the dashing philadelphia militia had been stationed at camp bloomfield within four miles of them the previous year these good people simply ignored the fact if their sons ever listened to the trumpets at a distance or stole nearer to have a peep at the uniforms no report of what they had seen or heard was likely to be made at home peace brought to them a relief like the awakening from an uncomfortable dream their lives at once reverted to the calm which they had breathed for thirty years preceding the national disturbance in their ways they had not materially changed for a hundred years the surplus produce of their farms more than sufficed for the very few needs which those farms did not supply and they seldom touched the world outside of their sect except in matters of business they were satisfied with themselves and with their lot they lived to a ripe and beautiful age rarely borrowed trouble and were patient to endure that which came in the fixed course of things if the spirit of curiosity the yearning for an active joyous grasp of life sometimes pierced through this placid temper and stirred the blood of the adolescent members they were persuaded by grave voices of almost prophetic authority to turn their hearts towards the stillness and the quietness it was the pleasant custom of the community to arrive at the meetinghouse some fifteen or twenty minutes before the usual time of meeting and exchange quiet and kindly greetings before taking their places on the plain benches inside as most of the families had lived during the week on the solitude of their farms they liked to see their neighbors faces and resolve as it were their sense of isolation into the common atmosphere before yielding to the assumed abstraction of their worship in this preliminary meeting also the sexes were divided but rather from habit than any prescribed rule they were already in the vestibule of the sanctuary their voices were subdued and their manner touched with a kind of reverence if the londongrove friends gathered together a few minutes earlier on that september firstday if the younger members looked more frequently towards one of the gates leading into the meetinghouse yard than towards the other and if abraham bradbury was the centre of a larger circle of neighbors than simon pennock although both sat side by side on the highest seat of the gallery the cause of these slight deviations from the ordinary behavior of the gathering was generally known abrahams son had died the previous sixthmonth leaving a widow incapable of taking charge of his farm on the street road which was therefore offered for rent it was not always easy to obtain a satisfactory tenant in those days and abraham was not more relieved than surprised on receiving an application from an unexpected quarter a strange friend of stately appearance called upon him bearing a letter from william warner in adams county together with a certificate from a monthly meeting on long island after inspecting the farm and making close inquiries in regard to the people of the neighborhood he accepted the terms of rent and had now with his family been three or four days in possession in this circumstance it is true there was nothing strange and the interest of the people sprang from some other particulars which had transpired the newcomer henry donnelly by name had offered in place of the usual security to pay the rent annually in advance his speech and manner were not in all respects those of friends and he acknowledged that he was of irish birth and moreover some who had passed the wagons bearing his household goods had been struck by the peculiar patterns of the furniture piled upon them abraham bradbury had of course been present at the arrival and the friends upon the adjoining farms had kindly given their assistance although it was a busy time of the year while therefore no one suspected that the farmer could possibly accept a tenant of doubtful character a general sentiment of curious expectancy went forth to meet the donnelly family even the venerable simon pennock who lived in the opposite part of the township was not wholly free from the prevalent feeling abraham he said approaching his colleague i suppose thee has satisfied thyself that the strange friend is of good repute abraham was assuredly satisfied of one thing that the three hundred silver dollars in his antiquated secretary at home were good and lawful coin we will not say that this fact disposed him to charity but will only testify that he answered thus i dont think we have any right to question the certificate from islip simon and william warners word whom thee knows by hearsay is that of a good and honest man henry himself will stand ready to satisfy thee if it is needful here he turned to greet a tall freshfaced youth who had quietly joined the group at the mens end of the meetinghouse he was nineteen blueeyed and rosy and a little embarrassed by the grave scrutinizing yet not unfriendly eyes fixed upon him simon this is henrys oldest son de courcy said abraham simon took the youths hand saying where did thee get thy outlandish name the young man colored hesitated and then said in a low firm voice it was my grandfathers name one of the heavy carriages of the place and period new and shiny in spite of its sober colors rolled into the yard abraham bradbury and de courcy donnelly set forth side by side to meet it out of it descended a tall broadshouldered figure a man in the prime of life whose ripe aggressive vitality gave his rigid quaker garb the air of a military undress his blue eyes seemed to laugh above the measured accents of his plain speech and the close crop of his hair could not hide its tendency to curl a bearing expressive of energy and the habit of command was not unusual in the sect strengthening but not changing its habitual mask yet in henry donnelly this bearing suggested one could scarcely explain why a different experience dress and speech in him expressed condescension rather than fraternal equality he carefully assisted his wife to alight and de courcy led the horse to the hitchingshed susan donnelly was a still blooming woman of forty her dress of the plainest color was yet of the richest texture and her round gentle almost timid face looked forth like a girls from the shadow of her scoop bonnet while she was greeting abraham bradbury the two daughters sylvia and alice who had been standing shyly by themselves on the edge of the group of women came forward the latter was a model of the demure quaker maiden but abraham experienced as much surprise as was possible to his nature on observing sylvias costume a lightblue dress a darkblue cloak a hat with ribbons and hair in curls what friend of good standing ever allowed his daughter thus to array herself in the fashion of the world henry read the question in abrahams face and preferred not to answer it at that moment saying thee must make me acquainted with the rest of our brethren he led the way back to the mens end when he had been presented to the older members it was time for them to assemble in meeting the people were again quietly startled when henry donnelly deliberately mounted to the third and highest bench facing them and sat down beside abraham and simon these two retained possibly with some little inward exertion the composure of their faces and the strange friend became like unto them his hands were clasped firmly in his lap his full decided lips were set together and his eyes gazed into vacancy from under the broad brim de courcy had removed his hat on entering the house but meeting his fathers eyes replaced it suddenly with a slight blush when simon pennock and ruth treadwell had spoken the thoughts which had come to them in the stillness the strange friend arose slowly with frequent pauses as if waiting for the guidance of the spirit and with that inward voice which falls so naturally into the measure of a chant he urged upon his hearers the necessity of seeking the light and walking therein he did not always employ the customary phrases but neither did he seem to speak the lower language of logic and reason while his tones were so full and mellow that they gave with every slowly modulated sentence a fresh satisfaction to the ear even his broad as and the strong roll of his rs verified the rumor of his foreign birth did not detract from the authority of his words the doubts which had preceded him somehow melted away in his presence and he came forth after the meeting had been dissolved by the shaking of hands an accepted tenant of the high seat that evening the family were alone in their new home the plain rushbottomed chairs and sober carpet in contrast with the dark solid mahogany table and the silver branched candlestick which stood upon it hinted of former wealth and present loss and something of the same contrast was reflected in the habits of the inmates while the father seated in a stately armchair read aloud to his wife and children sylvias eyes rested on a guitarcase in the corner and her fingers absently adjusted themselves to the imaginary frets de courcy twisted his neck as if the straight collar of his coat were a bad fit and henry the youngest boy nodded drowsily from time to time there my lads and lasses said henry donnelly as he closed the book now were plain farmers at last and the plainer the better since it must be theres only one thing wanting he paused and sylvia looking up with a bright arch determination answered its too late now father they have seen me as one of the worlds people as i meant they should when it is once settled as something not to be helped it will give us no trouble faith sylvia exclaimed de courcy i almost wish i had kept you company dont be impatient my boy said the mother gently think of the vexations we have had and what a rest this life will be think also the father added that i have the heaviest work to do and that thoult reap the most of what may come of it dont carry the old life to a land where its out of place we must be what we seem to be every one of us so we will said sylvia rising from her seat i as well as the rest it was what i said in the beginning you no thee knows father somebody must be interpreter when the time comes somebody must remember while the rest of you are forgetting oh i shall be talked about and set upon and called hard names it wont be so easy stay where you are de courcy that coat will fit sooner than you think her brother lifted his shoulders and made a grimace ive an unlucky name it seems said he the old fellow i mean friend simon pronounced it outlandish couldnt i change it to ezra or adonijah boy boy dont be alarmed father it will soon be as sylvia says thees right and mother is right ill let sylvia keep my memory and start fresh from here we must into the field tomorrow hal and i theres no need of a collar at the ploughtail they went to rest and on the morrow not only the boys but their father were in the field shrewd quick and strong they made available what they knew of farming operations and disguised much of their ignorance while they learned henry donnellys first public appearance had made a strong public impression in his favor which the voice of the older friends soon stamped as a settled opinion his sons did their share by the amiable yielding temper they exhibited in accommodating themselves to the manners and ways of the people the graces which came from a better education possibly more refined associations gave them an attraction which was none the less felt because it was not understood to the simpleminded young men who worked with the hired hands in their fathers fields if the donnelly family had not been accustomed in former days to sit at the same table with laborers in shirtsleeves and be addressed by the latter in fraternal phrase no little awkwardnesses or hesitations betrayed the fact they were anxious to make their naturalization complete and it soon became so the strange friend was now known in londongrove by the familiar name of henry he was a constant attendant at meeting not only on firstdays but also on fourthdays and whenever he spoke his words were listened to with the reverence due to one who was truly led towards the light this respect kept at bay the curiosity that might still have lingered in some minds concerning his antecedent life it was known that he answered simon pennock who had ventured to approach him with a direct question in these words thee knows friend simon that sometimes a seal is put upon our mouths for a wise purpose i have learned not to value the outer life except in so far as it is made the manifestation of the inner life and i only date my own from the time when i was brought to a knowledge of the truth it is not pleasant to me to look upon what went before but a season may come when it shall be lawful for me to declare all things nay when it shall be put upon me as a duty thee must suffer me to wait the call after this there was nothing more to be said the family was on terms of quiet intimacy with the neighbors and even sylvia in spite of her defiant eyes and worldly ways became popular among the young men and maidens she touched her beloved guitar with a skill which seemed marvellous to the latter and when it was known that her refusal to enter the sect arose from her fondness for the prohibited instrument she found many apologists among them she was not set upon and called hard names as she had anticipated it is true that her father when appealed to by the elders shook his head and said it is a cross to us but he had been known to remain in the room while she sang full high in kilbride and the keen light which arose in his eyes was neither that of sorrow nor anger at the end of their first year of residence the farm presented evidences of much more orderly and intelligent management than at first although the adjoining neighbors were of the opinion that the donnellys had hardly made their living out of it friend henry nevertheless was ready with the advance rent and his bills were promptly paid he was close at a bargain which was considered rather a merit than otherwise and almost painfully exact in observing the strict letter of it when made as time passed by and the family became a permanent part and parcel of the remote community wearing its peaceful color and breathing its untroubled atmosphere nothing occurred to disturb the esteem and respect which its members enjoyed from time to time the postmaster at the corner delivered to henry donnelly a letter from new york always addressed in the same hand the first which arrived had an esq added to the name but this compliment as the friends termed it soon ceased perhaps the official may have vaguely wondered whether there was any connection between the occasional absence of friend henry not at yearlymeeting time and these letters if he had been a visitor at the farmhouse he might have noticed variations in the moods of its inmates which must have arisen from some other cause than the price of stock or the condition of the crops outside of the family circle however they were serenely reticent in five or six years when de courcy had grown to be a hale handsome man of twentyfour and as capable of conducting a farm as any to the township born certain aberrations from the strict line of discipline began to be rumored he rode a gallant horse dressed a little more elegantly than his membership prescribed and his unusually high straight collar took a knack of falling over moreover he was frequently seen to ride up the street road in the direction of faggs manor towards those valleys where the brick presbyterian church displaces the whitewashed quaker meetinghouse had henry donnelly not occupied so high a seat and exercised such an acknowledged authority in the sect he might sooner have received counsel or proffers of sympathy as the case might be but he heard nothing until the rumors of de courcys excursions took a more definite form but one day abraham bradbury after discussing some monthlymeeting matters suddenly asked is this true that i hear henry that thy son de courcy keeps company with one of the alison girls who says that henry asked in a sharp voice why its the common talk surely thees heard of it before no henry set his lips together in a manner which abraham understood considering that he had fully performed his duty he said no more that evening sylvia who had been gently thrumming to herself at the window began singing bonnie peggie alison her father looked at de courcy who caught his glance then lowered his eyes and turned to leave the room stop de courcy said the former ive heard a piece of news about thee today which i want thee to make clear shall i go father asked sylvia no thee may stay to give de courcy his memory i think he is beginning to need it ive learned which way he rides on seventhday evenings father i am old enough to choose my way said de courcy but no such ways now boy has thee clean forgotten this was among the things upon which we agreed and you all promised to keep watch and guard over yourselves i had my misgivings then but for five years ive trusted you and now when the time of probation is so nearly over he hesitated and de courcy plucking up courage spoke again with a strong effort the young man threw off the yoke of a selftaught restraint and asserted his true nature has oneil written he asked not yet then father he continued i prefer the certainty of my present life to the uncertainty of the old i will not dissolve my connection with the friends by a shock which might give thee trouble but i will slowly work away from them notice will be taken of my ways there will be family visitations warnings and the usual routine of discipline so that when i marry margaret alison nobody will be surprised at my being read out of meeting i shall soon be twentyfive father and this thing has gone on about as long as i can bear it i must decide to be either a man or a milksop the color rose to henry donnellys cheeks and his eyes flashed but he showed no signs of anger he moved to de courcys side and laid his hand upon his shoulder patience my boy he said its the old blood and i might have known it would proclaim itself suppose i were to shut my eyes to thy ridings and thy merrymakings and thy worldly company so far i might go but the girl is no mate for thee if oneil is alive we are sure to hear from him soon and in three years at the utmost if the lord favors us the end will come how far has it gone with thy courting surely surely not too far to withdraw at least under the plea of my prohibition de courcy blushed but firmly met his fathers eyes i have spoken to her he replied and it is not the custom of our family to break plighted faith thou art our cross not sylvia go thy ways now i will endeavor to seek for guidance sylvia said the father when de courcy had left the room what is to be the end of this unless we hear from oneil father i am afraid it cannot be prevented de courcy has been changing for a year past i am only surprised that you did not sooner notice it what i said in jest has become serious truth he has already half forgotten we might have expected in the beginning that one of two things would happen either he would become a plodding quaker farmer or take to his present courses which would be worse when this life is over if that time ever comes sylvia sighed and there was a weariness in her voice which did not escape her fathers ear he walked up and down the room with a troubled air she sat down took the guitar upon her lap and began to sing the verse commencing erin my country though sad and forsaken when perhaps opportunely susan donnelly entered the room eh lass said henry slipping his arm around his wifes waist art thou tired yet have i been trying thy patience as i have that of the children have there been longings kept from me little rebellions crushed battles fought that i supposed were over not by me henry was her cheerful answer i have never have been happier than in these quiet ways with thee ive been thinking what if something has happened and the letters cease to come and it has seemed to me now that the boys are as good farmers as any and alice is such a tidy housekeeper that we could manage very well without help only for thy sake henry i fear it would be a terrible disappointment to thee or is thee as accustomed to the high seat as i to my place on the womens side no he answered emphatically the talk with de courcy has set my quiet quaker blood in motion the boy is more than half right i am sure sylvia thinks so too what could i expect he has no birthright and didnt begin his task as i did after the bravery of youth was over it took six generations to establish the serenity and content of our brethren here and the dress we wear dont give us the nature de courcy is tired of the masquerade and sylvia is tired of seeing it thou my little susan who wert so timid at first puttest us all to shame now i think i was meant for it alice and henry and i said she no outward change in henry donnellys demeanor betrayed this or any other disturbance at home there were repeated consultations between the father and son but they led to no satisfactory conclusion de courcy was sincerely attached to the pretty presbyterian maiden and found livelier society in her brothers and cousins than among the grave awkward quaker youths of londongrove with the occasional freedom from restraint there awoke in him a desire for independence a thirst for the suppressed license of youth his new acquaintances were accustomed to a rigid domestic regime but of a different character and they met on a common ground of rebellion their aberrations it is true were not of a very formidable character and need not have been guarded but for the severe conventionalities of both sects an occasional foxchase horserace or a stag party at some outlying tavern formed the sum of their dissipation they sang danced reels and sometimes ran into little excesses through the stimulating sense of the trespass they were committing by and by reports of certain of these performances were brought to the notice of the londongrove friends and with the consent of henry donnelly himself de courcy received a visit of warning and remonstrance he had foreseen the probability of such a visit and was prepared he denied none of the charges brought against him and accepted the grave counsel offered simply stating that his nature was not yet purified and chastened he was aware he was not walking in the light he believed it to be a troubled season through which he must needs pass his frankness as he was shrewd enough to guess was a scource of perplexity to the elders it prevented them from excommunicating him without further probation while it left him free to indulge in further recreations some months passed away and the absence from which henry donnelly always returned with a good supply of ready money did not take place the knowledge of farming which his sons had acquired now came into play it was necessary to exercise both skill and thrift in order to keep up the liberal footing upon which the family had lived for each member of it was too proud to allow the community to suspect the change in their circumstances de courcy retained more than ever at home and bound to steady labor was man enough to subdue his impatient spirit for the time but he secretly determined that with the first change for the better he would follow the fate he had chosen for himself late in the fall came the opportunity for which he had longed one evening he brought home a letter in the wellknown handwriting his father opened and read it in silence well father he said a former letter was lost it seems this should have come in the spring it is only the missing sum does oneil fix any time no but he hopes to make a better report next year then father said de courcy it is useless for me to wait longer i am satisfied as it is i should not have given up margaret in any case but now since thee can live with henrys help i shall claim her must it be de courcy it must but it was not to be a day or two afterwards the young man on his mettled horse set off up the street road feeling at last that the fortune and the freedom of his life were approaching he had become in habits and in feelings one of the people and the relinquishment of the hope in which his father still indulged brought him a firmer courage a more settled content his sweethearts family was in good circumstances but had she been poor he felt confident of his power to make and secure for her a farmers home to the past whatever it might have been he said farewell and went carolling some cheerful ditty to look upon the face of his future that night a country wagon slowly drove up to henry donnellys door the three men who accompanied it hesitated before they knocked and when the door was opened looked at each other with pale sad faces before either spoke no cries followed the few words that were said but silently swiftly a room was made ready while the men lifted from the straw and carried up stairs an unconscious figure the arms of which hung down with a horrible significance as they moved he was not dead for the heart beat feebly and slowly but all efforts to restore his consciousness were in vain there was concussion of the brain the physician said he had been thrown from his horse probably alighting upon his head as there were neither fractures nor external wounds all that night and next day the tenderest the most unwearied care was exerted to call back the flickering gleam of life the shock had been too great his deadly torpor deepened into death in their time of trial and sorrow the family received the fullest sympathy the kindliest help from the whole neighborhood they had never before so fully appreciated the fraternal character of the society whereof they were members the plain plodding people living on the adjoining farms became virtually their relatives and fellowmourners all the external offices demanded by the sad occasion were performed for them and other eyes than their own shed tears of honest grief over de courcys coffin all came to the funeral and even simon pennock in the plain yet touching words which he spoke beside the grave forgot the young mans wandering from the light in the recollection of his frank generous truthful nature if the donnellys had sometimes found the practical equality of life in londongrove a little repellent they were now gratefully moved by the delicate and refined ways in which the sympathy of the people sought to express itself the better qualities of human nature always develop a temporary goodbreeding wherever any of the family went they saw the reflection of their own sorrow and a new spirit informed to their eyes the quiet pastoral landscapes in their life at home there was little change abraham bradbury had insisted on sending his favorite grandson joel a youth of twentytwo to take de courcys place for a few months he was a shy quiet creature with large brown eyes like a fawns and young henry donnelly and he became friends at once it was believed that he would inherit the farm at his grandfathers death but he was as subservient to friend donnellys wishes in regard to the farming operations as if the latter held the fee of the property his coming did not fill the terrible gap which de courcys death had made but seemed to make it less constantly and painfully evident susan donnelly soon remarked a change which she could neither clearly define nor explain to herself both in her husband and in their daughter sylvia the former although in public he preserved the same grave stately face its lines perhaps a little more deeply marked seemed to be devoured by an internal unrest his dreams were of the old times words and names long unused came from his lips as he slept by her side although he bore his grief with more strength than she had hoped he grew nervous and excitable sometimes unreasonably petulant sometimes gay to a pitch which impressed her with pain when the spring came around and the mysterious correspondence again failed as in the previous year his uneasiness increased he took his place on the high seat on firstdays as usual but spoke no more sylvia on the other hand seemed to have wholly lost her proud impatient character she went to meeting much more frequently than formerly busied herself more actively about household matters and ceased to speak of the uncertain contingency which had been so constantly present in her thoughts in fact she and her father had changed places she was now the one who preached patience who held before them all the bright side of their lot who brought margaret alison to the house and justified her dead brothers heart to his fathers and who repeated to the latter in his restless moods de courcy foresaw the truth and we must all in the end decide as he did can thee do it sylvia her father would ask i believe i have done it already she said if it seems difficult pray consider how much later i begin my work i have had all your memories in charge and now i must not only forget for myself but for you as well indeed as the spring and summer months came and went sylvia evidently grew stronger in her determination the fret of her idle force was allayed and her content increased as she saw and performed the possible duties of her life perhaps her father might have caught something of her spirit but for his anxiety in regard to the suspended correspondence he wearied himself in guesses which all ended in the simple fact that to escape embarrassment the rent must again be saved from the earnings of the farm the harvests that year were bountiful wheat barley and oats stood thick and heavy in the fields no one showed more careful thrift or more cheerful industry than young joel bradbury and the family felt that much of the fortune of their harvest was owing to him on the first day after the crops had been securely housed all went to meeting except sylvia in the walled graveyard the sod was already green over de courcys unmarked mound but alice had planted a little rosetree at the head and she and her mother always visited the spot before taking their seats on the womens side the meetinghouse was very full that day as the busy season of the summer was over and the horses of those who lived at a distance had no longer such need of rest it was a sultry forenoon and the windows and doors of the building were open the humming of insects was heard in the silence and broken lights and shadows of the poplarleaves were sprinkled upon the steps and sills outside there were glimpses of quiet groves and orchards and blue fragments of sky no more semblance of life in the external landscape than there was in the silent meeting within some quarter of an hour before the shaking of hands took place the hoofs of a horse were heard in the meetinghouse yard the noise of a smart trot on the turf suddenly arrested the boys pricked up their ears at this unusual sound and stole glances at each other when they imagined themselves unseen by the awful faces in the gallery presently those nearest the door saw a broader shadow fall over those flickering upon the stone a red face appeared for a moment and was then drawn back out of sight the shadow advanced and receded in a state of peculiar restlessness sometimes the end of a ridingwhip was visible sometimes the corner of a coarse gray coat the boys who noticed these apparitions were burning with impatience but they dared not leave their seats until abraham bradbury had reached his hand to henry donnelly then they rushed out the mysterious personage was still beside the door leaning against the wall he was a short thickset man of fifty with red hair round gray eyes a broad pug nose and projecting mouth he wore a heavy gray coat despite the heat and a waistcoat with many brass buttons also corduroy breeches and riding boots when they appeared he started forward with open mouth and eyes and stared wildly in their faces they gathered around the poplartrunks and waited with some uneasiness to see what would follow slowly and gravely with the halfbroken ban of silence still hanging over them the people issued from the house the strange man stood leaning forward and seemed to devour each in turn with his eager eyes after the young men came the fathers of families and lastly the old men from the gallery seats last of these came henry donnelly in the meantime all had seen and wondered at the waiting figure its attitude was too intense and selfforgetting to be misinterpreted the greetings and remarks were suspended until the people had seen for whom the man waited and why henry donnelly had no sooner set his foot upon the doorstep than with something between a shout and a howl the stranger darted forward seized his hand and fell upon one knee crying o my lord my lord glory be to god that ive found ye at last if these words burst like a bomb on the ears of the people what was their consternation when henry donnelly exclaimed the divel jack oneil can that be you its me meself my lord when we heard the letters went wrong last year i said ill trust no such good news to their blasted mailposts ill go meself and carry it to his lordship if it is tother side o the say him and my lady and all the children went and sure i can go too and as i was the one that went with you from dunleigh castle ill go back with you to that same for it stands awaitin and blessed be the day that sees you back in your ould place all clear jack all mine again you may believe it my lord and money in the chest beside but wheres my lady bless her sweet face among yon women belike and youll help me to find her for its herself must have the news next and then the young master with that word henry donnelly awoke to a sense of time and place he found himself within a ring of staring wondering scandalized eyes he met them boldly with a proud though rather grim smile took hold of oneils arm and led him towards the womens end of the house where the sight of susan in her scoop bonnet so moved the servants heart that he melted into tears both husband and wife were eager to get home and hear oneils news in private so they set out at once in their plain carriage followed by the latter on horseback as for the friends they went home in a state of bewilderment alice donnelly with her brother henry and joel bradbury returned on foot the two former remembered oneil and although they had not witnessed his first interview with their father they knew enough of the family history to surmise his errand joel was silent and troubled alice i hope it doesnt mean that we are going back dont you said henry yes she answered and said no more they took a footpath across the fields and reached the farmhouse at the same time with the first party as they opened the door sylvia descended the staircase dressed in a rich shimmering brocade with a necklace of amethysts around her throat to their eyes so long accustomed to the absence of positive color she was completely dazzling there was a new color on her cheeks and her eyes seemed larger and brighter she made a stately courtesy and held open the parlor door welcome lord henry dunleigh of dunleigh castle she cried welcome lady dunleigh her father kissed her on the forehead now give us back our memories sylvia he said exultingly susan donnelly sank into a chair overcome by the mixed emotions of the moment come in my faithful jack unpack thy portmanteau of news for i see thou art bursting to show it let us have every thing from the beginning wife its a little too much for thee coming so unexpectedly set out the wine alice the decanter was placed upon the table oneil filled a tumbler to the brim lifted it high made two or three hoarse efforts to speak and then walked away to the window where he drank in silence this little incident touched the family more than the announcement of their good fortune henry donnellys feverish exultation subsided he sat down with a grave thoughtful face while his wife wept quietly beside him sylvia stood waiting with an abstracted air alice removed her mothers bonnet and shawl and henry and joel seated together at the farther end of the room looked on in silent anticipation oneils story was long and frequently interrupted he had been lord dunleighs steward in better days as his father had been to the old lord and was bound to the family by the closest ties of interest and affection when the estates became so encumbered that either an immediate change or a catastrophe was inevitable he had been taken into his masters confidence concerning the plan which had first been proposed in jest and afterwards adopted in earnest the family must leave dunleigh castle for a period of probably eight or ten years and seek some part of the world where their expenses could be reduced to the lowest possible figure in germany or italy there would be the annoyance of a foreign race and language of meeting of tourists belonging to the circle in which they had moved a dangerous idleness for their sons and embarrassing restrictions for their daughters on the other hand the suggestion to emigrate to america and become quakers during their exile offered more advantages the more they considered it it was original in character it offered them economy seclusion entire liberty of action inside the limits of the sect the best moral atmosphere for their children and an occupation which would not deteriorate what was best in their blood and breeding how lord dunleigh obtained admission into the sect as plain henry donnelly is a matter of conjecture with the londongrove friends the deception which had been practised upon them although it was perhaps less complete than they imagined left a soreness of feeling behind it the matter was hushed up after the departure of the family and one might now live for years in the neighborhood without hearing the story how the shrewd plan was carried out by lord dunleigh and his family we have already learned oneil left on the estate in the north of ireland did his part with equal fidelity he not only filled up the gaps made by his masters early profuseness but found means to move the sympathies of a cousin of the latter a rich eccentric old bachelor who had long been estranged by a family quarrel to this cousin he finally confided the character of the exile and at a lucky time for the cousins will was altered in lord dunleighs favor and he died before his mood of reconciliation passed away now the estate was not only unencumbered but there was a handsome surplus in the hands of the dublin bankers the family might return whenever they chose and there would be a festival to welcome them oneil said such as dunleigh castle had never known since its foundations were laid let us go at once said sylvia when he had concluded his tale no more masquerading i never knew until today how much i have hated it i will not say that your plan was not a sensible one father but i wish it might have been carried out with more honor to ourselves since de courcys death i have begun to appreciate our neighbors i was resigned to become one of these people had our luck gone the other way will they give us any credit for goodness and truth i wonder yes in mothers case and alices and i believe both of them would give up dunleigh castle for this little farm then her father exclaimed it is time that we should return and without delay but thee wrongs us somewhat sylvia it has not all been masquerading we have become the servants rather than the masters of our own parts and shall live a painful and divided life until we get back in our old place i fear me it will always be divided for thee wife and alice and henry if i am subdued by the element which i only meant to asssume how much more deeply must it have wrought in your natures yes sylvia is right we must get away at once tomorrow we must leave londongrove forever he had scarcely spoken when a new surprise fell upon the family joel bradbury arose and walked forward as if thrust by an emotion so powerful that it transformed his whole being he seemed to forget every thing but alice donnellys presence his soft brown eyes were fixed on her face with an expression of unutterable tenderness and longing he caught her by the hands alice o alice burst from his lips you are not going to leave me the flush in the girls sweet face faded into a deadly paleness a moan came from her lips her head dropped and she would have fallen swooning from the chair had not joel knelt at her feet and caught her upon his breast for a moment there was silence in the room presently sylvia all her haughtiness gone knelt beside the young man and took her sister from his arms joel my poor dear friend she said i am sorry that the last worst mischief we have done must fall upon you joel covered his face with his hands and convulsively uttered the words must she go then henry donnelly or rather lord dunleigh as we must now call him took the young mans hand he was profoundly moved his strong voice trembled and his words came slowly i will not appeal to thy heart joel he said for it would not hear me now but thou hast heard all our story and knowest that we must leave these parts never to return we belong to another station and another mode of life than yours and it must come to us as a good fortune that our time of probation is at an end bethink thee could we leave our darling alice behind us parted as if by the grave nay could we rob her of the life to which she is born of her share in our lives on the other hand could we take thee with us into relations where thee would always be a stranger and in which a nature like thine has no place this is a case where duty speaks clearly though so hard so very hard to follow he spoke tenderly but inflexibly and joel felt that his fate was pronounced when alice had somewhat revived and was taken to another room he stumbled blindly out of the house made his way to the barn and there flung himself upon the harvestsheaves which three days before he had bound with such a timid delicious hope working in his arm the day which brought such great fortune had thus a sad and troubled termination it was proposed that the family should start for philadelphia on the morrow leaving oneil to pack up and remove such furniture as they wished to retain but susan lady dunleigh could not forsake the neighborhood without a parting visit to the good friends who had mourned with her over her firstborn and sylvia was with her in this wish so two more days elapsed and then the dunleighs passed down the street road and the plain farmhouse was gone from their eyes forever two grieved over the loss of their happy home one was almost brokenhearted and the remaining two felt that the trouble of the present clouded all their happiness in the return to rank and fortune they went and they never came again an account of the great festival at dunleigh castle reached londongrove two years later through an irish laborer who brought to joel bradbury a letter of recommendation signed dunleigh joel kept the man upon his farm and the two preserved the memory of the family long after the neighborhood had ceased to speak of it joel never married he still lives in the house where the great sorrow of his life befell his head is gray and his face deeply wrinkled but when he lifts the shy lids of his soft brown eyes i fancy i can see in their tremulous depths the lingering memory of his love for alice dunleigh jacob flints journey if there ever was a man crushed out of all courage all selfreliance all comfort in life it was jacob flint why this should have been neither he nor any one else could have explained but so it was on the day that he first went to school his shy frightened face marked him as fair game for the rougher and stronger boys and they subjected him to all those exquisite refinements of torture which boys seem to get by the direct inspiration of the devil there was no form of their bullying meanness or the cowardice of their brutal strength which he did not experience he was born under a fading or falling star the inheritor of some anxious or unhappy mood of his parents which gave its fast color to the threads out of which his innocent being was woven even the good people of the neighborhood never accustomed to look below the externals of appearance and manner saw in his shrinking face and awkward motions only the signs of a cringing abject soul youll be no more of a man than jake flint was the reproach which many a farmer addressed to his dilatory boy and thus the parents one and all came to repeat the sins of the children if therefore at school and before folks jacobs position was always uncomfortable and depressing it was little more cheering at home his parents as all the neighbors believed had been unhappily married and though the mother died in his early childhood his father remained a moody unsocial man who rarely left his farm except on the st of april every year when he went to the county town for the purpose of paying the interest upon a mortgage the farm lay in a hollow between two hills separated from the road by a thick wood and the chimneys of the lonely old house looked in vain for a neighborsmoke when they began to grow warm of a morning beyond the barn and under the northern hill there was a log tenanthouse in which dwelt a negro couple who in the course of years had become fixtures on the place and almost partners in it harry the man was the medium by which samuel flint kept up his necessary intercourse with the world beyond the valley he took the horses to the blacksmith the grain to the mill the turkeys to market and through his hands passed all the incomings and outgoings of the farm except the annual interest on the mortgage sally his wife took care of the household which indeed was a light and comfortable task since the table was well supplied for her own sake and there was no sharp eye to criticise her sweeping dusting and bedmaking the place had a forlorn tumbledown aspect quite in keeping with its lonely situation but perhaps this very circumstance flattered the mood of its silent melancholy owner and his unhappy son in all the neighborhood there was but one person with whom jacob felt completely at ease but one who never joined in the general habit of making his name the butt of ridicule or contempt this was mrs ann pardon the hearty active wife of farmer robert pardon who lived nearly a mile farther down the brook jacob had won her goodwill by some neighborly services something so trifling indeed that the thought of a favor conferred never entered his mind ann pardon saw that it did not she detected a streak of most unconscious goodness under his uncouth embarrassed ways and she determined to cultivate it no little tact was required however to coax the wild forlorn creature into so much confidence as she desired to establish but tact is a native quality of the heart no less than a social acquirement and so she did the very thing necessary without thinking much about it robert pardon discovered by and by that jacob was a steady faithful hand in the harvestfield at huskingtime or whenever any extra labor was required and jacobs father made no objection to his earning a penny in this way and so he fell into the habit of spending his saturday evenings at the pardon farmhouse at first to talk over matters of work and finally because it had become a welcome relief from his dreary life at home now it happened that on a saturday in the beginning of hayingtime the village tailor sent home by harry a new suit of light summer clothes for which jacob had been measured a month before after supper he tried them on the days work being over and sallys admiration was so loud and emphatic that he felt himself growing red even to the small of his back now dont go for to take em off mr jake said she i spec youre gwine down to pardons and so you jist keep em on to show em all how nice you kin look the same thought had already entered jacobs mind poor fellow it was the highest form of pleasure of which he had ever allowed himself to conceive if he had been called upon to pass through the village on first assuming the new clothes every stitch would have pricked him as if the needle remained in it but a quiet walk down the brookside by the pleasant path through the thickets and over the fragrant meadows with a consciousness of his own neatness and freshness at every step and with kind ann pardons commendation at the close and the flattering curiosity of the children the only ones who never made fun of him all that was a delightful prospect he could never never forget himself as he had seen other young fellows do but to remember himself agreeably was certainly the next best thing jacob was already a wellgrown man of twentythree and would have made a good enough appearance but for the stoop in his shoulders and the drooping uneasy way in which he carried his head many a time when he was alone in the fields or woods he had straightened himself and looked courageously at the buts of the oaktrees or in the very eyes of the indifferent oxen but when a human face drew near some spring in his neck seemed to snap some buckle around his shoulders to be drawn three holes tighter and he found himself in the old posture the everpresent thought of this weakness was the only drop of bitterness in his cup as he followed the lonely path through the thickets some spirit in the sweet delicious freshness of the air some voice in the mellow babble of the stream leaping in and out of sight between the alders some smile of light lingering on the rising cornfields beyond the meadow and the melting purple of a distant hill reached to the seclusion of his heart he was soothed and cheered his head lifted itself in the presentiment of a future less lonely than the past and the everlasting trouble vanished from his eyes suddenly at a turn of the path two mowers from the meadow with their scythes upon their shoulders came upon him he had not heard their feet on the deep turf his chest relaxed and his head began to sink then with the most desperate effort in his life he lifted it again and darting a rapid side glance at the men hastened by they could not understand the mixed defiance and supplication of his face to them he only looked queer been committin a murder have you asked one of them grinning startin off on his journey i guess said the other the next instant they were gone and jacob with set teeth and clinched hands smothered something that would have been a howl if he had given it voice sharp lines of pain were marked on his face and for the first time the idea of resistance took fierce and bitter possession of his heart but the mood was too unusual to last presently he shook his head and walked on towards pardons farmhouse ann wore a smart gingham dress and her first exclamation was why jake how nice you look and so you know all about it too about what i see you dont said she i was too fast but it makes no difference i know you are willing to lend me a helping hand oh to be sure jacob answered and not mind a little company jacobs face suddenly clouded but he said though with an effort no not much if i can be of any help its rather a joke after all ann pardon continued speaking rapidly they meant a surprise a few of the young people but sister becky found a way to send me word or i might have been caught like meribah johnson last week in the middle of my work eight or ten she said but more may drop in and its moonlight and warm so theyll be mostly under the trees and robert wont be home till late and i do want help in carrying chairs and getting up some ice and handing around and though i know you dont care for merry makings you can help me out you see here she paused jacob looked perplexed but said nothing becky will help what she can and while im in the kitchen shell have an eye to things outside she said jacobs head was down again and moreover turned on one side but his ear betrayed the mounting blood finally he answered in a quick husky voice well ill do what i can whats first thereupon he began to carry some benches from the veranda to a grassy bank beside the sycamoretree ann pardon wisely said no more of the coming surpriseparty but kept him so employed that as the visitors arrived by twos and threes the merriment was in full play almost before he was aware of it moreover the night was a protecting presence the moonlight poured splendidly upon the open turf beyond the sycamore but every lilacbush or trellis of woodbine made a nook of shade wherein he could pause a moment and take courage for his duties becky morton ann pardons youngest sister frightened him a little every time she came to consult about the arrangement of seats or the distribution of refreshments but it was a delightful fascinating fear such as he had never felt before in his life he knew becky but he had never seen her in white and pink with floating tresses until now in fact he had hardly looked at her fairly but now as she glided into the moonlight and he paused in the shadow his eyes took note of her exceeding beauty some sweet confusing influence he knew not what passed into his blood the young men had brought a fiddler from the village and it was not long before most of the company were treading the measures of reels or cotillons on the grass how merry and happy they all were how freely and unembarrassedly they moved and talked by and by all became involved in the dance and jacob left alone and unnoticed drew nearer and nearer to the gay and beautiful life from which he was expelled with a longdrawn scream of the fiddle the dance came to an end and the dancers laughing chattering panting and fanning themselves broke into groups and scattered over the enclosure before the house jacob was surrounded before he could escape becky with two lively girls in her wake came up to him and said oh mr flint why dont you dance if he had stopped to consider he would no doubt have replied very differently but a hundred questions stirred by what he had seen were clamoring for light and they threw the desperate impulse to his lips if i could dance would you dance with me the two lively girls heard the words and looked at becky with roguish faces oh yes take him for your next partner cried one i will said becky after he comes back from his journey then all three laughed jacob leaned against the tree his eyes fixed on the ground is it a bargain asked one of the girls no said he and walked rapidly away he went to the house and finding that robert had arrived took his hat and left by the rear door there was a grassy alley between the orchard and garden from which it was divided by a high hawthorn hedge he had scarcely taken three paces on his way to the meadow when the sound of the voice he had last heard on the other side of the hedge arrested his feet becky i think you rather hurt jake flint said the girl hardly answered becky hes used to that not if he likes you and you might go further and fare worse well i must say becky exclaimed with a laugh youd like to see me stuck in that hollow out of your way its a good farm ive heard said the other yes and covered with as much as itll bear here the girls were called away to the dance jacob slowly walked up the dewy meadow the sounds of fiddling singing and laughter growing fainter behind him my journey he repeated to himself my journey why shouldnt i start on it now start off and never come back it was a very little thing after all which annoyed him but the mention of it always touched a sore nerve of his nature a dozen years before when a boy at school he had made a temporary friendship with another boy of his age and had one day said to the latter in the warmth of his first generous confidence when i am a little older i shall make a great journey and come back rich and buy whitneys place now whitneys place with its stately old brick mansion its avenue of silver firs and its two hundred acres of clean warmlying land was the finest the most aristocratic property in all the neighborhood and the boyfriend could not resist the temptation of repeating jacobs grand design for the endless amusement of the school the betrayal hurt jacob more keenly than the ridicule it left a wound that never ceased to rankle yet with the inconceivable perversity of unthinking natures precisely this joke as the people supposed it to be had been perpetuated until jake flints journey was a synonyme for any absurd or extravagant expectation perhaps no one imagined how much pain he was keeping alive for almost any other man than jacob would have joined in the laugh against himself and thus goodnaturedly buried the joke in time hes used to that the people said like becky morton and they really supposed there was nothing unkind in the remark after jacob had passed the thickets and entered the lonely hollow in which his fathers house lay his pace became slower and slower he looked at the shabby old building just touched by the moonlight behind the swaying shadows of the weepingwillow stopped looked again and finally seated himself on a stump beside the path if i knew what to do he said to himself rocking backwards and forwards with his hands clasped over his knees if i knew what to do the spiritual tension of the evening reached its climax he could bear no more with a strong bodily shudder his tears burst forth and the passion of his weeping filled him from head to foot how long he wept he knew not it seemed as if the hot fountains would never run dry suddenly and startlingly a hand fell upon his shoulder boy what does this mean it was his father who stood before him jacob looked up like some shy animal brought to bay his eyes full of a feeling mixed of fierceness and terror but he said nothing his father seated himself on one of the roots of the old stump laid one hand upon jacobs knee and said with an unusual gentleness of manner id like to know what it is that troubles you so much after a pause jacob suddenly burst forth with is there any reason why i should tell you do you care any more for me than the rest of em i didnt know as you wanted me to care for you particularly said the father almost deprecatingly i always thought you had friends of your own age friends devils exclaimed jacob oh what have i done what is there so dreadful about me that i should always be laughed at and despised and trampled upon you are a great deal older than i am father what do you see in me tell me what it is and how to get over it the eyes of the two men met jacob saw his fathers face grow pale in the moonlight while he pressed his hand involuntarily upon his heart as if struggling with some physical pain at last he spoke but his words were strange and incoherent i couldnt sleep he said i got up again and came out o doors the white ox had broken down the fence at the corner and would soon have been in the cornfield i thought it was that maybe but still your your mother would come into my head i was coming down the edge of the wood when i saw you and i dont know why it was that you seemed so different all at once here he paused and was silent for a minute then he said in a grave commanding tone just let me know the whole story i have that much right yet jacob related the history of the evening somewhat awkwardly and confusedly it is true but his fathers brief pointed questions kept him to the narrative and forced him to explain the full significance of the expressions he repeated at the mention of whitneys place a singular expression of malice touched the old mans face do you love becky morton he asked bluntly when all had been told i dont know jacob stammered i think not because when i seem to like her most i feel afraid of her its lucky that youre not sure of it exclaimed the old man with energy because you should never have her no said jacob with a mournful acquiescence i can never have her or any other one but you shall and will i when i help you its true ive not seemed to care much about you and i suppose youre free to think as you like but this i say ill not stand by and see you spit upon covered with as much as itll bear thats a piece o luck anyhow if were poor your wife must take your poverty with you or she dont come into my doors but first of all you must make your journey my journey repeated jacob werent you thinking of it this night before you took your seat on that stump a little more and youd have gone clean off i reckon jacob was silent and hung his head never mind ive no right to think hard of it in a week well have finished our haying and then its a fortnight to wheat but for that matter harry and i can manage the wheat by ourselves you may take a month two months if any thing comes of it under a month i dont mean that you shall come back ill give you twenty dollars for a start if you want more you must earn it on the road any way you please and mark you jacob since you are poor dont let anybody suppose you are rich for my part i shall not expect you to buy whitneys place all i ask is that youll tell me fair and square just what things and what people youve got acquainted with get to bed now the matters settled i will have it so they rose and walked across the meadow to the house jacob had quite forgotten the events of the evening in the new prospect suddenly opened to him which filled him with a wonderful confusion of fear and desire his father said nothing more they entered the lonely house together at midnight and went to their beds but jacob slept very little six days afterwards he left home on a sparkling june morning with a small bundle tied in a yellow silk handkerchief under his arm his father had furnished him with the promised money but had positively refused to tell him what road he should take or what plan of action he should adopt the only stipulation was that his absence from home should not be less than a month after he had passed the wood and reached the highway which followed the course of the brook he paused to consider which course to take southward the road led past pardons and he longed to see his only friends once more before encountering untried hazards but the village was beyond and he had no courage to walk through its one long street with a bundle denoting a journey under his arm northward he would have to pass the mill and blacksmiths shop at the crossroads then he remembered that he might easily wade the stream at a point where it was shallow and keep in the shelter of the woods on the opposite hill until he struck the road farther on and in that direction two or three miles would take him into a neighborhood where he was not known once in the woods an exquisite sense of freedom came upon him there was nothing mocking in the soft graceful stir of the expanded foliage in the twittering of the unfrightened birds or the scampering of the squirrels over the rustling carpet of dead leaves he lay down upon the moss under a spreading beechtree and tried to think but the thoughts would not come he could not even clearly recall the keen troubles and mortifications he had endured all things were so peaceful and beautiful that a portion of their peace and beauty fell upon men and invested them with a more kindly character towards noon jacob found himself beyond the limited geography of his life the first man he encountered was a stranger who greeted him with a hearty and respectful how do you do sir perhaps thought jacob i am not so very different from other people if i only thought so myself at noon he stopped at a farmhouse by the roadside to get a drink of water a pleasant woman who came from the door at that moment with a pitcher allowed him to lower the bucket and haul it up dripping with precious coolness she looked upon him with goodwill for he had allowed her to see his eyes and something in their honest appealing expression went to her heart were going to have dinner in five minutes said she wont you stay and have something jacob stayed and brake bread with the plain hospitable family their kindly attention to him during the meal gave him the lacking nerve for a moment he resolved to offer his services to the farmer but he presently saw that they were not really needed and besides the place was still too near home towards night he reached an old country tavern lording it over an incipient village of six houses the landlord and hostler were inspecting a droopinglooking horse in front of the stables now if there was any thing which jacob understood to the extent of his limited experience it was horse nature he drew near listened to the views of the two men examined the animal with his eyes and was ready to answer yes i guess so when the landlord said perhaps sir you can tell what is the matter with him his prompt detection of the ailment and prescription of a remedy which in an hour showed its good effects installed him in the landlords best graces the latter said well it shall cost you nothing tonight as he led the way to the supperroom when jacob went to bed he was surprised on reflecting that he had not only been talking for a full hour in the barroom but had been looking people in the face resisting an offer of good wages if he would stay and help look after the stables he set forward the next morning with a new and most delightful confidence in himself the knowledge that now nobody knew him as jake flint quite removed his tortured selfconsciousness when he met a person who was glum and ungracious of speech he saw nevertheless that he was not its special object he was sometimes asked questions to be sure which a little embarrassed him but he soon hit upon answers which were sufficiently true without betraying his purpose wandering sometimes to the right and sometimes to the left he slowly made his way into the land until on the afternoon of the fourth day after leaving home he found himself in a rougher region a rocky hilly tract with small and not very flourishing farms in the valleys here the season appeared to be more backward than in the open country the hay harvest was not yet over jacobs taste for scenery was not particularly cultivated but something in the loneliness and quiet of the farms reminded him of his own home and he looked at one house after another deliberating with himself whether it would not be a good place to spend the remainder of his month of probation he seemed to be very far from home about forty miles in fact and was beginning to feel a little tired of wandering finally the road climbed a low pass of the hills and dropped into a valley on the opposite side there was but one house in view a twostory building of logs and plaster with a garden and orchard on the hillside in the rear a large meadow stretched in front and when the whole of it lay clear before him as the road issued from a wood his eye was caught by an unusual harvest picture directly before him a woman whose face was concealed by a huge flapping sunbonnet was seated upon a mowing machine guiding a span of horses around the great tract of thick grass which was still uncut a little distance off a boy and girl were raking the drier swaths together and a haycart drawn by oxen and driven by a man was just entering the meadow from the side next the barn jacob hung his bundle upon a stake threw his coat and waistcoat over the rail and resting his chin on his shirted arms leaned on the fence and watched the haymakers as the woman came down the nearer side she appeared to notice him for her head was turned from time to time in his direction when she had made the round she stopped the horses at the corner sprang lightly from her seat and called to the man who leaving his team met her halfway they were nearly a furlong distant but jacob was quite sure that she pointed to him and that the man looked in the same direction presently she set off across the meadow directly towards him when within a few paces of the fence she stopped threw back the flaps of her sunbonnet and said good day to you jacob was so amazed to see a bright fresh girlish face that he stared at her with all his eyes forgetting to drop his head indeed he could not have done so for his chin was propped upon the top rail of the fence you are a stranger i see she added yes in these parts he replied looking for work he hardly knew what answer to make so he said at a venture thats as it happens then he colored a little for the words seemed foolish to his ears times precious said the girl so ill tell you at once we want help our hay must be got in while the fine weather lasts ill help you jacob exclaimed taking his arms from the rail and looking as willing as he felt im so glad but i must tell you at first that were not rich and the hands are asking a great deal now how much do you expect whatever you please said he climbing the fence no thats not our way of doing business what do you say to a dollar a day and found all right and with the words he was already at her side taking long strides over the elastic turf i will go on with my mowing said she when they reached the horses and you can rake and load with my father what name shall i call you by everybody calls me jake jake jacob is better well jacob i hope youll give us all the help you can with a nod and a light laugh she sprang upon the machine there was a sweet throb in jacobs heart which if he could have expressed it would have been a triumphant shout of im not afraid of her im not afraid of her the farmer was a kindly depressed man with whose quiet ways jacob instantly felt himself at home they worked steadily until sunset when the girl detaching her horses from the machine mounted one of them and led the other to the barn at the suppertable the farmers wife said susan you must be very tired not now mother she cheerily answered i was i think but after i picked up jacob i felt sure we should get our hay in it was a good thing said the farmer jacob dont need to be told how to work poor jacob he was so happy he could have cried he sat and listened and blushed a little with a smile on his face which it was a pleasure to see the honest people did not seem to regard him in the least as a stranger they discussed their family interests and troubles and hopes before him and in a little while it seemed as if he had known them always how faithfully he worked how glad and tired he felt when night came and the haymow was filled and the great stacks grew beside the barn but ah the haying came to an end and on the last evening at supper everybody was constrained and silent even susan looked grave and thoughtful jacob said the farmer finally i wish we could keep you until wheat harvest but you know we are poor and cant afford it perhaps you could he hesitated but jacob catching at the chance and obeying his own unselfish impulse cried oh yes i can ill be satisfied with my board till the wheats ripe susan looked at him quickly with a bright speaking face its hardly fair to you said the farmer but i like to be here so much jacob cried i like all of you we do seem to suit said the farmer like as one family and that reminds me weve not heard your family name yet flint jacob flint exclaimed the farmers wife with sudden agitation jacob was scared and troubled they had heard of him he thought and who knew what ridiculous stories susan noticed an anxiety on his face which she could not understand but she unknowingly came to his relief why mother she asked do you know jacobs family no i think not said her mother only somebody of the name long ago his offer however was gratefully accepted the bright hot summer days came and went but no flower of july ever opened as rapidly and richly and warmly as his chilled retarded nature new thoughts and instincts came with every mornings sun and new conclusions were reached with every evenings twilight yet as the wheat harvest drew towards the end he felt that he must leave the place the month of absence had gone by he scarce knew how he was free to return home and though he might offer to bridge over the gap between wheat and oats as he had already done between hay and wheat he imagined the family might hesitate to accept such an offer moreover this life at susans side was fast growing to be a pain unless he could assure himself that it would be so forever they were in the wheatfield busy with the last sheaves she raking and he binding the farmer and younger children had gone to the barn with a load jacob was working silently and steadily but when they had reached the end of a row he stopped wiped his wet brow and suddenly said susan i suppose today finishes my work here yes she answered very slowly and yet im very sorry to go i we dont want you to go if we could help it jacob appeared to struggle with himself he attempted to speak if i could he brought out and then paused susan would you be glad if i came back his eyes implored her to read his meaning no doubt she read it correctly for her face flushed her eyelids fell and she barely murmured yes jacob then ill come he cried ill come and help you with the oats dont talk of pay only tell me ill be welcome susan dont you believe ill keep my word i do indeed said she looking him firmly in the face that was all that was said at the time but the two understood each other tolerably well on the afternoon of the second day jacob saw again the lonely house of his father his journey was made yet if any of the neighbors had seen him they would never have believed that he had come back rich samuel flint turned away to hide a peculiar smile when he saw his son but little was said until late that evening after harry and sally had left then he required and received an exact account of jacobs experience during his absence after hearing the story to the end he said and so you love this susan meadows id id do any thing to be with her are you afraid of her no jacob uttered the word so emphatically that it rang through the house ah well said the old man lifting his eyes and speaking in the air all the harm may be mended yet but there must be another test then he was silent for some time i have it he finally exclaimed jacob you must go back for the oats harvest you must ask susan to be your wife and ask her parents to let you have her but pay attention to my words you must tell her that you are a poor hired man on this place and that she can be engaged as housekeeper dont speak of me as your father but as the owner of the farm bring her here in that belief and let me see how honest and willing she is i can easily arrange matters with harry and sally while you are away and ill only ask you to keep up the appearance of the thing for a month or so but father jacob began not a word are you not willing to do that much for the sake of having her all your life and this farm after me suppose it is covered with a mortgage if she is all you say you two can work it off not a word more it is no lie after all that you will tell her i am afraid said jacob that she could not leave her home now she is too useful there and the family is so poor tell them that both your wages for the first year shall go to them itll be my business to rake and scrape the money together somehow say too that the housekeepers place cant be kept for her must be filled at once push matters like a man if you mean to be a complete one and bring her here if she carries no more with her than the clothes on her back during the following days jacob had time to familiarize his mind with this startling proposal he knew his fathers stubborn will too well to suppose that it could be changed but the inevitable soon converted itself into the possible and desirable the sweet face of susan as she had stood before him in the wheatfield was continually present to his eyes and ere long he began to place her in his thoughts in the old rooms at home in the garden among the thickets by the brook and in ann pardons pleasant parlor enough his fathers plan became his own long before the time was out on his second journey everybody seemed to be an old acquaintance and an intimate friend it was evening as he approached the meadows farm but the younger children recognized him in the dusk and their cry of oh heres jacob brought out the farmer and his wife and susan with the heartiest of welcomes they had all missed him they said even the horses and oxen had looked for him and they were wondering how they should get the oats harvested without him jacob looked at susan as the farmer said this and her eyes seemed to answer i said nothing but i knew you would come then first he felt sufficient courage for the task before him he rose the next morning before any one was stirring and waited until she should come down stairs the sun had not risen when she appeared with a milkpail in each hand walking unsuspectingly to the cowyard he waylaid her took the pails in his hand and said in nervous haste susan will you be my wife she stopped as if she had received a sudden blow then a shy sweet consent seemed to run through her heart o jacob was all she could say but you will susan he urged and then neither of them exactly knew how it happened all at once his arms were around her and they had kissed each other susan he said presently i am a poor man only a farm hand and must work for my living you could look for a better husband i could never find a better than you jacob would you work with me too at the same place you know i am not afraid of work she answered and i could never want any other lot than yours then he told her the story which his father had prompted her face grew bright and happy as she listened and he saw how from her very heart she accepted the humble fortune only the thought of her parents threw a cloud over the new and astonishing vision jacob however grew bolder as he saw fulfilment of his hope so near they took the pails and seated themselves beside neighbor cows one raising objections or misgivings which the other manfully combated jacobs earnestness unconsciously ran into his hands as he discovered when the impatient cow began to snort and kick the harvesting of the oats was not commenced that morning the children were sent away and there was a council of four persons held in the parlor the result of mutual protestations and much weeping was that the farmer and his wife agreed to receive jacob as a soninlaw the offer of the wages was four times refused by them and then accepted and the chance of their being able to live and labor together was finally decided to be too fortunate to let slip when the shock and surprise was over all gradually became cheerful and as the matter was more calmly discussed the first conjectured difficulties somehow resolved themselves into trifles it was the simplest and quietest wedding at home on an august morning farmer meadows then drove the bridal pair halfway on their journey to the old country tavern where a fresh conveyance had been engaged for them the same evening they reached the farmhouse in the valley and jacobs happy mood gave place to an anxious uncertainty as he remembered the period of deception upon which susan was entering he keenly watched his fathers face when they arrived and was a little relieved when he saw that his wife had made a good first impression so this is my new housekeeper said the old man i hope you will suit me as well as your husband does ill do my best sir said she but you must have patience with me for a few days until i know your ways and wishes mr flint said sally shall i get supper ready susan looked up in astonishment at hearing the name yes the old man remarked we both have the same name the fact is jacob and i are a sort of relations jacob in spite of his new happiness continued ill at ease although he could not help seeing how his father brightened under susans genial influence how satisfied he was with her quick neat exact ways and the cheerfulness with which she fulfilled her duties at the end of a week the old man counted out the wages agreed upon for both and his delight culminated at the frank simplicity with which susan took what she supposed she had fairly earned jacob he whispered when she had left the room keep quiet one more week and then ill let her know he had scarcely spoken when susan burst into the room again crying jacob they are coming they have come who father and mother and we didnt expect them you know for a week yet all three went to the door as the visitors made their appearance on the veranda two of the party stood as if thunderstruck and two exclamations came together samuel flint lucy wheeler there was a moments silence then the farmers wife with a visible effort to compose herself said lucy meadows now the tears came into samuel flints eyes let us shake hands lucy he said my son has married your daughter all but jacob were freshly startled at these words the two shook hands and then samuel turning to susans father said and this is your husband lucy i am glad to make his acquaintance your father jacob susan cried what does it all mean jacobs face grew red and the old habit of hanging his head nearly came back upon him he knew not what to say and looked wistfully at his father come into the house and sit down said the latter i think we shall all feel better when we have quietly and comfortably talked the matter over they went into the quaint oldfashioned parlor which had already been transformed by susans care so that much of its shabbiness was hidden when all were seated and samuel flint perceived that none of the others knew what to say he took a resolution which for a man of his mood and habit of life required some courage three of us here are old people he began and the two young ones love each other it was so long ago lucy that it cannot be laid to my blame if i speak of it now your husband i see has an honest heart and will not misunderstand either of us the same thing often turns up in life it is one of those secrets that everybody knows and that everybody talks about except the persons concerned when i was a young man lucy i loved you truly and i faithfully meant to make you my wife i thought so too for a while said she very calmly farmer meadows looked at his wife and no face was ever more beautiful than his with that expression of generous pity shining through it you know how i acted samuel flint continued but our children must also know that i broke off from you without giving any reason a woman came between us and made all the mischief i was considered rich then and she wanted to secure my money for her daughter i was an innocent and unsuspecting young man who believed that everybody else was as good as myself and the woman never rested until she had turned me from my first love and fastened me for life to another little by little i discovered the truth i kept the knowledge of the injury to myself i quickly got rid of the money which had so cursed me and brought my wife to this the loneliest and dreariest place in the neighborhood where i forced upon her a life of poverty i thought it was a just revenge but i was unjust she really loved me she was if not quite without blame in the matter ignorant of the worst that had been done i learned all that too late and she never complained though the change in me slowly wore out her life i know now that i was cruel but at the same time i punished myself and was innocently punishing my son but to him there was one way to make amends i will help him to a wife i said who will gladly take poverty with him and for his sake i forced him against his will to say that he was a hired hand on this place and that susan must be content to be a hired housekeeper now that i know susan i see that this proof might have been left out but i guess it has done no harm the place is not so heavily mortgaged as people think and it will be jacobs after i am gone and now forgive me all of you lucy first for she has most cause jacob next and susan that will be easier and you friend meadows if what i have said has been hard for you to hear the farmer stood up like a man took samuels hand and his wifes and said in a broken voice lucy i ask you too to forgive him and i ask you both to be good friends to each other susan dissolved in tears kissed all of them in turn but the happiest heart there was jacobs it was now easy for him to confide to his wife the complete story of his troubles and to find his growing selfreliance strengthened by her quick intelligent sympathy the pardons were better friends than ever and the fact which at first created great astonishment in the neighborhood that jacob flint had really gone upon a journey and brought home a handsome wife began to change the attitude of the people towards him the old place was no longer so lonely the nearest neighbors began to drop in and insist on return visits now that jacob kept his head up and they got a fair view of his face they discovered that he was not lacking after all in sense or social qualities in october the whitney place which had been leased for several years was advertised to be sold at public sale the owner had gone to the city and become a successful merchant had outlived his local attachments and now took advantage of a rise in real estate to disburden himself of a property which he could not profitably control everybody from far and wide attended the sale and when jacob flint and his father arrived everybody said to the former of course youve come to buy jacob but each man laughed at his own smartness and considered the remark original with himself jacob was no longer annoyed he laughed too and answered im afraid i cant do that but ive kept half my word which is more than most men do jakes no fool after all was whispered behind him the bidding commenced at first very spirited and then gradually slacking off as the price mounted above the means of the neighboring farmers the chief aspirant was a stranger a welldressed man with a lawyers air whom nobody knew after the usual long pauses and passionate exhortations the hammer fell and the auctioneer turning to the stranger asked what name jacob flint there was a general cry of surprise all looked at jacob whose eyes and mouth showed that he was as dumbfoundered as the rest the stranger walked coolly through the midst of the crowd to samuel flint and said when shall i have the papers drawn up as soon as you can the old man replied then seizing jacob by the arm with the words lets go home now he hurried him on the explanation soon leaked out samuel flint had not thrown away his wealth but had put it out of his own hands it was given privately to trustees to be held for his son and returned when the latter should have married with his fathers consent there was more than enough to buy the whitney place jacob and susan are happy in their stately home and good as they are happy if any person in the neighborhood ever makes use of the phrase jacob flints journey he intends thereby to symbolize the good fortune which sometimes follows honesty reticence and shrewdness can a life hide itself i had been reading as is my wont from time to time one of the many volumes of the new pitaval that singular record of human crime and human cunning and also of the inevitable fatality which in every case leaves a gate open for detection were it not for the latter fact indeed one would turn with loathing from such endless chronicles of wickedness yet these may be safely contemplated when one has discovered the incredible fatuity of crime the certain weak mesh in a network of devilish texture or is it rather the agency of a power outside of man a subtile protecting principle which allows the operation of the evil element only that the latter may finally betray itself whatever explanation we may choose the fact is there like a tonic medicine distilled from poisonous plants to brace our faith in the ascendancy of good in the government of the world laying aside the book i fell into a speculation concerning the mixture of the two elements in mans nature the life of an individual is usually it seemed to me a series of results the processes leading to which are not often visible or observed when they are so each act is the precipitation of a number of mixed influences more or less unconsciously felt the qualities of good and evil are so blended therein that they defy the keenest moral analysis and how shall we then pretend to judge of any one perhaps the surest indication of evil i further reflected is that it always tries to conceal itself and the strongest incitement to good is that evil cannot be concealed the crime or the vice or even the selfacknowledged weakness becomes a part of the individual consciousness it cannot be forgotten or outgrown it follows a life through all experiences and to the uttermost ends of the earth pressing towards the light with a terrible demoniac power there are noteless lives of course lives that accept obscurity mechanically run their narrow round of circumstance and are lost but when a life endeavors to lose itself to hide some conscious guilt or failure can it succeed is it not thereby lifted above the level of common experience compelling attention to itself by the very endeavor to escape it i turned these questions over in my mind without approaching or indeed expecting any solution since i knew from habit the labyrinths into which they would certainly lead me when a visitor was announced it was one of the directors of our county almshouse who came on an errand to which he attached no great importance i owed the visit apparently to the circumstance that my home lay in his way and he could at once relieve his conscience of a very trifling pressure and his pocket of a small package by calling upon me his story was told in a few words the package was placed upon my table and i was again left to my meditations two or three days before a man who had the appearance of a tramp had been observed by the people of a small village in the neighborhood he stopped and looked at the houses in a vacant way walked back and forth once or twice as if uncertain which of the crossroads to take and presently went on without begging or even speaking to any one towards sunset a farmer on his way to the village store found him sitting at the roadside his head resting against a fencepost the mans face was so worn and exhausted that the farmer kindly stopped and addressed him but he gave no other reply than a shake of the head the farmer thereupon lifted him into his light countrywagon the man offering no resistance and drove to the tavern where his exhaustion being so evident a glass of whiskey was administered to him he afterwards spoke a few words in german which no one understood at the almshouse to which he was transported the same evening he refused to answer the customary questions although he appeared to understand them the physician was obliged to use a slight degree of force in administering nourishment and medicine but neither was of any avail the man died within twentyfour hours after being received his pockets were empty but two small leathern wallets were found under his pillow and these formed the package which the director left in my charge they were full of papers in a foreign language he said and he supposed i might be able to ascertain the strangers name and home from them i took up the wallets which were worn and greasy from long service opened them and saw that they were filled with scraps fragments and folded pieces of paper nearly every one of which had been carried for a long time loose in the pocket some were written in pen and ink and some in pencil but all were equally brown worn and unsavory in appearance in turning them over however my eye was caught by some slips in the russian character and three or four notes in french the rest were german i laid aside pitaval at once emptied all the leathern pockets carefully and set about examining the pile of material i first ran rapidly through the papers to ascertain the dead mans name but it was nowhere to be found there were half a dozen letters written on sheets folded and addressed in the fashion which prevailed before envelopes were invented but the name was cut out of the address in every case there was an official permit to embark on board a bremen steamer mutilated in the same way there was a card photograph from which the face had been scratched by a penknife there were latin sentences accounts of expenses a list of new york addresses covering eight pages and a number of notes written either in warsaw or breslau a more incongruous collection i never saw and i am sure that had it not been for the train of thought i was pursuing when the director called upon me i should have returned the papers to him without troubling my head with any attempt to unravel the mans story the evidence however that he had endeavored to hide his life had been revealed by my first superficial examination and here i reflected was a singular opportunity to test both his degree of success and my own power of constructing a coherent history out of the detached fragments unpromising as is the matter said i let me see whether he can conceal his secret from even such unpractised eyes as mine i went through the papers again read each one rapidly and arranged them in separate files according to the character of their contents then i rearranged these latter in the order of time so far as it was indicated and afterwards commenced the work of picking out and threading together whatever facts might be noted the first thing i ascertained or rather conjectured was that the mans life might be divided into three very distinct phases the first ending in breslau the second in poland and the third and final one in america thereupon i once again rearranged the material and attacked that which related to the first phase it consisted of the following papers three letters in a female hand commencing my dear brother and terminating with thy loving sister elise part of a diploma from a gymnasium or high school certifying that here the name was cut out had successfully passed his examination and was competent to teach and here again whether by accident or design the paper was torn off a note apparently to a jeweller ordering a certain gold ring to be delivered to otto and signed b v h a receipt from the packagepost for a box forwarded to warsaw to the address of count ladislas kasincsky and finally a washinglist at the bottom of which was written in pencil in a trembling hand may god protect thee but do not stay away so very long in the second collection relating to poland i found the following six orders in russian and three in french requesting somebody to send by jean sums of money varying from two to eight hundred rubles these orders were in the same hand and all signed y a charming letter in french addressed cher ami and declining in the most delicate and tender way an offer of marriage made to the sister of the writer of whose signature only amelie de remained the family name having been torn off a few memoranda of expenses one of which was curious dinner with jean rubles and immediately after it doctor rubles there were moreover a leaf torn out of a journal and half of a note which had been torn down the middle both implicating jean in some way with the fortunes of the dead man the papers belonging to the american phase so far as they were to be identified by dates or by some internal evidence were fewer but even more enigmatical in character the principal one was a list of addresses in new york divided into sections the street boundaries of which were given there were no names but some of the addresses were marked and others and a few had been crossed out with a pencil then there were some leaves of a journal of diet and bodily symptoms of a very singular character three fragments of drafts of letters in pencil one of them commencing dog and villain and a single note of began work september th this was about a year before his death the date of the diploma given by the gymnasium at breslau was june and the first date in poland was may belonging to the time between these two periods there were only the order for the ring and a little memorandum in pencil dated posen dec the last date in poland was march and the permit to embark at bremen was dated in october of that year here at least was a slight chronological framework the physician who attended the county almshouse had estimated the mans age at thirty which supposing him to have been nineteen at the time of receiving the diploma confirmed the dates to that extent i assumed at the start that the name which had been so carefully cut out of all the documents was the mans own the elise of the letters was therefore his sister the first two letters related merely to mothers health and similar details from which it was impossible to extract any thing except that the sister was in some kind of service the second letter closed with i have enough work to do but i keep well forget thy disappointment so far as i am concerned for i never expected any thing i dont know why but i never did here was a disappointment at least to begin with i made a note of it opposite the date on my blank programme and took up the next letter it was written in november and contained a passage which keenly excited my curiosity it ran thus do pray be more careful of thy money it may be all as thou sayest and inevitable but i dare not mention the thing to mother and five thalers is all i can spare out of my own wages as for thy other request i have granted it as thou seest but it makes me a little anxious what is the joke and how can it serve thee that is what i do not understand and i have plagued myself not a little to guess among the polish memoranda was this sept to dec rubles which i assumed to represent a salary this would give him eight hundred a year at least twelve times the amount which his sister who must either have been cook or housekeeper since she spoke of going to market for the family could have received his application to her for money and the manner of her reference to it indicated some imprudence or irregularity on his part what the other request was i could not guess but as i was turning and twisting the worn leaf in some perplexity i made a sudden discovery one side of the bottom edge had been very slightly doubled over in folding and as i smoothed it out i noticed some diminutive letters in the crease the paper had been worn nearly through but i made out the words write very soon dear otto this was the name in the order for the gold ring signed b v h a link indeed but a fresh puzzle knowing the stubborn prejudices of caste in germany and above all in eastern prussia and silesia i should have been compelled to accept otto whose sister was in service as himself the servant of b v h but for the tenderly respectful letter of amelie de declining the marriage offer for her sister i reread this letter very carefully to determine whether it was really intended for otto it ran thus dear friend i will not say that your letter was entirely unexpected either to helmine or myself i should perhaps have less faith in the sincerity of your attachment if you had not already involuntarily betrayed it when i say that although i detected the inclination of your heart some weeks ago and that i also saw it was becoming evident to my sister yet i refrained from mentioning the subject at all until she came to me last evening with your letter in her hand when i say this you will understand that i have acted towards you with the respect and sympathy which i profoundly feel helmine fully shares this feeling and her poor heart is too painfully moved to allow her to reply do i not say in saying this what her reply must be but though her heart cannot respond to your love she hopes you will always believe her a friend to whom your proffered devotion was an honor and will be if you will subdue it to her deserts a grateful thing to remember we shall remain in warsaw a fortnight longer as i think yourself will agree that it is better we should not immediately return to the castle jean who must carry a fresh order already will bring you this and we hope to have good news of henri i send back the papers which were unnecessary we never doubted you and we shall of course keep your secret so long as you choose to wear it amelie de the more light i seemed to obtain the more inexplicable the circumstances became the diploma and the note of salary were grounds for supposing that otto occupied the position of tutor in a noble polish family there was the receipt for a box addressed to count ladislas kasincsky and i temporarily added his family name to the writer of the french letter assuming her to be his wife jean appeared to be a servant and henri i set down as the son whom otto was instructing in the castle or family seat in the country while the parents were in warsaw plausible so far but the letter was not such a one as a countess would have written to her sons tutor under similar circumstances it was addressed to a social equal apparently to a man younger than herself and for whom supposing him to have been a tutor secretary or something of the kind she must have felt a special sympathy her mention of the papers and your secret must refer to circumstances which would explain the mystery so long as you choose to wear it she had written then it was certainly a secret connected with his personal history further it appeared that jean was sent to him with an order what could this be but one of the nine orders for money which lay before my eyes i examined the dates of the latter and lo there was one written upon the same day as the ladys letter the sums drawn by these orders amounted in all to four thousand two hundred rubles but how should a tutor or secretary be in possession of his employers money still this might be accounted for it would imply great trust on the part of the latter but no more than one man frequently reposes in another yet if it were so one of the memoranda confronted me with a conflicting fact dinner with jean rubles the unusual amount nearly fifty dollars indicated an act of the most reckless dissipation and in company with a servant if jean as i could scarcely doubt acted in that character i finally decided to assume both these conjectures as true and apply them to the remaining testimony i first took up the leaf which had been torn out of a small journal or pocket notebook as was manifested by the red edge on three sides it was scribbled over with brief notes in pencil written at different times many of them were merely mnemonic signs but the recurrence of the letters j and y seemed to point to transactions with jean and the drawer of the various sums of money the letter y reminded me that i had been too hasty in giving the name of kasincsky to the noble family indeed the name upon the postoffice receipt might have no connection with the matter i was trying to investigate suddenly i noticed a ky among the mnemonic signs and the suspicion flashed across my mind that count kasincsky had signed the order with the last letter of his family name to assume this however suggested a secret reason for doing so and i began to think that i had already secrets enough on hand the leaf was much rubbed and worn and it was not without considerable trouble that i deciphered the following omitting the unintelligible signs oct nov talk with y jean consider nov with j h hope dec told the c no knowledge of s therefore safe uncertain of c to warsaw met j as agreed further and further dec all for naught all for naught jan sick what is to be the end threats no tidings of y walked the streets all day at night as usual march news the c and h left yesterday no more to hope let it come then these broken words warmed my imagination powerfully looking at them in the light of my conjecture i was satisfied that otto was involved in some crime or dangerous secret of which jean was either the instigator or the accomplice y or count kasincsky and i was more than ever inclined to connect the two also had his mystery which might or might not be identical with the first by comparing dates i found that the entry made december was three days later than the date of the letter of amelie de and the exclamation all for naught certainly referred to the disappointment it contained i now guessed the h in the second entry to mean helmine the two last suggested a removal to warsaw from the country here was a little more ground to stand on but how should i ever get at the secret i took up the torn half of a note which after the first inspection i had laid aside as a hopeless puzzle a closer examination revealed several things which failed to impress me at the outset it was written in a strong and rather awkward masculine hand several words were underscored two misspelled and i felt i scarcely knew why that it was written in a spirit of mingled contempt and defiance let me give the fragment just as it lay before me aron it is quite time be done who knows is not his home by this concern for the that they are well off sian officers are cide at once my risau or i must t ten days delay money can be divitier and you may ever you please untess goes and she will know who you time unless you carry friend or not decide ann helm here i felt sure was the clue to much of the mystery the first thing that struck me was the appearance of a new name i looked at it again ran through in my mind all possible german names and found that it could only be johann and in the same instant i recalled the frequent habit of the prussian and polish nobility of calling their german valets by french names this then was jean the address was certainly baron and why thrice underscored unless in contemptuous satire light began to break upon the matter at last otto had been playing the part perhaps assuming the name of a nobleman seduced to the deception by his passion for the countess sister helmine this explained the reference to the papers and the secret and would account for the respectful and sympathetic tone of the countess letter but behind this there was certainly another secret in which y whoever he might be was concerned and which related to money the close of the note which i filled out to read your friend or not as you may decide conveyed a threat and to judge from the halves of lines immediately preceding it the threat referred to the money as well as to the betrayal of an assumed character here just as the story began to appear in faint outline my discoveries stopped for a while i ascertained the breadth of the original note by a part of the middlecrease which remained filled out the torn part with blank paper completed the divided words in the same character of manuscript and endeavored to guess the remainder but no clairvoyant power of divination came to my aid i turned over the letters again remarking the neatness with which the addresses had been cut off and wondering why the man had not destroyed the letters and other memoranda entirely if he wished to hide a possible crime the fact that they were not destroyed showed the hold which his past life had had upon him even to his dying hour weak and vain as i had already suspected him to be wanting in all manly fibre and of the very material which a keen energetic villain would mould to his needs i felt that his love for his sister and for helmine and other associations connected with his life in germany and poland had made him cling to these worn records i know not what gave me the suspicion that he had not even found the heart to destroy the exscinded names perhaps the care with which they had been removed perhaps in two instances the circumstance of their taking words out of the body of the letters with them but the suspicion came and led to a reexamination of the leathern wallets i could scarcely believe my eyes when feeling something rustle faintly as i pressed the thin lining of an inner pocket i drew forth three or four small pellets of paper and unrolling them found the lost addresses i fitted them to the vacant places and found that the first letters of the sister in breslau had been forwarded to otto lindenschmidt while the letter to poland was addressed otto von herisau i warmed with this success which exactly tallied with the previous discoveries and returned again to the polish memoranda the words russian officers in jeans note led me to notice that it had been written towards the close of the last insurrection in poland a circumstance which i immediately coupled with some things in the note and on the leaf of the journal no tidings of y might indicate that count kasincsky had been concerned in the rebellion and had fled or been taken prisoner had he left a large amount of funds in the hands of the supposed otto von herisau which were drawn from time to time by orders the form of which had been previously agreed upon then when he had disappeared might it not have been the remaining funds which jean urged otto to divide with him while the latter misled and entangled in deception rather than naturally dishonest held back from such a step i could hardly doubt so much and it now required but a slight effort of the imagination to complete the torn note the next letter of the sister was addressed to bremen after having established so many particulars i found it easily intelligible i have done what i can she wrote i put it in this letter it is all i have but do not ask me for money again mother is ailing most of the time and i have not yet dared to tell her all i shall suffer great anxiety until i hear that the vessel has sailed my mistress is very good she has given me an advance on my wages or i could not have sent thee any thing mother thinks thou art still in leipzig why didst thou stay there so long but no difference thy money would have gone anyhow it was nevertheless singular that otto should be without money so soon after the appropriation of count kasincskys funds if the in the first memorandum on the leaf meant twenty thousand rubles as i conjectured and but four thousand two hundred were drawn by the count previous to his flight or imprisonment ottos half of the remainder would amount to nearly eight thousand rubles and it was therefore not easy to account for his delay in leipzig and his destitute condition before examining the fragments relating to the american phase of his life which illustrated his previous history only by occasional revelations of his moods and feelings i made one more effort to guess the cause of his having assumed the name of von herisau the initials signed to the order for the ring b v h certainly stood for the same family name and the possession of papers belonging to one of the family was an additional evidence that otto had either been in the service of or was related to some von herisau perhaps a sentence in one of the sisters letters forget thy disappointment so far as i am concerned for i never expected any thing referred to something of the kind on the whole service seemed more likely than kinship but in that case the papers must have been stolen i had endeavored from the start to keep my sympathies out of the investigation lest they should lead me to misinterpret the broken evidence and thus defeat my object it must have been the countess letter and the brief almost stenographic signs of anxiety and unhappiness on the leaf of the journal that first beguiled me into a commiseration which the simple devotion and selfsacrifice of the poor toiling sister failed to neutralize however i detected the feeling at this stage of the examination and turned to the american records in order to get rid of it the principal paper was the list of addresses of which i have spoken i looked over it in vain to find some indication of its purpose yet it had been carefully made out and much used there was no name of a person upon it only numbers and streets one hundred and thirtyeight in all finally i took these one by one to ascertain if any of the houses were known to me and found three out of the whole number to be the residences of persons whom i knew one was a german gentleman and the other two were americans who had visited germany the riddle was read during a former residence in new york i had for a time been quite overrun by destitute germans men apparently of some culture who represented themselves as theological students political refugees or unfortunate clerks and secretaries soliciting assistance i found that when i gave to one a dozen others came within the next fortnight when i refused the persecution ceased for about the same length of time i became convinced at last that these persons were members of an organized society of beggars and the result proved it for when i made it an inviolable rule to give to no one who could not bring me an indorsement of his need by some person whom i knew the annoyance ceased altogether the meaning of the list of addresses was now plain my nascent commiseration for the man was not only checked but i was in danger of changing my role from that of culprits counsel to that of prosecuting attorney when i took up again the fragment of the first draught of a letter commencing dog and villain and applied it to the words jean or johann helm the few lines which could be deciphered became full of meaning dont think it began that i have forgotten you or the trick you played me if i was drunk or drugged the last night i know how it happened for all that i left but i shall go back and if you make use of here some words were entirely obliterated is true he gave me the ring and meant this was all i could make out the other papers showed only scattered memoranda of money or appointments or addresses with the exception of the diary in pencil i read the letter attentively and at first with very little idea of its meaning many of the words were abbreviated and there were some arbitrary signs it ran over a period of about four months terminating six weeks before the mans death he had been wandering about the country during this period sleeping in woods and barns and living principally upon milk the condition of his pulse and other physical functions was scrupulously set down with an occasional remark of good or bad the conclusion was at last forced upon me that he had been endeavoring to commit suicide by a slow course of starvation and exposure either as the cause or the result of this attempt i read in the final notes signs of an aberration of mind this also explained the singular demeanor of the man when found and his refusal to take medicine or nourishment he had selected a long way to accomplish his purpose but had reached the end at last the confused material had now taken shape the dead man despite his will had confessed to me his name and the chief events of his life it now remained looking at each event as the result of a long chain of causes to deduce from them the elements of his individual character and then fill up the inevitable gaps in the story from the probabilities of the operation of those elements this was not so much a mere venture as the reader may suppose because the two actions of the mind test each other if they cannot thus working towards a point and back again actually discover what was they may at least fix upon a very probable might have been a person accustomed to detective work would have obtained my little stock of facts with much less trouble and would almost instinctively have filled the blanks as he went along being an apprentice in such matters i had handled the materials awkwardly i will not here retrace my own mental zigzags between character and act but simply repeat the story as i finally settled and accepted it otto lindenschmidt was the child of poor parents in or near breslau his father died when he was young his mother earned a scanty subsistence as a washerwoman his sister went into service being a bright handsome boy he attracted the attention of a baron von herisau an old childless eccentric gentleman who took him first as page or attendant intending to make him a superior valet de chambre gradually however the baron fancied that he detected in the boy a capacity for better things his condescending feeling of protection had grown into an attachment for the handsome amiable grateful young fellow and he placed him in the gymnasium at breslau perhaps with the idea now of educating him to be an intelligent companion the boy and his humble relatives dazzled by this opportunity began secretly to consider the favor as almost equivalent to his adoption as a son the baron had once been married but his wife and only child had long been dead the old man of course came to look upon the growing intelligence of the youth as his own work vanity and affection became inextricably blended in his heart and when the cursus was over he took him home as the companion of his lonely life after two or three years during which the young man was acquiring habits of idleness and indulgence supposing his future secure the baron died perhaps too suddenly to make full provision for him perhaps after having kept up the appearance of wealth on a lifeannuity but in any case leaving very little if any property to otto in his disappointment the latter retained certain family papers which the baron had intrusted to his keeping the ring was a gift and he wore it in remembrance of his benefactor wandering about micawberlike in hopes that something might turn up he reached posen and there either met or heard of the polish count ladislas kasincsky who was seeking a tutor for his only son his accomplishments and perhaps also a certain aristocratic grace of manner unconsciously caught from the baron von herisau speedily won for him the favor of the count and countess kasincsky and emboldened him to hope for the hand of the countess sister helmine to whom he was no doubt sincerely attached here johann helm or jean a confidential servant of the count who looked upon the new tutor as a rival yet adroitly flattered his vanity for the purpose of misleading and displacing him appears upon the stage jean first detected ottos passion jean at an epicurean dinner wormed out of otto the secret of the herisau documents and perhaps suggested the part which the latter afterwards played this jean seemed to me to have been the evil agency in the miserable history which followed after helmines rejection of ottos suit and the flight or captivity of count kasincsky leaving a large sum of money in ottos hands it would be easy for jean by mingled persuasions and threats to move the latter to flight after dividing the money still remaining in his hands after the theft and the partition which took place beyond the polish frontier jean in turn stole his accomplices share together with the von herisau documents exile and a years experience of organized mendicancy did the rest otto lindenschmidt was one of those natures which possess no moral elasticity which have neither the power nor the comprehension of atonement the first real unmitigated guilt whether great or small breaks them down hopelessly he expected no chance of selfredemption and he found none his life in america was so utterly dark and hopeless that the brightest moment in it must have been that which showed him the approach of death my task was done i had tracked this weak vain erring hunted soul to its last refuge and the knowledge bequeathed to me but a single duty his sins were balanced by his temptations his vanity and weakness had revenged themselves and there only remained to tell the simple faithful sister that her sacrifices were no longer required i burned the evidences of guilt despair and suicide and sent the other papers with a letter relating the time and circumstances of otto lindenschmidts death to the civil authorities of breslau requesting that they might be placed in the hands of his sister elise this i supposed was the end of the history so far as my connection with it was concerned but one cannot track a secret with impunity the fatality connected with the act and the actor clings even to the knowledge of the act i had opened my door a little in order to look out upon the life of another but in doing so a ghost had entered in and was not to be dislodged until i had done its service in the summer of i was in germany and during a brief journey of idlesse and enjoyment came to the lovely little wateringplace of liebenstein on the southern slope of the thuringian forest i had no expectation or even desire of making new acquaintances among the gay company who took their afternoon coffee under the noble linden trees on the terrace but within the first hour of my afterdinner leisure i was greeted by an old friend an author from coburg and carried away in my own despite to a group of his associates my friend and his friends had already been at the place a fortnight and knew the very tint and texture of its gossip while i sipped my coffee i listened to them with one ear and to wagners overture to lohengrin with the other and i should soon have been wholly occupied with the fine orchestra had i not been caught and startled by an unexpected name have you noticed some one asked how much attention the baron von herisau is paying her i whirled round and exclaimed in a breath the baron von herisau yes said my friend do you know him i was glad that three crashing tremendous chords came from the orchestra just then giving me time to collect myself before i replied i am not sure whether it is the same person i knew a baron von herisau long ago how old is the gentleman here about thirtyfive i should think my friend answered ah then it cant be the same person said i still if he should happen to pass near us will you point him out to me it was an hour later and we were all hotly discussing the question of lessings obligations to english literature when one of the gentlemen at the table said there goes the baron von herisau is it perhaps your friend sir i turned and saw a tall man with prominent nose opaque black eyes and black mustache walking beside a pretty insipid girl behind the pair went an elderly couple overdressed and snobbish in appearance a carriage with servants in livery waited in the open space below the terrace and having received the two couples whirled swiftly away towards altenstein had i been more of a philosopher i should have wasted no second thought on the baron von herisau but the nemesis of the knowledge which i had throttled poor otto lindenschmidts ghost to obtain had come upon me at last and there was no rest for me until i had discovered who and what was the baron the list of guests which the landlord gave me whetted my curiosity to a painful degree for on it i found the entry aug otto v herisau rentier east prussia it was quite dark when the carriage returned i watched the company into the supperroom and then whisking in behind them secured a place at the nearest table i had an hour of quiet stealthy observation before my coburg friend discovered me and by that time i was glad of his company and had need of his confidence but before making use of him in the second capacity i desired to make the acquaintance of the adjoining partie carree he had bowed to them familiarly in passing and when the old gentleman said will you not join us herr i answered my friends interrogative glance with a decided affirmative and we moved to the other table my seat was beside the baron von herisau with whom i exchanged the usual commonplaces after an introduction his manner was cold and taciturn i thought and there was something forced in the smile which accompanied his replies to the remarks of the coarse old lady who continually referred to the herr baron as authority upon every possible subject i noticed however that he cast a sudden sharp glance at me when i was presented to the company as an american the mans neighborhood disturbed me i was obliged to let the conversation run in the channels already selected and stupid enough i found them i was considering whether i should not give a signal to my friend and withdraw when the baron stretched his hand across the table for a bottle of affenthaler and i caught sight of a massive gold ring on his middle finger instantly i remembered the ring which b v h had given to otto lindenschmidt and i said to myself that is it the inference followed like lightning that it was johann helm who sat beside me and not a baron von herisau that evening my friend and i had a long absorbing conversation in my room i told him the whole story which came back vividly to memory and learned in return that the reputed baron was supposed to be wealthy that the old gentleman was a bremen merchant or banker known to be rich that neither was considered by those who had met them to be particularly intelligent or refined and that the wooing of the daughter had already become so marked as to be a general subject of gossip my friend was inclined to think my conjecture correct and willingly cooperated with me in a plan to test the matter we had no considerable sympathy with the snobbish parents whose servility to a title was so apparent but the daughter seemed to be an innocent and amiable creature however silly and we determined to spare her the shame of an open scandal if our scheme should seem a little melodramatic it must not be forgotten that my friend was an author the next morning as the baron came up the terrace after his visit to the spring i stepped forward and greeted him politely after which i said i see by the strangers list that you are from east prussia baron have you ever been in poland at that moment a voice behind him called out rather sharply jean the baron started turned round and then back to me and all his art could not prevent the blood from rushing to his face i made as if by accident a gesture with my hand indicating success and went a step further because said i i am thinking of making a visit to cracow and warsaw and should be glad of any information certainly he interrupted me and i should be very glad to give it if i had ever visited poland at least i continued you can advise me upon one point but excuse me shall we not sit down a moment yonder as my question relates to money i should not wish to be overheard i pointed out a retired spot just before reaching which we were joined by my friend who suddenly stepped out from behind a clump of lilacs the baron and he saluted each other now said i to the former i can ask your advice mr johann helm he was not an adept after all his astonishment and confusion were brief to be sure but they betrayed him so completely that his afterimpulse to assume a haughty offensive air only made us smile if i had a message to you from otto lindenschmidt what then i asked he turned pale and presently stammered out he he is dead now said my friend it is quite time to drop the mask before us you see we know you and we know your history not from otto lindenschmidt alone count ladislas kasincsky what has he come back from siberia exclaimed johann helm his face expressed abject terror i think he would have fallen upon his knees before us if he had not somehow felt by a rascals instinct that we had no personal wrongs to redress in unmasking him our object however was to ascertain through him the complete facts of otto lindenschmidts history and then to banish him from liebenstein we allowed him to suppose for awhile that we were acting under the authority of persons concerned in order to make the best possible use of his demoralized mood for we knew it would not last long my guesses were very nearly correct otto lindenschmidt had been educated by an old baron bernhard von herisau on account of his resemblance in person to a dead son whose name had also been otto he could not have adopted the plebeian youth at least to the extent of giving him an old and haughty name but this the latter nevertheless expected up to the time of the barons death he had inherited a little property from his benefactor but soon ran through it he was a lightheaded fellow said johann helm but he knew how to get the confidence of the old junkers if he hadnt been so cowardly and fidgety he might have made himself a career the polish episode differed so little from my interpretation that i need not repeat helms version he denied having stolen ottos share of the money but could not help admitting his possession of the von herisau papers among which were the certificates of birth and baptism of the old barons son otto it seems that he had been fearful of lindenschmidts return from america for he managed to communicate with his sister in breslau and in this way learned the formers death not until then had he dared to assume his present disguise we let him go after exacting a solemn pledge that he would betake himself at once to hamburg and there ship for australia i judged that america was already amply supplied with individuals of his class the sudden departure of the baron von herisau was a two days wonder at liebenstein but besides ourselves only the bremen banker knew the secret he also left two days afterwards with his wife and daughter their cases it was reported requiring kissingen otto lindenschmidts life therefore could not hide itself can any life twinlove when john vincent after waiting twelve years married phebe etheridge the whole neighborhood experienced that sense of relief and satisfaction which follows the triumph of the right not that the fact of a true love is ever generally recognized and respected when it is first discovered for there is a perverse quality in american human nature which will not accept the existence of any fine unselfish passion until it has been tested and established beyond peradventure there were two views of the case when john vincents love for phebe and old reuben etheridges hard prohibition of the match first became known to the community the girls and boys and some of the matrons ranged themselves at once on the side of the lovers but a large majority of the older men and a few of the younger supported the tyrannical father reuben etheridge was rich and in addition to what his daughter would naturally inherit from him she already possessed more than her lover at the time of their betrothal this in the eyes of one class was a sufficient reason for the fathers hostility when low natures live as they almost invariably do wholly in the present they neither take tenderness from the past nor warning from the possibilities of the future it is the exceptional men and women who remember their youth so these lovers received a nearly equal amount of sympathy and condemnation and only slowly partly through their quiet fidelity and patience and partly through the improvement in john vincents worldly circumstances was the balance changed old reuben remained an unflinching despot to the last if any relenting softness touched his heart he sternly concealed it and such inference as could be drawn from the fact that he certainly knowing what would follow his death bequeathed his daughter her proper share of his goods was all that could be taken for consent they were married john a grave man in middle age weatherbeaten and worn by years of hard work and selfdenial yet not beyond the restoration of a milder second youth and phebe a sad weary woman whose warmth of longing had been exhausted from whom youth and its uncalculating surrenders of hope and feeling had gone forever they began their wedded life under the shadow of the death out of which it grew and when after a ceremony in which neither bridesmaid nor groomsman stood by their side they united their divided homes it seemed to their neighbors that a separated husband and wife had come together again not that the relation was new to either john vincent loved his wife with the tenderness of an innocent man but all his tenderness could not avail to lift the weight of settled melancholy which had gathered upon her disappointment waiting yearning indulgence in long lament and selfpity the morbid cultivation of unhappy fancies all this had wrought its work upon her and it was too late to effect a cure in the night she awoke to weep at his side because of the years when she had awakened to weep alone by day she kept up her old habit of foreboding although the evening steadily refuted the morning and there were times when without any apparent cause she would fall into a dark despairing mood which her husbands greatest care and cunning could only slowly dispel two or three years passed and new life came to the vincent farm one day between midnight and dawn the family pair was doubled the cry of twin sons was heard in the hushed house the father restrained his happy wonder in his concern for the imperilled life of the mother he guessed that she had anticipated death and she now hung by a thread so slight that her simple will might snap it but her will fortunately was as faint as her consciousness she gradually drifted out of danger taking her returning strength with a passive acquiescence rather than with joy she was hardly paler than her wont but the lurking shadow seemed to have vanished from her eyes and john vincent felt that her features had assumed a new expression the faintly perceptible stamp of some spiritual change it was a happy day for him when propped against his breast and gently held by his warm strong arm the twin boys were first brought to be laid upon her lap two staring darkfaced creatures with restless fists and feet they were alike in every least feature of their grotesque animality phebe placed a hand under the head of each and looked at them for a long time in silence why is this she said at last taking hold of a narrow pink ribbon which was tied around the wrist of one hes the oldest sure the nurse answered only by fifteen minutes or so but it generally makes a difference when twins come to be named and you may see with your own eyes that theres no telling of em apart otherways take off the ribbon then said phebe quietly i know them why maam its always done where theyre so like and ill never be able to tell which is which for they sleep and wake and feed by the same clock and you might mistake after all in giving em names there is no oldest or youngest john they are two and yet one this is mine and this is yours i see no difference at all phebe said john and how can we divide them we will not divide she answered i only meant it as a sign she smiled for the first time in many days he was glad of heart but did not understand her what shall we call them he asked elias and reuben after our fathers no john their names must be david and jonathan and so they were called and they grew not less but more alike in passing through the stages of babyhood the ribbon of the older one had been removed and the nurse would have been distracted but for phebes almost miraculous instinct the former comforted herself with the hope that teething would bring a variation to the two identical mouths but no they teethed as one child john after desperate attempts which always failed in spite of the headaches they gave him postponed the idea of distinguishing one from the other until they should be old enough to develop some dissimilarity of speech or gait or habit all trouble might have been avoided had phebe consented to the least variation in their dresses but herein she was mildly immovable not yet was her set reply to her husband and one day when he manifested a little annoyance at her persistence she turned to him holding a child on each knee and said with a gravity which silenced him thenceforth john can you not see that our burden has passed into them is there no meaning in this that two children who are one in body and face and nature should be given to us at our time of life after such long disappointment and trouble our lives were held apart theirs were united before they were born and i dare not turn them in different directions perhaps i do not know all that the lord intended to say to us in sending them but his hand is here i was only thinking of their good john meekly answered if they are spared to grow up there must be some way of knowing one from the other they will not need it and i too think only of them they have taken the cross from my heart and i will lay none on theirs i am reconciled to my life through them john you have been very patient and good with me and i will yield to you in all things but in this i do not think i shall live to see them as men grown yet while we are together i feel clearly what it is right to do can you not just once have a little faith without knowledge john ill try phebe he said any way ill grant that the boys belong to you more than to me phebe vincents character had verily changed her attacks of semihysterical despondency never returned her gloomy prophecies ceased she was still grave and the trouble of so many years never wholly vanished from her face but she performed every duty of her life with at least a quiet willingness and her home became the abode of peace for passive content wears longer than demonstrative happiness david and jonathan grew as one boy the taste and temper of one was repeated in the other even as the voice and features sleeping or waking grieved or joyous well or ill they lived a single life and it seemed so natural for one to answer to the others name that they probably would have themselves confused their own identities but for their mothers unerring knowledge perhaps unconsciously guided by her perhaps through the voluntary action of their own natures each quietly took the others place when called upon even to the sharing of praise or blame at school the friendships and quarrels of the playground they were healthy and happy lads and john vincent was accustomed to say to his neighbors theyre no more trouble than one would be and yet theyre four hands instead of two phebe died when they were fourteen saying to them with almost her latest breath be one always before her husband could decide whether to change her plan of domestic education they were passing out of boyhood changing in voice stature and character with a continued likeness which bewildered and almost terrified him he procured garments of different colors but they were accustomed to wear each article in common and the result was only a mixture of tints for both they were sent to different schools to be returned the next day equally pale suffering and incapable of study whatever device was employed they evaded it by a mutual instinct which rendered all external measures unavailing to john vincents mind their resemblance was an accidental misfortune which had been confirmed through their mothers fancy he felt that they were bound by some deep mysterious tie which inasmuch as it might interfere with all practical aspects of life ought to be gradually weakened two bodies to him implied two distinct men and it was wrong to permit a mutual dependence which prevented either from exercising his own separate will and judgment but while he was planning and pondering the boys became young men and he was an old man old and prematurely broken for he had worked much borne much and his large frame held only a moderate measure of vital force a great weariness fell upon him and his powers began to give way at first slowly but then with accelerated failure he saw the end coming long before his sons suspected it his doubt for their sakes was the only thing which made it unwelcome it was upon his mind as his quaker neighbors would say to speak to them of the future and at last the proper moment came it was a stormy november evening wind and rain whirled and drove among the trees outside but the sittingroom of the old farmhouse was bright and warm david and jonathan at the table with their arms over each others backs and their brown locks mixed together read from the same book their father sat in the ancient rockingchair before the fire with his feet upon a stool the housekeeper and hired man had gone to bed and all was still in the house john waited until he heard the volume closed and then spoke boys he said let me have a bit of talk with you i dont seem to get over my ailments rightly never will maybe a man must think of things while theres time and say them when they have to be said i dont know as theres any particular hurry in my case only we never can tell from one day to another when i die every thing will belong to you two share and share alike either to buy another farm with the money out or divide this i wont tie you up in any way but two of you will need two farms for two families for you wont have to wait twelve years like your mother and me we dont want another farm father said david and jonathan together i know you dont think so now a wife seemed far enough off from me when i was your age youve always been satisfied to be with each other but that cant last it was partly your mothers notion i remember her saying that our burden had passed into you i never quite understood what she meant but i suppose it must rather be the opposite of what we had to bear the twins listened with breathless attention while their father suddenly stirred by the past told them the story of his long betrothal and now he exclaimed in conclusion it may be putting wild ideas into your two heads but i must say it that was where i did wrong wrong to her and to me in waiting i had no right to spoil the best of our lives i ought to have gone boldly in broad day to her fathers house taken her by the hand and led her forth to be my wife boys if either of you comes to love a woman truly and she to love you and there is no reason why god i dont say man should put you asunder do as i ought to have done not as i did and maybe this advice is the best legacy i can leave you but father said david speaking for both we have never thought of marrying likely enough their father answered we hardly ever think of what surely comes but to me looking back its plain and this is the reason why i want you to make me a promise and as solemn as if i was on my deathbed maybe i shall be soon tears gathered in the eyes of the twins what is it father they both said nothing at all to any other two boys but i dont know how youll take it what if i was to ask you to live apart for a while oh father both cried they leaned together cheek pressing cheek and hand clasping hand growing white and trembling john vincent gazing into the fire did not see their faces or his purpose might have been shaken i dont say now he went on after a while when well when im dead and i only mean a beginning to help you toward what has to be only a month i dont want to seem hard to you but thats little in all conscience give me your word say for mothers sake there was a long pause then david and jonathan said in low faltering voices for mothers sake i promise remember that you were only boys to her she might have made all this seem easier for women have reasons for things no man can answer mind within a year after im gone he rose and tottered out of the room the twins looked at each other david said must we and jonathan how can we then they both thought it may be a long while yet here was a present comfort and each seemed to hold it firmly in holding the hand of the other as they fell asleep side by side the trial was nearer than they imagined their father died before the winter was over the farm and other property was theirs and they might have allowed life to solve its mysteries as it rolled onwards but for their promise to the dead this must be fulfilled and then one thing was certain they would never again separate the sooner the better said david it shall be the visit to our uncle and cousins in indiana you will come with me as far as harrisburg it may be easier to part there than here and our new neighbors the bradleys will want your help for a day or two after getting home it is less than death jonathan answered and why should it seem to be more we must think of father and mother and all those twelve years now i know what the burden was and we have never really borne any part of it father must have been right in forcing us to promise every day the discussion was resumed and always with the same termination familiarity with the inevitable step gave them increase of courage yet when the moment had come and gone when speeding on opposite trains the hills and valleys multiplied between them with terrible velocity a pang like death cut to the heart of each and the divided life became a chill oppressive dream during the separation no letters passed between them when the neighbors asked jonathan for news of his brother he always replied he is well and avoided further speech with such evidence of pain that they spared him an hour before the month drew to an end he walked forth alone taking the road to the nearest railway station a stranger who passed him at the entrance of a thick wood three miles from home was thunderstruck on meeting the same person shortly after entering the wood from the other side but the farmers in the near fields saw two figures issuing from the shade hand in hand each knew the others month before they slept and the last thing jonathan said with his head on davids shoulder was you must know our neighbors the bradleys and especially ruth in the morning as they dressed taking each others garments at random as of old jonathan again said i have never seen a girl that i like so well as ruth bradley do you remember what father said about loving and marrying it comes into my mind whenever i see ruth but she has no sister but we need not both marry david replied that might part us and this will not it is for always now for always david two or three days later jonathan said as he started on an errand to the village i shall stop at the bradleys this evening so you must walk across and meet me there when david approached the house a slender girlish figure with her back towards him was stooping over a bush of great crimson roses cautiously clipping a blossom here and there at the click of the gatelatch she started and turned towards him her light gingham bonnet falling back disclosed a long oval face fair and delicate sweet brown eyes and brown hair laid smoothly over the temples a soft flush rose suddenly to her cheeks and he felt that his own were burning oh jonathan she exclaimed transferring the roses to her left hand and extending her right as she came forward he was too accustomed to the name to recognize her mistake at once and the word ruth came naturally to his lips i should know your brother david has come she then said even if i had not heard so you look so bright how glad i am is he not here david asked no but there he is now surely she turned towards the lane where jonathan was dismounting why it is yourself over again jonathan as they approached a glance passed between the twins and a secret transfer of the ridingwhip to david set their identity right with ruth whose manner toward the latter innocently became shy with all its friendliness while her frank familiar speech was given to jonathan as was fitting but david also took the latter to himself and when they left ruth had apparently forgotten that there was any difference in the length of their acquaintance on their way homewards david said father was right we must marry like others and ruth is the wife for us i mean for you jonathan yes we must learn to say mine and yours after all when we speak of her even she cannot separate us it seems jonathan answered we must give her some sign and that will also be a sign for others it will seem strange to divide ourselves we can never learn it properly rather let us not think of marriage we cannot help thinking of it she stands in mothers place now as we in fathers then both became silent and thoughtful they felt that something threatened to disturb what seemed to be the only possible life for them yet were unable to distinguish its features and therefore powerless to resist it the same instinct which had been born of their wonderful spiritual likeness told them that ruth bradley already loved jonathan the duty was established and they must conform their lives to it there was however this slight difference between their natures that david was generally the first to utter the thought which came to the minds of both so when he said we shall learn what to do when the need comes it was a postponement of all foreboding they drifted contentedly towards the coming change the days went by and their visits to ruth bradley were continued sometimes jonathan went alone but they were usually together and the tie which united the three became dearer and sweeter as it was more closely drawn ruth learned to distinguish between the two when they were before her at least she said so and they were willing to believe it but she was hardly aware how nearly alike was the happy warmth in her bosom produced by either pair of dark gray eyes and the soft halfsmile which played around either mouth to them she seemed to be drawn within the mystic circle which separated them from others she alone and they no longer imagined a life in which she should not share then the inevitable step was taken jonathan declared his love and was answered alas he almost forgot david that late summer evening as they sat in the moonlight and over and over again assured each other how dear they had grown he felt the trouble in davids heart when they met ruth is ours and i bring her kiss to you he said pressing his lips to davids but the arms flung around him trembled and david whispered now the change begins oh this cannot be our burden jonathan cried with all the rapture still warm in his heart if it is it will be light or heavy or none at all as we shall bear it david answered with a smile of infinite tenderness for several days he allowed jonathan to visit the bradley farm alone saying that it must be so on ruths account her love he declared must give her the fine instinct which only their mother had ever possessed and he must allow it time to be confirmed jonathan however insisted that ruth already possessed it that she was beginning to wonder at his absence and to fear that she would not be entirely welcome to the home which must always be equally his david yielded at once you must go alone said jonathan to satisfy yourself that she knows us at last ruth came forth from the house as he drew near her face beamed she laid her hands upon his shoulders and kissed him now you cannot doubt me ruth he said gently doubt you jonathan she exclaimed with a fond reproach in her eyes but you look troubled is any thing the matter i was thinking of my brother said david in a low tone tell me what it is she said drawing him into the little arbor of woodbine near the gate they took seats side by side on the rustic bench he thinks i may come between you is it not that she asked only one thing was clear to davids mind that she would surely speak more frankly and freely of him to the supposed jonathan than to his real self this once he would permit the illusion not more than must be he answered he knew all from the very beginning but we have been like one person in two bodies and any change seems to divide us i feel as you do said ruth i would never consent to be your wife if i could really divide you i love you both too well for that do you love me he asked entirely forgetting his representative part again the reproachful look which faded away as she met his eyes she fell upon his breast and gave him kisses which were answered with equal tenderness suddenly he covered his face with his hands and burst into a passion of tears jonathan oh jonathan she cried weeping with alarm and sympathetic pain it was long before he could speak but at last turning away his head he faltered i am david there was a long silence when he looked up she was sitting with her hands rigidly clasped in her lap her face was very pale there it is ruth he said we are one heart and one soul could he love and not i you cannot decide between us for one is the other if i had known you first jonathan would be now in my place what follows then no marriage she whispered no he answered we brothers must learn to be two men instead of one you will partly take my place with jonathan i must live with half my life unless i can find somewhere in the world your other half i cannot part you david something stronger than you or me parts us ruth if it were death we should bow to gods will well it can no more be got away from than death or judgment say no more the pattern of all this was drawn long before we were born and we cannot do any thing but work it out he rose and stood before her remember this ruth he said it is no blame in us to love each other jonathan will see the truth in my face when we meet and i speak for him also you will not see me again until your weddingday and then no more afterwards but yes once in some faroff time when you shall know me to be david and still give me the kiss you gave today ah after death she thought i have parted them forever she was about to rise but fell upon the seat again fainting at the same moment jonathan appeared at davids side no word was said they bore her forth and supported her between them until the fresh breeze had restored her to consciousness her first glance rested on the brothers hands clasping then looking from one to the other she saw that the cheeks of both were wet now leave me she said but come tomorrow jonathan even then she turned from one to the other with a painful touching uncertainty and stretched out both hands to them in farewell how that poor twin heart struggled with itself is only known to god all human voices and as they believed also the divine voice commanded the division of their interwoven life submission would have seemed easier could they have taken up equal and similar burdens but david was unable to deny that his pack was overweighted for the first time their thoughts began to diverge at last david said for mothers sake jonathan as we promised she always called you her child and for ruths sake and fathers last advice they all tell me what i must do it was like the struggle between will and desire in the same nature and none the less fierce or prolonged because the softer quality foresaw its ultimate surrender long after he felt the step to be inevitable jonathan sought to postpone it but he was borne by all combined influences nearer and nearer to the time and now the weddingday came david was to leave home the same evening after the family dinner under his fathers roof in the morning he said to jonathan i shall not write until i feel that i have become other than now but i shall always be here in you as you will be in me everywhere whenever you want me i shall know it and i think i shall know when to return the hearts of all the people went out towards them as they stood together in the little village church both were calm but very pale and abstracted in their expression yet their marvellous likeness was still unchanged ruths eyes were cast down so they could not be seen she trembled visibly and her voice was scarcely audible when she spoke the vow it was only known in the neighborhood that david was going to make another journey the truth could hardly have been guessed by persons whose ideas follow the narrow round of their own experiences had it been there would probably have been more condemnation than sympathy but in a vague way the presence of some deeper element was felt the falling of a shadow although the outstretched wing was unseen far above them and above the shadow watched the infinite pity which was not denied to three hearts that day it was a long time more than a year and ruth was lulling her first child on her bosom before a letter came from david he had wandered westwards purchased some lands on the outer line of settlement and appeared to be leading a wild and lonely life i know now he wrote just how much there is to bear and how to bear it strange men come between us but you are not far off when i am alone on these plains there is a place where i can always meet you and i know that you have found it under the big ashtree by the barn i think i am nearly always there about sundown and on moonshiny nights because we are then nearest together and i never sleep without leaving you half my blanket when i first begin to wake i always feel your breath so we are never really parted for long i do not know that i can change much it is not easy it is like making up your mind to have different colored eyes and hair and i can only get sunburnt and wear a full beard but we are hardly as unhappy as we feared to be mother came the other night in a dream and took us on her knees oh come to me jonathan but for one day no you will not find me i am going across the plains and jonathan and ruth they loved each other tenderly no external trouble visited them their home was peaceful and pure and yet every room and stairway and chair was haunted by a sorrowful ghost as a neighbor said after visiting them there seemed to be something lost ruth saw how constantly and how unconsciously jonathan turned to see his own every feeling reflected in the missing eyes how his hand sought another even while its fellow pressed hers how halfspoken words day and night died upon his lips because they could not reach the twinear she knew not how it came but her own nature took upon itself the same habit she felt that she received a less measure of love than she gave not from jonathan in whose whole warm transparent heart no other woman had ever looked but something of her own passed beyond him and never returned to both their life was like one of those conjurers cups seemingly filled with red wine which is held from the lips by the false crystal hollow neither spoke of this neither dared to speak the years dragged out their slow length with rare and brief messages from david three children were in the house and still peace and plenty laid their signs upon its lintels but at last ruth who had been growing thinner and paler ever since the birth of her first boy became seriously ill consumption was hers by inheritance and it now manifested itself in a form which too surely foretold the result after the physician had gone leaving his fatal verdict behind him she called to jonathan who bewildered by his grief sank down on his knees at her bedside and sobbed upon her breast dont grieve she said this is my share of the burden if i have taken too much from you and david now comes the atonement many things have grown clear to me david was right when he said that there was no blame but my time is even less than the doctor thinks where is david can you not bid him come i can only call him with my heart he answered and will he hear me now after nearly seven years call then she eagerly cried call with all the strength of your love for him and for me and i believe he will hear you the sun was just setting jonathan went to the great ashtree behind the barn fell upon his knees and covered his face and the sense of an exceeding bitter cry filled his heart all the suppressed and baffled longing the want the hunger the unremitting pain of years came upon him and were crowded into the single prayer come david or i die before the twilight faded while he was still kneeling an arm came upon his shoulder and the faint touch of another cheek upon his own it was hardly for the space of a thought but he knew the sign david will come he said to ruth from that day all was changed the cloud of coming death which hung over the house was transmuted into fleecy gold all the lost life came back to jonathans face all the unrestful sweetness of ruths brightened into a serene beatitude months had passed since david had been heard from they knew not how to reach him without many delays yet neither dreamed of doubting his coming two weeks passed three and there was neither word nor sign jonathan and ruth thought he is near and one day a singular unrest fell upon the former ruth saw it but said nothing until night came when she sent jonathan from her bedside with the words go and meet him an hour afterwards she heard double steps on the stone walk in front of the house they came slowly to the door it opened she heard them along the hall and ascending the stairs then the chamberlamp showed her the two faces bright with a single unutterable joy one brother paused at the foot of the bed the other drew near and bent over her she clasped her thin hands around his neck kissed him fondly and cried dear dear david dear ruth he said i came as soon as i could i was far away among wild mountains when i felt that jonathan was calling me i knew that i must return never to leave you more and there was still a little work to finish now we shall all live again yes said jonathan coming to her other side try to live ruth her voice came clear strong and full of authority i do live as never before i shall take all my life with me when i go to wait for one soul as i shall find it there our love unites not divides from this hour the few weeks still left to her were a season of almost superhuman peace she faded slowly and painlessly taking the equal love of the twinhearts and giving an equal tenderness and gratitude then first she saw the mysterious need which united them the fulness and joy wherewith each completed himself in the other all the imperfect past was enlightened and the end even that now so near was very good every afternoon they carried her down to a cushioned chair on the veranda where she could enjoy the quiet of the sunny landscape the presence of the brothers seated at her feet and the sports of her children on the grass thus one day while david and jonathan held her hands and waited for her to wake from a happy sleep she went before them and ere they guessed the truth she was waiting for their one soul in the undiscovered land and jonathans children now growing into manhood and girlhood also call david father the marks left by their divided lives have long since vanished from their faces the middleaged men whose hairs are turning gray still walk hand in hand still sleep upon the same pillow still have their common wardrobe as when they were boys they talk of our ruth with no sadness for they believe that death will make them one when at the same moment he summons both and we who know them to whom they have confided the touching mystery of their nature believe so too the experiences of the a c bridgeport change cars for the naugatuck railroad shouted the conductor of the new york and boston express train on the evening of may th indeed he does it every night sundays excepted for that matter but as this story refers especially to mr j edward johnson who was a passenger on that train on the aforesaid evening i make special mention of the fact mr johnson carpetbag in hand jumped upon the platform entered the office purchased a ticket for waterbury and was soon whirling in the naugatuck train towards his destination on reaching waterbury in the soft spring twilight mr johnson walked up and down in front of the station curiously scanning the faces of the assembled crowd presently he noticed a gentleman who was performing the same operation upon the faces of the alighting passengers throwing himself directly in the way of the latter the two exchanged a steady gaze is your name billings is your name johnson were simultaneous questions followed by the simultaneous exclamations ned enos then there was a crushing grasp of hands repeated after a pause in testimony of ancient friendship and mr billings returning to practical life asked is that all your baggage come i have a buggy here eunice has heard the whistle and shell be impatient to welcome you the impatience of eunice mrs billings of course was not of long duration for in five minutes thereafter she stood at the door of her husbands chocolatecolored villa receiving his friend while these three persons are comfortably seated at the teatable enjoying their waffles cold tongue and canned peaches and asking and answering questions helterskelter in the delightful confusion of reunion after long separation let us briefly inform the reader who and what they are mr enos billings then was part owner of a manufactory of metal buttons forty years old of middling height ordinarily quiet and rather shy but with a large share of latent warmth and enthusiasm in his nature his hair was brown slightly streaked with gray his eyes a soft dark hazel forehead square eyebrows straight nose of no very marked character and a mouth moderately full with a tendency to twitch a little at the corners his voice was undertoned but mellow and agreeable mrs eunice billings of nearly equal age was a good specimen of the wideawake newengland woman her face had a piquant smartness of expression which might have been refined into a sharp edge but for her natural hearty goodhumor her head was smoothly formed her face a full oval her hair and eyes blond and blue in a strong light but brown and steelgray at other times and her complexion of that ripe fairness into which a ruddier color will sometimes fade her form neither plump nor square had yet a firm elastic compactness and her slightest movement conveyed a certain impression of decision and selfreliance as for j edward johnson it is enough to say that he was a tall thin gentleman of fortyfive with an aquiline nose narrow face and military whiskers which swooped upwards and met under his nose in a glossy black mustache his complexion was dark from the bronzing of fifteen summers in new orleans he was a member of a wholesale hardware firm in that city and had now revisited his native north for the first time since his departure a year before some letters relating to invoices of metal buttons signed foster kirkup co per enos billings had accidentally revealed to him the whereabouts of the old friend of his youth with whom we now find him domiciled the first thing he did after attending to some necessary business matters in new york was to take the train for waterbury enos said he as he stretched out his hand for the third cup of tea which he had taken only for the purpose of prolonging the pleasant tablechat i wonder which of us is most changed you of course said mr billings with your brown face and big mustache your own brother wouldnt have known you if he had seen you last as i did with smooth cheeks and hair of unmerciful length why not even your voice is the same that is easily accounted for replied mr johnson but in your case enos i am puzzled to find where the difference lies your features seem to be but little changed now that i can examine them at leisure yet it is not the same face but really i never looked at you for so long a time in those days i beg pardon you used to be so so remarkably shy mr billings blushed slightly and seemed at a loss what to answer his wife however burst into a merry laugh exclaiming oh that was before the days of the a c he catching the infection laughed also in fact mr johnson laughed but without knowing why the a c said mr billings bless me eunice how long it is since we have talked of that summer i had almost forgotten that there ever was an a c enos could you ever forget abel mallory and the beer or that scene between hollins and shelldrake or here she blushed the least bit your own fit of candor and she laughed again more heartily than ever what a precious lot of fools to be sure exclaimed her husband mr johnson meanwhile though enjoying the cheerful humor of his hosts was not a little puzzled with regard to its cause what is the a c he ventured to ask mr and mrs billings looked at each other and smiled without replying really ned said the former finally the answer to your question involves the whole story then why not tell him the whole story enos remarked his wife you know ive never told it yet and its rather a hard thing to do seeing that im one of the heroes of the farce for it wasnt even genteel comedy ned said mr billings however he continued absurd as the story may seem its the only key to the change in my life and i must run the risk of being laughed at ill help you through enos said his wife encouragingly and besides my role in the farce was no better than yours let us resuscitate for tonight only the constitution of the a c upon my word a capital idea but we shall have to initiate ned mr johnson merrily agreeing he was blindfolded and conducted into another room a heavy armchair rolling on casters struck his legs in the rear and he sank into it with lamblike resignation open your mouth was the command given with mock solemnity he obeyed now shut it and his lips closed upon a cigar while at the same time the handkerchief was whisked away from his eyes he found himself in mr billings library your nose betrays your taste mr johnson said the lady and i am not hardhearted enough to deprive you of the indulgence here are matches well said he acting upon the hint if the remainder of the ceremonies are equally agreeable i should like to be a permanent member of your order by this time mr and mrs billings having between them lighted the lamp stirred up the coal in the grate closed the doors and taken possession of comfortable chairs the latter proclaimed the chapter isnt that what you call it will now be held was it in when you left home ned asked mr b yes well the a c culminated in you remember something of the society of norridgeport the last winter you were there abel mallory for instance let me think a moment said mr johnson reflectively really it seems like looking back a hundred years mallory wasnt that the sentimental young man with wispy hair a tallowy skin and big sweaty hands who used to be spouting carlyle on the reading evenings at shelldrakes yes to be sure and there was hollins with his clerical face and infidel talk and pauline ringtop who used to say the beautiful is the good i can still hear her shrill voice singing would that i were beautiful would that i were fair there was a hearty chorus of laughter at poor miss ringtops expense it harmed no one however for the tarweed was already thick over her californian grave oh i see said mr billings you still remember the absurdities of those days in fact i think you partially saw through them then but i was younger and far from being so clearheaded and i looked upon those evenings at shelldrakes as being equal at least to the symposia of plato something in mallory always repelled me i detested the sight of his thick nose with the flaring nostrils and his coarse halfformed lips of the bluish color of raw cornedbeef but i looked upon these feelings as unreasonable prejudices and strove to conquer them seeing the admiration which he received from others he was an oracle on the subject of nature having eaten nothing for two years except graham bread vegetables without salt and fruits fresh or dried he considered himself to have attained an antediluvian purity of health or that he would attain it so soon as two pimples on his left temple should have healed these pimples he looked upon as the last feeble stand made by the pernicious juices left from the meat he had formerly eaten and the coffee he had drunk his theory was that through a body so purged and purified none but true and natural impulses could find access to the soul such indeed was the theory we all held a return to nature was the near millennium the dawn of which we already beheld in the sky to be sure there was a difference in our individual views as to how this should be achieved but we were all agreed as to what the result should be i can laugh over those days now ned but they were really happy while they lasted we were the salt of the earth we were lifted above those grovelling instincts which we saw manifested in the lives of others each contributed his share of gas to inflate the painted balloon to which we all clung in the expectation that it would presently soar with us to the stars but it only went up over the outhouses dodged backwards and forwards two or three times and finally flopped down with us into a swamp and that balloon was the a c suggested mr johnson as president of this chapter i prohibit questions said eunice and enos dont send up your balloon until the proper time dont anticipate the programme or the performance will be spoiled i had almost forgotten that ned is so much in the dark her obedient husband answered you can have but a slight notion he continued turning to his friend of the extent to which this sentimental or transcendental element in the little circle at shelldrakes increased after you left norridgeport we read the dial and emerson we believed in alcott as the purple plato of modern times we took psychological works out of the library and would listen for hours to hollins while he read schelling or fichte and then go home with a misty impression of having imbibed infinite wisdom it was perhaps a natural though very eccentric rebound from the hard practical unimaginative newengland mind which surrounded us yet i look back upon it with a kind of wonder i was then as you know unformed mentally and might have been so still but for the experiences of the a c mr johnson shifted his position a little impatiently eunice looked at him with laughing eyes and shook her finger with a mock threat shelldrake continued mr billings without noticing this byplay was a man of more pretence than real cultivation as i afterwards discovered he was in good circumstances and always glad to receive us at his house as this made him virtually the chief of our tribe and the outlay for refreshments involved only the apples from his own orchard and water from his well there was an entire absence of conventionality at our meetings and this conpared with the somewhat stiff society of the village was really an attraction there was a mystic bond of union in our ideas we discussed life love religion and the future state not only with the utmost candor but with a warmth of feeling which in many of us was genuine even i and you know how painfully shy and bashful i was felt myself more at home there than in my fathers house and if i didnt talk much i had a pleasant feeling of being in harmony with those who did well twas in the early part of i think in april when we were all gathered together discussing as usual the possibility of leading a life in accordance with nature abel mallory was there and hollins and miss ringtop and faith levis with her knitting and also eunice hazleton a lady whom you have never seen but you may take my wife at her representative stick to the programme enos interrupted mrs billings eunice hazleton then i wish i could recollect some of the speeches made on that occasion abel had but one pimple on his temple there was a purple spot where the other had been and was estimating that in two or three months more he would be a true unspoiled man his complexion nevertheless was more clammy and wheylike than ever yes said he i also am an arcadian this false dual existence which i have been leading will soon be merged in the unity of nature our lives must conform to her sacred law why cant we strip off these hollow shams he made great use of that word and be our true selves pure perfect and divine miss ringtop heaved a sigh and repeated a stanza from her favorite poet ah when wrecked are my desires on the everlasting never and my heart with all its fires out forever in the cradle of creation finds the soul resuscitation shelldrake however turning to his wife said elviry how many upstairs rooms is there in that house down on the sound four besides three small ones under the roof why what made you think of that jesse said she ive got an idea while abels been talking he answered weve taken a house for the summer down the other side of bridgeport right on the water where theres good fishing and a fine view of the sound now theres room enough for all of us at least all that can make it suit to go abel you and enos and pauline and eunice might fix matters so that we could all take the place in partnership and pass the summer together living a true and beautiful life in the bosom of nature there we shall be perfectly free and untrammelled by the chains which still hang around us in norridgeport you know how often we have wanted to be set on some island in the pacific ocean where we could build up a true society right from the start now heres a chance to try the experiment for a few months anyhow eunice clapped her hands yes you did and cried out splendid arcadian ill give up my school for the summer miss ringtop gave her opinion in another quotation the rainbow hues of the ideal condense to gems and form the real abel mallory of course did not need to have the proposal repeated he was ready for any thing which promised indulgence and the indulgence of his sentimental tastes i will do the fellow the justice to say that he was not a hypocrite he firmly believed both in himself and his ideas especially the former he pushed both hands through the long wisps of his drabcolored hair and threw his head back until his wide nostrils resembled a double door to his brain oh nature he said you have found your lost children we shall obey your neglected laws we shall hearken to your divine whispers i we shall bring you back from your ignominious exile and place you on your ancestral throne let us do it was the general cry a sudden enthusiasm fired us and we grasped each others hands in the hearty impulse of the moment my own private intention to make a summer trip to the white mountains had been relinquished the moment i heard eunice give in her adhesion i may as well confess at once that i was desperately in love and afraid to speak to her by the time mrs sheldrake brought in the apples and water we were discussing the plan as a settled thing hollins had an engagement to deliver temperance lectures in ohio during the summer but decided to postpone his departure until august so that he might at least spend two months with us faith levis couldnt go at which i think we were all secretly glad some three or four others were in the same case and the company was finally arranged to consist of the shelldrakes hollins mallory eunice miss ringtop and myself we did not give much thought either to the preparations in advance or to our mode of life when settled there we were to live near to nature that was the main thing what shall we call the place asked eunice arcadia said abel mallory rolling up his large green eyes then said hollins let us constitute ourselves the arcadian club aha interrupted mr johnson i see the a c yes you can see the a c now said mrs billings but to understand it fully you should have had a share in those arcadian experiences i am all the more interested in hearing them described go on enos the proposition was adopted we called ourselves the arcadian club but in order to avoid gossip and the usual ridicule to which we were all more or less sensitive in case our plan should become generally known it was agreed that the initials only should be used besides there was an agreeable air of mystery about it we thought of delphi and eleusis and samothrace we should discover that truth which the dim eyes of worldly men and women were unable to see and the day of disclosure would be the day of triumph in one sense we were truly arcadians no suspicion of impropriety i verily believe entered any of our minds in our aspirations after what we called a truer life there was no material taint we were fools if you choose but as far as possible from being sinners besides the characters of mr and mrs shelldrake who naturally became the heads of our proposed community were sufficient to preserve us from slander or suspicion if even our designs had been publicly announced i wont bore you with an account of our preparations in fact there was very little to be done mr shelldrake succeeded in hiring the house with most of its furniture so that but a few articles had to be supplied my trunk contained more books than boots more blank paper than linen two shirts will be enough said abel you can wash one of them any day and dry it in the sun the supplies consisted mostly of flour potatoes and sugar there was a vegetablegarden in good condition mr shelldrake said which would be our principal dependence besides the clams i exclaimed unthinkingly oh yes said eunice we can have chowderparties that will be delightful clams chowder oh worse than flesh groaned abel will you reverence nature by outraging her first laws i had made a great mistake and felt very foolish eunice and i looked at each other for the first time speak for yourself only enos gently interpolated his wife it was a lovely afternoon in the beginning of june when we first approached arcadia we had taken two double teams at bridgeport and drove slowly forward to our destination followed by a cart containing our trunks and a few household articles it was a bright balmy day the wheatfields were rich and green the clover showed faint streaks of ruby mist along slopes leaning southward and the meadows were yellow with buttercups now and then we caught glimpses of the sound and far beyond it the dim long island shore every old white farmhouse with its graywalled garden its clumps of lilacs viburnums and early roses offered us a picture of pastoral simplicity and repose we passed them one by one in the happiest mood enjoying the earth around us the sky above and ourselves most of all the scenery however gradually became more rough and broken knobs of gray gneiss crowned by mournful cedars intrenched upon the arable land and the darkblue gleam of water appeared through the trees our road which had been approaching the sound now skirted the head of a deep irregular inlet beyond which extended a beautiful promontory thickly studded with cedars and with scattering groups of elm oak and maple trees towards the end of the promontory stood a house with white walls shining against the blue line of the sound there is arcadia at last exclaimed mr shelldrake a general outcry of delight greeted the announcement and indeed the loveliness of the picture surpassed our most poetic anticipations the low sun was throwing exquisite lights across the point painting the slopes of grass of golden green and giving a pearly softness to the gray rocks in the background was drawn the faroff waterline over which a few specks of sail glimmered against the sky miss ringtop who with eunice mallory and myself occupied one carriage expressed her gushing feelings in the usual manner where the turf is softest greenest doth an angel thrust me on where the landscape lies serenest in the journey of the sun dont pauline said eunice i never like to hear poetry flourished in the face of nature this landscape surpasses any poem in the world let us enjoy the best thing we have rather than the next best ah yes sighed miss ringtop tis true they sing to the ear this sings to the eye thenceforward to the house all was childish joy and jubilee all minor personal repugnances were smoothed over in the general exultation even abel mallory became agreeable and hollins sitting beside mrs shelldrake on the back seat of the foremost carriage shouted to us in boyish lightness of heart passing the head of the inlet we left the countryroad and entered through a gate in the tottering stone wall on our summer domain a track open to the field on one side led us past a clump of deciduous trees between pastures broken by cedared knolls of rock down the centre of the peninsula to the house it was quite an old framebuilding two stories high with a gambrel roof and tall chimneys two slim lombardy poplars and a broadleaved catalpa shaded the southern side and a kitchengarden divided in the centre by a double row of untrimmed currantbushes flanked it on the east for flowers there were masses of blue flags and coarse tawnyred lilies besides a huge trumpetvine which swung its pendent arms from one of the gables in front of the house a natural lawn of mingled turf and rock sloped steeply down to the water which was not more than two hundred yards distant to the west was another and broader inlet of the sound out of which our arcadian promontory rose bluff and bold crowned with a thick fringe of pines it was really a lovely spot which shelldrake had chosen so secluded while almost surrounded by the winged and moving life of the sound so simple so pastoral and homelike no one doubted the success of our experiment for that evening at least perkins brown shelldrakes boyofallwork awaited us at the door he had been sent on two or three days in advance to take charge of the house and seemed to have had enough of hermitlife for he hailed us with a wild whoop throwing his straw hat halfway up one of the poplars perkins was a boy of fifteen the child of poor parents who were satisfied to get him off their hands regardless as to what humanitarian theories might be tested upon him as the arcadian club recognized no such thing as caste he was always admitted to our meetings and understood just enough of our conversation to excite a silly ambition in his slow mind his animal nature was predominant and this led him to be deceitful at that time however we all looked upon him as a proper young arcadian and hoped that he would develop into a second abel mallory after our effects had been deposited on the stoop and the carriages had driven away we proceeded to apportion the rooms and take possession on the first floor there were three rooms two of which would serve us as dining and drawing rooms leaving the third for the shelldrakes as neither eunice and miss ringtop nor hollins and abel showed any disposition to room together i quietly gave up to them the four rooms in the second story and installed myself in one of the attic chambers here i could hear the music of the rain close above my head and through the little gable window as i lay in bed watch the colors of the morning gradually steal over the distant shores the end was we were all satisfied now for our first meal in arcadia was the next cry mrs shelldrake like a prudent housekeeper marched off to the kitchen where perkins had already kindled a fire we looked in at the door but thought it best to allow her undisputed sway in such a narrow realm eunice was unpacking some loaves of bread and paper bags of crackers and miss ringtop smiling through her ropy curls as much as to say you see i also can perform the coarser tasks of life occupied herself with plates and cups we men therefore walked out to the garden which we found in a promising condition the usual vegetables had been planted and were growing finely for the season was yet scarcely warm enough for the weeds to make much headway radishes young onions and lettuce formed our contribution to the table the shelldrakes i should explain had not yet advanced to the antediluvian point in diet nor indeed had either eunice or myself we acknowledged the fascination of tea we saw a very mitigated evil in milk and butter and we were conscious of stifled longings after the abomination of meat only mallory hollins and miss ringtop had reached that loftiest round on the ladder of progress where the material nature loosens the last fetter of the spiritual they looked down upon us and we meekly admitted their right to do so our board that evening was really tempting the absence of meat was compensated to us by the crisp and racy onions and i craved only a little salt which had been interdicted as a most pernicious substance i sat at one corner of the table beside perkins brown who took an opportunity while the others were engaged in conversation to jog my elbow gently as i turned towards him he said nothing but dropped his eyes significantly the little rascal had the lid of a blackingbox filled with salt upon his knee and was privately seasoning his onions and radishes i blushed at the thought of my hypocrisy but the onions were so much better that i couldnt help dipping into the lid with him oh said eunice we must send for some oil and vinegar this lettuce is very nice oil and vinegar exclaimed abel why yes said she innocently they are both vegetable substances abel at first looked rather foolish but quickly recovering himself said all vegetable substances are not proper for food you would not taste the poisonoak or sit under the upastree of java well abel eunice rejoined how are we to distinguish what is best for us how are we to know what vegetables to choose or what animal and mineral substances to avoid i will tell you he answered with a lofty air see here pointing to his temple where the second pimple either from the change of air or because in the excitement of the last few days he had forgotten it was actually healed my blood is at last pure the struggle between the natural and the unnatural is over and i am beyond the depraved influences of my former taste my instincts are now therefore entirely pure also what is good for man to eat that i shall have a natural desire to eat what is bad will be naturally repelled how does the cow distinguish between the wholesome and the poisonous herbs of the meadow and is man less than a cow that he cannot cultivate his instincts to an equal point let me walk through the woods and i can tell you every berry and root which god designed for food though i know not its name and have never seen it before i shall make use of my time during our sojourn here to test by my purified instinct every substance animal mineral and vegetable upon which the human race subsists and to create a catalogue of the true food of man abel was eloquent on this theme and he silenced not only eunice but the rest of us indeed as we were all half infected with the same delusions it was not easy to answer his sophistries after supper was over the prospect of cleaning the dishes and putting things in order was not so agreeable but mrs shelldrake and perkins undertook the work and we did not think it necessary to interfere with them half an hour afterwards when the full moon had risen we took our chairs upon the sloop to enjoy the calm silver night the soft seaair and our summers residence in anticipatory talk my friends said hollins and his hobby as you may remember ned was the organization of society rather than those reforms which apply directly to the individual my friends i think we are sufficiently advanced in progressive ideas to establish our little arcadian community upon what i consider the true basis not law nor custom but the uncorrupted impulses of our nature what abel said in regard to dietetic reform is true but that alone will not regenerate the race we must rise superior to those conventional ideas of duty whereby life is warped and crippled life must not be a prison where each one must come and go work eat and sleep as the jailer commands labor must not be a necessity but a spontaneous joy tis true but little labor is required of us here let us therefore have no set tasks no fixed rules but each one work rest eat sleep talk or be silent as his own nature prompts perkins sitting on the steps gave a suppressed chuckle which i think no one heard but myself i was vexed with his levity but nevertheless gave him a warning nudge with my toe in payment for the surreptitious salt thats just the notion i had when i first talked of our coming here said shelldrake here were alone and unhindered and if the plan shouldnt happen to work well i dont see why it shouldnt though no harm will be done ive had a deal of hard work in my life and ive been badgered and bullied so much by your straitlaced professors that im glad to get away from the world for a spell and talk and do rationally without being laughed at yes answered hollins and if we succeed as i feel we shall for i think i know the hearts of all of us here this may be the commencement of a new eepoch for the world we may become the turningpoint between two dispensations behind us every thing false and unnatural before us every thing true beautiful and good ah sighed miss ringtop it reminds me of gamaliel j gawthrops beautiful lines unrobed man is lying hoary in the distance gray and dead there no wreaths of godless glory to his mistlike tresses wed and the footfall of the ages reigns supreme with noiseless tread i am willing to try the experiment said i on being appealed to by hollins but dont you think we had better observe some kind of order even in yielding every thing to impulse shouldnt there be at least a platform as the politicians call it an agreement by which we shall all be bound and which we can afterwards exhibit as the basis of our success he meditated a few moments and then answered i think not it resembles too much the thing we are trying to overthrow can you bind a mans belief by making him sign certain articles of faith no his thought will be free in spite of it and i would have action life as free as thought our platform to adopt your image has but one plank truth let each only be true to himself be himself act himself or herself with the uttermost candor we can all agree upon that the agreement was accordingly made and certainly no happier or more hopeful human beings went to bed in all new england that night i arose with the sun went into the garden and commenced weeding intending to do my quota of work before breakfast and then devote the day to reading and conversation i was presently joined by shelldrake and mallory and between us we finished the onions and radishes stuck the peas and cleaned the alleys perkins after milking the cow and turning her out to pasture assisted mrs shelldrake in the kitchen at breakfast we were joined by hollins who made no excuse for his easy morning habits nor was one expected i may as well tell you now though that his natural instincts never led him to work after a week when a second crop of weeds was coming on mallory fell off also and thenceforth shelldrake and myself had the entire charge of the garden perkins did the rougher work and was always on hand when he was wanted very soon however i noticed that he was in the habit of disappearing for two or three hours in the afternoon our meals preserved the same spartan simplicity eunice however carried her point in regard to the salad for abel after tasting and finding it very palatable decided that oil and vinegar might be classed in the catalogue of true food indeed his long abstinence from piquant flavors gave him such an appetite for it that our supply of lettuce was soon exhausted an embarrassing accident also favored us with the use of salt perkins happening to move his knee at the moment i was dipping an onion into the blackingbox lid our supply was knocked upon the floor he picked it up and we both hoped the accident might pass unnoticed but abel stretching his long neck across the corner of the table caught a glimpse of what was going on whats that he asked oh its its only said i seeking for a synonyme only chloride of sodium chloride of sodium what do you do with it eat it with onions said i boldly its a chemical substance but i believe it is found in some plants eunice who knew something of chemistry she taught a class though you wouldnt think it grew red with suppressed fun but the others were as ignorant as abel mallory himself let me taste it said he stretching out an onion i handed him the boxlid which still contained a portion of its contents he dipped the onion bit off a piece and chewed it gravely why said he turning to me its very much like salt perkins burst into a spluttering yell which discharged an oniontop he had just put between his teeth across the table eunice and i gave way at the same moment and the others catching the joke joined us but while we were laughing abel was finishing his onion and the result was that salt was added to the true food and thereafter appeared regularly on the table the forenoons we usually spent in reading and writing each in his or her chamber oh the journals ned but you shall not see mine after a midday meal i cannot call it dinner we sat upon the stoop listening while one of us read aloud or strolled down the shores on either side or when the sun was not too warm got into a boat and rowed or floated lazily around the promontory one afternoon as i was sauntering off past the garden towards the eastern inlet i noticed perkins slipping along behind the cedar knobs towards the little woodland at the end of our domain curious to find out the cause of his mysterious disappearances i followed cautiously from the edge of the wood i saw him enter a little gap between the rocks which led down to the water presently a thread of blue smoke stole up quietly creeping along i got upon the nearer bluff and looked down there was a sort of hearth built up at the base of the rock with a brisk little fire burning upon it but perkins had disappeared i stretched myself out upon the moss in the shade and waited in about half an hour up came perkins with a large fish in one hand and a lump of clay in the other i now understood the mystery he carefully imbedded the fish in a thin layer of clay placed it on the coals and then went down to the shore to wash his hands on his return he found me watching the fire ho ho mr enos said he youve found me out but you wont say nothin gosh you like it as well i do look ee there breaking open the clay from which arose a steam of rich distilled perfumes and i say ive got the boxlid with that ere stuff in it ho ho and the scamp roared again out of a hole in the rock he brought salt and the end of a loaf and between us we finished the fish before long i got into the habit of disappearing in the afternoon now and then we took walks alone or collectively to the nearest village or even to bridgeport for the papers or a late book the few purchases we required were made at such times and sent down in a cart or if not too heavy carried by perkins in a basket i noticed that abel whenever we had occasion to visit a grocery would go sniffing around alternately attracted or repelled by the various articles now turning away with a shudder from a ham now inhaling with a fearful delight and uncertainty the odor of smoked herrings i think herrings must feed on seaweed said he there is such a vegetable attraction about them after his violent vegetarian harangues however he hesitated about adding them to his catalogue but one day as we were passing through the village he was reminded by the sign of warter crackers in the window of an obscure grocery that he required a supply of these articles and we therefore entered there was a splendid rhode island cheese on the counter from which the shopmistress was just cutting a slice for a customer abel leaned over it inhaling the rich pungent fragrance enos said he to me between his sniffs this impresses me like flowers like marigolds it must be really yes the vegetable element is predominant my instinct towards it is so strong that i cannot be mistaken may i taste it maam the woman sliced off a thin corner and presented it to him on the knife delicious he exclaimed i am right this is the true food give me two pounds and the crackers maam i turned away quite as much disgusted as amused with this charlatanism and yet i verily believe the fellow was sincere selfdeluded only i had by this time lost my faith in him though not in the great arcadian principles on reaching home after an hours walk i found our household in unusual commotion abel was writhing in intense pain he had eaten the whole two pounds of cheese on his way home his stomach so weakened by years of unhealthy abstinence from true nourishment was now terribly tortured by this sudden stimulus mrs shelldrake fortunately had some mustard among her stores and could therefore administer a timely emetic his life was saved but he was very ill for two or three days hollins did not fail to take advantage of this circumstance to overthrow the authority which abel had gradually acquired on the subject of food he was so arrogant in his nature that he could not tolerate the same quality in another even where their views coincided by this time several weeks had passed away it was the beginning of july and the long summer heats had come i was driven out of my attic during the middle hours of the day and the others found it pleasanter on the doubly shaded stoop than in their chambers we were thus thrown more together than usual a circumstance which made our life more monotonous to the others as i could see but to myself who could at last talk to eunice and who was happy at the very sight of her this heated term seemed borrowed from elysium i read aloud and the sound of my own voice gave me confidence many passages suggested discussions in which i took a part and you may judge ned how fast i got on from the fact that i ventured to tell eunice of my fishbakes with perkins and invite her to join them after that she also often disappeared from sight for an hour or two in the afternoon oh mr johnson interrupted mrs billings it wasnt for the fish of course not said her husband it was for my sake no you need not think it was for you enos she added perceiving the feminine dilemma into which she had been led all this is not necessary to the story stop he answered the a c has been revived for this night only do you remember our platform or rather noplatform i must follow my impulses and say whatever comes uppermost right enos said mr johnson i as temporary arcadian take the same ground my instinct tells me that you mrs billings must permit the confession she submitted with a good grace and her husband continued i said that our lazy life during the hot weather had become a little monotonous the arcadian plan had worked tolerably well on the whole for there was very little for any one to do mrs shelldrake and perkins brown excepted our conversation however lacked spirit and variety we were perhaps unconsciously a little tired of hearing and assenting to the same sentiments but one evening about this time hollins struck upon a variation the consequences of which he little foresaw we had been reading one of bulwers works the weather was too hot for psychology and came upon this paragraph or something like it ah behind the veil we see the summer smile of the earth enamelled meadow and limpid stream but what hides she in her sunless heart caverns of serpents or grottoes of priceless gems youth whose soul sits on thy countenance thyself wearing no mask strive not to lift the masks of others be content with what thou seest and wait until time and experience shall teach thee to find jealousy behind the sweet smile and hatred under the honeyed word this seemed to us a dark and bitter reflection but one or another of us recalled some illustration of human hypocrisy and the evidences by the simple fact of repetition gradually led to a division of opinion hollins shelldrake and miss ringtop on the dark side and the rest of us on the bright the last however contented herself with quoting from her favorite poet gamaliel j gawthrop i look beyond thy brows concealment i see thy spirits dark revealment thy inner self betrayed i see thy coward craven shivering me we think we know one another exclaimed hollins but do we we see the faults of others their weaknesses their disagreeable qualities and we keep silent how much we should gain were candor as universal as concealment then each one seeing himself as others see him would truly know himself how much misunderstanding might be avoided how much hidden shame be removed hopeless because unspoken love made glad honest admiration cheer its object uttered sympathy mitigate misfortune in short how much brighter and happier the world would become if each one expressed everywhere and at all times his true and entire feeling why even evil would lose half its power there seemed to be so much practical wisdom in these views that we were all dazzled and halfconvinced at the start so when hollins turning towards me as he continued exclaimed come why should not this candor be adopted in our arcadia will any one will you enos commence at once by telling me now to my face my principal faults i answered after a moments reflection you have a great deal of intellectual arrogance and you are physically very indolent he did not flinch from the selfinvited test though he looked a little surprised well put said he though i do not say that you are entirely correct now what are my merits you are clearsighted i answered an earnest seeker after truth and courageous in the avowal of your thoughts this restored the balance and we soon began to confess our own private faults and weaknesses though the confessions did not go very deep no one betraying anything we did not all know already yet they were sufficient to strength hollins in his new idea and it was unanimously resolved that candor should thenceforth be the main charm of our arcadian life it was the very thing i wanted in order to make a certain communication to eunice but i should probably never have reached the point had not the same candor been exercised towards me from a quarter where i least expected it the next day abel who had resumed his researches after the true food came home to supper with a healthier color than i had before seen on his face do you know said he looking shyly at hollins that i begin to think beer must be a natural beverage there was an auction in the village today as i passed through and i stopped at a cakestand to get a glass of water as it was very hot there was no water only beer so i thought i would try a glass simply as an experiment really the flavor was very agreeable and it occurred to me on the way home that all the elements contained in beer are vegetable besides fermentation is a natural process i think the question has never been properly tested before but the alcohol exclaimed hollins i could not distinguish any either by taste or smell i know that chemical analysis is said to show it but may not the alcohol be created somehow during the analysis abel said hollins in a fresh burst of candor you will never be a reformer until you possess some of the commonest elements of knowledge the rest of us were much diverted it was a pleasant relief to our monotonous amiability abel however had a stubborn streak in his character the next day he sent perkins brown to bridgeport for a dozen bottles of beer perkins either intentionally or by mistake i always suspected the former brought pintbottles of scotch ale which he placed in the coolest part of the cellar the evening happened to be exceedingly hot and sultry and as we were all fanning ourselves and talking languidly abel bethought him of his beer in his thirst he drank the contents of the first bottle almost at a single draught the effect of beer said he depends i think on the commixture of the nourishing principle of the grain with the cooling properties of the water perhaps hereafter a liquid food of the same character may be invented which shall save us from mastication and all the diseases of the teeth hollins and shelldrake at his invitation divided a bottle between them and he took a second the potent beverage was not long in acting on a brain so unaccustomed to its influence he grew unusually talkative and sentimental in a few minutes oh sing somebody he sighed in a hoarse rapture the night was made for song miss ringtop nothing loath immediately commenced when stars are in the quiet skies but scarcely had she finished the first verse before abel interrupted her candors the order of the day isnt it he asked yes yes two or three answered well then said he candidly pauline youve got the darndest squeaky voice miss ringtop gave a faint little scream of horror oh never mind he continued we act according to impulse dont we and ive the impulse to swear and its right let nature have her way listen damn damn damn damn i never knew it was so easy why theres a pleasure in it try it pauline try it on me ohooh was all miss ringtop could utter abel abel exclaimed hollins the beer has got into your head no it isnt beer its candor said abel its your own proposal hollins suppose its evil to swear isnt it better i should express it and be done with it than keep it bottled up to ferment in my mind oh youre a precious consistent old humbug you are and therewith he jumped off the stoop and went dancing awkwardly down towards the water singing in a most unmelodious voice tis home whereer the heart is oh he may fall into the water exclaimed eunice in alarm hes not fool enough to do that said shelldrake his head is a little light thats all the air will cool him down presently but she arose and followed him not satisfied with this assurance miss ringtop sat rigidly still she would have received with composure the news of his drowning as eunices white dress disappeared among the cedars crowning the shore i sprang up and ran after her i knew that abel was not intoxicated but simply excited and i had no fear on his account i obeyed an involuntary impulse on approaching the water i heard their voices hers in friendly persuasion his in sentimental entreaty then the sound of oars in the rowlocks looking out from the last clump of cedars i saw them seated in the boat eunice at the stern while abel facing her just dipped an oar now and then to keep from drifting with the tide she had found him already in the boat which was loosely chained to a stone stepping on one of the forward thwarts in her eagerness to persuade him to return he sprang past her jerked away the chain and pushed off before she could escape she would have fallen but he caught her and placed her in the stern and then seated himself at the oars she must have been somewhat alarmed but there was only indignation in her voice all this had transpired before my arrival and the first words i heard bound me to the spot and kept me silent abel what does this mean she asked it means fate destiny he exclaimed rather wildly ah eunice ask the night and the moon ask the impulse which told you to follow me let us be candid like the old arcadians we imitate eunice we know that we love each other why should we conceal it any longer the angel of love comes down from the stars on his azure wings and whispers to our hearts let us confess to each other the female heart should not be timid in this pure and beautiful atmosphere of love which we breathe come eunice we are alone let your heart speak to me ned if youve ever been in love well talk of that after a while you will easily understand what tortures i endured in thus hearing him speak that he should love eunice it was a profanation to her an outrage to me yet the assurance with which he spoke could she love this conceited ridiculous repulsive fellow after all i almost gasped for breath as i clinched the prickly boughs of the cedars in my hands and set my teeth waiting to hear her answer i will not hear such language take me back to the shore she said in very short decided tones oh eunice he groaned and now i think he was perfectly sober dont you love me indeed i love you from my heart i do yes i love you tell me how you feel towards me abel said she earnestly i feel towards you only as a friend and if you wish me to retain a friendly interest in you you must never again talk in this manner i do not love you and i never shall let me go back to the house his head dropped upon his breast but he rowed back to the shore drew the bow upon the rocks and assisted her to land then sitting down he groaned forth oh eunice you have broken my heart and putting his big hands to his face began to cry she turned placed one hand on his shoulder and said in a calm but kind tone i am very sorry abel but i cannot help it i slipped aside that she might not see me and we returned by separate paths i slept very little that night the conviction which i chased away from my mind as often as it returned that our arcadian experiment was taking a ridiculous and at the same time impracticable development became clearer and stronger i felt sure that our little community could not hold together much longer without an explosion i had a presentiment that eunice shared my impressions my feelings towards her had reached that crisis where a declaration was imperative but how to make it it was a terrible struggle between my shyness and my affection there was another circumstance in connection with this subject which troubled me not a little miss ringtop evidently sought my company and made me as much as possible the recipient of her sentimental outpourings i was not bold enough to repel her indeed i had none of that tact which is so useful in such emergencies and she seemed to misinterpret my submission not only was her conversation pointedly directed to me but she looked at me when singing especially thou thou reignst in this bosom in a way that made me feel very uncomfortable what if eunice should suspect an attachment towards her on my part what if oh horror i had unconsciously said or done something to impress miss ringtop herself with the same conviction i shuddered as the thought crossed my mind one thing was very certain this suspense was not to be endured much longer we had an unusually silent breakfast the next morning abel scarcely spoke which the others attributed to a natural feeling of shame after his display of the previous evening hollins and shelldrake discussed temperance with a special view to his edification and miss ringtop favored us with several quotations about the maddening bowl but he paid no attention to them eunice was pale and thoughtful i had no doubt in my mind that she was already contemplating a removal from arcadia perkins whose perceptive faculties were by no means dull whispered to me shant i bring up some porgies for supper but i shook my head i was busy with other thoughts and did not join him in the wood that day the forenoon was overcast with frequent showers each one occupied his or her room until dinnertime when we met again with something of the old geniality there was an evident effort to restore our former flow of good feeling abels experience with the beer was freely discussed he insisted strongly that he had not been laboring under its effects and proposed a mutual test he shelldrake and hollins were to drink it in equal measures and compare observations as to their physical sensations the others agreed quite willingly i thought but i refused i had determined to make a desperate attempt at candor and abels fate was fresh before my eyes my nervous agitation increased during the day and after sunset fearing lest i should betray my excitement in some way i walked down to the end of the promontory and took a seat on the rocks the sky had cleared and the air was deliciously cool and sweet the sound was spread out before me like a sea for the long island shore was veiled in a silvery mist my mind was soothed and calmed by the influences of the scene until the moon arose moonlight you know disturbs at least when one is in love ah ned i see you understand it i felt blissfully miserable ready to cry with joy at the knowledge that i loved and with fear and vexation at my cowardice at the same time suddenly i heard a rustling beside me every nerve in my body tingled and i turned my head with a beating and expectant heart pshaw it was miss ringtop who spread her blue dress on the rock beside me and shook back her long curls and sighed as she gazed at the silver path of the moon on the water oh how delicious she cried how it seems to set the spirit free and we wander off on the wings of fancy to other spheres yes said i it is very beautiful but sad when one is alone i was thinking of eunice how inadequate she continued is language to express the emotions which such a scene calls up in the bosom poetry alone is the voice of the spiritual world and we who are not poets must borrow the language of the gifted sons of song oh enos i wish you were a poet but you feel poetry i know you do i have seen it in your eyes when i quoted the burning lines of adeliza kelley or the soulbreathings of gamaliel j gawthrop in him particularly i find the voice of my own nature do you know his nightwhispers how it embodies the feelings of such a scene as this stardrooping bowers bending down the spaces and moonlit glories sweep starfooted on and pale sweet rivers in their shining races are ever gliding through the moonlit places with silver ripples on their tranced faces and forests clasp their dusky hands with low and sullen moan ah she continued as i made no reply this is an hour for the soul to unveil its most secret chambers do you not think enos that love rises superior to all conventionalities that those whose souls are in unison should be allowed to reveal themselves to each other regardless of the worlds opinions yes said i earnestly enos do you understand me she asked in a tender voice almost a whisper yes said i with a blushing confidence of my own passion then she whispered our hearts are wholly in unison i know you are true enos i know your noble nature and i will never doubt you this is indeed happiness and therewith she laid her head on my shoulder and sighed life remits his tortures cruel love illumes his fairest fuel when the hearts that once were dual meet as one in sweet renewal miss ringtop i cried starting away from her in alarm you dont mean that that i could not finish the sentence yes enos dear enos henceforth we belong to each other the painful embarrassment i felt as her true meaning shot through my mind surpassed anything i had imagined or experienced in anticipation when planning how i should declare myself to eunice miss ringtop was at least ten years older than i far from handsome but you remember her face and so affectedly sentimental that i sentimental as i was then was sick of hearing her talk her hallucination was so monstrous and gave me such a shock of desperate alarm that i spoke on the impulse of the moment with great energy without regarding how her feelings might be wounded you mistake i exclaimed i didnt mean that i didnt understand you dont talk to me that way dont look at me in that way miss ringtop we were never meant for each other i wasntyoure so much older i mean different it cant be no it can never be let us go back to the house the night is cold i rose hastily to my feet she murmured something what i did not stay to hear but plunging through the cedars was hurrying with all speed to the house when halfway up the lawn beside one of the rocky knobs i met eunice who was apparently on her way to join us in my excited mood after the ordeal through which i had passed everything seemed easy my usual timidity was blown to the four winds i went directly to her took her hand and said eunice the others are driving me mad with their candor will you let me be candid too i think you are always candid enos she answered even then if i had hesitated i should have been lost but i went on without pausing eunice i love you i have loved you since we first met i came here that i might be near you but i must leave you forever and tonight unless you can trust your life in my keeping god help me since we have been together i have lost my faith in almost everything but you pardon me if i am impetuous different from what i have seemed i have struggled so hard to speak i have been a coward eunice because of my love but now i have spoken from my heart of hearts look at me i can bear it now read the truth in my eyes before you answer i felt her hand tremble while i spoke as she turned towards me her face which had been averted the moon shone full upon it and i saw that tears were upon her cheeks what was said whether anything was said i cannot tell i felt the blessed fact and that was enough that was the dawning of the true arcadia mrs billings who had been silent during this recital took her husbands hand and smiled mr johnson felt a dull pang about the region of his heart if he had a secret however i do not feel justified in betraying it it was late mr billings continued before we returned to the house i had a special dread of again encountering miss ringtop but she was wandering up and down the bluff under the pines singing the dream is past there was a sound of loud voices as we approached the stoop hollins shelldrake and his wife and abel mallory were sitting together near the door perkins brown as usual was crouched on the lowest step with one leg over the other and rubbing the top of his boot with a vigor which betrayed to me some secret mirth he looked up at me from under his straw hat with the grin of a malicious puck glanced towards the group and made a curious gesture with his thumb there were several empty pintbottles on the stoop now are you sure you can bear the test we heard hollins ask as we approached bear it why to be sure replied shelldrake if i couldnt bear it or if you couldnt your theorys done for try i can stand it as long as you can well then said hollins i think you are a very ordinary man i derive no intellectual benefit from my intercourse with you but your house is convenient to me im under no obligations for your hospitality however because my company is an advantage to you indeed if i were treated according to my deserts you couldnt do enough for me mrs shelldrake was up in arms indeed she exclaimed i think you get as good as you deserve and more too elvira said he with a benevolent condescension i have no doubt you think so for your mind belongs to the lowest and most material sphere you have your place in nature and you fill it but it is not for you to judge of intelligences which move only on the upper planes hollins said shelldrake elvirys a good wife and a sensible woman and i wont allow you to turn up your nose at her i am not surprised he answered that you should fail to stand the test i didnt expect it let me try it on you cried shelldrake you now have some intellect i dont deny that but not so much by a long shot as you think you have besides that youre awfully selfish in your opinions you wont admit that anybody can be right who differs from you youve sponged on me for a long time but i suppose ive learned something from you so well call it even i think however that what you call acting according to impulse is simply an excuse to cover your own laziness gosh thats it interrupted perkins jumping up then recollecting himself he sank down on the steps again and shook with a suppressed ho ho ho hollins however drew himself up with an exasperated air shelldrake said he i pity you i always knew your ignorance but i thought you honest in your human character i never suspected you of envy and malice however the true reformer must expect to be misunderstood and misrepresented by meaner minds that love which i bear to all creatures teaches me to forgive you without such love all plans of progress must fail is it not so abel shelldrake could only ejaculate the words pity forgive in his most contemptuous tone while mrs shelldrake rocking violently in her chair gave utterance to that peculiar clucking ts ts ts ts whereby certain women express emotions too deep for words abel roused by hollinss question answered with a sudden energy love there is no love in the world where will you find it tell me and ill go there love id like to see it if all human hearts were like mine we might have an arcadia but most men have no hearts the world is a miserable hollow deceitful shell of vanity and hypocrisy no let us give up we were born before our time this age is not worthy of us hollins stared at the speaker in utter amazement shelldrake gave a long whistle and finally gasped out well what next none of us were prepared for such a sudden and complete wreck of our arcadian scheme the foundations had been sapped before it is true but we had not perceived it and now in two short days the whole edifice tumbled about our ears though it was inevitable we felt a shock of sorrow and a silence fell upon us only that scamp of a perkins brown chuckling and rubbing his boot really rejoiced i could have kicked him we all went to bed feeling that the charm of our arcadian life was over i was so full of the new happiness of love that i was scarcely conscious of regret i seemed to have leaped at once into responsible manhood and a glad rush of courage filled me at the knowledge that my own heart was a better oracle than those now so shamefully overthrown on whom i had so long implicitly relied in the first revulsion of feeling i was perhaps unjust to my associates i see now more clearly the causes of those vagaries which originated in a genuine aspiration and failed from an ignorance of the true nature of man quite as much as from the egotism of the individuals other attempts at reorganizing society were made about the same time by men of culture and experience but in the a c we had neither our leaders had caught a few halftruths which in their minds were speedily warped into errors i can laugh over the absurdities i helped to perpetrate but i must confess that the experiences of those few weeks went far towards making a man of me did the a c break up at once asked mr johnson not precisely though eunice and i left the house within two days as we had agreed we were not married immediately however three long years years of hope and mutual encouragement passed away before that happy consummation before our departure hollins had fallen into his old manner convinced apparently that candor must be postponed to a better age of the world but the quarrel rankled in shelldrakes mind and especially in that of his wife i could see by her looks and little fidgety ways that his further stay would be very uncomfortable abel mallory finding himself gaining in weight and improving in color had no thought of returning the day previous as i afterwards learned he had discovered perkins browns secret kitchen in the woods golly said that youth in describing the circumstance to me i had to ketch two porgies that day miss ringtop who must have suspected the new relation between eunice and myself was for the most part rigidly silent if she quoted it was from the darkest and dreariest utterances of her favorite gamaliel what happened after our departure i learned from perkins on the return of the shelldrakes to norridgeport in september mrs shelldrake stoutly persisted in refusing to make hollinss bed or to wash his shirts her brain was dull to be sure but she was therefore all the more stubborn in her resentment he bore this state of things for about a week when his engagements to lecture in ohio suddenly called him away abel and miss ringtop were left to wander about the promontory in company and to exchange lamentations on the hollowness of human hopes or the pleasures of despair whether it was owing to that attraction of sex which would make any man and any woman thrown together on a desert island finally become mates or whether she skilfully ministered to abels sentimental vanity i will not undertake to decide but the fact is they were actually betrothed on leaving arcadia i think he would willingly have retreated after his return to the world but that was not so easy miss ringtop held him with an inexorable clutch they were not married however until just before his departure for california whither she afterwards followed him she died in less than a year and left him free and what became of the other arcadians asked mr johnson the shelldrakes are still living in norridgeport they have become spiritualists i understand and cultivate mediums hollins when i last heard of him was a deputysurveyor in the new york customhouse perkins brown is our butcher here in waterbury and he often asks me do you take chloride of soda on your beefsteaks he is as fat as a prize ox and the father of five children enos exclaimed mrs billings looking at the clock its nearly midnight mr johnson must be very tired after such a long story the chapter of the a c is hereby closed friend elis daughter i the mild may afternoon was drawing to a close as friend eli mitch enor reached the top of the long hill and halted a few minutes to allow his horse time to recover breath he also heaved a sigh of satisfaction as he saw again the green undulating valley of the neshaminy with its dazzling squares of young wheat its brown patches of cornland its snowy masses of blooming orchard and the huge fountain like jets of weeping willow half concealing the gray stone fronts of the farmhouses he had been absent from home only six days but the time seemed almost as long to him as a three years cruise to a new bedford whaleman the peaceful seclusion and pastoral beauty of the scene did not consciously appeal to his senses but he quietly noted how much the wheat had grown during his absence that the oats were up and looking well that friend comlys meadow had been ploughed and friend martin had built his half of the linefence along the top of the hillfield if any smothered delight in the loveliness of the springtime found a hidingplace anywhere in the wellordered chambers of his heart it never relaxed or softened the straight inflexible lines of his face as easily could his collarless drab coat and waistcoat have flushed with a sudden gleam of purple or crimson eli mitchenor was at peace with himself and the world that is so much of the world as he acknowledged beyond the community of his own sect and a few personal friends who were privileged to live on its borders he neither knew nor cared to know much more of the human race than if it belonged to a planet farther from the sun in the discipline of the friends he was perfect he was privileged to sit on the high seats with the elders of the society and the travelling brethren from other states who visited bucks county invariably blessed his house with a familymeeting his farm was one of the best on the banks of the neshaminy and he also enjoyed the annual interest of a few thousand dollars carefully secured by mortgages on real estate his wife abigail kept even pace with him in the consideration she enjoyed within the limits of the sect and his two children moses and asenath vindicated the paternal training by the strictest sobriety of dress and conduct moses wore the plain coat even when his ways led him among the worlds people and asenath had never been known to wear or to express a desire for a ribbon of a brighter tint than brown or fawncolor friend mitchenor had thus gradually ripened to his sixtieth year in an atmosphere of life utterly placid and serene and looked forward with confidence to the final change as a translation into a deeper calm a serener quiet a prosperous eternity of mild voices subdued colors and suppressed emotions he was returning home in his own oldfashioned chair with its heavy square canopy and huge curved springs from the yearly meeting of the hicksite friends in philadelphia the large bay farmhorse slow and grave in his demeanor wore his plain harness with an air which made him seem among his fellowhorses the counterpart of his master among men he would no more have thought of kicking than the latter would of swearing a huge oath even now when the top of the hill was gained and he knew that he was within a mile of the stable which had been his home since colthood he showed no undue haste or impatience but waited quietly until friend mitchenor by a wellknown jerk of the lines gave him the signal to go on obedient to the motion he thereupon set forward once more jogging soberly down the eastern slope of the hill across the covered bridge where in spite of the tempting level of the hollowsounding floor he was as careful to abstain from trotting as if he had read the warning notice along the wooded edge of the green meadow where several cows of his acquaintance were grazing and finally wheeling around at the proper angle halted squarely in front of the gate which gave entrance to the private lane the old stone house in front the springhouse in a green little hollow just below it the walled garden with its clumps of box and lilac and the vast barn on the left all joining in expressing a silent welcome to their owner as he drove up the lane moses a man of twentyfive left his work in the garden and walked forward in his shirtsleeves well father how does thee do was his quiet greeting as they shook hands hows mother by this time asked eli oh thee neednt have been concerned said the son there she is go in ill tend to the horse abigail and her daughter appeared on the piazza the mother was a woman of fifty thin and delicate in frame but with a smooth placid beauty of countenance which had survived her youth she was dressed in a simple dovecolored gown with bookmuslin cap and handkerchief so scrupulously arranged that one might have associated with her for six months without ever discovering a spot on the former or an uneven fold in the latter asenath who followed was almost as plainly attired her dress being a darkblue calico while a white pasteboard sunbonnet with broad cape covered her head well abigail how art thou said eli quietly giving his hand to his wife im glad to see thee back was her simple welcome no doubt they had kissed each other as lovers but asenath had witnessed this manifestation of affection but once in her life after the burial of a younger sister the fact impressed her with a peculiar sense of sanctity and solemnity it was a caress wrung forth by a season of tribulation and therefore was too earnest to be profaned to the uses of joy so far therefore from expecting a paternal embrace she would have felt had it been given like the doomed daughter of the gileadite consecrated to sacrifice both she and her mother were anxious to hear the proceedings of the meeting and to receive personal news of the many friends whom eli had seen but they asked few questions until the suppertable was ready and moses had come in from the barn the old man enjoyed talking but it must be in his own way and at his own good time they must wait until the communicative spirit should move him with the first cup of coffee the inspiration came hovering at first over indifferent details he gradually approached those of more importance told of the addresses which had been made the points of discipline discussed the testimony borne and the appearance and genealogy of any new friends who had taken a prominent part therein finally at the close of his relation he said abigail there is one thing i must talk to thee about friend speakmans partner perhaps thees heard of him richard hilton has a son who is weakly hes two or three years younger than moses his mother was consumptive and theyre afraid he takes after her his father wants to send him into the country for the summer to some place where hell have good air and quiet and moderate exercise and friend speakman spoke of us i thought id mention it to thee and if thee thinks well of it we can send word down next week when josiah comly goes what does thee think asked his wife after a pause hes a very quiet steady young man friend speakman says and would be very little trouble to thee i thought perhaps his board would buy the new yoke of oxen we must have in the fall and the price of the fat ones might go to help set up moses but its for thee to decide i suppose we could take him said abigail seeing that the decision was virtually made already theres the corner room which we dont often use only if he should get worse on our hands friend speakman says theres no danger he is only weakbreasted as yet and clerking isnt good for him i saw the young man at the store if his looks dont belie him hes wellbehaved and orderly so it was settled that richard hilton the younger was to be an inmate of friend mitchenors house during the summer ii at the end of ten days he came in the undersized earnest darkhaired and darkeyed young man of threeandtwenty abigail mitchenor at once felt a motherly interest having received him as a temporary member of the family she considered him entitled to the same watchful care as if he were in reality an invalid son the ice over an hereditary quaker nature is but a thin crust if one knows how to break it and in richard hiltons case it was already broken before his arrival his only embarrassment in fact arose from the difficulty which he naturally experienced in adapting himself to the speech and address of the mitchenor family the greetings of old eli grave yet kindly of abigail quaintly familiar and tender of moses cordial and slightly condescending and finally of asenath simple and natural to a degree which impressed him like a new revelation in woman at once indicated to him his position among them his city manners he felt instinctively must be unlearned or at least laid aside for a time yet it was not easy for him to assume at such short notice those of his hosts happening to address asenath as miss mitchenor eli turned to him with a rebuking face we do not use compliments richard said he my daughters name is asenath i beg pardon i will try to accustom myself to your ways since you have been so kind as to take me for a while apologized richard hilton thees under no obligation to us said friend mitchenor in his strict sense of justice thee pays for what thee gets the finer feminine instinct of abigail led her to interpose well not expect too much of thee at first richard she remarked with a kind expression of face which had the effect of a smile but our ways are plain and easily learned thee knows perhaps that were no respecters of persons it was some days however before the young man could overcome his natural hesitation at the familiarity implied by these new forms of speech friend mitchenor and moses were not difficult to learn but it seemed a want of respect to address as abigail a woman of such sweet and serene dignity as the mother and he was fain to avoid either extreme by calling her with her cheerful permission aunt mitchenor on the other hand his own modest and unobtrusive nature soon won the confidence and cordial regard of the family he occasionally busied himself in the garden by way of exercise or accompanied moses to the cornfield or the woodland on the hill but was careful never to interfere at inopportune times and willing to learn silently by the simple process of looking on one afternoon as he was idly sitting on the stone wall which separated the garden from the lane asenath attired in a new gown of chocolatecolored calico with a doublehandled willow workbasket on her arm issued from the house as she approached him she paused and said the time seems to hang heavy on thy hands richard if thees strong enough to walk to the village and back it might do thee more good than sitting still richard hilton at once jumped down from the wall certainly i am able to go said he if you will allow it havent i asked thee was her quiet reply let me carry your basket he said suddenly after they had walked side by side some distance down the lane indeed i shall not let thee do that im only going for the mail and some little things at the store that make no weight at all thee mustnt think im like the young women in the city who im told if they buy a spool of cotton must have it sent home to them besides thee mustnt overexert thy strength richard hilton laughed merrily at the gravity with which she uttered the last sentence why miss asenath i mean what am i good for if i have not strength enough to carry a basket thees a man i know and i think a man would almost as lief be thought wicked as weak thee cant help being weaklyinclined and its only right that thee should be careful of thyself theres surely nothing in that that thee need be ashamed of while thus speaking asenath moderated her walk in order unconsciously to her companion to restrain his steps oh there are the dogstooth violets in blossom she exclaimed pointing to a shady spot beside the brook does thee know them richard immediately gathered and brought to her a handful of the nodding yellow bells trembling above their large cool spotted leaves how beautiful they are said he but i should never have taken them for violets they are misnamed she answered the flower is an erythronium but i am accustomed to the common name and like it did thee ever study botany not at all i can tell a geranium when i see it and i know a heliotrope by the smell i could never mistake a red cabbage for a rose and i can recognize a hollyhock or a sunflower at a considerable distance the wild flowers are all strangers to me i wish i knew something about them if thees fond of flowers it would be very easy to learn i think a study of this kind would pleasantly occupy thy mind why couldnt thee try i would be very willing to teach thee what little i know its not much indeed but all thee wants is a start see i will show thee how simple the principles are taking one of the flowers from the bunch asenath as they slowly walked forward proceeded to dissect it explained the mysteries of stamens and pistils pollen petals and calyx and by the time they had reached the village had succeeded in giving him a general idea of the linnaean system of classification his mind took hold of the subject with a prompt and profound interest it was a new and wonderful world which suddenly opened before him how surprised he was to learn that there were signs by which a poisonous herb could be detected from a wholesome one that cedars and pinetrees blossomed that the gray lichens on the rocks belonged to the vegetable kingdom his respect for asenaths knowledge thrust quite out of sight the restraint which her youth and sex had imposed upon him she was teacher equal friend and the simple candid manner which was the natural expression of her dignity and purity thoroughly harmonized with this relation although in reality two or three years younger than he asenath had a gravity of demeanor a calm selfpossession a deliberate balance of mind and a repose of the emotional nature which he had never before observed except in much older women she had had as he could well imagine no romping girlhood no season of careless lighthearted dalliance with opening life no violent alternation even of the usual griefs and joys of youth the social calm in which she had expanded had developed her nature as gently and securely as a seaflower is unfolded below the reach of tides and storms she would have been very much surprised if any one had called her handsome yet her face had a mild unobtrusive beauty which seemed to grow and deepen from day to day of a longer oval than the greek standard it was yet as harmonious in outline the nose was fine and straight the darkblue eyes steady and untroubled and the lips calmly but not too firmly closed her brown hair parted over a high white forehead was smoothly laid across the temples drawn behind the ears and twisted into a simple knot the white cape and sunbonnet gave her face a nunlike character which set her apart in the thoughts of the worlds people whom she met as one sanctified for some holy work she might have gone around the world repelling every rude word every bold glance by the protecting atmosphere of purity and truth which inclosed her the days went by each bringing some new blossom to adorn and illustrate the joint studies of the young man and maiden for richard hilton had soon mastered the elements of botany as taught by priscilla wakefield the only source of asenaths knowledge and entered with her upon the textbook of gray a copy of which he procured from philadelphia yet though he had overtaken her in his knowledge of the technicalities of the science her practical acquaintance with plants and their habits left her still his superior day by day exploring the meadows the woods and the clearings he brought home his discoveries to enjoy her aid in classifying and assigning them to their true places asenath had generally an hour or two of leisure from domestic duties in the afternoons or after the early supper of summer was over and sometimes on seventhdays she would be his guide to some locality where the rarer plants were known to exist the parents saw this community of interest and exploration without a thought of misgiving they trusted their daughter as themselves or if any possible fear had flitted across their hearts it was allayed by the absorbing delight with which richard hilton pursued his study an earnest discussion as to whether a certain leaf was ovate or lanceolate whether a certain plant belonged to the species scandens or canadensis was in their eyes convincing proof that the young brains were touched and therefore not the young hearts but love symbolized by a rosebud is emphatically a botanical emotion a sweet tender perception of beauty such as this study requires or develops is at once the most subtile and certain chain of communication between impressible natures richard hilton feeling that his years were numbered had given up in despair his boyish dreams even before he understood them his fate seemed to preclude the possibility of love but as he gained a little strength from the genial season the pure country air and the release from gloomy thoughts which his rambles afforded the end was farther removed and a future though brief perhaps still a future began to glimmer before him if this could be his life an endless summer with a search for new plants every morning and their classification every evening with asenaths help on the shady portico of friend mitchenors house he could forget his doom and enjoy the blessing of life unthinkingly the azaleas succeeded to the anemones the orchis and trillium followed then the yellow gerardias and the feathery purple pogonias and finally the growing gleam of the goldenrods along the woodside and the red umbels of the tall eupatoriums in the meadow announced the close of summer one evening as richard in displaying his collection brought to view the bloodred leaf of a gumtree asenath exclaimed ah there is the sign it is early this year what sign he asked that the summer is over we shall soon have frosty nights and then nothing will be left for us except the asters and gentians and goldenrods was the time indeed so near a few more weeks and this arcadian life would close he must go back to the city to its rectilinear streets its close brick walls its artificial constrained existence how could he give up the peace the contentment the hope he had enjoyed through the summer the question suddenly took a more definite form in his mind how could he give up asenath yes the quiet unsuspecting girl sitting beside him with her lap full of the september blooms he had gathered was thenceforth a part of his inmost life pure and beautiful as she was almost sacred in his regard his heart dared to say i need her and claim her thee looks pale tonight richard said abigail as they took their seats at the suppertable i hope thee has not taken cold iii will thee go along richard i know where the rudbeckias grow said asenath on the following seventhday afternoon they crossed the meadows and followed the course of the stream under its canopy of magnificent ash and plane trees into a brake between the hills it was an almost impenetrable thicket spangled with tall autumnal flowers the eupatoriums with their purple crowns stood like young trees with an undergrowth of aster and blue spikes of lobelia tangled in a golden mesh of dodder a strong mature odor mixed alike of leaves and flowers and very different from the faint elusive sweetness of spring filled the air the creek with a few faded leaves dropped upon its bosom and films of gossamer streaming from its bushy fringe gurgled over the pebbles in its bed here and there on its banks shone the deep yellow stars of the flower they sought richard hilton walked as in a dream mechanically plucking a stem of rudbeckia only to toss it presently into the water why richard whats thee doing cried asenath thee has thrown away the very best specimen let it go he answered sadly i am afraid everything else is thrown away what does thee mean she asked with a look of surprised and anxious inquiry dont ask me asenath or yes i will tell you i must say it to you now or never afterwards do you know what a happy life ive been leading since i came here that ive learned what life is as if id never known it before i want to live asenath and do you know why i hope thee will live richard she said gently and tenderly her deepblue eyes dim with the mist of unshed tears but asenath how am i to live without you but you cant understand that because you do not know what you are to me no you never guessed that all this while ive been loving you more and more until now i have no other idea of death than not to see you not to love you not to share your life oh richard i knew you would be shocked asenath i meant to have kept this to myself you never dreamed of it and i had no right to disturb the peace of your heart the truth is told now and i cannot take it back if i wished but if you cannot love you can forgive me for loving you forgive me now and every day of my life he uttered these words with a passionate tenderness standing on the edge of the stream and gazing into its waters his slight frame trembled with the violence of his emotion asenath who had become very pale as he commenced to speak gradually flushed over neck and brow as she listened her head drooped the gathered flowers fell from her hands and she hid her face for a few minutes no sound was heard but the liquid gurgling of the water and the whistle of a bird in the thicket beside them richard hilton at last turned and in a voice of hesitating entreaty pronounced her name asenath she took away her hands and slowly lifted her face she was pale but her eyes met his with a frank appealing tender expression which caused his heart to stand still a moment he read no reproach no faintest thought of blame but was it pity was it pardon or we stand before god richard said she in a low sweet solemn tone he knows that i do not need to forgive thee if thee requires it i also require his forgiveness for myself though a deeper blush now came to cheek and brow she met his gaze with the bravery of a pure and innocent heart richard stunned with the sudden and unexpected bliss strove to take the full consciousness of it into a being which seemed too narrow to contain it his first impulse was to rush forward clasp her passionately in his arms and hold her in the embrace which encircled for him the boundless promise of life but she stood there defenceless save in her holy truth and trust and his heart bowed down and gave her reverence asenath said he at last i never dared to hope for this god bless you for those words can you trust me can you indeed love me i can trust thee i do love thee they clasped each others hands in one long clinging pressure no kiss was given but side by side they walked slowly up the dewy meadows in happy and hallowed silence asenaths face became troubled as the old farmhouse appeared through the trees father and mother must know of this richard said she i am afraid it may be a cross to them the same fear had already visited his own mind but he answered cheerfully i hope not i think i have taken a new lease of life and shall soon be strong enough to satisfy them besides my father is in prosperous business it is not that she answered but thee is not one of us it was growing dusk when they reached the house in the dim candlelight asenaths paleness was not remarked and richards silence was attributed to fatigue the next morning the whole family attended meeting at the neighboring quaker meetinghouse in the preparation for which and the various special occupations of their firstday mornings the unsuspecting parents overlooked that inevitable change in the faces of the lovers which they must otherwise have observed after dinner as eli was taking a quiet walk in the garden richard hilton approached him friend mitchenor said he i should like to have some talk with thee what is it richard asked the old man breaking off some pods from a seedling radish and rubbing them in the palm of his hand i hope friend mitchenor said the young man scarcely knowing how to approach so important a crisis in his life i hope thee has been satisfied with my conduct since i came to live with thee and has no fault to find with me as a man well exclaimed eli turning around and looking up sharply does thee want a testimony from me ive nothing that i know of to say against thee if i were sincerely attached to thy daughter friend mitchenor and she returned the attachment could thee trust her happiness in my hands what cried eli straightening himself and glaring upon the speaker with a face too amazed to express any other feeling can you confide asenaths happiness to my care i love her with my whole heart and soul and the fortune of my life depends on your answer the straight lines in the old mans face seemed to grow deeper and more rigid and his eyes shone with the chill glitter of steel richard not daring to say a word more awaited his reply in intense agitation so he exclaimed at last this is the way thees repaid me i didnt expect this from thee has thee spoken to her i have thee has has thee and i suppose thees persuaded her to think as thee does theed better never have come here when i want to lose my daughter and cant find anybody else for her ill let thee know what have you against me friend mitchenor richard sadly asked forgetting in his excitement the quaker speech he had learned thee neednt use compliments now asenath shall be a friend while i live thy fine clothes and merrymakings and vanities are not for her thee belongs to the world and thee may choose one of the worlds women never protested richard but friend mitchenor was already ascending the gardensteps on his way to the house the young man utterly overwhelmed wandered to the nearest grove and threw himself on the ground thus in a miserable chaos of emotion unable to grasp any fixed thought the hours passed away towards evening he heard a footstep approaching and sprang up it was moses the latter was engaged with the consent of his parents and expected to pass meeting in a few weeks he knew what had happened and felt a sincere sympathy for richard for whom he had a cordial regard his face was very grave but kind theed better come in richard said he the evenings are damp and i ve brought thy overcoat i know everything and i feel that it must be a great cross for thee but thee wont be alone in bearing it do you think there is no hope of your father relenting he asked in a tone of despondency which anticipated the answer fathers very hard to move said moses and when mother and asenath cant prevail on him nobody else need try im afraid thee must make up thy mind to the trial im sorry to say it richard but i think theed better go back to town ill go tomorrow go and die he muttered hoarsely as he followed moses to the house abigail as she saw his haggard face wept quietly she pressed his hand tenderly but said nothing eli was stern and cold as an iceland rock asenath did not make her appearance at supper the old man and his son exchanged a few words about the farmwork to be done on the morrow but nothing else was said richard soon left the room and went up to his chamber to spend his last his only unhappy night at the farm a yearning pitying look from abigail accompanied him try and not think hard of us was her farewell the next morning as he stepped into the old chair in which moses was to convey him to the village where he should meet the doylestown stage so without a word of comfort from asenaths lips without even a last look at her beloved face he was taken away iv true and firm and selfreliant as was the nature of asenath mitchenor the thought of resistance to her fathers will never crossed her mind it was fixed that she must renounce all intercourse with richard hilton it was even sternly forbidden her to see him again during the few hours he remained in the house but the sacred love thus rudely dragged to the light and outraged was still her own she would take it back into the keeping of her heart and if a day should ever come when he would be free to return and demand it of her he would find it there unwithered with all the unbreathed perfume hoarded in its folded leaves if that day came not she would at the last give it back to god saying father here is thy most precious gift bestow it as thou wilt as her life had never before been agitated by any strong emotion so it was not outwardly agitated now the placid waters of her soul did not heave and toss before those winds of passion and sorrow they lay in dull leaden calm under a cold and sunless sky what struggles with herself she underwent no one ever knew after richard hiltons departure she never mentioned his name or referred in any way to the summers companionship with him she performed her household duties if not cheerfully at least as punctually and carefully as before and her father congratulated himself that the unfortunate attachment had struck no deeper root abigails finer sight however was not deceived by this external resignation she noted the faint shadows under the eyes the increased whiteness of the temples the unconscious traces of pain which sometimes played about the dimpled corners of the mouth and watched her daughter with a silent tender solicitude the wedding of moses was a severe test of asenaths strength but she stood the trial nobly performing all the duties required by her position with such sweet composure that many of the older female friends remarked to abigail how womanly asenath has grown eli mitchenor noted with peculiar satisfaction that the eyes of the young friends some of them of great promise in the sect and well endowed with worldly goods followed her admiringly it will not be long he thought before she is consoled fortune seemed to favor his plans and justify his harsh treatment of richard hilton there were unfavorable accounts of the young mans conduct his father had died during the winter and he was represented as having become very reckless and dissipated these reports at last assumed such a definite form that friend mitchenor brought them to the notice of his family i met josiah comly in the road said he one day at dinner hes just come from philadelphia and brings bad news of richard hilton hes taken to drink and is spending in wickedness the money his father left him his friends have a great concern about him but it seems hes not to be reclaimed abigail looked imploringly at her husband but he either disregarded or failed to understand her look asenath who had grown very pale steadily met her fathers gaze and said in a tone which he had never yet heard from her lips father will thee please never mention richard hiltons name when i am by the words were those of entreaty but the voice was that of authority the old man was silenced by a new and unexpected power in his daughters heart he suddenly felt that she was not a girl as heretofore but a woman whom he might persuade but could no longer compel it shall be as thee wishes asenath he said we had best forget him of their friends however she could not expect this reserve and she was doomed to hear stories of richard which clouded and embittered her thoughts of him and a still severer trial was in store she accompanied her father in obedience to his wish and against her own desire to the yearly meeting in philadelphia it has passed into a proverb that the friends on these occasions always bring rain with them and the period of her visit was no exception to the rule the showery days of yearly meeting week glided by until the last and she looked forward with relief to the morrows return to bucks county glad to have escaped a meeting with richard hilton which might have confirmed her fears and could but have given her pain in any case as she and her father joined each other outside the meetinghouse at the close of the afternoon meeting a light rain was falling she took his arm under the capacious umbrella and they were soon alone in the wet streets on their way to the house of the friends who entertained them at a crossing where the water pouring down the gutter towards the delaware caused them to halt a man plashing through the flood staggered towards them without an umbrella with dripping disordered clothes yet with a hot flushed face around which the long black hair hung wildly he approached singing to himself with maudlin voice a song that would have been sweet and tender in a lovers mouth friend mitchenor drew to one side lest his spotless drab should be brushed by the unclean reveller but the latter looking up stopped suddenly face to face with them asenath he cried in a voice whose anguish pierced through the confusion of his senses and struck down into the sober quick of his soul richard she breathed rather than spoke in a low terrified voice it was indeed richard hilton who stood before her or rather as she afterwards thought in recalling the interview the body of richard hilton possessed by an evil spirit his cheeks burned with a more than hectic red his eyes were wild and bloodshot and though the recognition had suddenly sobered him an impatient reckless devil seemed to lurk under the set mask of his features here i am asenath he said at length hoarsely i said it was death didnt i well its worse than death i suppose but what matter you cant be more lost to me now than you were already this is thy doing friend eli he continued turning to the old man with a sneering emphasis on the thy i hope thees satisfied with thy work here he burst into a bitter mocking laugh which it chilled asenaths blood to hear the old man turned pale come away child said he tugging at her arm but she stood firm strengthened for the moment by a solemn feeling of duty which trampled down her pain richard she said with the music of an immeasurable sorrow in her voice oh richard what has thee done where the lord commands resignation thee has been rebellious where he chasteneth to purify thee turns blindly to sin i had not expected this of thee richard i thought thy regard for me was of the kind which would have helped and uplifted thee not through me as an unworthy object but through the hopes and the pure desires of thy own heart i expected that thee would so act as to justify what i felt towards thee not to make my affection a reproach oh richard not to cast over my heart the shadow of thy sin the wretched young man supported himself against the post of an awning buried his face in his hands and wept passionately once or twice he essayed to speak but his voice was choked by sobs and after a look from the streaming eyes which asenath could scarcely bear to meet he again covered his face a stranger coming down the street paused out of curiosity come come cried eli once more eager to escape from the scene his daughter stood still and the man slowly passed on asenath could not thus leave her lost lover in his despairing grief she again turned to him her own tears flowing fast and free i do not judge thee richard but the words that passed between us give me a right to speak to thee it was hard to lose sight of thee then but it is still harder for me to see thee now if the sorrow and pity i feel could save thee i would be willing never to know any other feelings i would still do anything for thee except that which thee cannot ask as thee now is and i could not give thee has made the gulf between us so wide that it cannot be crossed but i can now weep for thee and pray for thee as a fellowcreature whose soul is still precious in the sight of the lord fare thee well he seized the hand she extended bowed down and showered mingled tears and kisses upon it then with a wild sob in his throat he started up and rushed down the street through the fastfalling rain the father and daughter walked home in silence eli had heard every word that was spoken and felt that a spirit whose utterances he dared not question had visited asenaths tongue she as year after year went by regained the peace and patience which give a sober cheerfulness to life the pangs of her heart grew dull and transient but there were two pictures in her memory which never blurred in outline or faded in color one the brake of autumn flowers under the bright autumnal sky with bird and stream making accordant music to the new voice of love the other a rainy street with a lost reckless man leaning against an awningpost and staring in her face with eyes whose unutterable woe when she dared to recall it darkened the beauty of the earth and almost shook her trust in the providence of god v year after year passed by but not without bringing change to the mitchenor family moses had moved to chester county soon after his marriage and had a good farm of his own at the end of ten years abigail died and the old man who had not only lost his savings by an unlucky investment but was obliged to mortgage his farm finally determined to sell it and join his son he was getting too old to manage it properly impatient under the unaccustomed pressure of debt and depressed by the loss of the wife to whom without any outward show of tenderness he was in truth tenderly attached he missed her more keenly in the places where she had lived and moved than in a neighborhood without the memory of her presence the pang with which he parted from his home was weakened by the greater pang which had preceded it it was a harder trial to asenath she shrank from the encounter with new faces and the necessity of creating new associations there was a quiet satisfaction in the ordered monotonous round of her life which might be the same elsewhere but here alone was the nook which held all the morning sunshine she had ever known here still lingered the halo of the sweet departed summer here still grew the familiar wildflowers which the first richard hilton had gathered this was the paradise in which the adam of her heart had dwelt before his fall her resignation and submission entitled her to keep those pure and perfect memories though she was scarcely conscious of their true charm she did not dare to express to herself in words that one everlasting joy of womans heart through all trials and sorrows i have loved i have been beloved on the last firstday before their departure she walked down the meadows to the lonely brake between the hills it was the early spring and the black buds of the ash had just begun to swell the maples were dusted with crimson bloom and the downy catkins of the swampwillow dropped upon the stream and floated past her as once the autumn leaves in the edges of the thickets peeped forth the blue scentless violet the fairy cups of the anemone and the pinkveined bells of the miskodeed the tall blooms through which the lovers walked still slept in the chilly earth but the sky above her was mild and blue and the remembrance of the day came back to her with a delicate pungent sweetness like the perfume of the trailing arbutus in the air around her in a sheltered sunny nook she found a single erythronium lured forth in advance of its proper season and gathered it as a relic of the spot which she might keep without blame as she stooped to pluck it her own face looked up at her out of a little pool filled by the spring rains seen against the reflected sky it shone with a soft radiance and the earnest eyes met hers as if it were her young self evoked from the past to bid her farewell farewell she whispered taking leave at once as she believed of youth and the memory of love during those years she had more than once been sought in marriage but had steadily though kindly refused once when the suitor was a man whose character and position made the union very desirable in eli mitchenors eyes he ventured to use his paternal influence asenaths gentle resistance was overborne by his arbitrary force of will and her protestations were of no avail father she finally said in the tone which he had once heard and still remembered thee can take away but thee cannot give he never mentioned the subject again richard hilton passed out of her knowledge shortly after her meeting with him in philadelphia she heard indeed that his headlong career of dissipation was not arrested that his friends had given him up as hopelessly ruined and finally that he had left the city after that all reports ceased he was either dead or reclaimed and leading a better life somewhere far away dead she believed almost hoped for in that case might he not now be enjoying the ineffable rest and peace which she trusted might be her portion it was better to think of him as a purified spirit waiting to meet her in a holier communion than to know that he was still bearing the burden of a soiled and blighted life in any case her own future was plain and clear it was simply a prolongation of the present an alternation of seedtime and harvest filled with humble duties and cares until the master should bid her lay down her load and follow him friend mitchenor bought a small cottage adjacent to his sons farm in a community which consisted mostly of friends and not far from the large old meetinghouse in which the quarterly meetings were held he at once took his place on the upper seat among the elders most of whom he knew already from having met them year after year in philadelphia the charge of a few acres of ground gave him sufficient occupation the money left to him after the sale of his farm was enough to support him comfortably and a late indian summer of contentment seemed now to have come to the old man he was done with the earnest business of life moses was gradually taking his place as father and friend and asenath would be reasonably provided for at his death as his bodily energies decayed his imperious temper softened his mind became more accessible to liberal influences and he even cultivated a cordial friendship with a neighboring farmer who was one of the worlds people thus at seventyfive he was really younger because tenderer of heart and more considerate than he had been at sixty asenath was now a woman of thirtyfive and suitors had ceased to approach her much of her beauty still remained but her face had become thin and wasted and the inevitable lines were beginning to form around her eyes her dress was plainer than ever and she wore the scoopbonnet of drab silk in which no woman can seem beautiful unless she be very old she was calm and grave in her demeanor save that her perfect goodness and benevolence shone through and warmed her presence but when earnestly interested she had been known to speak her mind so clearly and forcibly that it was generally surmised among the friends that she possessed a gift which might in time raise her to honor among them to the children of moses she was a good genius and a word from aunt senath oftentimes prevailed when the authority of the parents was disregarded in them she found a new source of happiness and when her old home on the neshaminy had been removed a little farther into the past so that she no longer looked with every mornings sun for some familiar feature of its scenery her submission brightened into a cheerful content with life it was summer and quarterlymeeting day had arrived there had been rumors of the expected presence of friends from a distance and not only those of the district but most of the neighbors who were not connected with the sect attended by the byroad through the woods it was not more than half a mile from friend mitchenors cottage to the meetinghouse and asenath leaving her father to be taken by moses in his carriage set out on foot it was a sparkling breezy day and the forest was full of life squirrels chased each other along the branches of the oaks and the air was filled with fragrant odors of hickoryleaves sweet fern and spicewood picking up a flower here and there asenath walked onward rejoicing alike in shade and sunshine grateful for all the consoling beauty which the earth offers to a lonely heart that serene content which she had learned to call happiness had filled her being until the dark canopy was lifted and the waters took back their transparency under a cloudless sky passing around to the womens side of the meetinghouse she mingled with her friends who were exchanging information concerning the expected visitors micajah morrill had not arrived they said but ruth baxter had spent the last night at friend ways and would certainly be there besides there were friend chandler from nine partners and friend carter from maryland they had been seen on the ground friend carter was said to have a wonderful gift mercy jackson had heard him once in baltimore the friends there had been a little exercised about him because they thought he was too much inclined to the newness but it was known that the spirit had often manifestly led him friend chandler had visited yearly meeting once they believed he was an old man and had been a personal friend of elias hicks at the appointed hour they entered the house after the subdued rustling which ensued upon taking their seats there was an interval of silence shorter than usual because it was evident that many persons would feel the promptings of the spirit friend chandler spoke first and was followed by ruth baxter a frail little woman with a voice of exceeding power the not unmelodious chant in which she delivered her admonitions rang out at times like the peal of a trumpet fixing her eyes on vacancy with her hands on the wooden rail before her and her body slightly swaying to and fro her voice soared far aloft at the commencement of every sentence gradually dropping through a melodious scale of tone to the close she resembled an inspired prophetess an aged deborah crying aloud in the valleys of israel the last speaker was friend carter a small man not more than forty years of age his face was thin and intense in its expression his hair gray at the temples and his dark eye almost too restless for a child of the stillness and the quietness his voice though not loud was clear and penetrating with an earnest sympathetic quality which arrested not the ear alone but the serious attention of the auditor his delivery was but slightly marked by the peculiar rhythm of the quaker preachers and this fact perhaps increased the effect of his words through the contrast with those who preceded him his discourse was an eloquent vindication of the law of kindness as the highest and purest manifestation of true christian doctrine the paternal relation of god to man was the basis of that religion which appealed directly to the heart so the fraternity of each man with his fellow was its practical application god pardons the repentant sinner we can also pardon where we are offended we can pity where we cannot pardon both the good and the bad principles generate their like in others force begets force anger excites a corresponding anger but kindness awakens the slumbering emotions even of an evil heart love may not always be answered by an equal love but it has never yet created hatred the testimony which friends bear against war he said is but a general assertion which has no value except in so far as they manifest the principle of peace in their daily lives in the exercise of pity of charity of forbearance and christian love the words of the speaker sank deeply into the hearts of his hearers there was an intense hush as if in truth the spirit had moved him to speak and every sentence was armed with a sacred authority asenath mitchenor looked at him over the low partition which divided her and her sisters from the mens side absorbed in his rapt earnestness and truth she forgot that other hearers were present he spake to her alone a strange spell seemed to seize upon her faculties and chain them at his feet had he beckoned to her she would have arisen and walked to his side friend carter warmed and deepened as he went on i feel moved today he said moved i know not why but i hope for some wise purpose to relate to you an instance of divine and human kindness which has come directly to my own knowledge a young man of delicate constitution whose lungs were thought to be seriously affected was sent to the house of a friend in the country in order to try the effect of air and exercise asenath almost ceased to breathe in the intensity with which she gazed and listened clasping her hands tightly in her lap to prevent them from trembling and steadying herself against the back of the seat she heard the story of her love for richard hilton told by the lips of a stranger not merely of his dismissal from the house but of that meeting in the street at which only she and her father were present nay more she heard her own words repeated she heard richards passionate outburst of remorse described in language that brought his living face before her she gasped for breath his face was before her the features sharpened by despairing grief which her memory recalled had almost anticipated the harder lines which fifteen years had made and which now with a terrible shock and choking leap of the heart she recognized her senses faded and she would have fallen from her seat but for the support of the partition against which she leaned fortunately the women near her were too much occupied with the narrative to notice her condition many of them wept silently with their handkerchiefs pressed over their mouths the first shock of deathlike faintness passed away and she clung to the speakers voice as if its sound alone could give her strength to sit still and listen further deserted by his friends unable to stay his feet on the evil path he continued the young man left his home and went to a city in another state but here it was easier to find associates in evil than tender hearts that might help him back to good he was tired of life and the hope of a speedier death hardened him in his courses but my friends death never comes to those who wickedly seek him the lord withholds destruction from the hands that are madly outstretched to grasp it and forces his pity and forgiveness on the unwilling soul finding that it was the principle of life which grew stronger within him the young man at last meditated an awful crime the thought of selfdestruction haunted him day and night he lingered around the wharves gazing into the deep waters and was restrained from the deed only by the memory of the last loving voice he had heard one gloomy evening when even this memory had faded and he awaited the approaching darkness to make his design secure a hand was laid on his arm a man in the simple garb of the friends stood beside him and a face which reflected the kindness of the divine father looked upon him my child said he i am drawn to thee by the great trouble of thy mind shall i tell thee what it is thee meditates the young man shook his head i will be silent then but i will save thee i know the human heart and its trials and weaknesses and it may be put into my mouth to give thee strength he took the young mans hand as if he had been a little child and led him to his home he heard the sad story from beginning to end and the young man wept upon his breast to hear no word of reproach but only the largest and tenderest pity bestowed upon him they knelt down side by side at midnight and the friends right hand was upon his head while they prayed the young man was rescued from his evil ways to acknowledge still further the boundless mercy of providence the dissipation wherein he had recklessly sought death was for him a marvellous restoration to life his lungs had become sound and free from the tendency to disease the measure of his forgiveness was almost more than he could bear he bore his cross thenceforward with a joyful resignation and was mercifully drawn nearer and nearer to the truth until in the fulness of his convictions he entered into the brotherhood of the friends i have been powerfully moved to tell you this story friend carter concluded from a feeling that it may be needed here at this time to influence some heart trembling in the balance who is there among you my friends that may not snatch a brand from the burning oh believe that pity and charity are the most effectual weapons given into the hands of us imperfect mortals and leave the awful attribute of wrath in the hands of the lord he sat down and dead silence ensued tears of emotion stood in the eyes of the hearers men as well as women and tears of gratitude and thanksgiving gushed warmly from those of asenath an ineffable peace and joy descended upon her heart when the meeting broke up friend mitchenor who had not recognized richard hilton but had heard the story with feelings which he endeavored in vain to control approached the preacher the lord spoke to me this day through thy lips said he will thee come to one side and hear me a minute eli mitchenor exclaimed friend carter eli i knew not thee was here doesnt thee know me the old man stared in astonishment it seems like a face i ought to know he said but i cant place thee they withdrew to the shade of one of the poplars friend carter turned again much moved and grasping the old mans hands in his own exclaimed friend mitchenor i was called upon today to speak of myself i am or rather i was the richard hilton whom thee knew friend mitchenors face flushed with mingled emotions of shame and joy and his grasp on the preachers hands tightened but thee calls thyself carter he finally said soon after i was saved was the reply an aunt on the mothers side died and left her property to me on condition that i should take her name i was tired of my own then and to give it up seemed only like losing my former self but i should like to have it back again now wonderful are the ways of the lord and past finding out said the old man come home with me richard come for my sake for there is a concern on my mind until all is clear between us or stay will thee walk home with asenath while i go with moses asenath yes there she goes through the gate thee can easily overtake her i m coming moses and he hurried away to his sons carriage which was approaching asenath felt that it would be impossible for her to meet richard hilton there she knew not why his name had been changed he had not betrayed his identity with the young man of his story he evidently did not wish it to be known and an unexpected meeting with her might surprise him into an involuntary revelation of the fact it was enough for her that a saviour had arisen and her lost adam was redeemed that a holier light than the autumn suns now rested and would forever rest on the one landscape of her youth her eyes shone with the pure brightness of girlhood a soft warmth colored her cheek and smoothed away the coming lines of her brow and her step was light and elastic as in the old time eager to escape from the crowd she crossed the highway dusty with its string of returning carriages and entered the secluded lane the breeze had died away the air was full of insectsounds and the warm light of the sinking sun fell upon the woods and meadows nature seemed penetrated with a sympathy with her own inner peace but the crown of the benignant day was yet to come a quick footstep followed her and ere long a voice near at hand called her by name she stopped turned and for a moment they stood silent face to face i knew thee richard at last she said in a trembling voice may the lord bless thee tears were in the eyes of both he has blessed me richard answered in a reverent tone and this is his last and sweetest mercy asenath let me hear that thee forgives me i have forgiven thee long ago richard forgiven but not forgotten the hush of sunset was on the forest as they walked onward side by side exchanging their mutual histories not a leaf stirred in the crowns of the tall trees and the dusk creeping along between their stems brought with it a richer woodland odor their voices were low and subdued as if an angel of god were hovering in the shadows and listening or god himself looked down upon them from the violet sky at last richard stopped asenath said he does thee remember that spot on the banks of the creek where the rudbeckias grew i remember it she answered a girlish blush rising to her face if i were to say to thee now what i said to thee there what would be thy answer her words came brokenly i would say to thee richard i can trust thee i do love thee look at me asenath her eyes beaming with a clearer light than even then when she first confessed were lifted to his she placed her hands gently upon his shoulders and bent her head upon his breast he tenderly lifted it again and for the first time her virgin lips knew the kiss of man miss bartrams trouble i it was a day of unusual excitement at the rambo farmhouse on the farm it is true all things were in their accustomed order and all growths did their accustomed credit to the season the fences were in good repair the cattle were healthy and gave promise of the normal increase and the young corn was neither strangled with weeds nor assassinated by cutworms old john rambo was gradually allowing his son henry to manage in his stead and the latter shrewdly permitted his father to believe that he exercised the ancient authority leonard clare the strong young fellow who had been taken from that shiftless adventurer his father when a mere child and brought up almost as one of the family and who had worked as a joiners apprentice during the previous six months had come back for the harvest work so the rambos were forehanded and probably as well satisfied as it is possible for pennsylvania farmers to be in the house also mrs priscilla rambo was not severely haunted by the spectre of any neglected duty the simple regular routine of the household could not be changed under her charge each thing had its appropriate order of performance must be done and was done if the season were backward at the time appointed for whitewashing or soapmaking so much the worse for the season if the unhatched goslings were slain by thunder she laid the blame on the thunder and if but no it is quite impossible to suppose that outside of those two inevitable fearful housecleaning weeks in each year there could have been any disorder in the cold prim varnishodored best rooms sacred to company it was miss betty rambo whose pulse beat some ten strokes faster than its wont as she sat down with the rest to their early country dinner whether her brother henrys participated in the accelerated movement could not be guessed from his demeanor she glanced at him now and then with bright eyes and flushed cheeks eager to speak yet shrinking from the half magisterial air which was beginning to supplant his old familiar banter henry was changing with his new responsibility as she admitted to herself with a sort of dismay he had the airs of an independent farmer and she remained only a farmers daughter without any acknowledged rights until she should acquire them all at a single blow by marriage nevertheless he must have felt what was in her mind for as he cut out the quarter of a dried apple pie he said carelessly i must go down to the lion this afternoon theres a fresh drove of maryland cattle just come oh harry cried betty in real distress i know he answered but as miss bartram is going to stay two weeks shell keep shes not like a drove thats here one day and away the next besides it is precious little good i shall have of her society until you two have used up all your secrets and small talk i know how it is with girls leonard will drive over to meet the train wont i do on a pinch leonard asked oh to be sure said betty a little embarrassed only alice miss bartram might expect harry because her brother came for me when i went up if thats all make yourself easy bet henry answered as he rose from the table theres a mighty difference between here and there unless you mean to turn us into a town family while she stays high quality eh go along to your cattle theres not much quality high or low where you are betty was indignant but the annoyance exhausted itself healthfully while she was clearing away the dishes and restoring the room to its order so that when leonard drove up to the gate with the lumbering oldfashioned carriage two hours afterwards she came forth calm cheerful fresh as a pink in her pink muslin and entirely the good sensible countrygirl she was two or three years before she and miss alice bartram daughter of the distinguished lawyer in the city had been roommates at the nereid seminary for young ladies each liked the other for the contrast to her own self both were honest good and lovable but betty had the stronger nerves and a practical sense which seemed to be admirable courage in the eyes of miss alice whose instincts were more delicate whose tastes were fine and high and who could not conceive of life without certain luxurious accessories a very cordial friendship sprang up between them not the effusive girllove with its iterative kisses tears and flow of loosened hair but springing from the respect inspired by sound and positive qualities the winter before betty had been invited to visit her friend in the city and had passed a very excited and delightful week in the stately bartram mansion if she were at first a little fluttered by the manners of the new world she was intelligent enough to carry her own nature frankly through it instead of endeavoring to assume its character thus her little awkwardnesses became originalities and she was almost popular in the lofty circle when she withdrew from it it was therefore perhaps slightly inconsistent in betty that she was not quite sure how miss bartram would accept the reverse side of this social experience she imagined it easier to look down and make allowances as a host than as a guest she could not understand that the charm of the change might be fully equal it was lovely weather as they drove up the sweet everchanging curves of the brandywine valley the woods fairly laughed in the clear sunlight and the soft incessant shifting breezes leonard in his best clothes and with a smoother gloss on his brown hair sang to himself as he urged the strongboned horses into a trot along the levels and betty finally felt so quietly happy that she forgot to be nervous when they reached the station they walked up and down the long platform together until the train from the city thundered up and painfully restrained its speed then betty catching sight of a fawncolored travelling dress issuing from the ladies car caught hold of leonards arm and cried there she is miss bartram heard the words and looked down with a bright glad expression on her face it was not her beauty that made leonards heart suddenly stop beating for she was not considered a beauty in society it was something rarer than perfect beauty yet even more difficult to describe a serene unconscious grace a pure lofty maturity of womanhood such as our souls bow down to in the santa barbara of palma vecchio her features were not faultlessly regular but they were informed with the finer harmonies of her character she was a woman at whose feet a noble man might kneel lay his forehead on her knee confess his sins and be pardoned she stepped down to the platform and bettys arms were about her after a double embrace she gently disengaged herself turned to leonard gave him her hand and said with a smile which was delightfully frank and cordial i will not wait for bettys introduction mr rambo she has talked to me so much of her brother harry that i quite know you already leonard could neither withdraw his eyes nor his hand it was like a double burst of warmth and sunshine in which his breast seemed to expand his stature to grow and his whole nature to throb with some new and wonderful force a faint color came into miss bartrams cheeks as they stood thus for a moment face to face she seemed to be waiting for him to speak but of this he never thought had any words come to his mind his tongue could not have uttered them it is not harry betty explained striving to hide her embarrassment this is leonard clare who lives with us then i do not know you so well as i thought miss bartram said to him it is the beginning of a new acquaintance after all there isnt no harm done leonard answered and instantly feeling the awkwardness of the words blushed so painfully that miss bartram felt the inadequacy of her social tact to relieve so manifest a case of distress but she did instinctively what was really best she gave leonard the check for her trunk divided her satchels with betty and walked to the carriage he did not sing as he drove homewards down the valley seated on the trunk in front he quietly governed the horses while the two girls on the seat behind him talked constantly and gaily only the rich steady tones of miss bartrams voice would make their way into his ears and every light careless sentence printed itself upon his memory they came to him as if from some inaccessible planet poor fellow he was not the first to feel the desire of the moth for the star when they reached the rambo farmhouse it was necessary that he should give his hand to help her down from the clumsy carriage he held it but a moment yet in that moment a gentle pulse throbbed upon his hard palm and he mechanically set his teeth to keep down the impulse which made him wild to hold it there forever thank you mr clare said miss bartram and passed into the house when he followed presently shouldering her trunk into the upper bestroom and kneeling upon the floor to unbuckle the straps she found herself wondering is this a knightly service or the menial duty of a porter can a man be both sensitive and ignorant chivalrous and vulgar the question was not so easily decided though no one guessed how much miss bartram pondered it during the succeeding days she insisted from the first that her coming should make no change in the habits of the household she rose in the cool dewy summer dawns dined at noon in the old brown room beside the kitchen and only differed from the rambos in sitting at her moonlit window and breathing the subtle odors of a myriad leaves long after betty was sleeping the sleep of health it was strange how frequently the strong not very graceful figure of leonard clare marched through these reveries she occasionally spoke to him at the common table or as she passed the borders of the hayfield where he and henry were at work but his words to her were always few and constrained what was there in his eyes that haunted her not merely a most reverent admiration of her pure womanly refinement although she read that also not a fear of disparagement such as his awkward speech implied but something which seemed to seek agonizingly for another language than that of the lips something which appealed to her from equal ground and asked for an answer one evening she met him in the lane as she returned from the meadow she carried a bunch of flowers with delicate blue and lilac bells and asked him the name thems brandywine cowslips he answered i never heard no other name may i correct you she said gently and with a smile which she meant to be playful i suppose the main thing is to speak ones thought but there are neat and orderly ways and there are careless ways thereupon she pointed out the inaccuracies of his answer he standing beside her silent and attentive when she ceased he did not immediately reply you will take it in good part will you not she continued i hope i have not offended you no he exclaimed firmly lifting his head and looking at her the inscrutable expression in his dark gray eyes was stronger than before and all his features were more clearly drawn he reminded her of a picture of adam which she had once seen there was the same rather low forehead straight even brows full yet strong mouth and that broader form of chin which repeats and balances the character of the forehead he was not positively handsome but from head to foot he expressed a fresh sound quality of manhood another question flashed across miss bartrams mind is life long enough to transform this clay into marble here is a man in form and with all the dignity of the perfect masculine nature shall the broad free intelligence the grace and sweetness the taste and refinement which the best culture gives never be his also if not woman must be content with faulty representations of her ideal so musing she walked on to the farmhouse leonard had picked up one of the blossoms she had let fall and appeared to be curiously examining it if he had apologized for his want of grammar or promised to reform it her interest in him might have diminished but his silence his simple natural obedience to some powerful inner force whatever it was helped to strengthen that phantom of him in her mind which was now beginning to be a serious trouble once again the day before she left the rambo farmhouse to return to the city she came upon him alone she had wandered off to the brandywine to gather ferns at a rocky point where some choice varieties were to be found there were a few charming clumps halfway up a slaty cliff which it did not seem possible to scale and she was standing at the base looking up in vain longing when a voice almost at her ear said which ones do you want afterwards she wondered that she did not start at the voice leonard had come up the road from one of the lower fields he wore neither coat nor waistcoat and his shirt open at the throat showed the firm beautiful white of the flesh below the strong tan of his neck miss bartram noticed the sinewy strength and elasticity of his form yet when she looked again at the ferns she shook her head and answered none since i cannot have them without saying a word he took off his shoes and commenced climbing the nearly perpendicular face of the cliff he had done it before many a time but miss bartram although she was familiar with such exploits from the pages of many novels had never seen the reality and it quite took away her breath when he descended with the ferns in his hand she said it was a great risk i wish i had not wanted them it was no risk for me he answered what can i send you in return she asked as they walked forwards i am going home tomorrow betty told me leonard said please wait one minute he stepped down to the bank of the stream washed his hands carefully in the clear water and came back to her holding them dripping at his sides i am very ignorant he then continued ignorant and rough you are good to want to send me something but i want nothing miss bartram you are very good he paused but with all her tact and social experience she did not know what to say would you do one little thing for me not for the ferns that was nothing no more than you do without thinking for all your friends oh surely she said might i might i now therell be no chance tomorrow shake hands with you the words seemed to be forced from him by the strength of a fierce will both stopped involuntarily its quite dry you see said he offering his hand her own sank upon it palm to palm and the fingers softly closed over each as if with the passion and sweetness of a kiss miss bartrams heart came to her eyes and read at last the question in leonards it was i as man and you as woman are equals will you give me time to reach you what her eyes replied she knew not a mighty influence drew her on and a mighty doubt and dread restrained her one said here is your lover your husband your cherished partner left by fate below your station yet whom you may lift to your side shall man alone crown the humble maiden stoop to love and loving ennoble be you the queen and love him by the royal right of womanhood but the other sternly whispered how shall your fine and delicate fibres be knit into this coarse texture ignorance which years cannot wash away low instincts what do you know all the servile side of life which is turned from you what madness to choose this because some current of earthly magnetism sets along your nerves he loves you what of that you are a higher being to him and he stupidly adores you think yes dare to think of all the prosaic realities of life shared with him miss bartram felt herself growing dizzy behind the impulse which bade her cast herself upon his breast swept such a hot wave of shame and pain that her face burned and she dropped her eyelids to shut out the sight of his face but for one endless second the sweeter voice spoke through their clasped hands perhaps he kissed hers she did not know she only heard herself murmur goodbye pray go on i will rest here she sat down upon a bank by the roadside turned away her head and closed her eyes it was long before the tumult in her nature subsided if she reflected with a sense of relief nothing was said the thought immediately followed but all is known it was impossible yes clearly impossible and then came such a wild longing such an assertion of the right and truth and justice of love as made her seem a miserable coward the veriest slave of conventionalities out of this struggle dawned selfknowledge and the strength which is born of it when she returned to the house she was pale and weary but capable of responding to betty rambos constant cheerfulness the next day she left for the city without having seen leonard clare again ii henry rambo married and brought a new mistress to the farmhouse betty married and migrated to a new home in another part of the state leonard clare went back to his trade and returned no more in harvesttime so the pleasant farm by the brandywine having served its purpose as a background will be seen no more in this history miss bartrams inmost life as a woman was no longer the same the point of view from which she had beheld the world was shifted and she was obliged to remodel all her feelings and ideas to conform to it but the process was gradual and no one stood near enough to her to remark it she was occasionally suspected of that eccentricity which in a woman of fiveandtwenty is looked upon as the first symptom of a tendency to oldmaidenhood but which is really the sign of an earnest heart struggling with the questions of life in the society of cities most men give only the shallow flashy surface of their natures to the young women they meet and miss bartram after that revelation of the dumb strength of an ignorant man sometimes grew very impatient of the platitudes and affectations which came to her clad in elegant words and accompanied by irreproachable manners she had various suitors for that sense of grace and repose and sweet feminine power which hung around her like an atmosphere attracted good and true men towards her to some indeed she gave that noble untroubled friendship which is always possible between the best of the two sexes and when she was compelled to deny the more intimate appeal it was done with such frank sorrow such delicate tenderness that she never lost the friend in losing the lover but as one year after another went by and the younger members of her family fell off into their separate domestic orbits she began to shrink a little at the perspective of a lonely life growing lonelier as it receded from the present by this time leonard clare had become almost a dream to her she had neither seen him nor heard of him since he let go her hand on that memorable evening beside the stream he was a strange bewildering chance a cypher concealing a secret which she could not intelligently read why should she keep the memory of that power which was perhaps some unconscious quality of his nature no it was not so something deeper than reason cried or long since forgotten if felt by him the man whom she most esteemed came back to her she knew the ripeness and harmony of his intellect the nobility of his character and the generosity of a feeling which would be satisfied with only a partial return she felt sure also that she should never possess a sentiment nearer to love than that which pleaded his cause in her heart but her hand lay quiet in his her pulses were calm when he spoke and his face manly and true as it was never invaded her dreams all questioning was vain her heart gave no solution of the riddle perhaps her own want was common to all lives then she was cherishing a selfish ideal and rejecting the positive good offered to her hands after long hesitation she yielded the predictions of society came to naught instead of becoming an eccentric spinster miss bartram was announced to be the affianced bride of mr lawrie a few weeks and months rolled around and when the weddingday came she almost hailed it as the port of refuge where she should find a placid and peaceful life they were married by an aged clergyman a relative of the bridegroom the crossstreet where his chapel stood fronting a methodist church both of the simplest form of that architecture fondly supposed to be gothic was quite blocked up by the carriages of the party the pews were crowded with elegant guests the altar was decorated with flowers and the ceremony lacked nothing of its usual solemn beauty the bride was pale but strikingly calm and selfpossessed and when she moved towards the door as mrs lawrie on her husbands arm many matrons recalling their own experience marvelled at her unflurried dignity just as they passed out the door and the bridal carriage was summoned a singular thing happened another bridal carriage drew up from the opposite side and a newly wedded pair came forth from the portal of the methodist church both parties stopped face to face divided only by the narrow street mrs lawrie first noticed the flushed cheeks of the other bride her white dress rather showy than elegant and the heavy gold ornaments she wore then she turned to the bridegroom he was tall and wellformed dressed like a gentleman but like one who is not yet unconscious of his dress and had the air of a man accustomed to exercise some authority she saw his face and instantly all other faces disappeared from the opposite brink of a tremendous gulf she looked into his eyes and their blended ray of love and despair pierced her to the heart there was a roaring in her ears followed a long sighing sound like that of the wind on some homeless waste she leaned more heavily on her husbands arm leaned against his shoulder slid slowly down into his supporting clasp and knew no more shes paying for her mock composure after all said the matrons it must have been a great effort iii ten years afterwards mrs lawrie went on board a steamer at southampton bound for new york she was travelling alone having been called suddenly from europe by the approaching death of her aged father for two or three days after sailing the thick rainy spring weather kept all below except a few hardy gentlemen who crowded together on the lee of the smokestack and kept up a stubborn cheerfulness on a very small capital of comfort there were few cabinpassengers on board but the usual crowd of emigrants in the steerage mrs lawries face had grown calmer and colder during these years there was yet no gray in her hair no wrinkles about her clear eyes each feature appeared to be the same but the pale monotonous color which had replaced the warm bloom of her youth gave them a different character the gracious dignity of her manner the mellow tones of her voice still expressed her unchanging goodness yet those who met her were sure to feel in some inexplicable way that to be good is not always to be happy perhaps indeed her manner was older than her face and form she still attracted the interest of men but with a certain doubt and reserve certain it is that when she made her appearance on deck glad of the blue sky and sunshine and threw back her hood to feel the freshness of the sea air all eyes followed her movements except those of a forlorn individual who muffled in his cloak and apparently seasick lay upon one of the benches the captain presently joined her and the gentlemen saw that she was bright and perfectly selfpossessed in conversation some of them immediately resolved to achieve an acquaintance the dull passive existence of the beginning of every voyage seemed to be now at an end it was time for the little society of the vessel to awake stir itself and organize a life of its own for the few remaining days that night as mrs lawrie was sleeping in her berth she suddenly awoke with a singular feeling of dread and suspense she listened silently but for some time distinguished none other than the small sounds of night on shipboard the indistinct orders the dragging of ropes the creaking of timbers the dull regular jar of the engine and the shuffling noise of feet overhead but ere long she seemed to catch faint distant sounds that seemed like cries then came hurry and confusion on deck then voices in the cabin one of which said they never can get it under at this rate she rose dressed herself hastily and made her way through pale and excited stewards and the bewildered passengers who were beginning to rush from their staterooms to the deck in the wild tumult which prevailed she might have been thrown down and trampled under foot had not a strong arm seized her around the waist and borne her towards the stern where there were but few persons wait here said a voice and her protector plunged into the crowd she saw instantly the terrible fate which had fallen upon the vessel the bow was shrouded in whirls of smoke through which dull red flashes began to show themselves and all the length and breadth of the deck was filled with a screaming struggling fighting mass of desperate human beings she saw the captain officers and a few of the crew working in vain against the disorder she saw the boats filled before they were lowered and heard the shrieks as they were capsized she saw spars and planks and benches cast overboard and maddened men plunging after them and then like the sudden opening of the mouth of hell the relentless triumphant fire burst through the forward deck and shot up to the foreyard she was leaning against the mizen shrouds between the coils of rope nobody appeared to notice her although the quarterdeck was fast filling with persons driven back by the fire yet still shrinking from the terror and uncertainty of the sea she thought it is but death why should i fear the waves are at hand to save me from all suffering and the collective horror of hundreds of beings did not so overwhelm her as she had both fancied and feared the tragedy of each individual life was lost in the confusion and was she not a sharer in their doom suddenly a man stood before her with a cork lifepreserver in his hands and buckled it around her securely under the arms he was panting and almost exhausted yet he strove to make his voice firm and even cheerful as he said we fought the cowardly devils as long as there was any hope two boats are off and two capsized in ten minutes more every soul must take to the water trust to me and i will save you or die with you what else can i do she answered with a few powerful strokes of an axe he broke off the top of the pilothouse bound two or three planks to it with ropes and dragged the mass to the bulwarks the minute this goes he then said to her you go after it and i follow keep still when you rise to the surface she left the shrouds took hold of the planks at his side and they heaved the rude raft into the sea in an instant she was seized and whirled over the side she instinctively held her breath felt a shock felt herself swallowed up in an awful fathomless coldness and then found herself floating below the huge towering hull which slowly drifted away in another moment there was one at her side lay your hand on my shoulder he said and when she did so swam for the raft which they soon reached while she supported herself by one of the planks he so arranged and bound together the pieces of timber that in a short time they could climb upon them and rest not much washed by the waves the ship drifted further and further casting a faint though awful glare over the sea until the light was suddenly extinguished as the hull sank the dawn was in the sky by this time and as it broadened they could see faint specks here and there where others like themselves clung to drifting spars mrs lawrie shuddered with cold and the reaction from an excitement which had been far more powerful than she knew at the time her preserver then took off his coat wrapped it around her and produced a pocketflask saying this will support us the longest it is all i could find or bring with me she sat leaning against his shoulder though partly turned away from him all she could say was you are very good after awhile he spoke and his voice seemed changed to her ears you must be thinking of mr lawrie it will indeed be terrible for him to hear of the disaster before knowing that you are saved god has spared him that distress she answered mr lawrie died a year ago she felt a start in the strong frame upon which she leaned after a few minutes of silence he slowly shifted his position towards her yet still without facing her and said almost in a whisper you have said that i am very good will you put your hand in mine she stretched hers eagerly and gratefully towards him what had happened through all the numbness of her blood there sprang a strange new warmth from his strong palm and a pulse which she had almost forgotten as a dream of the past began to beat through her frame she turned around all atremble and saw his face in the glow of the coming day leonard clare she cried then you have not forgotten me could one forget when the other remembers the words came involuntarily from her lips she felt what they implied the moment afterwards and said no more but he kept her hand in his mrs lawrie he began after another silence we are hanging by a hair on the edge of life but i shall gladly let that hair break since i may tell you now purely and in the hearing of god how i have tried to rise to you out of the low place in which you found me at first you seemed too far but you yourself led me the first step of the way and i have steadily kept my eyes on you and followed it when i had learned my trade i came to the city no labor was too hard for me no study too difficult i was becoming a new man i saw all that was still lacking and how to reach it and i watched you unknown at a distance then i heard of your engagement you were lost and something of which i had begun to dream became insanity i determined to trample it out of my life the daughter of the masterbuilder whose first assistant i was had always favored me in her society and i soon persuaded her to love me i fancied too that i loved her as most married men seemed to love their wives the union would advance me to a partnership in her fathers business and my fortune would then be secured you know what happened but you do not know how the sight of your face planted the old madness again in my life and made me a miserable husband a miserable man of wealth almost a scoffer at the knowledge i had acquired for your sake when my wife died taking an only child with her there was nothing left to me except the mechanical ambition to make myself without you what i imagined i might have become through you i have studied and travelled lived alone and in society until your world seemed to be almost mine but you were not there the sun had risen while they sat rocking on their frail support her hand still lay in his and her head rested on his shoulder every word he spoke sank into her heart with a solemn sweetness in which her whole nature was silent and satisfied why should she speak he knew all yes it seemed that he knew his arm stole around her and her head was drawn from his shoulder to the warm breadth of his breast something hard pressed her cheek and she lifted her hand to move it aside he drew forth a flat medallion case and to the unconscious question in her face such a sad tender smile came to his lips that she could not repress a sudden pain was it the miniature of his dead wife he opened the case and showed her under the glass a faded pressed flower what is it she asked the brandywine cowslip you dropped when you spoke to me in the lane then it was that you showed me the first step of the way she laid her head again upon his bosom hour after hour they sat and the light swells of the sea heaved them aimlessly to and fro and the sun burned them and the spray drenched their limbs at last leonard clare roused himself and looked around he felt numb and faint and he saw also that her strength was rapidly failing we cannot live much longer i fear he said clasping her closely in his arms kiss me once darling and then we will die she clung to him and kissed him there is life not death in your lips he cried oh god if we should live he rose painfully to his feet stood tottering on the raft and looked across the waves presently he began to tremble then to sob like a child and at last spoke through his tears a sail a sail and heading towards us mrs strongitharms report mr editor if you ever read the burroak banner which you will find among your exchanges as the editor publishes your prospectus for six weeks every year and sends no bill to you my name will not be that of a stranger let me throw aside all affectation of humility and say that i hope it is already and not unfavorably familiar to you i am informed by those who claim to know that the manuscripts of obscure writers are passed over by you editors without examination in short that i must first have a name if i hope to make one the fact that an article of three hundred and seventyfive pages which i sent successively to the north american review the catholic world and the radical was in each case returned to me with my knot on the tape by which it was tied convinces me that such is indeed the case a few years ago i should not have meekly submitted to treatment like this but late experiences have taught me the vanity of many womanly dreams you are acquainted with the part i took i am sure you must have seen it in the burroak banner eight years ago in creating that public sentiment in our favor which invested us with all the civil and political rights of men how the editors of the revolution to which i subscribe and the conventions in favor of the equal rights of women recently held in boston and other cities have failed to notice our noble struggle is a circumstance for which i will not try to account i will only say and it is a hint which some persons will understand that there are other forms of jealousy than those which spring from love it is indeed incredible that so little is known outside the state of atlantic of the experiment i mean the achievement of the last eight years while the war lasted we did not complain that our work was ignored but now that our sisters in other states are acting as if in complete unconsciousness of what we have done now that we need their aid and they need ours but in different ways it is time that somebody should speak were selina whiston living i should leave the task to her pen she never recovered from the shock and mortification of her experiences in the state legislature in but i will not anticipate the history of all the band of female iconoclasts as the hon mr screed called us in jest it was no jest afterwards his image being the first to go down of all i say some are married and some are dead and there is really no one left so familiar with the circumstances as i am and equally competent to give a report of them mr spelter the editor of the burroak banner suggests that i must be brief if i wish my words to reach the ears of the millions for whom they are designed and i shall do my best to be so if i were not obliged to begin at the very beginning and if the interests of atlantic had not been swallowed up like those of other little states in the whirlpool of national politics i should have much less to say but if mr george fenian brain and mrs candy station do not choose to inform the public of either the course or the results of our struggle am i to blame if i could have attended the convention in boston and had been allowed to speak and i am sure the distinguished chairwoman would have given me a chance it would have been the best way no doubt to set our case before the world i must first tell you how it was that we succeeded in forcing the men to accept our claims so much in advance of other states we were indebted for it chiefly to the skill and adroitness of selina whiston the matter had been agitated it is true for some years before and as early as a bill drawn up by mrs whiston herself had been introduced into the legislature where it received three votes moreover we had held meetings in almost every election precinct in the state and our annual fair to raise funds at gaston while the legislature was in session was always very brilliant and successful so the people were not entirely unprepared although our state had gone for fremont in by a small majority the democrats afterwards elected their governor and both parties therefore had hopes of success in the canvass began early and was very animated mrs whiston had already inaugurated the custom of attending political meetings and occasionally putting a question to the stump orator no matter of which party of sometimes indeed taking the stump herself after the others had exhausted their wind she was very witty as you know and her stories were so good and so capitally told that neither democrat nor republican thought of leaving the ground while she was upon the stand now it happened that our congressional district was one of the closest it happened also that our candidate i am a republican and so is mr strongitharm was rather favorably inclined to the womans cause it happened thirdly and this is the seemingly insignificant pivot upon which we whirled into triumph that he mr wrangle and the opposing candidate mr tumbrill had arranged to hold a joint meeting at burroak this meeting took place on a magnificent day just after the oatsharvest and everybody for twenty miles around was there mrs whiston together with sarah pincher olympia knapp and several other prominent advocates of our cause met at my house in the morning and we all agreed that it was time to strike a blow the rest of us magnanimously decided to take no part in the concerted plan though very eager to do so selina whiston declared that she must have the field to herself and when she said that we knew she meant it it was generally known that she was on the ground in fact she spent most of the time while messrs wrangle and tumbrill were speaking in walking about through the crowds so after an hour apiece for the gentlemen and then fifteen minutes apiece for a rejoinder and the star spangled banner from the band for both sides we were not a bit surprised to hear a few cries of whiston from the audience immediately we saw the compact gray bonnet and brown serge dress she knew what would go through a crowd without tearing splitting the wedge of people on the steps leading to the platform i noticed that the two congressional candidates looked at each other and smiled in spite of the venomous charges they had just been making well i wont attempt to report her speech though it was her most splendid effort as people will say when it was no effort to her at all but the substance of it was this after setting forth womans wrongs and mans tyranny and taxation without representation and an equal chance and fairplay and a struggle for life which you know all about from the other conventions she turned squarely around to the two candidates arid said now to the practical application you mr wrangle and you mr tumbrill want to be elected to congress the district is a close one you have both counted the votes in advance oh i know your secrets and there isnt a difference of a hundred in your estimates a very little will turn the scale either way perhaps a womans influence perhaps my voice might do it but i will give you an equal chance so much power is left to woman despite what you withhold that we the women of putnam shinnebaug and rancocus counties are able to decide which of you shall be elected either of you would give a great deal to have a majority of the intelligent women of the district on your side it would already be equivalent to success now to show that we understand the political business from which you have excluded us to prove that we are capable of imitating the noble example of men we offer to sell our influence as they their votes to the highest bidder there was great shouting and cheering among the people at this but the two candidates somehow or other didnt seem much amused i stand here she continued in the interest of my struggling sisters and with authority to act for them which of you will bid the most not in offices or material advantages as is the way of your parties but in the way of help to the womans cause which of you will here publicly pledge himself to say a word for us from now until electionday whenever he appears upon the stump there was repeated cheering and cries of got em there men are so vulgar i pause for a reply shall they not answer me she continued turning to the audience then there were tremendous cries of yes yes wrangle tumbrill mr wrangle looked at mr tumbrill and made a motion with his head signifying that he should speak then mr tumbrill looked at mr wrangle and made a motion that he should speak the people saw all this and laughed and shouted as if they would never finish mr wrangle on second thoughts this is my private surmise saw that boldness would just then be popular so he stepped forward do i understand he said that my fair and eloquent friend demands perfect political and civil equality for her sex i do exclaimed selina whiston in her firmest manner let me be more explicit he continued you mean precisely the same rights the same duties the same obligations the same responsibilities she repeated the phrases over after him affirmatively with an emphasis which i never heard surpassed pardon me once more said mr wrangle the right to vote to hold office to practise law theology medicine to take part in all municipal affairs to sit on juries to be called upon to aid in the execution of the law to aid in suppressing disturbances enforcing public order and performing military duty here there were loud cheers from the audience and a good many voices cried out got her there men are so very vulgar mrs whiston looked troubled for a moment but she saw that a moments hesitation would be fatal to our scheme so she brought out her words as if each one were a maulblow on the buttend of a wedge all that we demand then said mr wrangle i bid my support in exchange for the womens just what the speaker demands without exception or modification equal privileges rights duties and obligations without regard to the question of sex is that broad enough i was all in a tremble when it came to that somehow mr wrangles acceptance of the bid did not inspire me although it promised so much i had anticipated opposition dissatisfaction tumult so had mrs whiston and i could see and the crowd could see that she was not greatly elated mr wrangle made a very significant bow to mr tumbrill and then sat down there were cries of tumbrill and that gentleman none of us of course believing him sincere for we knew his private views came forward and made exactly the same pledge i will do both parties the justice to say that they faithfully kept their word nay it was generally thought the repetition of their brief pleas for woman at some fifty meetings before election came had gradually conducted them to the belief that they were expressing their own personal sentiments the mechanical echo in public thus developed into an opinion in private my own political experience has since demonstrated to me that this is a phenomenon very common among men the impulse generated at that meeting gradually spread all over the state we the leaders of the womens movement did not rest until we had exacted the same pledge from all the candidates of both parties and the nearer it drew towards electionday the more prominence was given in the public meetings to the illustration and discussion of the subject our state went for lincoln by a majority of as you will find by consulting the tribune almanac and mr wrangle was elected to congress having received a hundred and fortytwo more votes than his opponent mr tumbrill has always attributed his defeat to his want of courage in not taking up at once the glove which selina whiston threw down i think i have said enough to make it clear how the state of atlantic came to be the first to grant equal civil and political rights to women when the legislature of met at gaston we estimated that we might count upon fiftythree out of the seventyone republican senators and assemblymen and on thirtyfour out of the sixtyfive democrats this would give a majority of twentyeight in the house and ten in the senate should the bill pass there was still a possibility that it might be vetoed by the governor of whom we did not feel sure we therefore arranged that our annual fair should be held a fortnight later than usual and that the proceeds a circumstance known only to the managers should be devoted to a series of choice suppers at which we entertained not only the governor and our friends in both houses but also like true christians our legislatorial enemies olympia knapp who you know is so very beautiful presided at these entertainments she put forth all her splendid powers and with more effect than any of us suspected on the day before the bill reached its third reading the governor made her an offer of marriage she came to the managers in great agitation and laid the matter before them stating that she was overwhelmed with surprise though sarah pincher always maintained that she wasnt in the least and asking their advice we discussed the question for four hours and finally decided that the interests of the cause would oblige her to accept the governors hand oh i am so glad cried olympia for i accepted him at once it was a brave a noble deed now i would ask those who assert that women are incapable of conducting the business of politics to say whether any set of men of either party could have played their cards more skilfully even after the campaign was over we might have failed had it not been for the suppers we owed this idea like the first to the immortal selina whiston a lucky accident as momentous in its way as the fall of an apple to newton or the flying of a kite to dr franklin gave her the secret principle by which the politics of men are directed her house in whittletown was the half of a double frame building and the rearend of the other part was the private office of but no i will not mention the name a lawyer and a politician he was known as a wirepuller and the other wirepullers of his party used to meet in his office and discuss matters mrs whiston always asserted that there was a mousehole through the partition but she had energy enough to have made a hole herself for the sake of the cause she never would tell us all she overheard it is enough she would say that i know how the thing is done i remember that we were all considerably startled when she first gave us an outline of her plan on my saying that i trusted the dissemination of our principles would soon bring us a great adhesion she burst out with principles why if we trust to principles we shall never succeed we must rely upon influences as the men do we must fight them with their own weapons and even then we are at a disadvantage because we cannot very well make use of whiskey and cigars we yielded because we had grown accustomed to be guided by her and moreover we had seen time and again how she could succeed as for instance in the nelson divorce case but i dont suppose you ever heard of that when the matter seemed nigh hopeless to all of us the history of and the following winter proves that in her the world has lost a stateswoman mr wrangle and governor battle have both said to me that they never knew a measure to be so splendidly engineered both before the public and in the state legislature after the bill had been passed and signed by the governor and so had become a law and the grand womens jubilee had been held at gaston the excitement subsided it would be nearly a year to the next state election and none of the women seemed to care for the local and municipal elections in the spring besides there was a good deal of anxiety among them in regard to the bill which was drawn up in almost the exact terms used by mr wrangle at the political meeting in fact we always have suspected that he wrote it the word male was simply omitted from all laws nothing is changed said mrs whiston quoting charles x there are only more citizens in atlantic this was in january you must remember and the shadow of the coming war began to fall over us had the passage of our bill been postponed a fortnight it would have been postponed indefinitely for other and for the men more powerful excitements followed one upon the other even our jubilee was thinly attended and all but two of the members on whom we relied for speeches failed us governor battle who was to have presided was at washington and olympia already his wife accompanied him i may add that she has never since taken any active part with us they have been in europe for the last three years most of the women here in burroak at least expressed a feeling of disappointment that there was no palpable change in their lot no sense of extended liberty such as they imagined would come to transform them into brighter and better creatures they supposed that they would at once gain in importance in the eyes of the men but the men were now so preoccupied by the events at the south that they seemed to have forgotten our political value speaking for myself as a good union woman i felt that i must lay aside for a time the interests of my sex once it is true i proposed to accompany mr strongitharm to a party caucus at the wrangle house but he so suddenly discovered that he had business in another part of the town that i withdrew my proposition as the summer passed over and the first and second call for volunteers had been met and more than met by the patriotic men of the state how we blessed them we began to take courage and to feel that if our new civil position brought us no very tangible enjoyment at least it imposed upon us no very irksome duties the first practical effect of the new law came to light at the august term of our county court the names of seven women appeared on the list of jurors but only three of them answered to their names one the wife of a poor farmer was excused by the judge as there was no one to look after six small children in her absence another was a tailoress with a quantity of work on hand some of which she proposed bringing with her into court in order to save time but as this could not be allowed she made so much trouble that she was also finally let off only one therefore remained to serve fortunately for the credit of our sex she was both able and willing to do so and we afterward made a subscription and presented her with a silver fishknife on account of her having tired out eleven jurymen and brought in a verdict of damages against a young man whom she convicted of seduction she told me that no one would ever know what she endured during those three days but the morals of our county have been better ever since mr spelter told me that his state exchanges showed that there had been difficulties of the same kind in all the other counties in mendip the countytown of which is whittletown mrs whistons home the immediate result had been the decision on the part of the commissioners to build an addition at the rear of the courthouse with large commodious and wellfurnished juryrooms so arranged that a comfortable privacy was secured to the jurywomen i did my best to have the same improvement adopted here but alas i have not the ability of selina whiston in such matters and there is nothing to this day but the one vile miserable room properly furnished in no particular except spittoons the nominating conventions were held in august also and we were therefore called upon to move at once in order to secure our fair share much valuable time had been lost in discussing a question of policy namely whether we should attach ourselves to the two parties already in existence according to our individual inclinations or whether we should form a third party for ourselves we finally accepted the former proposition and i think wisely for the most of us were so ignorant of political tricks and devices that we still needed to learn from the men and we could not afford to draw upon us the hostility of both parties in the very infancy of our movement never in my life did i have such a task as in drumming up a few women to attend the primary township meeting for the election of delegates it was impossible to make them comprehend its importance even after i had done my best to explain the technicalities of male politics and fancied that i had made some impression the answer would be well id go im sure just to oblige you but then theres the tomatoes to be canned or im so behindhand with my darning and patching or johnll be sure to go and theres no need of two from the same house and so on until i was mightily discouraged there were just nine of us all told to about a hundred men i wont deny that our situation that night at the wrangle house was awkward and not entirely agreeable to be sure the landlord gave us the parlor and most of the men came in now and then to speak to us but they managed the principal matters all by themselves in the barroom which was such a mess of smoke and stale liquor smells that it turned my stomach when i ventured in for two minutes i dont think we should have accomplished much but for a cute idea of mrs wilbur the tinmans wife she went to the leaders and threatened them that the womens vote should be cast in a body for the democratic candidates unless we were considered in making up the ticket that helped the delegates were properly instructed and the county convention afterward nominated two men and one woman as candidates for the assembly that woman was as i need hardly say for the world knows it myself i had not solicited the honor and therefore could not refuse especially as my daughter melissa was then old enough to keep house in my absence no woman had applied for the nomination for sheriff but there were seventeen schoolmistresses anxious for the office of county treasurer the only other nomination given to the women however was that of director or rather directress of the poor which was conferred on mrs bassett wife of a clergyman mr strongitharm insisted that i should in some wise prepare myself for my new duties by reading various political works and i conscientiously tried to do so but dear me it was much more of a task than i supposed we had all read the debate on our bill of course but i always skipped the dry stupid stuff about the tariff and finance and stay laws and exemption laws and railroad company squabbles and for the life of me i cant see to this day what connection there is between these things and womens rights but as i said i did my best with the help of websters dictionary although the further i went the less i liked it as electionday drew nearer our prospects looked brighter the republican ticket under the editorial head of the burroak banner with my name and mrs bassetts among the mens was such an evidence that many women notably opposed to the cause said we didnt want the right but since we have it we shall make use of it this was exactly what mrs whiston had foretold we estimated that taking the county tickets all over the state we had about onetwentieth of the republican and onefiftieth of the democratic nominations this was far from being our due but still it was a good beginning my husband insisted that i should go very early to the polls i could scarcely restrain a tear of emotion as i gave my first ballot into the hands of the judges there were not a dozen persons present and the act did not produce the sensation which i expected one man cried out three cheers for our assemblywoman and they gave them and i thereupon returned home in the best spirits i devoted the rest of the day to relieving poorer women who could not have spared the time to vote if i had not meanwhile looked after their children the last was nancy black the shoemakers wife in our street who kept me waiting upon her till it was quite dark when she finally came the skirt of her dress was ripped nearly off her hair was down and her comb broken but she was triumphant for sam black was with her and sober the first time since we were married mrs strongitharm she cried then she whispered to me as i was leaving and ive killed his vote anyhow when the count was made our party was far ahead up to this time i think the men of both parties had believed that only a few women here and there would avail themselves of their new right but they were roundly mistaken although only ten per cent of the female voters went to the polls yet threefourths of them voted the republican ticket which increased the majority of that party in the state about eleven thousand it was amazing what an effect followed this result the whole country would have rung with it had we not been in the midst of war mr wrangle declared that he had always been an earnest advocate of the womens cause governor battle in his next message congratulated the state on the signal success of the experiment and the democratic masses smarting under their defeat cursed their leaders for not having been sharp enough to conciliate the new element the leaders themselves said nothing and in a few weeks the rank and file recovered their cheerfulness even mrs whiston with all her experience was a little puzzled by this change of mood alas she was far from guessing the correct explanation it was a great comfort to me that mrs whiston was also elected to the legislature my husband had just then established his manufactory of patent selfscouring knifeblades now so celebrated and could not leave so i was obliged to go up to gaston all alone when the session commenced there were but four of us assemblywomen and although the men treated us with great courtesy i was that nervous that i seemed to detect either commiseration or satire everywhere before i had even taken my seat i was addressed by fifteen or twenty different gentlemen either great capitalists or great engineers or distinguished lawyers all interested in various schemes for developing the resources of our state by new railroads canals or ferries i then began to comprehend the grandeur of the legislators office my voice could assist in making possible these magnificent improvements and i promised it to all mr filch president of the shinnebaug and great western consolidated line was so delighted with my appreciation of his plan for reducing the freight on grain from nebraska that he must have written extravagant accounts of me to his wife for she sent me at christmas one of the loveliest shawls i ever beheld i had frequently made short addresses at our public meetings and was considered to have my share of selfpossession but i never could accustom myself to the keen disturbing irritating atmosphere of the legislature everybody seemed wideawake and aggressive instead of pleasantly receptive there were so many points of order and what not such complete disregard among the members of each others feelings and finally a thing i could never understand indeed such inconsistency and lack of principle in the intercourse of the two parties how could i feel assured of their sincerity when i saw the very men chatting and laughing together in the lobbies ten minutes after they had been facing each other like angry lions in the debate mrs whiston also had her trials of the same character nothing ever annoyed her so much as a little blunder she made the week after the opening of the session i have not yet mentioned that there was already a universal dissatisfaction among the women on account of their being liable to military service the war seemed to have hardly begun as yet and conscription was already talked about the women therefore clamored for an exemption on account of sex although we all felt that this was a retrograde movement the pressure was so great that we yielded mrs whiston reluctant at first no sooner made up her mind that the thing must be done than she furthered it with all her might after several attempts to introduce a bill which were always cut off by some point of order she unhappily lost her usual patience i dont know that i can exactly explain how it happened for what the men call parliamentary tactics always made me fidgetty but the previous question turned up as it always seemed to me to do at the wrong time and cut her off before she had spoken ten words mr speaker she protested there is no question previous to this which needs the consideration of the house this is first in importance and demands your immediate order order came from all parts of the house i am in order the right is always in order she exclaimed getting more and more excited we women are not going to be contented with the mere show of our rights on this floor we demand the substance and so she was going on when there arose the most fearful tumult the upshot of it was that the speaker ordered the sergeantatarms to remove mrs whiston one of the members more considerate walked across the floor to her and tried to explain in what manner she was violating the rules and in another minute she sat down so white rigid and silent that it made me shake in my shoes to look at her i have made a great blunder she said to me that evening and it may set us back a little but i shall recover my ground which she did i assure you she cultivated the acquaintance of the leaders of both parties studied their tactics and quietly waited for a good opportunity to bring in her bill at first we thought it would pass but one of the male members presently came out with a speech which dashed our hopes to nothing he simply took the ground that there must be absolute equality in citizenship that every privilege was balanced by a duty every trust accompanied with its responsibility he had no objection to women possessing equal rights with men but to give them all civil rights and exempt them from the most important obligation of service would be he said to create a privileged class a female aristocracy it was contrary to the spirit of our institutions the women had complained of taxation without representation did they now claim the latter without the former the people never look more than halfway into a subject and so this speech was immensely popular i will not give mrs whistons admirable reply for mr spelter informs me that you will not accept an article if it should make more than seventy or eighty printed pages it is enough that our bill was killed as the men say a brutal word and the women of the state laid the blame of the failure upon us you may imagine that we suffered under this injustice but worse was to come as i said before a great many things came up in the legislature which i did not understand and to be candid did not care to understand but i was obliged to vote nevertheless and in this extremity i depended pretty much on mrs whistons counsel we could not well go to the private nightly confabs of the members indeed they did not invite us and when it came to the issue of state bonds bank charters and such like i felt as if i were blundering along in the dark one day i received to my immense astonishment a hundred and more letters all from the northern part of our county i opened them one after the other and well it is beyond my power to tell you what varieties of indignation and abuse fell upon me it seems that i had voted against the bill to charter the mendip extension railroad co i had been obliged to vote for or against so many things that it was impossible to recollect them all however i procured the printed journal and sure enough there among the nays was strongitharm it was not a week after that and i was still suffering in mind and body when the newspapers in the interest of the rancocus and great western consolidated accused me not by name but the same thing you know how they do it of being guilty of taking bribes mr filch of the shinnebaug consolidated had explained to me so beautifully the superior advantages of his line that the directors of the other company took their revenge in this vile abominable way that was only the beginning of my trouble what with these slanders and longing for the quiet of our dear old home at burroak i was almost sick yet the legislature sat on and sat on until i was nearly desperate then one morning came a despatch from my husband melissa is drafted come home how i made the journey i cant tell i was in an agony of apprehension and when mr strongitharm and melissa both met me at the burroak station well and smiling i fell into a hysterical fit of laughing and crying for the first time in my life billy brandon who was engaged to melissa came forward and took her place like a man he fought none the worse let me tell you because he represented a woman and i may as well say it now he came home a captain without a left arm but melissa seems to have three arms for his sake you have no idea what a confusion and lamentation there was all over the state a good many women were drafted and those who could neither get substitutes for love nor money were marched to gaston where the recruiting colonel was considerate enough to give them a separate camp in a week however the word came from washington that the army regulations of the united states did not admit of their being received and they came home blessing mr stanton this was the end of drafting women in our state nevertheless the excitement created by the draft did not subside at once it was seized upon by the democratic leaders as part of a plan already concocted which they then proceeded to set in operation it succeeded only too well and i dont know when we shall ever see the end of it we had more friends among the republicans at the start because all the original abolitionists in the state came into that party in our success had been so rapid and unforeseen that the democrats continued their opposition even after female suffrage was an accomplished fact but the leaders were shrewd enough to see that another such election as the last would ruin their party in the state so their trains were quietly laid and the match was not applied until all atlantic was ringing with the protestations of the unwilling conscripts and the laments of their families then came like three claps of thunder in one sympathy for the women acquiescence in their rights and invitations to them everywhere to take part in the democratic caucuses and conventions most of the prominent women of the state were deluded for a time by this manifestation and acted with the party for the sake of the sex i had no idea however what the practical result of this movement would be until a few weeks before election i was calling upon mrs buckwalter and happened to express my belief that we republicans were going to carry the state again by a large majority i am very glad of it said she with an expression of great relief because then my vote will not be needed why i exclaimed you wont decline to vote surely worse than that she answered i am afraid i shall have to vote with the other side now as i knew her to be a good republican i could scarcely believe my ears she blushed i must admit when she saw my astonished face im so used to bridget you know she continued and good girls are so very hard to find nowadays she has as good as said that she wont stay a day later than election if i dont vote for her candidate and what am i to do do without i said shortly getting up in my indignation yes thats very well for you with your wonderful physique said mrs buckwalter quietly but think of me with my neuralgia and the pain in my back it would be a dreadful blow if i should lose bridget well what with torchlight processions and meetings on both sides burroak was in such a state of excitement when election came that most of the ladies of my acquaintance were almost afraid to go to the polls i tried to get them out during the first hours after sunrise when i went myself but in vain even that early i heard things that made me shudder those who came later went home resolved to give up their rights rather than undergo a second experience of rowdyism but it was a jubilee for the servant girls mrs buckwalter didnt gain much by her apostasy for bridget came home singing the wearing of the green and let fall a whole tray full of the best china before she could be got to bed burroak which the year before had a republican majority of three hundred now went for the democrats by more than five hundred the same party carried the state electing their governor by near twenty thousand the republicans would now have gladly repealed the bill giving us equal rights but they were in a minority and the democrats refused to cooperate mrs whiston who still remained loyal to our side collected information from all parts of the state from which it appeared that fourfifths of all the female citizens had voted the democratic ticket in new lisbon our great manufacturing city with its population of nearly one hundred thousand the party gained three thousand votes while the accessions to the republican ranks were only about four hundred mrs whiston barely escaped being defeated her majority was reduced from seven hundred to fortythree eleven democratic assemblywomen and four senatoresses were chosen however so that she had the consolation of knowing that her sex had gained although her party had lost she was still in good spirits it will all right itself in time she said you will readily guess after what i have related that i was not only not reelected to the legislature but that i was not even a candidate i could have born the outrageous attacks of the opposite party but the treatment i had received from my own constituents i shall always hate the word gave me a new revelation of the actual character of political life i have not mentioned half the worries and annoyances to which i was subjected the endless endless letters and applications for office or for my influence in some way the abuse and threats when i could not possibly do what was desired the exhibitions of selfishness and disregard of all great and noble principles and finally the shameless advances which were made by what men call the lobby to secure my vote for this that and the other thing why it fairly made my hair stand on end to hear the stories which the pleasant men whom i thought so grandly interested in schemes for the material development of the country told about each other mrs filchs shawl began to burn my shoulders before i had worn it a half a dozen times i have since given it to melissa as a weddingpresent before the next session was half over i was doubly glad of being safe at home mrs whiston supposed that the increased female representation would give her more support and indeed it seemed so at first but after her speech on the bounty bill only two of the fifteen democratic women would even speak to her and all hope of concord of action in the interests of women was at an end we read the debates and my blood fairly boiled when i found what taunts and sneers and epithets she was forced to endure i wondered how she could sit still under them to make her position worse the adjoining seat was occupied by an irishwoman who had been elected by the votes of the laborers on the new albemarle extension in the neighborhood of which she kept a grocery store nelly kirkpatrick was a great redhaired giant of a woman very illiterate but with some native wit and goodhearted enough i am told when she was in her right mind she always followed the lead of mr gorham whose name you see came before hers in the call and a look from him was generally sufficient to quiet her when she was inclined to be noisy when the resolutions declaring the war a failure were introduced the party excitement ran higher than ever the lunchroom as they called it i never went there but once the title having deceived me in the basementstory of the state house was crowded during the discussion and every time nelly kirkpatrick came up her face was a shade deeper red mr gorhams nods and winks were of no avail speak she would and speak she did not so very incoherently after all but very abusively to be sure you would never have guessed it if you had read the quiet and dignified report in the papers on her side the next day then mrs whistons patience broke down mr speaker she exclaimed starting to her feet i protest against this house being compelled to listen to such a tirade as has just been delivered are we to be disgraced before the world oh hoo disgraced is it yelled nelly kirkpatrick violently interrupting her and me as dacent a woman as ever she was or ever will be disgraced hey oh ill larn her what it is to blaggard her betters and before anybody could imagine what was coming she pounced upon mrs whiston with one jerk ripped off her skirt it was silk not serge this time seized her by the hair and gave her head such a twist backwards that the chignon not only came off in her hands but as her victim opened her mouth too widely in the struggle the springs of her false teeth were sprung the wrong way and the entire set flew out and rattled upon the floor of course there were cries of order order and the nearest members mr gorham among the first rushed in but the mischief was done mrs whiston had always urged upon our minds the necessity of not only being dressed according to the popular fashion but also as elegantly and becomingly as possible if we adopt the bloomers she said we shall never get our rights while the world stands where it is necessary to influence men we must be wholly and truly women not semisexed nondescripts we must employ every charm nature gives us and fashion adds not hide them under a forked extinguisher i give her very words to show you her way of looking at things well now imagine this elegant woman looking not a day over forty though she was but no i have no right to tell it imagine her i say with only her scanty natural hair hanging over her ears her mouth dreadfully fallen in her skirt torn off all in open day before the eyes of a hundred and fifty members and i am told they laughed immensely in spite of the scandal that it was and if you are human beings you will feel that she must have been wounded to the very heart there was a motion made to expel nelly kirkpatrick and perhaps it might have succeeded but the railroad hands all over the state made a heroine of her and her party was afraid of losing five or six thousand votes so only a mild censure was pronounced but there was no end to the caricatures and songs and all sorts of ribaldry about the occurrence and even our party said that although mrs whiston was really and truly a martyr yet the circumstance was an immense damage to them when she heard that i believe it killed her she resigned her seat went home never appeared again in public and died within a year my dear friend she wrote to me not a month before her death i have been trying all my life to get a thorough knowledge of the masculine nature but my womans plummet will not reach to the bottom of that chaotic pit of selfishness and principle expedience and firmness for the right brutality and tenderness gullibility and devilish shrewdness which i have tried to sound only one thing is clear we women cannot do without what we have sometimes alas sneered at as the chivelry of the sex the question of our rights is as clear to me as ever but we must find a plan to get them without being forced to share or even to see all that men do in their political lives we have only beheld some principle riding aloft not the mud through which her chariot wheels are dragged the ways must be swept before we can walk in them but how and by whom shall this be done for my part i cant say and i wish somebody would tell me well after seeing our state which we used to be proud of delivered over for two years to the control of a party whose policy was so repugnant to all our feelings of loyalty we endeavored to procure at least a qualification of intelligence for voters of course we didnt get it the exclusion from suffrage of all who were unable to read and write might have turned the scales again and given us the state after our boys came back from the war we might have succeeded but their votes were overbalanced by those of the servantgirls every one of whom turned out making a whole holiday of the election i thought last fall that my maria who is german would have voted with us i stayed at home and did the work myself on purpose that she might hear the oration of carl schurz but old hammer who keeps the lagerbeer saloon in the upper end of burroak gave a supper and a dance to all the german girls and their beaux after the meeting and so managed to secure nine out of ten of their votes for seymour maria proposed going away a week before election up into decatur county where she said some relations just arrived from bavaria had settled i was obliged to let her go or lose her altogether but i was comforted by the thought that if her vote were lost for grant at least it could not be given to seymour after the election was over and decatur county which we had always managed to carry hitherto went against us the whole matter was explained about five hundred girls we were informed had been colonized in private families as extra help for a fortnight and of course maria was one of them i have looked at the addresses of her letters ever since and not one has she sent to decatur a committee has been appointed and a report made on the election frauds in our state and we shall see i suppose whether any help comes of it now you mustnt think from all this that i am an apostate from the principle of womens rights no indeed all the trouble we have had as i think will be evident to the millions who read my words comes from the men they have not only made politics their monopoly but they have fashioned it into a tremendous elaborate system in which there is precious little of either principle or honesty we can and we must run the machine to use another of their vulgar expressions with them until we get a chance to knock off the useless wheels and thingumbobs and scour the whole concern inside and out perhaps the men themselves would like to do this if they only knew how men have so little talent for cleaningup but when it comes to making a litter theyre at home let me tell you meanwhile in our state things are about as bad as they can be the women are drawn for juries the same as ever but except in whittletown where they have a separate room no respectable woman goes and the fines come heavy on some of us the demoralization among our help is so bad that we are going to try cooperative housekeeping if that dont succeed i shall get brother samuel who lives in california to send me two chinamen one for cook and chamberboy and one as nurse for melissa i console myself with thinking that the end of it all must be good since the principle is right but dear me i had no idea that i should be called upon to go through such tribulation now the reason i write and i suppose i must hurry to the end or you will be out of all patience is to beg and insist and implore my sisters in other states to lose no more time but at once to coax or melt or threaten the men into accepting their claims we are now so isolated in our rights that we are obliged to bear more than our proper share of the burden when the states around us shall be so far advanced there will be a chance for new stateswomen to spring up and fill mrs whistons place and we shall then i firmly believe devise a plan to cleanse the great augean stable of politics by turning into it the river of female honesty and intelligence and morality but they must do this somehow or other without letting the river be tainted by the heaps of pestilent offal it must sweep away as lord bacon says in that play falsely attributed to shakespeare ay theres the rub if you were to ask me now what effect the right of suffrage office and all the duties of men has had upon the morals of the women of our state i should be puzzled what to say it is something like this if you put a chemical purifying agent into a bucket of muddy water the water gets clearer to be sure but the chemical substance takes up some of the impurity perhaps thats rather too strong a comparison but if you say that men are worse than women as most people do then of course we improve them by closer political intercourse and lose a little ourselves in the process i leave you to decide the relative loss and gain to tell you the truth this is a feature of the question which i would rather not discuss and i see by the reports of the recent conventions that all the champions of our sex feel the same way well since i must come to an end somewhere let it be here to quote lord bacon again take my round unvarnished tale and perhaps the world will yet acknowledge that some good has been done by yours truly jane strongitharm
