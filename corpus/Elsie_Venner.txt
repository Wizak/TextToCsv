 elsie venner by oliver wendell holmes preface this tale was published in successive parts in the atlantic monthly under the name of the professors story the first number having appeared in the third week of december the critic who is curious in coincidences must refer to the magazine for the date of publication of the chapter he is examining in calling this narrative a romance the author wishes to make sure of being indulged in the common privileges of the poetic license through all the disguise of fiction a grave scientific doctrine may be detected lying beneath some of the delineations of character he has used this doctrine as a part of the machinery of his story without pledging his absolute belief in it to the extent to which it is asserted or implied it was adopted as a convenient medium of truth rather than as an accepted scientific conclusion the reader must judge for himself what is the value of various stories cited from old authors he must decide how much of what has been told he can accept either as having actually happened or as possible and more or less probable the author must be permitted however to say here in his personal character and as responsible to the students of the human mind and body that since this story has been in progress he has received the most startling confirmation of the possibility of the existence of a character like that which he had drawn as a purely imaginary conception in elsie venner boston january a second preface this is the story which a dear old lady my very good friend spoke of as a medicated novel and quite properly refused to read i was always pleased with her discriminating criticism it is a medicated novel and if she wished to read for mere amusement and helpful recreation there was no need of troubling herself with a story written with a different end in view this story has called forth so many curious inquiries that it seems worth while to answer the more important questions which have occurred to its readers in the first place it is not based on any wellascertained physiological fact there are old fables about patients who have barked like dogs or crowed like cocks after being bitten or wounded by those animals there is nothing impossible in the idea that romulus and remus may have imbibed wolfish traits of character from the wet nurse the legend assigned them but the legend is not sound history and the supposition is nothing more than a speculative fancy still there is a limbo of curious evidence bearing on the subject of prenatal influences sufficient to form the startingpoint of an imaginative composition the real aim of the story was to test the doctrine of original sin and human responsibility for the disordered volition coming under that technical denomination was elsie venner poisoned by the venom of a crotalus before she was born morally responsible for the volitional aberrations which translated into acts become what is known as sin and it may be what is punished as crime if on presentation of the evidence she becomes by the verdict of the human conscience a proper object of divine pity and not of divine wrath as a subject of moral poisoning wherein lies the difference between her position at the bar of judgment human or divine and that of the unfortunate victim who received a moral poison from a remote ancestor before he drew his first breath it might be supposed that the character of elsie veneer was suggested by some of the fabulous personages of classical or mediaeval story i remember that a french critic spoke of her as cette pauvre melusine i ought to have been ashamed perhaps but i had not the slightest idea who melusina was until i hunted up the story and found that she was a fairy who for some offence was changed every saturday to a serpent from her waist downward i was of course familiar with keatss lamia another imaginary being the subject of magical transformation into a serpent my story was well advanced before hawthornes wonderful marble faun which might be thought to have furnished me with the hint of a mixed nature human with an alien element was published or known to me so that my poor heroine found her origin not in fable or romance but in a physiological conception fertilized by a theological dogma i had the dissatisfaction of enjoying from a quiet corner a wellmeant effort to dramatize elsie veneer unfortunately a physiological romance as i knew beforehand is hardly adapted for the melodramatic efforts of stage representation i can therefore say with perfect truth that i was not disappointed it is to the mind and not to the senses that such a story must appeal and all attempts to render the character and events objective on the stage or to make them real by artistic illustrations are almost of necessity failures the story has won the attention and enjoyed the favor of a limited class of readers and if it still continues to interest others of the same tastes and habits of thought i can ask nothing more of it january preface to the new edition i have nothing of importance to add to the two preceding prefaces the continued call for this story which was not written for popularity but with a very serious purpose has somewhat surprised and i need not add gratified me i can only restate the motive idea of the tale in a little different language believing as i do that our prevailing theologies are founded upon an utterly false view of the relation of man to his creator i attempted to illustrate the doctrine of inherited moral responsibility for other peoples misbehavior i tried to make out a case for my poor elsie whom the most hardened theologian would find it hard to blame for her inherited ophidian tastes and tendencies how then is he to blame mankind for inheriting sinfulness from their first parents may not the serpent have bitten eve before the birth of cain her firstborn that would have made an excuse for cains children as elsies antenatal misfortune made an excuse for her but what difference does it make in the childs responsibility whether his inherited tendencies come from a snakebite or some other source which he knew nothing about and could not have prevented from acting all this is plain enough and the only use of the story is to bring the dogma of inherited guilt and its consequences into a clearer point of view but after all the tale must have proved readable as a story to account for the large number of editions which it has reached some readers have been curious about the locality the writer was thought to have in view no particular place was intended some of the characters may have been thought to have been drawn from life but the personages mentioned are mostly composites like mr galtons compound photographic likenesses and are not calculated to provoke scandal or suits for libel o w h beverly farms mass august elsie venner chapter i the brahmin caste of new england there is nothing in new england corresponding at all to the feudal aristocracies of the old world whether it be owing to the stock from which we were derived or to the practical working of our institutions or to the abrogation of the technical law of honor which draws a sharp line between the personally responsible class of gentlemen and the unnamed multitude of those who are not expected to risk their lives for an abstraction whatever be the cause we have no such aristocracy here as that which grew up out of the military systems of the middle ages what we mean by aristocracy is merely the richer part of the community that live in the tallest houses drive real carriages not kerridges kidglove their hands and frenchbonnet their ladies heads give parties where the persons who call them by the above title are not invited and have a provokingly easy way of dressing walking talking and nodding to people as if they felt entirely at home and would not be embarrassed in the least if they met the governor or even the president of the united states face to face some of these great folks are really wellbred some of them are only purseproud and assuming but they form a class and are named as above in the common speech it is in the nature of large fortunes to diminish rapidly when subdivided and distributed a million is the unit of wealth now and here in america it splits into four handsome properties each of these into four good inheritances these again into scanty competences for four ancient maidens with whom it is best the family should die out unless it can begin again as its greatgrandfather did now a million is a kind of golden cheese which represents in a compendious form the summers growth of a fat meadow of craft or commerce and as this kind of meadow rarely bears more than one crop it is pretty certain that sons and grandsons will not get another golden cheese out of it whether they milk the same cows or turn in new ones in other words the millionocracy considered in a large way is not at all an affair of persons and families but a perpetual fact of money with a variable human element which a philosopher might leave out of consideration without falling into serious error of course this trivial and fugitive fact of personal wealth does not create a permanent class unless some special means are taken to arrest the process of disintegration in the third generation this is so rarely done at least successfully that one need not live a very long life to see most of the rich families he knew in childhood more or less reduced and the millions shifted into the hands of the countryboys who were sweeping stores and carrying parcels when the now decayed gentry were driving their chariots eating their venison over silver chafingdishes drinking madeira chilled in embossed coolers wearing their hair in powder and casing their legs in long boots with silken tassels there is however in new england an aristocracy if you choose to call it so which has a far greater character of permanence it has grown to be a caste not in any odious sense but by the repetition of the same influences generation after generation it has acquired a distinct organization and physiognomy which not to recognize is mere stupidity and not to be willing to describe would show a distrust of the goodnature and intelligence of our readers who like to have us see all we can and tell all we see if you will look carefully at any class of students in one of our colleges you will have no difficulty in selecting specimens of two different aspects of youthful manhood of course i shall choose extreme cases to illustrate the contrast between them in the first the figure is perhaps robust but often otherwise inelegant partly from careless attitudes partly from illdressing the face is uncouth in feature or at least common the mouth coarse and unformed the eye unsympathetic even if bright the movements of the face are clumsy like those of the limbs the voice is unmusical and the enunciation as if the words were coarse castings instead of fine carvings the youth of the other aspect is commonly slender his face is smooth and apt to be pallid his features are regular and of a certain delicacy his eye is bright and quick his lips play over the thought he utters as a pianists fingers dance over their music and his whole air though it may be timid and even awkward has nothing clownish if you are a teacher you know what to expect from each of these young men with equal willingness the first will be slow at learning the second will take to his books as a pointer or a setter to his fieldwork the first youth is the common countryboy whose race has been bred to bodily labor nature has adapted the family organization to the kind of life it has lived the hands and feet by constant use have got more than their share of development the organs of thought and expression less than their share the finer instincts are latent and must be developed a youth of this kind is raw material in its first stage of elaboration you must not expect too much of any such many of them have force of will and character and become distinguished in practical life but very few of them ever become great scholars a scholar is in a large proportion of cases the son of scholars or scholarly persons that is exactly what the other young man is he comes of the brahmin caste of new england this is the harmless inoffensive untitled aristocracy referred to and which many readers will at once acknowledge there are races of scholars among us in which aptitude for learning and all these marks of it i have spoken of are congenital and hereditary their names are always on some college catalogue or other they break out every generation or two in some learned labor which calls them up after they seem to have died out at last some newer name takes their place it maybe but you inquire a little and you find it is the blood of the edwardses or the chauncys or the ellerys or some of the old historic scholars disguised under the altered name of a female descendant there probably is not an experienced instructor anywhere in our northern states who will not recognize at once the truth of this general distinction but the reader who has never been a teacher will very probably object that some of our most illustrious public men have come direct from the homespunclad class of the people and he may perhaps even find a noted scholar or two whose parents were masters of the english alphabet but of no other it is not fair to pit a few chosen families against the great multitude of those who are continually working their way up into the intellectual classes the results which are habitually reached by hereditary training are occasionally brought about without it there are natural filters as well as artificial ones and though the great rivers are commonly more or less turbid if you will look long enough you may find a spring that sparkles as no water does which drips through your apparatus of sands and sponges so there are families which refine themselves into intellectual aptitude without having had much opportunity for intellectual acquirements a series of felicitous crosses develops an improved strain of blood and reaches its maximum perfection at last in the large uncombed youth who goes to college and startles the hereditary classleaders by striding past them all that is natures republicanism thank god for it but do not let it make you illogical the race of the hereditary scholar has exchanged a certain portion of its animal vigor for its new instincts and it is hard to lead men without a good deal of animal vigor the scholar who comes by natures special grace from an unworn stock of broadchested sires and deepbosomed mothers must always overmatch an equal intelligence with a compromised and lowered vitality a mans breathing and digestive apparatus one is tempted to add muscular are just as important to him on the floor of the senate as his thinking organs you broke down in your great speech did you yes your grandfather had an attack of dyspepsia in after working too hard on his famous election sermon all this does not touch the main fact our scholars come chiefly from a privileged order just as our best fruits come from wellknown grafts though now and then a seedling apple like the northern spy or a seedling pear like the seckel springs from a nameless ancestry and grows to be the pride of all the gardens in the land let me introduce you to a young man who belongs to the brahmin caste of new england chapter ii the student and his certificate bernard c langdon a young man attending medical lectures at the school connected with one of our principal colleges remained after the lecture one day and wished to speak with the professor he was a student of mark first favorite of his year as they say of the derby colts there are in every class half a dozen bright faces to which the teacher naturally directs his discourse and by the intermediation of whose attention he seems to hold that of the mass of listeners among these some one is pretty sure to take the lead by virtue of a personal magnetism or some peculiarity of expression which places the face in quick sympathetic relations with the lecturer this was a young man with such a face and i found for you have guessed that i was the professor abovementioned that when there was anything difficult to be explained or when i was bringing out some favorite illustration of a nice point as for instance when i compared the cellgrowth by which nature builds up a plant or an animal to the glassblowers similar mode of beginning always with a hollow sphere or vesicle whatever he is going to make i naturally looked in his face and gauged my success by its expression it was a handsome face a little too pale perhaps and would have borne something more of fulness without becoming heavy i put the organization to which it belongs in section b of class of my angloamerican anthropology unpublished the jaw in this section is but slightly narrowed just enough to make the width of the forehead tell more decidedly the moustache often grows vigorously but the whiskers are thin the skin is like that of jacob rather than like esaus one string of the animal nature has been taken away but this gives only a greater predominance to the intellectual chords to see just how the vital energy has been toned down you must contrast one of this section with a specimen of section a of the same class say for instance one of the oldfashioned fullwhiskered redfaced roaring big commodores of the last generation whom you remember at least by their portraits in ruffled shirts looking as hearty as butchers and as plucky as bullterriers with their hair combed straight up from their foreheads which were not commonly very high or broad the special form of physical life i have been describing gives you a right to expect more delicate perceptions and a more reflective nature than you commonly find in shaggythroated men clad in heavy suits of muscles the student lingered in the lectureroom looking all the time as if he wanted to say something in private and waiting for two or three others who were still hanging about to be gone something is wrong i said to myself when i noticed his expression well mr langdon i said to him when we were alone can i do anything for you today you can sir he said i am going to leave the class for the present and keep school why that s a pity and you so near graduating youd better stay and finish this course and take your degree in the spring rather than break up your whole plan of study i cant help myself sir the young man answered there s trouble at home and they cannot keep me here as they have done so i must look out for myself for a while its what ive done before and am ready to do again i came to ask you for a certificate of my fitness to teach a common school or a high school if you think i am up to that are you willing to give it to me willing yes to be sure but i dont want you to go stay well make it easy for you theres a fund will do something for you perhaps then you can take both the annual prizes if you like and claim them in money if you want that more than medals i have thought it all over he answered and have pretty much made up my mind to go a perfectly gentlemanly young man of courteous address and mild utterance but means at least as much as he says there are some people whose rhetoric consists of a slight habitual understatement i often tell mrs professor that one of her i think its sos is worth the bibleoath of all the rest of the household that they know its so when you find a person a little better than his word a little more liberal than his promise a little more than borne out in his statement by his facts a little larger in deed than in speech you recognize a kind of eloquence in that persons utterance not laid down in blair or campbell this was a proud fellow selftrusting sensitive with familyrecollections that made him unwilling to accept the kind of aid which many students would have thankfully welcomed i knew him too well to urge him after the few words which implied that he was determined to go besides i have great confidence in young men who believe in themselves and are accustomed to rely on their own resources from an early period when a resolute young fellow steps up to the great bully the world and takes him boldly by the beard he is often surprised to find it come off in his hand and that it was only tied on to scare away timid adventurers i have seen young men more than once who came to a great city without a single friend support themselves and pay for their education lay up money in a few years grow rich enough to travel and establish themselves in life without ever asking a dollar of any person which they had not earned but these are exceptional cases there are horsetamers born so as we all know there are womantamers who bewitch the sex as the pied piper bedeviled the children of hamelin and there are worldtamers who can make any community even a yankee one get down and let them jump on its back as easily as mr rarey saddled cruiser whether langdon was of this sort or not i could not say positively but he had spirit and as i have said a familypride which would not let him be dependent the new england brahmin caste often gets blended with connections of political influence or commercial distinction it is a charming thing for the scholar when his fortune carries him in this way into some of the old families who have fine old houses and citylots that have risen in the market and names written in all the stockbooks of all the dividendpaying companies his narrow study expands into a stately library his books are counted by thousands instead of hundreds and his favorites are dressed in gilded calf in place of plebeian sheepskin or its pauper substitutes of cloth and paper the reverend jedediah langdon grandfather of our young gentleman had made an advantageous alliance of this kind miss dorothea wentworth had read one of his sermons which had been printed by request and became deeply interested in the young author whom she had never seen out of this circumstance grew a correspondence an interview a declaration a matrimonial alliance and a family of half a dozen children wentworth langdon esquire was the oldest of these and lived in the old familymansion unfortunately that principle of the diminution of estates by division to which i have referred rendered it somewhat difficult to maintain the establishment upon the fractional income which the proprietor received from his share of the property wentworth langdon esq represented a certain intermediate condition of life not at all infrequent in our old families he was the connecting link between the generation which lived in ease and even a kind of state upon its own resources and the new brood which must live mainly by its wits or industry and make itself rich or shabbily subside into that lower stratum known to social geologists by a deposit of kidderminster carpets and the peculiar aspect of the fossils constituting the family furniture and wardrobe this slackwater period of a race which comes before the rapid ebb of its prosperity is familiar to all who live in cities there are no more quiet inoffensive people than these children of rich families just above the necessity of active employment yet not in a condition to place their own children advantageously if they happen to have families many of them are content to live unmarried some mend their broken fortunes by prudent alliances and some leave a numerous progeny to pass into the obscurity from which their ancestors emerged so that you may see on handcarts and cobblers stalls names which a few generations back were upon parchments with broad seals and tombstones with armorial bearings in a large city this class of citizens is familiar to us in the streets they are very courteous in their salutations they have time enough to bow and take their hats off which of course no businessman can afford to do their beavers are smoothly brushed and their boots well polished all their appointments are tidy they look the respectable walking gentleman to perfection they are prone to habits they frequent readingrooms insuranceoffices they walk the same streets at the same hours so that one becomes familiar with their faces and persons as a part of the streetfurniture there is one curious circumstance that all citypeople must have noticed which is often illustrated in our experience of the slackwater gentry we shall know a certain person by his looks familiarly for years but never have learned his name about this person we shall have accumulated no little circumstantial knowledge thus his face figure gait his mode of dressing of saluting perhaps even of speaking may be familiar to us yet who he is we know not in another department of our consciousness there is a very familiar name which we have never found the person to match we have heard it so often that it has idealized itself and become one of that multitude of permanent shapes which walk the chambers of the brain in velvet slippers in the company of falstaff and hamlet and general washington and mr pickwick sometimes the person dies but the name lives on indefinitely but now and then it happens perhaps after years of this independent existence of the name and its shadowy image in the brain on the one part and the person and all its real attributes as we see them daily on the other that some accident reveals their relation and we find the name we have carried so long in our memory belongs to the person we have known so long as a fellowcitizen now the slack water gentry are among the persons most likely to be the subjects of this curious divorce of title and reality for the reason that playing no important part in the community there is nothing to tie the floating name to the actual individual as is the case with the men who belong in any way to the public while yet their names have a certain historical currency and we cannot help meeting them either in their haunts or going to and from them to this class belonged wentworth langdon esq he had been deadheaded into the world some fifty years ago and had sat with his hands in his pockets staring at the show ever since i shall not tell you for reasons before hinted the whole name of the place in which he lived i will only point you in the right direction by saying that there are three towns lying in a line with each other as you go down east each of them with a port in its name and each of them having a peculiar interest which gives it individuality in addition to the oriental character they have in common i need not tell you that these towns are newburyport portsmouth and portland the oriental character they have in common consists in their large square palatial mansions with sunny gardens round them the two first have seen better days they are in perfect harmony with the condition of weakened but not impoverished gentility each of them is a paradise of demifortunes each of them is of that intermediate size between a village and a city which any place has outgrown when the presence of a welldressed stranger walking up and down the main street ceases to be a matter of public curiosity and private speculation as frequently happens during the busier months of the year in considerable commercial centres like salem they both have grand old recollections to fall back upon times when they looked forward to commercial greatness and when the portly gentlemen in cocked hats who built their now decaying wharves and sent out their ships all over the world dreamed that their fastgrowing port was to be the tyre or the carthage of the rich british colony great houses like that once lived in by lord timothy dexter in newburyport remain as evidence of the fortunes amassed in these places of old other mansions like the rockingham house in portsmouth look at the white horses tail before you mount the broad staircase show that there was not only wealth but style and state in these quiet old towns during the last century it is not with any thought of pity or depreciation that we speak of them as in a certain sense decayed towns they did not fulfil their early promise of expansion but they remain incomparably the most interesting places of their size in any of the three northernmost new england states they have even now prosperity enough to keep them in good condition and offer the most attractive residences for quiet families which if they had been english would have lived in a palazzo at genoa or pisa or some other continental newburyport or portsmouth as for the last of the three ports or portland it is getting too prosperous to be as attractive as its less northerly neighbors meant for a fine old town to ripen like a cheshire cheese within its walls of ancient rind burrowed by crooked alleys and mottled with venerable mould it seems likely to sacrifice its mellow future to a vulgar material prosperity still it remains invested with many of its old charms as yet and will forfeit its place among this admirable trio only when it gets a hotel with unequivocal marks of having been built and organized in the present century it was one of the old square palaces of the north in which bernard langdon the son of wentworth was born if he had had the luck to be an only child he might have lived as his father had done letting his meagre competence smoulder on almost without consuming like the fuel in an airtight stove but after master bernard came miss dorothea elizabeth wentworth langdon and then master william pepperell langdon and others equally well named a string of them looking when they stood in a row in prayertime as if they would fit a set of pandean pipes of from three feet upward in dimensions the door of the airtight stove has to be opened under such circumstances you may well suppose so it happened that our young man had been obliged from an early period to do something to support himself and found himself stopped short in his studies by the inability of the good people at home to furnish him the present means of support as a student you will understand now why the young man wanted me to give him a certificate of his fitness to teach and why i did not choose to urge him to accept the aid which a meek countryboy from a family without anterevolutionary recollections would have thankfully received go he must that was plain enough he would not be content otherwise he was not however to give up his studies and as it is customary to allow halftime to students engaged in schoolkeeping that is to count a year so employed if the student also keep on with his professional studies as equal to six months of the three years he is expected to be under an instructor before applying for his degree he would not necessarily lose more than a few months of time he had a small library of professional books which he could take with him so he left my teaching and that of my estimable colleagues carrying with him my certificate that mr bernard c langdon was a young gentleman of excellent moral character of high intelligence and good education and that his services would be of great value in any school academy or other institution where young persons ofeither sex were to be instructed i confess that expression either sex ran a little thick as i may say from my pen for although the young man bore a very fair character and there was no special cause for doubting his discretion i considered him altogether too goodlooking in the first place to be let loose in a roomful of young girls i didnt want him to fall in love just then and if half a dozen girls fell in love with him as they most assuredly would if brought into too near relations with him why there was no telling what gratitude and natural sensibility might bring about certificates are for the most part like ostricheggs the giver never knows what is hatched out of them but once in a thousand times they act as curses are said to come home to roost give them often enough until it gets to be a mechanical business and some day or other you will get caught warranting somebodys ice not to melt in any climate or somebodys razors to be safe in the hands of the youngest children i had an uneasy feeling after giving this certificate it might be all right enough but if it happened to end badly i should always reproach myself there was a chance certainly that it would lead him or others into danger or wretchedness any one who looked at this young man could not fail to see that he was capable of fascinating and being fascinated those large dark eyes of his would sink into the white soul of a young girl as the black cloth sunk into the snow in franklins famous experiment or on the other hand if the rays of a passionate nature should ever be concentrated on them they would be absorbed into the very depths of his nature and then his blood would turn to flame and burn his life out of him until his cheeks grew as white as the ashes that cover a burning coal i wish i had not said either sex in my certificate an academy for young gentlemen now that sounds cool and unimaginative a boys school that would be a very good place for him some of them are pretty rough but there is nerve enough in that old wentworth strain of blood he can give any country fellow of the common stock twenty pounds and hit him out of time in ten minutes but to send such a young fellow as that out a girlsnesting to give this falcon a free pass into all the dovecotes i was a fool thats all i brooded over the mischief which might come out of these two words until it seemed to me that they were charged with destiny i could hardly sleep for thinking what a train i might have been laying which might take a spark any day and blow up nobody knows whose peace or prospects what i dreaded most was one of those miserable matrimonial misalliances where a young fellow who does not know himself as yet flings his magnificent future into the checked apronlap of some freshfaced halfbred countrygirl no more fit to be mated with him than her fathers horse to go in double harness with flora temple to think of the eagles wings being clipped so that he shall never lift himself over the farmyard fence such things happen and always must because as one of us said awhile ago a man always loves a woman and a woman a man unless some good reason exists to the contrary you think yourself a very fastidious young man my friend but there are probably at least fivethousand young women in these united states any one of whom you would certainly marry if you were thrown much into her company and nobody more attractive were near and she had no objection and you my dear young lady justly pride yourself on your discerning delicacy but if i should say that there are twenty thousand young men any one of whom if he offered his hand and heart under favorable circumstances you would first endure then pity then embrace i should be much more imprudent than i mean to be and you would no doubt throw down a story in which i hope to interest you i had settled it in my mind that this young fellow had a career marked out for him he should begin in the natural way by taking care of poor patients in one of the public charities and work his way up to a better kind of practice better that is in the vulgar worldly sense the great and good boerhaave used to say as i remember very well that the poor were his best patients for god was their paymaster but everybody is not as patient as boerhaave nor as deserving so that the rich though not perhaps the best patients are good enough for common practitioners i suppose boerhaave put up with them when he could not get poor ones as he left his daughter two millions of florins when he died now if this young man once got into the wide streets he would sweep them clear of his rivals of the same standing and as i was getting indifferent to business and old dr kilham was growing careless and had once or twice prescribed morphine when he meant quinine there would soon be an opening into the doctors paradise the streets with only one side to them then i would have him strike a bold stroke set up a nice little coach and be driven round like a firstclass london doctor instead of coasting about in a shabby onehorse concern and casting anchor opposite his patients doors like a cape ann fishingsmack by the time he was thirty he would have knocked the social pawns out of his way and be ready to challenge a wife from the row of great pieces in the background i would not have a man marry above his level so as to become the appendage of a powerful familyconnection but i would not have him marry until he knew his level that is again looking at the matter in a purely worldly point of view and not taking the sentiments at all into consideration but remember that a young man using large endowments wisely and fortunately may put himself on a level with the highest in the land in ten brilliant years of spirited unflagging labor and to stand at the very top of your calling in a great city is something in itself that is if you like money and influence and a seat on the platform at public lectures and gratuitous tickets to all sorts of places where you dont want to go and what is a good deal better than any of these things a sense of power limited it may be but absolute in its range so that all the caesars and napoleons would have to stand aside if they came between you and the exercise of your special vocation that is what i thought this young fellow might have come to and now i have let him go off into the country with my certificate that he is fit to teach in a school for either sex ten to one he will run like a moth into a candle right into one of those girlsnests and get tangled up in some sentimental folly or other and there will be the end of him oh yes country doctor half a dollar a visit drive drive drive all day get up at night and harness your own horse drive again ten miles in a snowstorm shake powders out of two phials pulv glycyrrhiz pulv gum acac as partes equates drive back again if you dont happen to get stuck in a drift no home no peace no continuous meals no unbroken sleep no sunday no holiday no social intercourse but one eternal jog jog jog in a sulky until you feel like the mummy of an indian who had been buried in the sitting posture and was dug up a hundred years afterwards why did nt i warn him about love and all that nonsense why didnt i tell him he had nothing to do with it yet awhile why did nt i hold up to him those awful examples i could have cited where poor young fellows who could just keep themselves afloat have hung a matrimonial millstone round their necks taking it for a lifepreserver all this of two words in a certificate chapter iii mr bernard tries his hand whether the student advertised for a school or whether he fell in with the advertisement of a schoolcommittee is not certain at any rate it was not long before he found himself the head of a large district or as it was called by the inhabitants deestric school in the flourishing inland village of pequawkett or as it is commonly spelt pigwacket centre the natives of this place would be surprised if they should hear that any of the readers of a work published in boston were unacquainted with so remarkable a locality as however some copies of it may be read at a distance from this distinguished metropolis it may be well to give a few particulars respecting the place taken from the universal gazetteer pigwacket sometimes spelt pequawkett a postvillage and township in co state of situated in a fine agricultural region thriving villages pigwacket centre and smithville churches several school houses and many handsome private residences mink river runs through the town navigable for small boats after heavy rains muddy pond at n e section well stocked with horn pouts eels and shiners products beef pork butter cheese manufactures shoepegs clothespins and tinware pop the reader may think there is nothing very remarkable implied in this description if however he had read the townhistory by the rev jabez grubb he would have learned that like the celebrated little pedlington it was distinguished by many very remarkable advantages thus the situation of pigwacket is eminently beautiful looking down the lovely valley of mink river a tributary of the musquash the air is salubrious and many of the inhabitants have attained great age several having passed the allotted period of threescore years and ten before succumbing to any of the various ills that flesh is heir to widow comfort leevins died in aet lxxxvii years venus an african died in supposed to be c years old the people are distinguished for intelligence as has been frequently remarked by eminent lyceumlecturers who have invariably spoken in the highest terms of a pigwacket audience there is a public library containing nearly a hundred volumes free to all subscribers the preached word is well attended there is a flourishing temperance society and the schools are excellent it is a residence admirably adapted to refined families who relish the beauties of nature and the charms of society the honorable john smith formerly a member of the state senate was a native of this town that is the way they all talk after all it is probably pretty much like other inland new england towns in point of salubrity that is gives people their choice of dysentery or fever every autumn with a seasonticket for consumption good all the year round and so of the other pretences pigwacket audience forsooth was there ever an audience anywhere though there wasnt a pair of eyes in it brighter than pickled oysters that did nt think it was distinguished for intelligence the preached word that means the rev jabez grubbs sermons temperance society excellent schools ah that is just what we were talking about the truth was that district no pigwacket centre had had a good deal of trouble of late with its schoolmasters the committee had done their best but there were a number of wellgrown and pretty rough young fellows who had got the upperhand of the masters and meant to keep it two dynasties had fallen before the uprising of this fierce democracy this was a thing that used to be not very uncommon but in so intelligent a community as that of pigwacket centre in an era of public libraries and lyceumlectures it was portentous and alarming the rebellion began under the ferule of master weeks a slender youth from a country college underfed thinblooded slopingshouldered knockkneed straighthaired weakbearded paleeyed widepupilled halfcolored a common type enough in indoor races not rich enough to pick and choose in their alliances nature kills off a good many of this sort in the first teethingtime a few in later childhood a good many again in early adolescence but every now and then one runs the gauntlet of her various diseases or rather forms of one disease and grows up as master weeks had done it was a very foolish thing for him to try to inflict personal punishment on such a lusty young fellow as abner briggs junior one of the hardest customers in the way of a roughandtumble fight that there were anywhere round no doubt he had been insolent but it would have been better to overlook it it pains me to report the events which took place when the master made his rash attempt to maintain his authority abner briggs junior was a great hulking fellow who had been bred to butchering but urged by his parents to attend school in order to learn the elegant accomplishments of reading and writing in which he was sadly deficient he was in the habit of talking and laughing pretty loud in schoolhours of throwing wads of paper reduced to a pulp by a natural and easy process of occasional insolence and general negligence one of the soft but unpleasant missiles just alluded to flew by the masters head one morning and flattened itself against the wall where it adhered in the form of a convex mass in alto rilievo the master looked round and saw the young butchers arm in an attitude which pointed to it unequivocally as the source from which the projectile had taken its flight master weeks turned pale he must lick abner briggs junior or abdicate so he determined to lick abner briggs junior come here sir he said you have insulted me and outraged the decency of the schoolroom often enough hold out your hand the young fellow grinned and held it out the master struck at it with his black ruler with a will in the blow and a snapping of the eyes as much as to say that he meant to make him smart this time the young fellow pulled his hand back as the ruler came down and the master hit himself a vicious blow with it on the right knee there are things no man can stand the master caught the refractory youth by the collar and began shaking him or rather shaking himself against him le go o that are coat naow said the fellow or i ll make ye t ll take tew on yet handle me i tell ye n then ye caant dew it and the young pupil returned the masters attention by catching hold of his collar when it comes to that the best man not exactly in the moral sense but rather in the material and more especially the muscular point of view is very apt to have the best of it irrespectively of the merits of the case so it happened now the unfortunate schoolmaster found himself taking the measure of the sanded floor amidst the general uproar of the school from that moment his ferule was broken and the schoolcommittee very soon had a vacancy to fill master pigeon the successor of master weeks was of better stature but loosely put together and slenderlimbed a dreadfully nervous kind of man he was walked on tiptoe started at sudden noises was distressed when he heard a whisper had a quick suspicious look and was always saying hush and putting his hands to his ears the boys were not long in finding out this nervous weakness of course in less than a week a regular system of torments was inaugurated full of the most diabolical malice and ingenuity the exercises of the conspirators varied from day to day but consisted mainly of footscraping solos on the slatepencil making it screech on the slate falling of heavy books attacks of coughing banging of desklids bootcreaking with sounds as of drawing a cork from time to time followed by suppressed chuckles master pigeon grew worse and worse under these inflictions the rascally boys always had an excuse for any one trick they were caught at could n help coughin sir slipped out o m han sir did n go to sir did n dewt o purpose sir and so on always the best of reasons for the most outrageous of behavior the master weighed himself at the grocers on a platform balance some ten days after he began keeping the school at the end of a week he weighed himself again he had lost two pounds at the end of another week he had lost five he made a little calculation based on these data from which he learned that in a certain number of months going on at this rate he should come to weigh precisely nothing at all and as this was a sum in subtraction he did not care to work out in practice master pigeon took to himself wings and left the schoolcommittee in possession of a letter of resignation and a vacant place to fill once more this was the school to which mr bernard langdon found himself appointed as master he accepted the place conditionally with the understanding that he should leave it at the end of a month if he were tired of it the advent of master langdon to pigwacket centre created a much more lively sensation than had attended that of either of his predecessors looks go a good way all the world over and though there were several goodlooking people in the place and major bush was what the natives of the town called a hahnsome mahn that is big fat and red yet the sight of a really elegant young fellow with the natural air which grows up with carefullybred young persons was a novelty the brahmin blood which came from his grandfather as well as from his mother a direct descendant of the old flynt family well known by the famous tutor henry flynt see cat harv anno had been enlivened and enriched by that of the wentworths which had had a good deal of ripe old madeira and other generous elements mingled with it so that it ran to gout sometimes in the old folks and to high spirit warm complexion and curly hair in some of the younger ones the soft curling hair mr bernard had inherited something perhaps of the high spirit but that we shall have a chance of finding out by and by but the long sermons and the frugal board of his brahmin ancestry with his own habits of study had told upon his color which was subdued to something more of delicacy than one would care to see in a young fellow with rough work before him this however made him look more interesting or as the young ladies at major bushs said interestin when mr bernard showed himself at meeting on the first sunday after his arrival it may be supposed that a good many eyes were turned upon the young schoolmaster there was something heroic in his coming forward so readily to take a place which called for a strong hand and a prompt steady will to guide it in fact his position was that of a military chieftain on the eve of a battle everybody knew everything in pigwacket centre and it was an understood thing that the young rebels meant to put down the new master if they could it was natural that the two prettiest girls in the village called in the local dialect as nearly as our limited alphabet will represent it alminy cutterr and arvilly braowne should feel and express an interest in the goodlooking stranger and that when their flattering comments were repeated in the hearing of their indigenous admirers among whom were some of the older boys of the school it should not add to the amiable dispositions of the turbulent youth monday came and the new schoolmaster was in his chair at the upper end of the schoolhouse on the raised platform the rustics looked at his handsome face thoughtful peaceful pleasant cheerful but sharply cut round the lips and proudly lighted about the eyes the ringleader of the mischiefmakers the young butcher who has before figured in this narrative looked at him stealthily whenever he got a chance to study him unobserved for the truth was he felt uncomfortable whenever he found the large dark eyes fixed on his own little sharp deepset gray ones but he managed to study him pretty well first his face then his neck and shoulders the set of his arms the narrowing at the loins the make of his legs and the way he moved in short he examined him as he would have examined a steer to see what he could do and how he would cut up if he could only have gone to him and felt of his muscles he would have been entirely satisfied he was not a very wise youth but he did know well enough that though big arms and legs are very good things there is something besides size that goes to make a man and he had heard stories of a fightingman called the spider from his attenuated proportions who was yet a terrible hitter in the ring and had whipped many a biglimbed fellow in and out of the roped arena nothing could be smoother than the way in which everything went on for the first day or two the new master was so kind and courteous he seemed to take everything in such a natural easy way that there was no chance to pick a quarrel with him he in the mean time thought it best to watch the boys and young men for a day or two with as little show of authority as possible it was easy enough to see that he would have occasion for it before long the schoolhouse was a grim old red onestory building perched on a bare rock at the top of a hill partly because this was a conspicuous site for the temple of learning and partly because land is cheap where there is no chance even for rye or buckwheat and the very sheep find nothing to nibble about the little porch were carved initials and dates at various heights from the stature of nine to that of eighteen inside were old unpainted desks unpainted but browned with the umber of human contact and hacked by innumerable jackknives it was long since the walls had been whitewashed as might be conjectured by the various traces left upon them wherever idle hands or sleepy heads could reach them a curious appearance was noticeable on various higher parts of the wall namely a wartlike eruption as one would be tempted to call it being in reality a crop of the soft missiles before mentioned which adhering in considerable numbers and hardening after the usual fashion of papiermache formed at last permanent ornaments of the edifice the young masters quick eye soon noticed that a particular part of the wall was most favored with these ornamental appendages their position pointed sufficiently clearly to the part of the room they came from in fact there was a nest of young mutineers just there which must be broken up by a coup detat this was easily effected by redistributing the seats and arranging the scholars according to classes so that a mischievous fellow charged full of the rebellious imponderable should find himself between two nonconductors in the shape of small boys of studious habits it was managed quietly enough in such a plausible sort of way that its motive was not thought of but its effects were soon felt and then began a system of correspondence by signs and the throwing of little scrawls done up in pellets and announced by preliminary ahms to call the attention of the distant youth addressed some of these were incendiary documents devoting the schoolmaster to the lower divinities as a stuckup dandy as a purseproud aristocrat as a sight too big for his etc and holding him up in a variety of equally forcible phrases to the indignation of the youthful community of school district no pigwacket centre presently the draughtsman of the school set a caricature in circulation labelled to prevent mistakes with the schoolmasters name an immense bellcrowned hat and a long pointed swallowtailed coat showed that the artist had in his mind the conventional dandy as shown in prints of thirty or forty years ago rather than any actual human aspect of the time but it was passed round among the boys and made its laugh helping of course to undermine the masters authority as punch or the charivari takes the dignity out of an obnoxious minister one morning on going to the schoolroom master langdon found an enlarged copy of this sketch with its label pinned on the door he took it down smiled a little put it into his pocket and entered the schoolroom an insidious silence prevailed which looked as if some plot were brewing the boys were ripe for mischief but afraid they had really no fault to find with the master except that he was dressed like a gentleman which a certain class of fellows always consider a personal insult to themselves but the older ones were evidently plotting and more than once the warning ahm was heard and a dirty little scrap of paper rolled into a wad shot from one seat to another one of these happened to strike the stovefunnel and lodged on the masters desk he was cool enough not to seem to notice it he secured it however and found an opportunity to look at it without being observed by the boys it required no immediate notice he who should have enjoyed the privilege of looking upon mr bernard langdon the next morning when his toilet was about half finished would have had a very pleasant gratuitous exhibition first he buckled the strap of his trousers pretty tightly then he took up a pair of heavy dumbbells and swung them for a few minutes then two great indian clubs with which he enacted all sorts of impossiblelooking feats his limbs were not very large nor his shoulders remarkably broad but if you knew as much of the muscles as all persons who look at statues and pictures with a critical eye ought to have learned if you knew the trapezius lying diamondshaped over the back and shoulders like a monks cowl or the deltoid which caps the shoulder like an epaulette or the triceps which furnishes the calf of the upper arm or the hardknotted biceps any of the great sculptural landmarks in fact you would have said there was a pretty show of them beneath the white satiny skin of mr bernard langdon and if you had seen him when he had laid down the indian clubs catch hold of a leather strap that hung from the beam of the oldfashioned ceiling and lift and lower himself over and over again by his left hand alone you might have thought it a very simple and easy thing to do until you tried to do it yourself mr bernard looked at himself with the eye of an expert pretty well he said not so much fallen off as i expected then he set up his bolster in a very knowing sort of way and delivered two or three blows straight as rulers and swift as winks that will do he said then as if determined to make a certainty of his condition he took a dynamometer from one of the drawers in his old veneered bureau first he squeezed it with his two hands then he placed it on the floor and lifted steadily strongly the springs creaked and cracked the index swept with a great stride far up into the high figures of the scale it was a good lift he was satisfied he sat down on the edge of his bed and looked at his cleanlyshaped arms if i strike one of those boobies i am afraid i shall spoil him he said yet this young man when weighed with his class at the college could barely turn one hundred and fortytwo pounds in the scale not a heavy weight surely but some of the middle weights as the present english champion for instance seem to be of a far finer quality of muscle than the bulkier fellows the master took his breakfast with a good appetite that morning but was perhaps rather more quiet than usual after breakfast he went upstairs and put on a light loose frock instead of that which he commonly wore which was a closefitting and rather stylish one on his way to school he met alminy cutterr who happened to be walking in the other direction goodmorning miss cutter he said for she and another young lady had been introduced to him on a former occasion in the usual phrase of polite society in presenting ladies to gentlemen mr langdon let me make y acquainted with miss cutterr let me make y acquainted with miss braowne so he said goodmorning to which she replied goodmornin mr langdon haows your haalth the answer to this question ought naturally to have been the end of the talk but alminy cutterr lingered and looked as if she had something more on her mind a young fellow does not require a great experience to read a simple countrygirls face as if it were a signboard alminy was a good soul with red cheeks and bright eyes kindhearted as she could be and it was out of the question for her to hide her thoughts or feelings like a fine lady her bright eyes were moist and her red cheeks paler than their wont as she said with her lips quivering oh mr langdon them boys ll be the death of ye if ye dont take caar why whats the matter my dear said mr bernard dont think there was anything very odd in that my dear at the second interview with a village belle some of these womantamers call a girl my dear after five minutes acquaintance and it sounds all right as they say it but you had better not try it at a venture it sounded all right to alminy as mr bernard said it i ll tell ye whats the mahtterr she said in a frightened voice ahbner s gon to car his dog n hell set him on yez sure z y r alive ts the same cretur that haaf eat up eben squiress little jo a year come nex faast day now this last statement was undoubtedly overcolored as little jo squires was running about the village with an ugly scar on his arm it is true where the beast had caught him with his teeth on the occasion of the childs taking liberties with him as he had been accustomed to do with a goodtempered newfoundland dog who seemed to like being pulled and hauled round by children after this the creature was commonly muzzled and as he was fed on raw meat chiefly was always ready for a fight which he was occasionally indulged in when anything stout enough to match him could be found in any of the neighboring villages tiger or more briefly tige the property of abner briggs junior belonged to a species not distinctly named in scientific books but well known to our countryfolks under the name yallah dog they do not use this expression as they would say black dog or white dog but with almost as definite a meaning as when they speak of a terrier or a spaniel a yallah dog is a large canine brute of a dingy oldflannel color of no particular breed except his own who hangs round a tavern or a butchers shop or trots alongside of a team looking as if he were disgusted with the world and the world with him our inland population while they tolerate him speak of him with contempt old of meredith bridge used to twit the sun for not shining on cloudy days swearing that if he hung up his yallah dog he would make a better show of daylight a country fellow abusing a horse of his neighbors vowed that if he had such a hoss hed swap him for a yallah dog and then shoot the dog tige was an illconditioned brute by nature and art had not improved him by cropping his ears and tail and investing him with a spiked collar he bore on his person also various not ornamental scars marks of old battles for tige had fight in him as was said before and as might be guessed by a certain bluntness about the muzzle with a projection of the lower jaw which looked as if there might be a bulldog stripe among the numerous barsinisters of his lineage it was hardly fair however to leave alminy cutterr waiting while this piece of natural history was telling as she spoke of little jo who had been haaf eat up by tige she could not contain her sympathies and began to cry why my dear little soul said mr bernard what are you worried about i used to play with a bear when i was a boy and the bear used to hug me and i used to kiss him so it was too bad of mr bernard only the second time he had seen alminy but her kind feelings had touched him and that seemed the most natural way of expressing his gratitude ahniny looked round to see if anybody was near she saw nobody so of course it would do no good to holler she saw nobody but a stout young fellow leading a yellow dog muzzled saw her through a crack in a picket fence not a great way off the road many a year he had been hangin raoun alminy and never did he see any encouraging look or hear any behave naow or come naow ant ye shamed or other forbidding phrase of acquiescence such as village belles under stand as well as ever did the nymph who fled to the willows in the eclogue we all remember no wonder he was furious when he saw the school master who had never seen the girl until within a week touching with his lips those rosy cheeks which he had never dared to approach but that was all it was a sudden impulse and the master turned away from the young girl laughing and telling her not to fret herself about him he would take care of himself so master langdon walked on toward his schoolhouse not displeased perhaps with his little adventure nor immensely elated by it for he was one of the natural class of the sexsubduers and had had many a smile without asking which had been denied to the feeble youth who try to win favor by pleading their passion in rhyme and even to the more formidable approaches of young officers in volunteer companies considered by many to be quite irresistible to the fair who have once beheld them from their windows in the epaulettes and plumes and sashes of the pigwacket invincibles or the hackmatack rangers master langdon took his seat and began the exercises of his school the smaller boys recited their lessons well enough but some of the larger ones were negligent and surly he noticed one or two of them looking toward the door as if expecting somebody or something in that direction at half past nine oclock abner briggs junior who had not yet shown himself made his appearance he was followed by his yallah dog without his muzzle who squatted down very grimly near the door and gave a wolfish look round the room as if he were considering which was the plumpest boy to begin with the young butcher meanwhile went to his seat looking somewhat flushed except round the lips which were hardly as red as common and set pretty sharply put out that dog abner briggs the master spoke as the captain speaks to the helmsman when there are rocks foaming at the lips right under his lee abner briggs answered as the helmsman answers when he knows he has a mutinous crew round him that mean to run the ship on the reef and is one of the mutineers himself put him aout yrself f ye ant afeard on him the master stepped into the aisle the great cur showed his teeth and the devilish instincts of his old wolfancestry looked out of his eyes and flashed from his sharp tusks and yawned in his wide mouth and deep red gullet the movements of animals are so much quicker than those of human beings commonly are that they avoid blows as easily as one of us steps out of the way of an oxcart it must be a very stupid dog that lets himself be run over by a fast driver in his gig he can jump out of the wheels way after the tire has already touched him so while one is lifting a stick to strike or drawing back his foot to kick the beast makes his spring and the blow or the kick comes too late it was not so this time the master was a fencer and something of a boxer he had played at singlestick and was used to watching an adversarys eye and coming down on him without any of those premonitory symptoms by which unpractised persons show long beforehand what mischief they meditate out with you he said fiercely and explained what he meant by a sudden flash of his foot that clashed the yellow dogs white teeth together like the springing of a beartrap the cur knew he had found his master at the first word and glance as low animals on four legs or a smaller number always do and the blow took him so by surprise that it curled him up in an instant and he went bundling out of the open schoolhousedoor with a most pitiable yelp and his stump of a tail shut down as close as his owner ever shut the short stubbed blade of his jackknife it was time for the other cur to find who his master follow your dog abner briggs said master langdon the stout butcheryouth looked round but the rebels were all cowed and sat still ill go when im ready he said n i guess i wont go afore im ready youre ready now said master langdon turning up his cuffs so that the little boys noticed the yellow gleam of a pair of gold sleevebuttons once worn by colonel percy wentworth famous in the old french war abner briggs junior did not apparently think he was ready at any rate for he rose up in his place and stood with clenched fists defiant as the master strode towards him the master knew the fellow was really frightened for all his looks and that he must have no time to rally so he caught him suddenly by the collar and with one great pull had him out over his desk and on the open floor he gave him a sharp fling backwards and stood looking at him the roughandtumble fighters all clinch as everybody knows and abner briggs junior was one of that kind he remembered how he had floored master weeks and he had just spunk enough left in him to try to repeat his former successful experiment an the new master he sprang at him openhanded to clutch him so the master had to strike once but very hard and just in the place to tell no doubt the authority that doth hedge a schoolmaster added to the effect of the blow but the blow was itself a neat one and did not require to be repeated now go home said the master and dont let me see you or your dog here again and he turned his cuffs down over the gold sleevebuttons this finished the great pigwacket centre school rebellion what could be done with a master who was so pleasant as long as the boys behaved decently and such a terrible fellow when he got riled as they called it in a weeks time everything was reduced to order and the schoolcommittee were delighted the master however had received a proposition so much more agreeable and advantageous that he informed the committee he should leave at the end of his month having in his eye a sensible and energetic young collegegraduate who would be willing and fully competent to take his place so at the expiration of the appointed time bernard langdon late master of the school district no pigwacket centre took his departure from that place for another locality whither we shall follow him carrying with him the regrets of the committee of most of the scholars and of several young ladies also two locks of hair sent unbeknown to payrents one dark and one warmish auburn inscribed with the respective initials of alminy cutterr and arvilly braowne chapter iv the moth flies into the candle the invitation which mr bernard langdon had accepted came from the board of trustees of the apollinean female institute a school for the education of young ladies situated in the flourishing town of rockland this was an establishment on a considerable scale in which a hundred scholars or thereabouts were taught the ordinary english branches several of the modern languages something of latin if desired with a little natural philosophy metaphysics and rhetoric to finish off with in the last year and music at any time when they would pay for it at the close of their career in the institute they were submitted to a grand public examination and received diplomas tied in blue ribbons which proclaimed them with a great flourish of capitals to be graduates of the apollinean female institute rockland was a town of no inconsiderable pretensions it was ennobled by lying at the foot of a mountain called by the workingfolks of the place the maounting which sufficiently showed that it was the principal high land of the district in which it was situated it lay to the south of this and basked in the sunshine as italy stretches herself before the alps to pass from the town of tamarack on the north of the mountain to rockland on the south was like crossing from coire to chiavenna there is nothing gives glory and grandeur and romance and mystery to a place like the impending presence of a high mountain our beautiful northampton with its fair meadows and noble stream is lovely enough but owes its surpassing attraction to those twin summits which brood over it like living presences looking down into its streets as if they were its tutelary divinities dressing and undressing their green shrines robing themselves in jubilant sunshine or in sorrowing clouds and doing penance in the snowy shroud of winter as if they had living hearts under their rocky ribs and changed their mood like the children of the soil at their feet who grow up under their almost parental smiles and frowns happy is the child whose first dreams of heaven are blended with the evening glories of mount holyoke when the sun is firing its treetops and gilding the white walls that mark its one human dwelling if the other and the wilder of the two summits has a scowl of terror in its overhanging brows yet is it a pleasing fear to look upon its savage solitudes through the barred nurserywindows in the heart of the sweet companionable village and how the mountains love their children the sea is of a facile virtue and will run to kiss the first comer in any port he visits but the chaste mountains sit apart and show their faces only in the midst of their own families the mountain which kept watch to the north of rockland lay waste and almost inviolate through much of its domain the catamount still glared from the branches of its old hemlocks on the lesser beasts that strayed beneath him it was not long since a wolf had wandered down famished in the winters dearth and left a few bones and some tufts of wool of what had been a lamb in the morning nay there were broadfooted tracks in the snow only two years previously which could not be mistaken the black bear alone could have set that plantigrade seal and little children must come home early from school and play for he is an indiscriminate feeder when he is hungry and a little child would not come amiss when other game was wanting but these occasional visitors may have been mere wanderers which straying along in the woods by day and perhaps stalking through the streets of still villages by night had worked their way along down from the ragged mountainspurs of higher latitudes the one feature of the mountain that shed the brownest horror on its woods was the existence of the terrible region known as rattlesnake ledge and still tenanted by those damnable reptiles which distil a fiercer venom under our cold northern sky than the cobra himself in the land of tropical spices and poisons from the earliest settlement of the place this fact had been next to the indians the reigning nightmare of the inhabitants it was easy enough after a time to drive away the savages for a screeching indian divell as our fathers called him could not crawl into the crack of a rock to escape from his pursuers but the venomous population of rattlesnake ledge had a gibraltar for their fortress that might have defied the siegetrain dragged to the walls of sebastopol in its deep embrasures and its impregnable easemates they reared their families they met in love or wrath they twined together in family knots they hissed defiance in hostile clans they fed slept hibernated and in due time died in peace many a foray had the townspeople made and many a stuffed skin was shown as a trophy nay there were families where the childrens first toy was made from the warning appendage that once vibrated to the wrath of one of these cruel serpents sometimes one of them coaxed out by a warm sun would writhe himself down the hillside into the roads up the walks that led to houses worse than this into the long grass where the barefooted mowers would soon pass with their swinging scythes more rarely into houses and on one memorable occasion early in the last century into the meetinghouse where he took a position on the pulpitstairs as is narrated in the account of some remarkable providences etc where it is suggested that a strong tendency of the rev didymus bean the minister at that time towards the arminian heresy may have had something to do with it and that the serpent supposed to have been killed on the pulpitstairs was a false show of the daemons contrivance he having come in to listen to a discourse which was a sweet savour in his nostrils and of course not being capable of being killed himself others said however that though there was good reason to think it was a damon yet he did come with intent to bite the heel of that faithful servant etc one gilson is said to have died of the bite of a rattlesnake in this town early in the present century after this there was a great snakehunt in which very many of these venomous beasts were killed one in particular said to have been as big round as a stout mans arm and to have had no less than forty joints to his rattle indicating according to some that he had lived forty years but if we might put any faith in the indian tradition that he had killed forty human beings an idle fancy clearly this hunt however had no permanent effect in keeping down the serpent population viviparous creatures are a kind of speciepaying lot but oviparous ones only give their notes as it were for a future brood an egg being so to speak a promise to pay a young one by and by if nothing happen now the domestic habits of the rattlesnake are not studied very closely for obvious reasons but it is no doubt to all intents and purposes oviparous consequently it has large families and is not easy to kill out in the year a melancholy proof was afforded to the inhabitants of rockland that the brood which infested the mountain was not extirpated a very interesting young married woman detained at home at the time by the state of her health was bitten in the entry of her own house by a rattlesnake which had found its way down from the mountain owing to the almost instant employment of powerful remedies the bite did not prove immediately fatal but she died within a few months of the time when she was bitten all this seemed to throw a lurid kind of shadow over the mountain yet as many years passed without any accident people grew comparatively careless and it might rather be said to add a fearful kind of interest to the romantic hillside that the banded reptiles which had been the terror of the red men for nobody knows how many thousand years were there still with the same poisonbags and springteeth at the white mens service if they meddled with them the other natural features of rockland were such as many of our pleasant countrytowns can boast of a brook came tumbling down the mountainside and skirted the most thickly settled portion of the village in the parts of its course where it ran through the woods the water looked almost as brown as coffee flowing from its urn to say like smoky quartz would perhaps give a better idea but in the open plain it sparkled over the pebbles white as a queens diamonds there were huckleberrypastures on the lower flanks of the mountain with plenty of the sweetscented bayberry mingled with the other bushes in other fields grew great store of highbush blackberries along the roadside were bayberrybushes hung all over with bright red coral pendants in autumn and far into the winter then there were swamps set thick with dingy alders where the threeleaved arum and the skunkscabbage grew broad and succulent shelving down into black boggy pools here and there at the edge of which the green frog stupidest of his tribe sat waiting to be victimized by boy or snappingturtle long after the shy and agile leopardfrog had taken the sixfoot spring that plumped him into the middle of the pool and on the neighboring banks the maidenhair spread its flat disk of embroidered fronds on the wirelike stem that glistened polished and brown as the darkest tortoiseshell and pale violets cheated by the cold skies of their hues and perfume sunned themselves like whitecheeked invalids over these rose the old foresttrees the maple scarred with the wounds which had drained away its sweet lifeblood the beech its smooth gray bark mottled so as to look like the body of one of those great snakes of old that used to frighten armies always the mark of lovers knives as in the days of musidora and her swain the yellow birch rough as the breast of silenus in old marbles the wild cherry its little bitter fruit lying unheeded at its foot and soaring over all the huge coarsebarked splinterylimbed darkmantled hemlock in the depth of whose aerial solitudes the crow brooded on her nest unscared and the gray squirrel lived unharmed till his incisors grew to look like ramshorns rockland would have been but half a town without its pond guinnepeg pond was the name of it but the young ladies of the apollinean institute were very anxious that it should be called crystalline lake it was here that the young folks used to sail in summer and skate in winter here too those queer old rumscented goodfornothing lazy storytelling halfvagabonds who sawed a little wood or dug a few potatoes now and then under the pretence of working for their living used to go and fish through the ice for pickerel every winter and here those three young people were drowned a few summers ago by the upsetting of a sailboat in a sudden flaw of wind there is not one of these smiling ponds which has not devoured more youths and maidens than any of those monsters the ancients used to tell such lies about but it was a pretty pond and never looked more innocent so the native bard of rockland said in his elegy than on the morning when they found sarah jane and ellen maria floating among the lilypads the apollinean institute or institoot as it was more commonly called was in the language of its prospectus a firstclass educational establishment it employed a considerable corps of instructors to rough out and finish the hundred young lady scholars it sheltered beneath its roof first mr and mrs peckham the principal and the matron of the school silas peckham was a thorough yankee born on a windy part of the coast and reared chiefly on saltfish everybody knows the type of yankee produced by this climate and diet thin as if he had been split and dried with an ashen kind of complexion like the tint of the food he is made of and about as sharp tough juiceless and biting to deal with as the other is to the taste silas peckham kept a young ladies school exactly as he would have kept a hundred head of cattle for the simple unadorned purpose of making just as much money in just as few years as could be safely done mr peckham gave very little personal attention to the department of instruction but was always busy with contracts for flour and potatoes beef and pork and other nutritive staples the amount of which required for such an establishment was enough to frighten a quartermaster mrs peckham was from the west raised on indian corn and pork which give a fuller outline and a more humid temperament but may perhaps be thought to render people a little coarsefibred her specialty was to look after the feathering cackling roosting rising and general behavior of these hundred chicks an honest ignorant woman she could not have passed an examination in the youngest class so this distinguished institution was under the charge of a commissary and a housekeeper and its real business was making money by taking young girls in as boarders connected with this however was the incidental fact which the public took for the principal one namely the business of instruction mr peckham knew well enough that it was just as well to have good instructors as bad ones so far as cost was concerned and a great deal better for the reputation of his feedingestablishment he tried to get the best he could without paying too much and having got them to screw all the work out of them that could possibly be extracted there was a master for the english branches with a young lady assistant there was another young lady who taught french of the ahvaung and baundahng style which does not exactly smack of the asphalt of the boulevards there was also a german teacher of music who sometimes helped in french of the ahfaung and bauntaung style so that between the two the young ladies could hardly have been mistaken for parisians by a committee of the french academy the german teacher also taught a latin class after his fashion benna a ben gahboot ahead and so forth the master for the english branches had lately left the school for private reasons which need not be here mentioned but he had gone at any rate and it was his place which had been offered to mr bernard langdon the offer came just in season as for various causes he was willing to leave the place where he had begun his new experience it was on a fine morning that mr bernard ushered in by mr peckham made his appearance in the great schoolroom of the apollinean institute a general rustle ran all round the seats when the handsome young man was introduced the principal carried him to the desk of the young lady english assistant miss darley by name and introduced him to her there was not a great deal of study done that day the young lady assistant had to point out to the new master the whole routine in which the classes were engaged when their late teacher left and which had gone on as well as it could since then master langdon had a great many questions to ask some relating to his new duties and some perhaps implying a degree of curiosity not very unnatural under the circumstances the truth is the general effect of the schoolroom with its scores of young girls all their eyes naturally centring on him with fixed or furtive glances was enough to bewilder and confuse a young man like master langdon though he was not destitute of selfpossession as we have already seen you cannot get together a hundred girls taking them as they come from the comfortable and affluent classes probably anywhere certainly not in new england without seeing a good deal of beauty in fact we very commonly mean by beauty the way young girls look when there is nothing to hinder their looking as nature meant them to and the great schoolroom of the apollinean institute did really make so pretty a show on the morning when master langdon entered it that he might be pardoned for asking miss darley more questions about his scholars than about their lessons there were girls of all ages little creatures some pallid and delicatelooking the offspring of invalid parents much given to books not much to mischief commonly spoken of as particularly good children and contrasted with another sort girls of more vigorous organization who were disposed to laughing and play and required a strong hand to manage them then young growing misses of every shade of saxon complexion and here and there one of more southern hue blondes some of them so translucentlooking that it seemed as if you could see the souls in their bodies like bubbles in glass if souls were objects of sight brunettes some with rosered colors and some with that swarthy hue which often carries with it a heavilyshaded lip and which with pure outlines and outspoken reliefs gives us some of our handsomest women the women whom ornaments of plain gold adorn more than any other parures and again but only here and there one with dark hair and gray or blue eyes a celtic type perhaps but found in our native stock occasionally rarest of all a lighthaired girl with dark eyes hazel brown or of the color of that mountainbrook spoken of in this chapter where it ran through shadowy woodlands with these were to be seen at intervals some of maturer years fullblown flowers among the opening buds with that conscious look upon their faces which so many women wear during the period when they never meet a single man without having his monosyllable ready for him tied as they are poor things on the rock of expectation each of them an andromeda waiting for her perseus who is that girl in ringlets the fourth in the third row on the right said master langdon charlotte ann wood said miss darley writes very pretty poems oh and the pink one three seats from her looks bright anything in her emma dean dayscholar squire deans daughter nice girl second medal last year the master asked these two questions in a careless kind of way and did not seem to pay any too much attention to the answers and who and what is that he said sitting a little apart there that strange wildlooking girl this time he put the real question he wanted answered the other two were asked at random as masks for the third the ladyteachers face changed one would have said she was frightened or troubled she looked at the girl doubtfully as if she might hear the masters question and its answer but the girl did not look up she was winding a gold chain about her wrist and then uncoiling it as if in a kind of reverie miss darley drew close to the master and placed her hand so as to hide her lips dont look at her as if we were talking about her she whispered softly that is elsie venner chapter v an oldfashioned descriptive chapter it was a comfort to get to a place with something like society with residences which had pretensions to elegance with people of some breeding with a newspaper and stores to advertise in it and with two or three churches to keep each other alive by wholesome agitation rockland was such a place some of the natural features of the town have been described already the mountain of course was what gave it its character and redeemed it from wearing the commonplace expression which belongs to ordinary countryvillages beautiful wild invested with the mystery which belongs to untrodden spaces and with enough of terror to give it dignity it had yet closer relations with the town over which it brooded than the passing stranger knew of thus it made a local climate by cutting off the northern winds and holding the suns heat like a gardenwall peachtrees which on the northern side of the mountain hardly ever came to fruit ripened abundant crops in rockland but there was still another relation between the mountain and the town at its foot which strangers were not likely to hear alluded to and which was oftener thought of than spoken of by its inhabitants those highimpending forests hangers as white of selborne would have called them sloping far upward and backward into the distance had always an air of menace blended with their wild beauty it seemed as if some heavenscaling titan had thrown his shaggy robe over the bare precipitous flanks of the rocky summit and it might at any moment slide like a garment flung carelessly on the nearest chancesupport and so sliding crush the village out of being as the rossberg when it tumbled over on the valley of goldau persons have been known to remove from the place after a short residence in it because they were haunted day and night by the thought of this awful green wall piled up into the air over their heads they would lie awake of nights thinking they heard the muffed snapping of roots as if a thousand acres of the mountainside were tugging to break away like the snow from a houseroof and a hundred thousand trees were clinging with all their fibres to hold back the soil just ready to peel away and crash down with all its rocks and forestgrowths and yet by one of those strange contradictions we are constantly finding in human nature there were natives of the town who would come back thirty or forty years after leaving it just to nestle under this same threatening mountainside as old men sun themselves against southwardfacing walls the old dreams and legends of danger added to the attraction if the mountain should ever slide they had a kind of feeling as if they ought to be there it was a fascination like that which the rattlesnake is said to exert this comparison naturally suggests the recollection of that other source of danger which was an element in the everyday life of the rockland people the folks in some of the neighboring towns had a joke against them that a rocklander could nt hear a beanpod rattle without saying the lord have mercy on us it is very true that many a nervous old lady has had a terrible start caused by some mischievous young rogues giving a sudden shake to one of these noisy vegetable products in her immediate vicinity yet strangely enough many persons missed the excitement of the possibility of a fatal bite in other regions where there were nothing but black and green and striped snakes mean ophidians having the spite of the nobler serpent without his venom poor crawling creatures whom nature would not trust with a poisonbag many natives of rockland did unquestionably experience a certain gratification in this infinitesimal sense of danger it was noted that the old people retained their hearing longer than in other places some said it was the softened climate but others believed it was owing to the habit of keeping their ears open whenever they were walking through the grass or in the woods at any rate a slight sense of danger is often an agreeable stimulus people sip their creme de noyau with a peculiar tremulous pleasure because there is a bare possibility that it may contain prussic acid enough to knock them over in which case they will lie as dead as if a thundercloud had emptied itself into the earth through their brain and marrow but rockland had other features which helped to give it a special character first of all there was one grand street which was its chief glory elm street it was called naturally enough for its elms made a long pointedarched gallery of it through most of its extent no natural gothic arch compares for a moment with that formed by two american elms where their lofty jets of foliage shoot across each others ascending curves to intermingle their showery flakes of green when one looks through a long double row of these as in that lovely avenue which the poets of yale remember so well oh could the vista of my life but now as bright appear as when i first through temple street looked down thine espalier he beholds a temple not built with hands fairer than any minster with all its clustered stems and flowering capitals that ever grew in stone nobody knows new england who is not on terms of intimacy with one of its elms the elm comes nearer to having a soul than any other vegetable creature among us it loves man as man loves it it is modest and patient it has a small flake of a seed which blows in everywhere and makes arrangements for coming up by and by so in spring one finds a crop of babyelms among his carrots and parsnips very weak and small compared to those succulent vegetables the babyelms die most of them slain unrecognized or unheeded by hand or hoe as meekly as herods innocents one of them gets overlooked perhaps until it has established a kind of right to stay three generations of carrot and parsnip consumers have passed away yourself among them and now let your greatgrandson look for the babyelm twentytwo feet of clean girth three hundred and sixty feet in the line that bounds its leafy circle it covers the boy with such a canopy as neither glossyleafed oak nor insecthaunted linden ever lifted into the summer skies elm street was the pride of rockland but not only on account of its gothicarched vista in this street were most of the great houses or mansionhouses as it was usual to call them along this street also the more nicely kept and neatly painted dwellings were chiefly congregated it was the correct thing for a rockland dignitary to have a house in elm street a new england mansionhouse is naturally square with dormer windows projecting from the roof which has a balustrade with turned posts round it it shows a good breadth of frontyard before its door as its owner shows a respectable expanse of a clean shirtfront it has a lateral margin beyond its stables and offices as its master wears his white wrist bands showing beyond his coatcuffs it may not have what can properly be called grounds but it must have elbowroom at any rate without it it is like a man who is always tightbuttoned for want of any linen to show the mansionhouse which has had to button itself up tight in fences for want of green or gravel margin will be advertising for boarders presently the old english pattern of the new england mansionhouse only on a somewhat grander scale is sir thomas abneys place where dear good dr watts said prayers for the family and wrote those blessed hymns of his that sing us into consciousness in our cradles and come back to us in sweet single verses between the moments of wandering and of stupor when we lie dying and sound over us when we can no longer hear them bringing grateful tears to the hot aching eyes beneath the thick black veils and carrying the holy calm with them which filled the good mans heart as he prayed and sung under the shelter of the old english mansionhouse next to the mansionhouses came the twostory trim whitepainted genteel houses which being more gossipy and less nicely bred crowded close up to the street instead of standing back from it with arms akimbo like the mansionhouses their little frontyards were very commonly full of lilac and syringa and other bushes which were allowed to smother the lower story almost to the exclusion of light and airy so that what with small windows and small windowpanes and the darkness made by these choking growths of shrubbery the front parlors of some of these houses were the most tomblike melancholy places that could be found anywhere among the abodes of the living their garnishing was apt to assist this impression largepatterned carpets which always look discontented in little rooms haircloth furniture black and shiny as beetles wing cases and centretables with a sullen oillamp of the kind called astral by our imaginative ancestors in the centre these things were inevitable in set piles round the lamp was ranged the current literature of the day in the form of temperance documents unbound numbers of one of the unknown publics magazines with wornout steel engravings and highcolored fashionplates the poems of a distinguished british author whom it is unnecessary to mention a volume of sermons or a novel or two or both according to the tastes of the family and the good book which is always itself in the cheapest and commonest company the father of the family with his hand in the breast of his coat the mother of the same in a widebordered cap sometimes a print of the last supper by no means morghens or the father of his country or the old general or the defender of the constitution or an unknown clergyman with an open book before him these were the usual ornaments of the walls the first two a matter of rigor the others according to politics and other tendencies this intermediate class of houses wherever one finds them in new england towns are very apt to be cheerless and unsatisfactory they have neither the luxury of the mansionhouse nor the comfort of the farmhouse they are rarely kept at an agreeable temperature the mansionhouse has large fireplaces and generous chimneys and is open to the sunshine the farmhouse makes no pretensions but it has a good warm kitchen at any rate and one can be comfortable there with the rest of the family without fear and without reproach these lesser countryhouses of genteel aspirations are much given to patent subterfuges of one kind and another to get heat without combustion the chilly parlor and the slippery haircloth seat take the life out of the warmest welcome if one would make these places wholesome happy and cheerful the first precept would be the dearest fuel plenty of it and let half the heat go up the chimney if you cant afford this dont try to live in a genteel fashion but stick to the ways of the honest farmhouse there were a good many comfortable farmhouses scattered about rockland the best of them were something of the following pattern which is too often superseded of late by a more pretentious but infinitely less pleasing kind of rustic architecture a little back from the road seated directly on the green sod rose a plain wooden building two stories in front with a long roof sloping backwards to within a few feet of the ground this like the mansionhouse is copied from an old english pattern cottages of this model may be seen in lancashire for instance always with the same honest homely look as if their roofs acknowledged their relationship to the soil out of which they sprung the walls were unpainted but turned by the slow action of sun and air and rain to a quiet dove or slate color an old broken millstone at the door a wellsweep pointing like a finger to the heavens which the shining round of water beneath looked up at like a dark unsleeping eye a single large elm a little at one side a barn twice as big as the house a cattleyard with the white horns tossing above the wall some fields in pasture or in crops with low stone walls round them a row of beehives a gardenpatch with roots and currantbushes and manyhued hollyhocks and swollenstemmed globeheaded seedling onions and marigolds and flowerdeluces and ladysdelights and peonies crowding in together with southernwood in the borders and woodbine and hops and morningglories climbing as they got a chance these were the features by which the rocklandborn children remembered the farmhouse when they had grown to be men such are the recollections that come over poor sailorboys crawling out on reeling yards to reef topsails as their vessels stagger round the stormy cape and such are the flitting images that make the eyes of old countryborn merchants look dim and dreamy as they sit in their city palaces warm with the afterdinner flush of the red wave out of which memory arises as aphrodite arose from the green waves of the ocean two meetinghouses stood on two eminences facing each other and looking like a couple of fightingcocks with their necks straight up in the air as if they would flap their roofs the next thing and crow out of their upstretched steeples and peck at each others glass eyes with their sharppointed weathercocks the first was a good pattern of the real oldfashioned new england meetinghouse it was a large barn with windows fronted by a square tower crowned with a kind of wooden bell inverted and raised on legs out of which rose a slender spire with the sharpbilled weathercock at its summit inside tall square pews with flapping seats and a gallery running round three sides of the building on the fourth side the pulpit with a huge dusty soundingboard hanging over it here preached the reverend pierrepont honeywood d d successor after a number of generations to the office and the parsonage of the reverend didymus bean before mentioned but not suspected of any of his alleged heresies he held to the old faith of the puritans and occasionally delivered a discourse which was considered by the hardheaded theologians of his parish to have settled the whole matter fully and finally so that now there was a good logical basis laid down for the millennium which might begin at once upon the platform of his demonstrations yet the reverend dr honeywood was fonder of preaching plain practical sermons about the duties of life and showing his christianity in abundant good works among his people it was noticed by some few of his flock not without comment that the great majority of his texts came from the gospels and this more and more as he became interested in various benevolent enterprises which brought him into relations withministers and kindhearted laymen of other denominations he was in fact a man of a very warm open and exceedingly human disposition and although bred by a clerical father whose motto was sit anima mea cum puritanis he exercised his human faculties in the harness of his ancient faith with such freedom that the straps of it got so loose they did not interfere greatly with the circulation of the warm blood through his system once in a while he seemed to think it necessary to come out with a grand doctrinal sermon and them he would lapse away for a while into preaching on mens duties to each other and to society and hit hard perhaps at some of the actual vices of the time and place and insist with such tenderness and eloquence on the great depth and breadth of true christian love and charity that his oldest deacon shook his head and wished he had shown as much interest when he was preaching three sabbaths back on predestinaticn or in his discourse against the sabellians but he was sound in the faith no doubt of that did he not preside at the council held in the town of tamarack on the other side of the mountain which expelled its clergyman for maintaining heretical doctrines as presiding officer he did not vote of course but there was no doubt that he was all right he had some of the edwards blood in him and that couldnt very well let him go wrong the meetinghouse on the other and opposite summit was of a more modern style considered by many a great improvement on the old new england model so that it is not uncommon for a country parish to pull down its old meetinghouse which has been preached in for a hundred years or so and put up one of these more elegant edifices the new building was in what may be called the florid shinglegothic manner its pinnacles and crockets and other ornaments were like the body of the building all of pine wood an admirable material as it is very soft and easily worked and can be painted of any color desired inside the walls were stuccoed in imitation of stone first a dark brown square then two light brown squares then another dark brown square and so on to represent the accidental differences of shade always noticeable in the real stones of which walls are built to be sure the architect could not help getting his partycolored squares in almost as regular rhythmical order as those of a chessboard but nobody can avoid doing things in a systematic and serial way indeed people who wish to plant trees in natural chimps know very well that they cannot keep from making regular lines and symmetrical figures unless by some trick or other as that one of throwing a peck of potatoes up into the air and sticking in a tree wherever a potato happens to fall the pews of this meetinghouse were the usual oblong ones where people sit close together with a ledge before them to support their hymnbooks liable only to occasional contact with the back of the next pews heads or bonnets and a place running under the seat of that pew where hats could be deposited always at the risk of the owner in case of injury by boots or crickets in this meetinghouse preached the reverend chauncy fairweather a divine of the liberal school as it is commonly called bred at that famous college which used to be thought twenty or thirty years ago to have the monopoly of training young men in the milder forms of heresy his ministrations were attended with decency but not followed with enthusiasm the beauty of virtue got to be an old story at last the moral dignity of human nature ceased to excite a thrill of satisfaction after some hundred repetitions it grew to be a dull business this preaching against stealing and intemperance while he knew very well that the thieves were prowling round orchards and empty houses instead of being there to hear the sermon and that the drunkards being rarely churchgoers get little good by the statistics and eloquent appeals of the preacher every now and then however the reverend mr fairweather let off a polemic discourse against his neighbor opposite which waked his people up a little but it was a languid congregation at best very apt to stay away from meeting in the afternoon and not at all given to extra evening services the minister unlike his rival of the other side of the way was a downhearted and timid kind of man he went on preaching as he had been taught to preach but he had misgivings at times there was a little roman catholic church at the foot of the hill where his own was placed which he always had to pass on sundays he could never look on the thronging multitudes that crowded its pews and aisles or knelt bareheaded on its steps without a longing to get in among them and go down on his knees and enjoy that luxury of devotional contact which makes a worshipping throng as different from the same numbers praying apart as a bed of coals is from a trail of scattered cinders oh if i could but huddle in with those poor laborers and workingwomen he would say to himself if i could but breathe that atmosphere stifling though it be yet made holy by ancient litanies and cloudy with the smoke of hallowed incense for one hour instead of droning over these moral precepts to my halfsleeping congregation the intellectual isolation of his sect preyed upon him for of all terrible things to natures like his the most terrible is to belong to a minority no person that looked at his thin and sallow cheek his sunken and sad eye his tremulous lip his contracted forehead or who heard his querulous though not unmusical voice could fail to see that his life was an uneasy one that he was engaged in some inward conflict his dark melancholic aspect contrasted with his seemingly cheerful creed and was all the more striking as the worthy dr honeywood professing a belief which made him a passenger on board a shipwrecked planet was yet a most goodhumored and companionable gentleman whose laugh on weekdays did one as much good to listen to as the best sermon he ever delivered on a sunday a mile or two from the centre of rockland was a pretty little episcopal church with a roof like a wedge of cheese a square tower a stained window and a trained rector who read the service with such ventral depth of utterance and rrreduplication of the rrresonant letter that his own mother would not have known him for her son if the good woman had not ironed his surplice and put it on with her own hands there were two publichouses in the place one dignified with the name of the mountain house somewhat frequented by city people in the summer months largefronted threestoried balconied boasting a distinct ladiesdrawingroom and spreading a table dhote of some pretensions the other pollards tahvern in the common speech a twostory building with a barroom once famous where there was a great smell of hay and boots and pipes and all other bucolicflavored elements where games of checkers were played on the back of the bellows with red and white kernels of corn or with beans and coffee where a man slept in a boxsettle at night to wake up early passengers where teamsters came in with woodenhandled whips and coarse frocks reinforcing the bucolic flavor of the atmosphere and middleaged male gossips sometimes including the squire of the neighboring lawoffice gathered to exchange a question or two about the news and then fall into that solemn state of suspended animation which the temperance barrooms of modern days produce in human beings as the grotta del cane does in dogs in the wellknown experiments related by travellers this barroom used to be famous for drinking and storytelling and sometimes fighting in old times that was when there were rows of decanters on the shelf behind the bar and a hissing vessel of hot water ready to make punch and three or four loggerheads long irons clubbed at the end were always lying in the fire in the cold season waiting to be plunged into sputtering and foaming mugs of flip a goodly compound speaking according to the flesh made with beer and sugar and a certain suspicion of strong waters over which a little nutmeg being grated and in it the hot iron being then allowed to sizzle there results a peculiar singed aroma which the wise regard as a warning to remove themselves at once out of the reach of temptation but the bar of pollards tahvern no longer presented its old attractions and the loggerheads had long disappeared from the fire in place of the decanters were boxes containing lozengers as they were commonly called sticks of candy in jars cigars in tumblers a few lemons grown hardskinned and marvellously shrunken by long exposure but still feebly suggestive of possible lemonade the whole ornamented by festoons of yellow and blue cut flypaper on the front shelf of the bar stood a large germansilver pitcher of water and scattered about were illconditioned lamps with wicks that always wanted picking which burned red and smoked a good deal and were apt to go out without any obvious cause leaving strong reminiscences of the whalefishery in the circumambient air the common schoolhouses of rockland were dwarfed by the grandeur of the apollinean institute the master passed one of them in a walk he was taking soon after his arrival at rockland he looked in at the rows of desks and recalled his late experiences he could not help laughing as he thought how neatly he had knocked the young butcher off his pins a little science is a dangerous thing as well as a little learning he said to himself only its dangerous to the fellow you try it on and he cut him a good stick and began climbing the side of the mountain to get a look at that famous rattlesnake ledge chapter vi the sunbeam and the shadow the virtue of the world is not mainly in its leaders in the midst of the multitude which follows there is often something better than in the one that goes before old generals wanted to take toulon but one of their young colonels showed them how the junior counsel has been known not unfrequently to make a better argument than his senior fellow if indeed he did not make both their arguments good ministers will tell you they have parishioners who beat them in the practice of the virtues a great establishment got up on commercial principles like the apollinean institute might yet be well carried on if it happened to get good teachers and when master langdon came to see its management he recognized that there must be fidelity and intelligence somewhere among the instructors it was only necessary to look for a moment at the fair open forehead the still tranquil eye of gentle habitual authority the sweet gravity that lay upon the lips to hear the clear answers to the pupils questions to notice how every request had the force without the form of a command and the young man could not doubt that the good genius of the school stood before him in the person of helen barley it was the old story a poor countryclergyman dies and leaves a widow and a daughter in old england the daughter would have eaten the bitter bread of a governess in some rich family in new england she must keep a school so rising from one sphere to another she at length finds herself the prima donna in the department of instruction in mr silas peckhams educational establishment what a miserable thing it is to be poor she was dependent frail sensitive conscientious she was in the power of a hard grasping thinblooded toughfibred trading educator who neither knew nor cared for a tender womans sensibilities but who paid her and meant to have his moneys worth out of her brains and as much more than his moneys worth as he could get she was consequently in plain english overworked and an overworked woman is always a sad sight sadder a great deal than an overworked man because she is so much more fertile in capacities of suffering than a man she has so many varieties of headache sometimes as if jael were driving the nail that killed sisera into her temples sometimes letting her work with half her brain while the other half throbs as if it would go to pieces sometimes tightening round the brows as if her capband were a ring of iron and then her neuralgias and her backaches and her fits of depression in which she thinks she is nothing and less than nothing and those paroxysms which men speak slightingly of as hysterical convulsions that is all only not commonly fatal ones so many trials which belong to her fine and mobile structure that she is always entitled to pity when she is placed in conditions which develop her nervous tendencies the poor young ladys work had of course been doubled since the departure of master langdons predecessor nobody knows what the weariness of instruction is as soon as the teachers faculties begin to be overtasked but those who have tried it the relays of fresh pupils each new set with its exhausting powers in full action coming one after another take out all the reserved forces and faculties of resistance from the subject of their draining process the days work was over and it was late in the evening when she sat down tired and faint with a great bundle of girls themes or compositions to read over before she could rest her weary head on the pillow of her narrow trundlebed and forget for a while the treadmill stair of labor she was daily climbing how she dreaded this most forlorn of all a teachers tasks she was conscientious in her duties and would insist on reading every sentence there was no saying where she might find faults of grammar or bad spelling there might have been twenty or thirty of these themes in the bundle before her of course she knew pretty well the leading sentiments they could contain that beauty was subject to the accidents of time that wealth was inconstant and existence uncertain that virtue was its own reward that youth exhaled like the dewdrop from the flower ere the sun had reached its meridian that life was oershadowed with trials that the lessons of virtue instilled by our beloved teachers were to be our guides through all our future career the imagery employed consisted principally of roses lilies birds clouds and brooks with the celebrated comparison of wayward genius to meteor who does not know the small slanted italian hand of these girlscompositions their stringing together of the good old traditional copybook phrases their occasional gushes of sentiment their profound estimates of the world sounding to the old folks that read them as the experience of a bantam pullets lasthatched young one with the chips of its shell on its head would sound to a mother carys chicken who knew the great ocean with all its typhoons and tornadoes yet every now and then one is liable to be surprised with strange clairvoyant flashes that can hardly be explained except by the mysterious inspiration which every now and then seizes a young girl and exalts her intelligence just as hysteria in other instances exalts the sensibility a little something of that which made joan of arc and the burney girl who prophesied evelina and the davidson sisters in the midst of these commonplace exercises which miss darley read over so carefully were two or three that had something of individual flavor about them and here and there there was an image or an epithet which showed the footprint of a passionate nature as a fallen scarlet feather marks the path the wild flamingo has trodden the young ladyteacher read them with a certain indifference of manner as one reads proofs noting defects of detail but not commonly arrested by the matters treated of even miss charlotte ann woods poem beginning how sweet at evenings balmy hour did not excite her she marked the inevitable false rhyme of cockney and yankee beginners morn and dawn and tossed the verses on the pile of papers she had finished she was looking over some of the last of them in a rather listless way for the poor thing was getting sleepy in spite of herself when she came to one which seemed to rouse her attention and lifted her drooping lids she looked at it a moment before she would touch it then she took hold of it by one corner and slid it off from the rest one would have said she was afraid of it or had some undefined antipathy which made it hateful to her such odd fancies are common enough in young persons in her nervous state many of these young people will jump up twenty times a day and run to dabble the tips of their fingers in water after touching the most inoffensive objects this composition was written in a singular sharppointed long slender hand on a kind of wavy ribbed paper there was something strangely suggestive about the look of it but exactly of what miss barley either could not or did not try to think the subject of the paper was the mountain the composition being a sort of descriptive rhapsody it showed a startling familiarity with some of the savage scenery of the region one would have said that the writer must have threaded its wildest solitudes by the light of the moon and stars as well as by day as the teacher read on her color changed and a kind of tremulous agitation came over her there were hints in this strange paper she did not know what to make of there was something in its descriptions and imagery that recalled miss darley could not say what but it made her frightfully nervous still she could not help reading till she came to one passage which so agitated her that the tired and overwearied girls selfcontrol left her entirely she sobbed once or twice then laughed convulsively and flung herself on the bed where she worked out a set hysteric spasm as she best might without anybody to rub her hands and see that she did not hurt herself by and by she got quiet rose and went to her bookcase took down a volume of coleridge and read a short time and so to bed to sleep and wake from time to time with a sudden start out of uneasy dreams perhaps it is of no great consequence what it was in the composition which set her off into this nervous paroxysm she was in such a state that almost any slight agitation would have brought on the attack and it was the accident of her transient excitability very probably which made a trifling cause the seeming occasion of so much disturbance the theme was signed in the same peculiar sharp slender hand e venner and was of course written by that wildlooking girl who had excited the masters curiosity and prompted his question as before mentioned the next morning the ladyteacher looked pale and wearied naturally enough but she was in her place at the usual hour and master langdon in his own the girls had not yet entered the school room you have been ill i am afraid said mr bernard i was not well yesterday she answered i had a worry and a kind of fright it is so dreadful to have the charge of all these young souls and bodies every young girl ought to walk locked close arm in arm between two guardian angels sometimes i faint almost with the thought of all that i ought to do and of my own weakness and wants tell me are there not natures born so out of parallel with the lines of natural law that nothing short of a miracle can bring them right mr bernard had speculated somewhat as all thoughtful persons of his profession are forced to do on the innate organic tendencies with which individuals families and races are born he replied therefore with a smile as one to whom the question suggested a very familiar class of facts why of course each of us is only the footingup of a double column of figures that goes back to the first pair every unit tells and some of them are plus and some minus if the columns dont add up right it is commonly because we cant make out all the figures i dont mean to say that something may not be added by nature to make up for losses and keep the race to its average but we are mainly nothing but the answer to a long sum in addition and subtraction no doubt there are people born with impulses at every possible angle to the parallels of nature as you call them if they happen to cut these at right angles of course they are beyond the reach of common influences slight obliquities are what we have most to do with in education penitentiaries and insane asylums take care of most of the rightangle cases i am afraid i have put it too much like a professor and i am only a student you know pray what set you to asking me this any strange cases among the scholars the meek teachers blue eyes met the luminous glance that came with the question she too was of gentle blood not meaning by that that she was of any noted lineage but that she came of a cultivated stock never rich but long trained to intellectual callings a thousand decencies amenities reticences graces which no one thinks of until he misses them are the traditional right of those who spring from such families and when two persons of this exceptional breeding meet in the midst of the common multitude they seek each others company at once by the natural law of elective affinity it is wonderful how men and women know their peers if two stranger queens sole survivors of two shipwrecked vessels were cast halfnaked on a rock together each would at once address the other as our royal sister helen darley looked into the dark eyes of bernard langdon glittering with the light which flashed from them with his question not as those foolish innocent countrygirls of the small village did she look into them to be fascinated and bewildered but to sound them with a calm steadfast purpose a gentleman she said to herself as she read his expression and his features with a womans rapid but exhausting glance a lady he said to himself as he met her questioning look so brief so quiet yet so assured as of one whom necessity had taught to read faces quickly without offence as children read the faces of parents as wives read the faces of hardsouled husbands all this was but a few seconds work and yet the main point was settled if there had been any vulgar curiosity or coarseness of any kind lurking in his expression she would have detected it if she had not lifted her eyes to his face so softly and kept them there so calmly and withdrawn them so quietly he would not have said to himself she is a lady for that word meant a good deal to the descendant of the courtly wentworths and the scholarly langdons there are strange people everywhere mr langdon she said and i dont think our schoolroom is an exception i am glad you believe in the force of transmitted tendencies it would break my heart if i did not think that there are faults beyond the reach of everything but gods special grace i should die if i thought that my negligence or incapacity was alone responsible for the errors and sins of those i have charge of yet there are mysteries i do not know how to account for she looked all round the schoolroom and then said in a whisper mr langdon we had a girl that stole in the school not long ago worse than that we had a girl who tried to set us on fire children of good people both of them and we have a girl now that frightens me so the door opened and three misses came in to take their seats three types as it happened of certain classes into which it would not have been difficult to distribute the greater number of the girls in the school hannah martin fourteen years and three months old shortnecked thickwaisted roundcheeked smooth vacant forehead large dull eyes looks goodnatured with little other expression three buns in her bag and a large apple has a habit of attacking her provisions in schoolhours rosa milburn sixteen brunette with a rareripe flush in her cheeks color comes and goes easily eyes wandering apt to be downcast moody at times said to be passionate if irritated finished in high relief carries shoulders well back and walks well as if proud of her womans life with a slight rocking movement being one of the wideflanged pattern but seems restless a hard girl to look after has a romance in her pocket which she means to read in schooltime charlotte ann wood fifteen the poetess before mentioned long light ringlets pallid complexion blue eyes delicate child half unfolded gentle but languid and despondent does not go much with the other girls but reads a good deal especially poetry underscoring favorite passages writes a great many verses very fast not very correctly full of the usual human sentiments expressed in the accustomed phrases undervitalized sensibilities not covered with their normal integuments a negative condition often confounded with genius and sometimes running into it young people who fall out of line through weakness of the active faculties are often confounded with those who step out of it through strength of the intellectual ones the girls kept coming in one after another or in pairs or groups until the schoolroom was nearly full then there was a little pause and a light step was heard in the passage the ladyteachers eyes turned to the door and the masters followed them in the same direction a girl of about seventeen entered she was tall and slender but rounded with a peculiar undulation of movement such as one sometimes sees in perfectly untutored countrygirls whom nature the queen of graces has taken in hand but more commonly in connection with the very highest breeding of the most thoroughly trained society she was a splendid scowling beauty blackbrowed with a flash of white teeth which was always like a surprise when her lips parted she wore a checkered dress of a curious pattern and a camelshair scarf twisted a little fantastically about her she went to her seat which she had moved a short distance apart from the rest and sitting down began playing listlessly with her gold chain as was a common habit with her coiling it and uncoiling it about her slender wrist and braiding it in with her long delicate fingers presently she looked up black piercing eyes not large a low forehead as low as that of clytie in the townley bust black hair twisted in heavy braids a face that one could not help looking at for its beauty yet that one wanted to look away from for something in its expression and could not for those diamond eyes they were fixed on the ladyteacher now the latter turned her own away and let them wander over the other scholars but they could not help coming back again for a single glance at the wild beauty the diamond eyes were on her still she turned the leaves of several of her books as if in search of some passage and when she thought she had waited long enough to be safe once more stole a quick look at the dark girl the diamond eyes were still upon her she put her kerchief to her forehead which had grown slightly moist she sighed once almost shivered for she felt cold then following some illdefined impulse which she could not resist she left her place and went to the young girls desk what do you want of me elsie venner it was a strange question to put for the girl had not signified that she wished the teacher to come to her nothing she said i thought i could make you come the girl spoke in a low tone a kind of halfwhisper she did not lisp yet her articulation of one or two consonants was not absolutely perfect where did you get that flower elsie said miss darley it was a rare alpine flower which was found only in one spot among the rocks of the mountain where it grew said elsie veneer take it the teacher could not refuse her the girls finger tips touched hers as she took it how cold they were for a girl of such an organization the teacher went back to her seat she made an excuse for quitting the schoolroom soon afterwards the first thing she did was to fling the flower into her fireplace and rake the ashes over it the second was to wash the tips of her fingers as if she had been another lady macbeth a poor overtasked nervous creature we must not think too much of her fancies after school was done she finished the talk with the master which had been so suddenly interrupted there were things spoken of which may prove interesting by and by but there are other matters we must first attend to chapter vii the event of the season mr and mrs colonel sprowles compliments to mr langdon and requests the pleasure of his company at a social entertainment on wednesday evening next elm st monday on paper of a pinkish color and musky smell with a large s at the top and an embossed border envelop adherent not sealed addressed langdon esq present brought by h frederic sprowle youngest son of the colonel the h of course standing for the paternal hezekiah put in to please the father and reduced to its initial to please the mother she having a marked preference for frederic boy directed to wait for an answer mr langdon has the pleasure of accepting mr and mrs colonel sprowles polite invitation for wednesday evening on plain paper sealed with an initial in walking along the main street mr bernard had noticed a large house of some pretensions to architectural display namely unnecessarily projecting eaves giving it a mushroomy aspect wooden mouldings at various available points and a grandiose arched portico it looked a little swaggering by the side of one or two of the mansionhouses that were not far from it was painted too bright for mr bernards taste had rather too fanciful a fence before it and had some fruittrees planted in the frontyard which to this fastidious young gentleman implied a defective sense of the fitness of things not promising in people who lived in so large a house with a mushroom roof and a triumphal arch for its entrance this place was known as colonel sprowles villa genteel friends as the elegant residence of our distinguished fellowcitizen colonel sprowle rockland weekly universe as the neew haouse old settlers as spraowles folly disaffected and possibly envious neighbors and in common discourse as the colonels hezekiah sprowle esquire colonel sprowle of the commonwealths militia was a retired merchant an india merchant he might perhaps have been properly called for he used to deal in west india goods such as coffee sugar and molasses not to speak of rum also in tea salt fish butter and cheese oil and candles dried fruit agricultural pdoose generally industrial products such as boots and shoes and various kinds of iron and wooden ware and at one end of the establishment in calicoes and other stuffs to say nothing of miscellaneous objects of the most varied nature from sticks of candy which tempted in the smaller youth with coppers in their fists up to ornamental articles of apparel pocketbooks breastpins giltedged bibles stationery in short everything which was like to prove seductive to the rural population the colonel had made money in trade and also by matrimony he had married sarah daughter and heiress of the late tekel jordan esq an old miser who gave the townclock which carries his name to posterity in large gilt letters as a generous benefactor of his native place in due time the colonel reaped the reward of wellplaced affections when his wifes inheritance fell in he thought he had money enough to give up trade and therefore sold out his store called in some dialects of the english language shop and his business life became pretty hard work to him of course as soon as he had nothing particular to do country people with money enough not to have to work are in much more danger than city people in the same condition they get a specific look and character which are the same in all the villages where one studies them they very commonly fall into a routine the basis of which is going to some loungingplace or other a barroom a readingroom or something of the kind they grow slovenly in dress and wear the same hat forever they have a feeble curiosity for news perhaps which they take daily as a man takes his bitters and then fall silent and think they are thinking but the mind goes out under this regimen like a fire without a draught and it is not very strange if the instinct of mental selfpreservation drives them to brandyandwater which makes the hoarse whisper of memory musical for a few brief moments and puts a weak leer of promise on the features of the holloweyed future the colonel was kept pretty well in hand as yet by his wife and though it had happened to him once or twice to come home rather late at night with a curious tendency to say the same thing twice and even three times over it had always been in very cold weather and everybody knows that no one is safe to drink a couple of glasses of wine in a warm room and go suddenly out into the cold air miss matilda sprowle sole daughter of the house had reached the age at which young ladies are supposed in technical language to have come out and thereafter are considered to be in company theres one piece o goods said the colonel to his wife that we hant disposed of nor got a customer for yet that s matildy i dont mean to set her up at vaandoo i guess she can have her pick of a dozen she s never seen anybody yet said mrs sprowle who had had a certain project for some time but had kept quiet about it lets have a party and give her a chance to show herself and see some of the young folks the colonel was not very clearheaded and he thought naturally enough that the party was his own suggestion because his remark led to the first starting of the idea he entered into the plan therefore with a feeling of pride as well as pleasure and the great project was resolved upon in a family council without a dissentient voice this was the party then to which mr bernard was going the town had been full of it for a week everybody was asked so everybody said that was invited but how in respect of those who were not asked if it had been one of the old mansionhouses that was giving a party the boundary between the favored and the slighted families would have been known pretty well beforehand and there would have been no great amount of grumbling but the colonel for all his title had a forest of poor relations and a brushwood swamp of shabby friends for he had scrambled up to fortune and now the time was come when he must define his new social position this is always an awkward business in town or country an exclusive alliance between two powers is often the same thing as a declaration of war against a third rockland was soon split into a triumphant minority invited to mrs sprowles party and a great majority uninvited of which the fraction just on the border line between recognized gentility and the level of the ungloved masses was in an active state of excitement and indignation who is she i should like to know said mrs saymore the tailors wife there was plenty of folks in rockland as good as ever sally jordan was if she had managed to pick up a merchant other folks could have married merchants if their families was nt as wealthy as them old skinflints that willed her their money etc etc mrs saymore expressed the feeling of many beside herself she had however a special right to be proud of the name she bore her husband was own cousin to the saymores of freestone avenue who write the name seymour and claim to be of the duke of somersets family showing a clear descent from the protector to edward seymour then a jump that would break a heralds neck to one seth saymore from whom to the head of the present family the line is clear again mrs saymore the tailors wife was not invited because her husband mended clothes if he had confined himself strictly to making them it would have put a different face upon the matter the landlord of the mountain house and his lady were invited to mrs sprowles party not so the landlord of pollards tahvern and his lady whereupon the latter vowed that they would have a party at their house too and made arrangements for a dance of twenty or thirty couples to be followed by an entertainment tickets to this social ball were soon circulated and being accessible to all at a moderate price admission to the elegant supper included this second festival promised to be as merry if not as select as the great party wednesday came such doings had never been heard of in rockland as went on that day at the villa the carpet had been taken up in the long room so that the young folks might have a dance miss matildas piano had been moved in and two fiddlers and a clarionetplayer engaged to make music all kinds of lamps had been put in requisition and even colored waxcandles figured on the mantelpieces the costumes of the family had been tried on the day before the colonels black suit fitted exceedingly well his ladys velvet dress displayed her contours to advantage miss matildas flowered silk was considered superb the eldest son of the family mr t jordan sprowle called affectionately and elegantly geordie voted himself stunnin and even the small youth who had borne mr bernards invitation was effective in a new jacket and trousers buttony in front and baggy in the reverse aspect as is wont to be the case with the homemade garments of inland youngsters great preparations had been made for the refection which was to be part of the entertainment there was much clinking of borrowed spoons which were to be carefully counted and much clicking of borrowed china which was to be tenderly handled for nobody in the country keeps those vast closets full of such things which one may see in rich cityhouses not a great deal could be done in the way of flowers for there were no greenhouses and few plants were out as yet but there were paper ornaments for the candlesticks and colored mats for the lamps and all the tassels of the curtains and bells were taken out of those brown linen bags in which for reasons hitherto undiscovered they are habitually concealed in some households in the remoter apartments every imaginable operation was going on at once roasting boiling baking beating rolling pounding in mortars frying freezing for there was to be icecream tonight of domestic manufacture and in the midst of all these labors mrs sprowle and miss matilda were moving about directing and helping as they best might all day long when the evening came it might be feared they would not be in just the state of mind and body to entertain company one would like to give a party now and then if one could be a billionnaire antoine i am going to have twenty people to dine today biens madame not a word or thought more about it but get home in season to dress and come down to your own table one of your own guests giuseppe we are to have a party a week from tonight five hundred invitations there is the list the day comes madam do you remember you have your party tonight why so i have everything right supper and all all as it should be madam send up victorine victorine full toilet for this evening pink diamonds and emeralds coiffeur at seven allez billionism or even millionism must be a blessed kind of state with health and clear conscience and youth and good looks but most blessed is this that it takes off all the mean cares which give people the three wrinkles between the eyebrows and leaves them free to have a good time and make others have a good time all the way along from the charity that tips up unexpected loads of wood before widows houses and leaves foundling turkeys upon poor mens doorsteps and sets lean clergymen crying at the sight of anonymous fiftydollar bills to the taste which orders a perfect banquet in such sweet accord with every sense that everybodys nature flowers out full blown in its golden glowing fragrant atmosphere a great party given by the smaller gentry of the interior is a kind of solemnity so to speak it involves so much labor and anxiety its spasmodic splendors are so violently contrasted with the homeliness of everyday familylife it is such a formidable matter to break in the raw subordinates to the manege of the cloakroom and the table there is such a terrible uncertainty in the results of unfamiliar culinary operations so many feuds are involved in drawing that fatal line which divides the invited from the uninvited fraction of the local universe that if the notes requested the pleasure of the guests company on this solemn occasion they would pretty nearly express the true state of things the colonel himself had been pressed into the service he had pounded something in the great mortar he had agitated a quantity of sweetened and thickened milk in what was called a creamfreezer at eleven oclock a m he retired for a space on returning his color was noted to be somewhat heightened and he showed a disposition to be jocular with the female help which tendency displaying itself in livelier demonstrations than were approved at headquarters led to his being detailed to outofdoor duties such as raking gravel arranging places for horses to be hitched to and assisting in the construction of an arch of wintergreen at the porch of the mansion a whiff from mr geordies cigar refreshed the toiling females from time to time for the windows had to be opened occasionally while all these operations were going on and the youth amused himself with inspecting the interior encouraging the operatives now and then in the phrases commonly employed by genteel young men for he had perused an odd volume of verdant green and was acquainted with a sophomore from one of the freshwater colleges go it on the feed exclaimed this spirited young man nothin like a good spread grub enough and good liquor thats the ticket guvnorll do the heavy polite and let me alone for polishin off the young charmers and mr geordie looked expressively at a handmaid who was rolling gingerbread as if he were rehearsing for don giovanni evening came at last and the ladies were forced to leave the scene of their labors to array themselves for the coming festivities the tables had been set in a back room the meats were ready the pickles were displayed the cake was baked the blancmange had stiffened and the icecream had frozen at half past seven oclock the colonel in costume came into the front parlor and proceeded to light the lamps some were goodhumored enough and took the hint of a lighted match at once others were as vicious as they could be would not light on any terms any more than if they were filled with water or lighted and smoked one side of the chimney or spattered a few sparks and sulked themselves out or kept up a faint show of burning so that their ground glasses looked as feebly phosphorescent as so many invalid fireflies with much coaxing and screwing and pricking a tolerable illumination was at last achieved at eight there was a grand rustling of silks and mrs and miss sprowle descended from their respective bowers or boudoirs of course they were pretty well tired by this time and very glad to sit down having the prospect before them of being obliged to stand for hours the colonel walked about the parlor inspecting his regiment of lamps by and by mr geordie entered mph mph he sniffed as he came in you smell of lampsmoke here that always galls people to have a newcomer accuse them of smoke or close air which they have got used to and do not perceive the colonel raged at the thought of his lamps smoking and tongued a few anathemas inside of his shut teeth but turned down two or three wicks that burned higher than the rest master h frederic next made his appearance with questionable marks upon his fingers and countenance had been tampering with something brown and sticky his elder brother grew playful and caught him by the baggy reverse of his more essential garment hush said mrs sprowle there s the bell everybody took position at once and began to look very smiling and altogether at ease false alarm only a parcel of spoons loaned as the inland folks say when they mean lent by a neighbor better late than never said the colonel let me heft them spoons mrs sprowle came down into her chair again as if all her bones had been bewitched out of her im pretty nigh beat out aready said she before any of the folks has come they sat silent awhile waiting for the first arrival how nervous they got and how their senses were sharpened hark said miss matilda what s that rumblin it was a cart going over a bridge more than a mile off which at any other time they would not have heard after this there was a lull and poor mrs sprowles head nodded once or twice presently a crackling and grinding of gravel how much that means when we are waiting for those whom we long or dread to see then a change in the tone of the gravelcrackling yes they have turned in at our gate theyre comin mother mother everybody in position smiling and at ease bell rings enter the first set of visitors the event of the season has begun law its nothin but the cranes folks i do believe mahala s come in that old green delaine she wore at the surprise party miss matilda had peeped through a crack of the door and made this observation and the remark founded thereon continuing her attitude of attention she overheard mrs crane and her two daughters conversing in the attiringroom up one flight how fine everything is in the great house said mrs crane jest look at the picters matildy sprowles drawins said ada azuba the eldest daughter i should think so said mahala crane her younger sister a wideawake girl who had nt been to school for nothing and performed a little on the lead pencil herself i should like to know whether thats a haycock or a mountain miss matilda winced for this must refer to her favorite monochrome executed by laying on heavy shadows and stumping them down into mellow harmony the style of drawing which is taught in six lessons and the kind of specimen which is executed in something less than one hour parents and other very near relatives are sometimes gratified with these productions and cause them to be framed and hung up as in the present instance i guess we wont go down jest yet said mrs crane as folks dont seem to have come so she began a systematic inspection of the dressingroom and its conveniences mahogany fourposter come from the jordans i calla te marseilles quilt ruffles all round the piller chintz curtings jest put up o purpose for the party ill lay ye a dollar what a nice washbowl taps it with a white knuckle belonging to a red finger stone chaney heres a brannew brush and comb and heres a scentbottle come here girls and fix yourselves in the glass and scent your pockethandkerchers and mrs crane bedewed her own kerchief with some of the eau de cologne of native manufacture said on its label to be much superior to the german article it was a relief to mrs and the miss cranes when the bell rang and the next guests were admitted deacon and mrs soper deacon soper of the rev mr fairweathers church and his lady mrs deacon soper was directed of course to the ladies dressingroom and her husband to the other apartment where gentlemen were to leave their outside coats and hats then came mr and mrs briggs and then the three miss spinneys then silas peckham head of the apollinean institute and mrs peckham and more after them until at last the ladies dressingroom got so full that one might have thought it was a trap none of them could get out of in truth they all felt a little awkwardly nobody wanted to be first to venture downstairs at last mr silas peckham thought it was time to make a move for the parlor and for this purpose presented himself at the door of the ladies dressingroom lorindy my dear he exclaimed to mrs peckham i think there can be no impropriety in our joining the family downstairs mrs peckham laid her large flaccid arm in the sharp angle made by the black sleeve which held the bony limb her husband offered and the two took the stair and struck out for the parlor the ice was broken and the dressingroom began to empty itself into the spacious lighted apartments below mr silas peckham slid into the room with mrs peckham alongside like a shad convoying a jellyfish goodevenin mrs sprowle i hope i see you well this evenin how s your haalth colonel sprowle very well much obleeged to you hope you and your good lady are well much pleased to see you hope youll enjoy yourselves weve laid out to have everything in good shape spared no trouble nor ex pence said silas peckham mrs colonel sprowle who you remember was a jordan had nipped the colonels statement in the middle of the word mr peckham finished with a look that jerked him like one of those sharp twitches women keep giving a horse when they get a chance to drive one mr and mrs crane miss ada azuba and miss mahala crane made their entrance there had been a discussion about the necessity and propriety of inviting this family the head of which kept a small shop for hats and boots and shoes the colonels casting vote had carried it in the affirmative how terribly the poor old green delaine did cut up in the blaze of so many lamps and candles deluded little wretch male or female in town or country going to your first great party how little you know the nature of the ceremony in which you are to bear the part of victim what are not these garlands and gauzy mists and manycolored streamers which adorn you is not this music which welcomes you this radiance that glows about you meant solely for your enjoyment young miss of seventeen or eighteen summers now for the first time swimming unto the frothy chatoyant sparkling undulating sea of laces and silks and satins and whitearmed flowercrowned maidens struggling in their waves beneath the lustres that make the false summer of the drawingroom stop at the threshold this is a hall of judgment you are entering the court is in session and if you move five steps forward you will be at its bar there was a tribunal once in france as you may remember called the chambre ardente the burning chamber it was hung all round with lamps and hence its name the burning chamber for the trial of young maidens is the blazing ballroom what have they fulldressed you or rather halfdressed you for do you think to make you look pretty of course why have they hung a chandelier above you flickering all over with flames so that it searches you like the noonday sun and your deepest dimple cannot hold a shadow to give brilliancy to the gay scene no doubt no my clear society is inspecting you and it finds undisguised surfaces and strong lights a convenience in the process the dance answers the purpose of the revolving pedestal upon which the white captive turns to show us the soft kneaded marble which looks as if it had never been hard in all its manifold aspects of living loveliness no mercy for you my love justice strict justice you shall certainly have neither more nor less for look you there are dozens scores hundreds with whom you must be weighed in the balance and you have got to learn that the struggle for life mr charles darwin talks about reaches to vertebrates clad in crinoline as well as to mollusks in shells or articulates in jointed scales or anything that fights for breathingroom and food and love in any coat of fur or feather happy they who can flash defiance from bright eyes and snowy shoulders back into the pendants of the insolent lustres miss mahala crane did not have these reflections and no young girl ever did or ever will thank heaven her keen eyes sparkled under her plainly parted hair and the green delaine moulded itself in those unmistakable lines of natural symmetry in which nature indulges a small shopkeepers daughter occasionally as well as a wholesale dealers young ladies she would have liked a new dress as much as any other girl but she meant to go and have a good time at any rate the guests were now arriving in the drawingroom pretty fast and the colonels hand began to burn a good deal with the sharp squeezes which many of the visitors gave it conversation which had begun like a summershower in scattering drops was fast becoming continuous and occasionally rising into gusty swells with now and then a broadchested laugh from some captain or major or other military personage for it may be noted that all large and loud men in the unpaved districts bear military titles deacon soper came up presently and entered into conversation with colonel sprowle i hope to see our pastor present this evenin said the deacon i dont feel quite sure the colonel answered his dyspepsy has been bad on him lately he wrote to say that providence permittin it would be agreeable to him to take a part in the exercises of the evenin but i mistrusted he did nt mean to come to tell the truth deacon soper i rather guess he dont like the idee of dancin and some of the other little arrangements well said the deacon i know theres some condemns dancin ive heerd a good deal of talk about it among the folks round some have it that it never brings a blessin on a house to have dancin in it judge tileston died you remember within a month after he had his great ball twelve year ago and some thought it was in the natur of a judgment i dont believe in any of them notions if a man happened to be struck dead the night after hed been givin a ball the colonel loosened his black stock a little and winked and swallowed two or three times i should nt call it a judgment i should call it a coincidence but i m a little afraid our pastor wont come somethin or others the matter with mr fairweather i should sooner expect to see the old doctor come over out of the orthodox parsonagehouse ive asked him said the colonel well said deacon soper he said he should like to come but he did nt know what his people would say for his part he loved to see young folks havin their sports together and very often felt as if he should like to be one of em himself but says i doctor i dont say there wont be a little dancin dont says he for i want letty to go shes his granddaughter thats been stayin with him and letty s mighty fond of dancin you know says the doctor it is nt my business to settle whether other peoples children should dance or not and the doctor looked as if he should like to rigadoon and sashy across as well as the young one he was talkin about he s got blood in him the old doctor has i wish our little man and him would swop pulpits deacon soper started and looked up into the colonels face as if to see whether he was in earnest mr silas peckham and his lady joined the group is this to be a temperance celebration mrs sprowle asked mr silas peckham mrs sprowle replied that there would be lemonade and srub for those that preferred such drinks but that the colonel had given folks to understand that he did nt mean to set in judgment on the marriage in canaan and that those that didnt like srub and such things would find somethin that would suit them better deacon sopers countenance assumed a certain air of restrained cheerfulness the conversation rose into one of its gusty paroxysms just then master h frederic got behind a door and began performing the experiment of stopping and unstopping his ears in rapid alternation greatly rejoicing in the singular effect of mixed conversation chopped very small like the contents of a mincepie or meatpie as it is more forcibly called in the deeprutted villages lying along the unsalted streams all at once it grew silent just round the door where it had been loudest and the silence spread itself like a stain till it hushed everything but a few cornerduets a dark sadlooking middleaged gentleman entered the parlor with a young lady on his arm his daughter as it seemed for she was not wholly unlike him in feature and of the same dark complexion dudley venner exclaimed a dozen people in startled but halfsuppressed tones what can have brought dudley out tonight said jefferson buck a young fellow who had been interrupted in one of the cornerduets which he was executing in concert with miss susy pettingill how do i know jeff was miss susys answer then after a pause elsie made him come i guess go ask dr kittredge he knows all about em both they say dr kittredge the leading physician of rockland was a shrewd old man who looked pretty keenly into his patients through his spectacles and pretty widely at men women and things in general over them sixtythree years old just the year of the grand climacteric a bald crown as every doctor should have a consulting practitioners mouth that is movable round the corners while the case is under examination but both corners well drawn down and kept so when the final opinion is made up in fact the doctor was often sent for to act as caounsel all over the county and beyond it he kept three or four horses sometimes riding in the saddle commonly driving in a sulky pretty fast and looking straight before him so that people got out of the way of bowing to him as he passed on the road there was some talk about his not being so longsighted as other folks but his old patients laughed and looked knowing when this was spoken of the doctor knew a good many things besides how to drop tinctures and shake out powders thus he knew a horse and what is harder to understand a horsedealer and was a match for him he knew what a nervous woman is and how to manage her he could tell at a glance when she is in that condition of unstable equilibrium in which a rough word is like a blow to her and the touch of unmagnetized fingers reverses all her nervous currents it is not everybody that enters into the soul of mozarts or beethovens harmonies and there are vital symphonies in b flat and other low sad keys which a doctor may know as little of as a hurdygurdy player of the essence of those divine musical mysteries the doctor knew the difference between what men say and what they mean as well as most people when he was listening to common talk he was in the habit of looking over his spectacles if he lifted his head so as to look through them at the person talking he was busier with that persons thoughts than with his words jefferson buck was not bold enough to confront the doctor with miss susys question for he did not look as if he were in the mood to answer queries put by curious young people his eyes were fixed steadily on the dark girl every movement of whom he seemed to follow she was indeed an apparition of wild beauty so unlike the girls about her that it seemed nothing more than natural that when she moved the groups should part to let her pass through them and that she should carry the centre of all looks and thoughts with her she was dressed to please her own fancy evidently with small regard to the modes declared correct by the rockland milliners and mantuamakers her heavy black hair lay in a braided coil with a long gold pin shat through it like a javelin round her neck was a golden torque a round cordlike chain such as the gaols used to wear the dying gladiator has it her dress was a grayish watered silk her collar was pinned with a flashing diamond brooch the stones looking as fresh as morning dewdrops but the silver setting of the past generation her arms were bare round but slender rather than large in keeping with her lithe round figure on her wrists she wore bracelets one was a circlet of enamelled scales the other looked as if it might have been cleopatras asp with its body turned to gold and its eyes to emeralds her father for dudley venner was her father looked like a man of culture and breeding but melancholy and with a distracted air as one whose life had met some fatal cross or blight he saluted hardly anybody except his entertainers and the doctor one would have said to look at him that he was not at the party by choice and it was natural enough to think with susy pettingill that it must have been a freak of the dark girls which brought him there for he had the air of a shy and sadhearted recluse it was hard to say what could have brought elsie venner to the party hardly anybody seemed to know her and she seemed not at all disposed to make acquaintances here and there was one of the older girls from the institute but she appeared to have nothing in common with them even in the schoolroom it may be remembered she sat apart by her own choice and now in the midst of the crowd she made a circle of isolation round herself drawing her arm out of her fathers she stood against the wall and looked with a strange cold glitter in her eyes at the crowd which moved and babbled before her the old doctor came up to her by and by well elsie i am quite surprised to find you here do tell me how you happened to do such a goodnatured thing as to let us see you at such a great party its been dull at the mansionhouse she said and i wanted to get out of it its too lonely there theres nobody to hate since dicks gone the doctor laughed goodnaturedly as if this were an amusing bit of pleasantry but he lifted his head and dropped his eyes a little so as to see her through his spectacles she narrowed her lids slightly as one often sees a sleepy cat narrow hers somewhat as you may remember our famous margaret used to if you remember her at all so that her eyes looked very small but bright as the diamonds on her breast the old doctor felt very oddly as she looked at him be did not like the feeling so he dropped his head and lifted his eyes and looked at her over his spectacles again and how have you all been at the mansion house said the doctor oh well enough but dicks gone and theres nobody left but dudley and i and the people im tired of it what kills anybody quickest doctor then in a whisper i ran away again the other day you know where did you go the doctor spoke in a low serious tone oh to the old place here i brought this for you the doctor started as she handed him a flower of the atragene americana for he knew that there was only one spot where it grew and that not one where any rash foot least of all a thinshod womans foot should venture how long were you gone said the doctor only one night you should have heard the horns blowing and the guns firing dudley was frightened out of his wits old sophy told him shed had a dream and that i should be found in deadmans hollow with a great rock lying on me they hunted all over it but they did nt find me i was farther up doctor kittredge looked cloudy and worried while she was speaking but forced a pleasant professional smile as he said cheerily and as if wishing to change the subject have a good dance this evening elsie the fiddlers are tuning up where s the young master has he come yet or is he going to be late with the other great folks the girl turned away without answering and looked toward the door the great folks meaning the mansionhouse gentry were just beginning to come dudley venner and his daughter had been the first of them judge thornton whiteheaded freshfaced as good at sixty as he was at forty with a youngish second wife and one noble daughter arabella who they said knew as much law as her father a stately portia like girl fit for a premiers wife not like to find her match even in the great cities she sometimes visited the trecothicks the family of a merchant in the larger sense who having made himself rich enough by the time he had reached middle life threw down his ledger as sylla did his dagger and retired to make a little paradise around him in one of the stateliest residences of the town a family inheritance the vaughans an old rockland race descended from its first settlers toryish in tendency in revolutionary times and barely escaping confiscation or worse the dunhams a new family dating its gentility only as far back as the honorable washington dunham m c but turning out a clever boy or two that went to college and some showy girls with white necks and fat arms who had picked up professional husbands these were the principal mansionhouse people all of them had made it a point to come and as each of them entered it seemed to colonel and mrs sprowle that the lamps burned up with a more cheerful light and that the fiddles which sounded from the uncarpeted room were all half a tone higher and half a beat quicker mr bernard came in later than any of them he had been busy with his new duties he looked well and that is saying a good deal for nothing but a gentleman is endurable in full dress hair that masses well a head set on with an air a neckerchief tied cleverly by an easy practised hand closefitting gloves feet well shaped and well covered these advantages can make us forgive the odious sable broadcloth suit which appears to have been adopted by society on the same principle that condemned all the venetian gondolas to perpetual and uniform blackness mr bernard introduced by mr geordie made his bow to the colonel and his lady and to miss matilda from whom he got a particularly gracious curtsy and then began looking about him for acquaintances he found two or three faces he knew many more strangers there was silas peckham there was no mistaking him there was the inelastic amplitude of mrs peckham few of the apollinean girls of course they not being recognized members of society but there is one with the flame in her cheeks and the fire in her eyes the girl of vigorous tints and emphatic outlines whom we saw entering the schoolroom the other day old judge thornton has his eyes on her and the colonel steals a look every now and then at the red brooch which lifts itself so superbly into the light as if he thought it a wonderfully becoming ornament mr bernard himself was not displeased with the general effect of the richblooded schoolgirl as she stood under the bright lamps fanning herself in the warm languid air fixed in a kind of passionate surprise at the new life which seemed to be flowering out in her consciousness perhaps he looked at her somewhat steadily as some others had done at any rate she seemed to feel that she was looked at as people often do and turning her eyes suddenly on him caught his own on her face gave him a halfbashful smile and threw in a blush involuntarily which made it more charming what can i do better he said to himself than have a dance with rosa milburn so he carried his handsome pupil into the next room and took his place with her in a cotillon whether the breath of the goddess of love could intoxicate like the cup of circe whether a woman is ever phosphorescent with the luminous vapor of life that she exhales these and other questions which relate to occult influences exercised by certain women we will not now discuss it is enough that mr bernard was sensible of a strange fascination not wholly new to him nor unprecedented in the history of human experience but always a revelation when it comes over us for the first or the hundredth time so pale is the most recent memory by the side of the passing moment with the flush of any newborn passion on its cheek remember that nature makes every man love all women and trusts the trivial matter of special choice to the commonest accident if mr bernard had had nothing to distract his attention he might have thought too much about his handsome partner and then gone home and dreamed about her which is always dangerous and waked up thinking of her still and then begun to be deeply interested in her studies and so on through the whole syllogism which ends in natures supreme quod erat demonstrandum what was there to distract him or disturb him he did not know but there was something this sumptuous creature this eve just within the gate of an untried paradise untutored in the ways of the world but on tiptoe to reach the fruit of the tree of knowledge alive to the moist vitality of that warm atmosphere palpitating with voices and music as the flower of some dioecious plant which has grown in a lone corner and suddenly unfolding its corolla on some hotbreathing june evening feels that the air is perfumed with strange odors and loaded with golden dust wafted from those other blossoms with which its double life is shared this almost overwomanized woman might well have bewitched him but that he had a vague sense of a countercharm it was perhaps only the same consciousness that some one was looking at him which he himself had just given occasion to in his partner presently in one of the turns of the dance he felt his eyes drawn to a figure he had not distinctly recognized though he had dimly felt its presence and saw that elsie venner was looking at him as if she saw nothing else but him he was not a nervous person like the poor ladyteacher yet the glitter of the diamond eyes affected him strangely it seemed to disenchant the air so full a moment before of strange attractions he became silent and dreamy as it were the roundlimbed beauty at his side crushed her gauzy draperies against him as they trod the figure of the dance together but it was no more to him than if an old nurse had laid her hand on his sleeve the young girl chafed at his seeming neglect and her imperious blood mounted into her cheeks but he appeared unconscious of it there is one of our young ladies i must speak to he said and was just leaving his partners side four hands all round shouted the first violin and mr bernard found himself seized and whirled in a circle out of which he could not escape and then forced to cross over and then to dozy do as the maestro had it and when on getting back to his place he looked for elsie venner she was gone the dancing went on briskly some of the old folks looked on others conversed in groups and pairs and so the evening wore along until a little after ten oclock about this time there was noticed an increased bustle in the passages with a considerable opening and shutting of doors presently it began to be whispered about that they were going to have supper many who had never been to any large party before held their breath for a moment at this announcement it was rather with a tremulous interest than with open hilarity that the rumor was generally received one point the colonel had entirely forgotten to settle it was a point involving not merely propriety but perhaps principle also or at least the good report of the house and he had never thought to arrange it he took judge thornton aside and whispered the important question to him in his distress of mind mistaking pockets and taking out his bandanna instead of his white handkerchief to wipe his forehead judge he said do you think that before we commence refreshing ourselves at the tables it would be the proper thing to crave a to request deacon soper or some other elderly person to ask a blessing the judge looked as grave as if he were about giving the opinion of the court in the great indiarubber case on the whole he answered after a pause i should think it might perhaps be dispensed with on this occasion young folks are noisy and it is awkward to have talking and laughing going on while blessing is being asked unless a clergyman is present and makes a point of it i think it will hardly be expected the colonel was infinitely relieved judge will you take mrs sprowle in to supper and the colonel returned the compliment by offering his arm to mrs judge thornton the door of the supperroom was now open and the company following the lead of the host and hostess began to stream into it until it was pretty well filled there was an awful kind of pause many were beginning to drop their heads and shut their eyes in anticipation of the usual petition before a meal some expected the music to strike up others that an oration would now be delivered by the colonel make yourselves at home ladies and gentlemen said the colonel good things were made to eat and youre welcome to all you see before you so saying he attacked a huge turkey which stood at the head of the table and his example being followed first by the bold then by the doubtful and lastly by the timid the clatter soon made the circuit of the tables some were shocked however as the colonel had feared they would be at the want of the customary invocation widow leech a kind of relation who had to be invited and who came with her old backcountrylooking string of gold beads round her neck seemed to feel very serious about it if shed ha known that folks would begrutch cravin a blessin over sech a heap o provisions shed rather ha staid t home it was a bad sign when folks was nt grateful for the baounties of providence the elder miss spinney to whom she made this remark assented to it at the same time ogling a piece of frosted cake which she presently appropriated with great refinement of manner taking it between her thumb and forefinger keeping the others well spread and the little finger in extreme divergence with a graceful undulation of the neck and a queer little sound in her throat as of an m that wanted to get out and perished in the attempt the tables now presented an animated spectacle young fellows of the more dashing sort with high standup collars and voluminous bows to their neckerchiefs distinguished themselves by cutting up fowls and offering portions thereof to the buxom girls these knowing ones had commonly selected a bit of the wing roxy or of the under limb the first laugh broke out at this but it was premature a sporadic laugh as dr kittredge would have said which did not become epidemic people were very solemn as yet many of them being new to such splendid scenes and crushed as it were in the presence of so much crockery and so many silver spoons and such a variety of unusual viands and beverages when the laugh rose around roxy and her saucy beau several looked in that direction with an anxious expression as if something had happened a lady fainted for instance or a couple of lively fellows come to high words young folks will be young folks said deacon soper no harm done least said soonest mended have some of these shelloysters said the colonel to mrs trecothick a delicate emphasis on the word shell implied that the colonel knew what was what to the new england inland native beyond the reach of the east winds the oyster unconditioned the oyster absolute without a qualifying adjective is the pickled oyster mrs trecothick who knew very well that an oyster long out of his shell as is apt to be the case with the rural bivalve gets homesick and loses his sprightliness replied with the pleasantest smile in the world that the chicken she had been helped to was too delicate to be given up even for the greater rarity but the word shelloysters had been overheard and there was a perceptible crowding movement towards their newly discovered habitat a large souptureen silas peckham had meantime fallen upon another locality of these recent mollusks he said nothing but helped himself freely and made a sign to mrs peckham lorindy he whispered shelloysters and ladled them out to her largely without betraying any emotion just as if they had been the natural inland or pickled article after the more solid portion of the banquet had been duly honored the cakes and sweet preparations of various kinds began to get their share of attention there were great cakes and little cakes cakes with raisins in them cakes with currants and cakes without either there were brown cakes and yellow cakes frosted cakes glazed cakes hearts and rounds and jumbles which playful youth slip over the forefinger before spoiling their annular outline there were mounds of blomonje of the arrowroot variety that being undistinguishable from such as is made with russia isinglass there were jellies which had been shaking all the time the young folks were dancing in the next room as if they were balancing to partners there were builtup fabrics called charlottes caky externally pulpy within there were also marangs and likewise custards some of the indolentfluid sort others firm in which every stroke of the teaspoon left a smooth conchoidal surface like the fracture of chalcedony with here and there a little eye like what one sees in cheeses nor was that most wonderful object of domestic art called trifle wanting with its charming confusion of cream and cake and almonds and jam and jelly and wine and cinnamon and froth nor yet the marvellous floatingisland name suggestive of all that is romantic in the imaginations of youthful palates it must have cost you a sight of work to say nothin of money to get all this beautiful confectionery made for the party said mrs crane to mrs sprowle well it cost some considable labor no doubt said mrs sprowle matilda and our girls and i made most all the cake with our own hands and we all feel some tired but if folks get what suits em we dont begrudge the time nor the work but i do feel thirsty said the poor lady and i think a glass of srub would do my throat good its dreadful dry mr peckham would you be so polite as to pass me a glass of srub silas peckham bowed with great alacrity and took from the table a small glass cup containing a fluid reddish in hue and subacid in taste this was srub a beverage in local repute of questionable nature but suspected of owing its tint and sharpness to some kind of syrup derived from the marooncolored fruit of the sumac there were similar small cups on the table filled with lemonade and here and there a decanter of madeira wine of the marsala kind which some prefer to and many more cannot distinguish from that which comes from the atlantic island take a glass of wine judge said the colonel here is an article that i rather think ll suit you the judge knew something of wines and could tell all the famous old madeiras from each other eclipse juno the almost fabulously scarce and precious whitetop and the rest he struck the nativity of the mediterranean madeira before it had fairly moistened his lip a sound wine colonel and i should think of a genuine vintage your very good health deacon soper said the colonel here is some madary judge thornton recommends let me fill you a glass of it the deacons eyes glistened he was one of those consistent christians who stick firmly by the first miracle and pauls advice to timothy a little good wine wont hurt anybody said the deacon plenty plenty plenty there he had not withdrawn his glass while the colonel was pouring for fear it should spill and now it was running over it is very odd how all a mans philosophy and theology are at the mercy of a few drops of a fluid which the chemists say consists of nothing but c o h the deacons theology fell off several points towards latitudinarianism in the course of the next ten minutes he had a deep inward sense that everything was as it should be human nature included the little accidents of humanity known collectively to moralists as sin looked very venial to his growing sense of universal brotherhood and benevolence it will all come right the deacon said to himself i feel a joyful conviction that everything is for the best i am favored with a blessed peace of mind and a very precious season of good feelin toward my fellowcreturs a lusty young fellow happened to make a quick step backward just at that instant and put his heel with his weight on top of it upon the deacons toes aigh what the d d didos are y abaout with them great huffs o yourn said the deacon with an expression upon his features not exactly that of peace and goodwill to men the lusty young fellow apologized but the deacons face did not come right and his theology backed round several points in the direction of total depravity some of the dashing young men in standup collars and extensive neckties encouraged by mr geordie made quite free with the ma dary and even induced some of the more stylish girls not of the mansionhouse set but of the tiptop twostory families to taste a little most of these young ladies made faces at it and declared it was perfectly horrid with that aspect of veracity peculiar to their age and sex about this time a movement was made on the part of some of the mansionhouse people to leave the suppertable miss jane trecothick had quietly hinted to her mother that she had had enough of it miss arabella thornton had whispered to her father that he had better adjourn this court to the next room there were signs of migration a loosening of people in their places a looking about for arms to hitch on to stop said the colonel theres something coming yet icecream the great folks saw that the play was not over yet and that it was only polite to stay and see it out the word icecream was no sooner whispered than it passed from one to another all down the tables the effect was what might have been anticipated many of the guests had never seen this celebrated product of human skill and to all the twostory population of rockland it was the last expression of the art of pleasing and astonishing the human palate its appearance had been deferred for several reasons first because everybody would have attacked it if it had come in with the other luxuries secondly because undue apprehensions were entertained owing to want of experience of its tendency to deliquesce and resolve itself with alarming rapidity into puddles of creamy fluid and thirdly because the surprise would make a grand climax to finish off the banquet there is something so audacious in the conception of icecream that it is not strange that a population undebauched by the luxury of great cities looks upon it with a kind of awe and speaks of it with a certain emotion this defiance of the seasons forcing nature to do her work of congelation in the face of her sultriest noon might well inspire a timid mind with fear lest human art were revolting against the higher powers and raise the same scruples which resisted the use of ether and chloroform in certain contingencies whatever may be the cause it is well known that the announcement at any private rural entertainment that there is to be icecream produces an immediate and profound impression it may be remarked as aiding this impression that exaggerated ideas are entertained as to the dangerous effects this congealed food may produce on persons not in the most robust health there was silence as the pyramids of ice were placed on the table everybody looking on in admiration the colonel took a knife and assailed the one at the head of the table when he tried to cut off a slice it didnt seem to understand it however and only tipped as if it wanted to upset the colonel attacked it on the other side and it tipped just as badly the other way it was awkward for the colonel permit me said the judge and he took the knife and struck a sharp slanting stroke which sliced off a piece just of the right size and offered it to mrs sprowle this act of dexterity was much admired by the company the tables were all alive again lorindy heres a plate of icecream said silas peckham come mahaly said a freshlooking youngfellow with a saucerful in each hand heres your icecream lets go in the corner and have a celebration us two and the old green delame with the young curves under it to make it sit well moved off as pleased apparently as if it had been silk velvet with thousanddollar laces over it oh now miss green do you think its safe to put that cold stuff into your stomick said the widow leech to a young married lady who finding the air rather warm thought a little ice would cool her down very nicely its jest like eatin snowballs you dont look very rugged and i should be dreadful afeard if i was you carrie said old dr kittredge who had overheard this how well youre looking this evening but you must be tired and heated sit down here and let me give you a good slice of icecream how you young folks do grow up to be sure i dont feel quite certain whether its you or your older sister but i know it s somebody i call carrie and that i ve known ever since a sound something between a howl and an oath startled the company and broke off the doctors sentence everybodys eyes turned in the direction from which it came a group instantly gathered round the person who had uttered it who was no other than deacon soper hes chokin hes chokin was the first exclamation slap him on the back several heavy fists beat such a tattoo on his spine that the deacon felt as if at least one of his vertebrae would come up hes black in the face said widow leech he s swallered somethin the wrong way wheres the doctor let the doctor get to him cant ye if you will move my good lady perhaps i can said doctor kittredge in a calm tone of voice hes not choking my friends the doctor added immediately when he got sight of him it s apoplexy i told you so dont you see how red he is in the face said old mrs peake a famous woman for nussin sick folks determined to be a little ahead of the doctor its not apoplexy said dr kittredge what is it doctor what is it will he die is he dead heres his poor wife the widow soper that is to be if she ant aready do be quiet my good woman said dr kittredge nothing serious i think mrs soper deacon the sudden attack of deacon soper had begun with the extraordinary sound mentioned above his features had immediately assumed an expression of intense pain his eyes staring wildly and clapping his hands to his face he had rocked his head backward and forward in speechless agony at the doctors sharp appeal the deacon lifted his head its all right said the doctor as soon as he saw his face the deacon had a smart attack of neuralgic pain that s all very severe but not at all dangerous the doctor kept his countenance but his diaphragm was shaking the change in iris waistcoatpockets with subterranean laughter he had looked through his spectacles and seen at once what had happened the deacon not being in the habit of taking his nourishment in the congealed state had treated the icecream as a pudding of a rare species and to make sure of doing himself justice in its distribution had taken a large mouthful of it without the least precaution the consequence was a sensation as if a dentist were killing the nerves of twentyfive teeth at once with hot irons or cold ones which would hurt rather worse the deacon swallowed something with a spasmodic effort and recovered pretty soon and received the congratulations of his friends there were different versions of the expressions he had used at the onset of his complaint some of the reported exclamations involving a breach of propriety to say the least but it was agreed that a man in an attack of neuralgy wasnt to be judged of by the rules that applied to other folks the company soon after this retired from the supperroom the mansionhouse gentry took their leave and the twostory people soon followed mr bernard had stayed an hour or two and left soon after he found that elsie venner and her father had disappeared as he passed by the dormitory of the institute he saw a light glimmering from one of its upper rooms where the ladyteacher was still waking his heart ached when he remembered that through all these hours of gayety or what was meant for it the patient girl had been at work in her little chamber and he looked up at the silent stars as if to see that they were watching over her the planet mars was burning like a red coal the northern constellation was slanting downward about its central point of flame and while he looked a falling star slid from the zenith and was lost he reached his chamber and was soon dreaming over the event of the season chapter viii the morning after colonel sprowles family arose late the next morning the fatigues and excitements of the evening and the preparation for it were followed by a natural collapse of which somnolence was a leading symptom the sun shone into the window at a pretty well opened angle when the colonel first found himself sufficiently awake to address his yet slumbering spouse sally said the colonel in a voice that was a little husky for he had finished off the evening with an extra glass or two of madary and had a somewhat rusty and headachy sense of renewed existence on greeting the rather advanced dawn sally take care o them custardcups there they go poor mrs sprowle was fighting the party over in her dream and as the visionary custardcups crashed down through one lobe of her brain into another she gave a start as if an inch of lightning from a quart leyden jar had jumped into one of her knuckles with its sudden and lively poonk sally said the colonel wake up wake up what r y dreamin abaout mrs sprowle raised herself by a sort of spasm sur son seant as they say in france up on end as we have it in new england she looked first to the left then to the right then straight before her apparently without seeing anything and at last slowly settled down with her two eyes blank of any particular meaning directed upon the colonel what time is t she said ten oclock what y been dreamin abaout y giv a jump like a hoppergrass wake up wake up th party s over and y been asleep all the mornin the partys over i tell ye wake up over said mrs sprowle who began to define her position at last over i should think t was time t was over its lasted a hundud year ive been workin for that party longer n methuselahs lifetime sence i been asleep the pies would n bake and the blomonje would n set and the icecream would n freeze and all the folks kep comin n comin n comin everybody i ever knew in all my life some of em s been dead this twenty year n more n nothin for em to eat nor drink the fire would n burn to cook anything all we could do we blowed with the belluses n we stuffed in paper n pitchpine kindlins but nothin could make that fire burn n all the time the folks kep comin as if theyd never stop n nothin for em but empty dishes n all the borrowed chaney slippin round on the waiters n chippin n crackin i would n go through what i been through tnight for all th money in th bank i do believe its harder t have a party than t mrs sprowle stated the case strongly the colonel said he did nt know how that might be she was a better judge than he was it was bother enough anyhow and he was glad that it was over after this the worthy pair commenced preparations for rejoining the waking world and in due time proceeded downstairs everybody was late that morning and nothing had got put to rights the house looked as if a small army had been quartered in it over night the tables were of course in huge disorder after the protracted assault they had undergone there had been a great battle evidently and it had gone against the provisions some points had been stormed and all their defences annihilated but here and there were centres of resistance which had held out against all attacks large rounds of beef and solid loaves of cake against which the inexperienced had wasted their energies in the enthusiasm of youth or uninformed maturity while the longerheaded guests were making discoveries of shelloysters and patridges and similar delicacies the breakfast was naturally of a somewhat fragmentary character a chicken that had lost his legs in the service of the preceding campaign was once more put on duty a great ham stuck with cloves as saint sebastian was with arrows was again offered for martyrdom it would have been a pleasant sight for a medical man of a speculative turn to have seen the prospect before the colonels family of the next weeks breakfasts dinners and suppers the trail that one of these great rural parties leaves after it is one of its most formidable considerations every doorhandle in the house is suggestive of sweetmeats for the next week at least the most unnatural articles of diet displace the frugal but nutritious food of unconvulsed periods of existence if there is a walking infant about the house it will certainly have a more or less fatal fit from overmuch of some indigestible delicacy before the week is out everybody will be tired to death of sugary forms of nourishment and long to see the last of the remnants of the festival the family had not yet arrived at this condition on the contrary the first inspection of the tables suggested the prospect of days of unstinted luxury and the younger portion of the household especially were in a state of great excitement as the account of stock was taken with reference to future internal investments some curious facts came to light during these researches wheres all the oranges gone to said mrs sprowle i expected thered be ever so many of em left i did nt see many of the folks eatin oranges wheres the skins of em there ought to be six dozen orangeskins round on the plates and there ant one dozen and all the small cakes too and all the sugar things that was stuck on the big cakes has anybody counted the spoons some of em got swallered perhaps i hope they was plated ones if they did the failure of the mornings orangecrop and the deficit in other expected residual delicacies were not very difficult to account for in many of the twostory rockland families and in those favored households of the neighboring villages whose members had been invited to the great party there was a very general excitement among the younger people on the morning after the great event did y bring home somethin from the party what is it what is it is it frutcake is it nuts and oranges and apples give me some give me some such a concert of treble voices uttering accents like these had not been heard since the great temperance festival with the celebrated colation in the open air under the trees of the parnassian grove as the place was christened by the young ladies of the institute the cry of the children was not in vain from the pockets of demure fathers from the bags of sharpeyed spinsters from the folded handkerchiefs of lightfingered sisters from the tall hats of slywinking brothers there was a resurrection of the missing oranges and cakes and sugarthings in many a rejoicing familycircle enough to astonish the most hardened caterer that ever contracted to feed a thousand people under canvas the tender recollections of those dear little ones whom extreme youth or other pressing considerations detain from scenes of festivity a trait of affection by no means uncommon among our thoughtful people dignifies those social meetings where it is manifested and sheds a ray of sunshine on our common nature it is an oasis in the desert to use the striking expression of the last years valedictorian of the apollinean institute in the midst of so much that is purely selfish it is delightful to meet such disinterested care for others when a large family of children are expecting a parents return from an entertainment it will often require great exertions on his part to freight himself so as to meet their reasonable expectations a few rules are worth remembering by all who attend anniversary dinners in faneuil hall or elsewhere thus lobsters claws are always acceptable to children of all ages oranges and apples are to be taken one at a time until the coatpockets begin to become inconveniently heavy cakes are injured by sitting upon them it is therefore well to carry a stout tin box of a size to hold as many pieces as there are children in the domestic circle a very pleasant amusement at the close of one of these banquets is grabbing for the flowers with which the table is embellished these will please the ladies at home very greatly and if the children are at the same time abundantly supplied with fruits nuts cakes and any little ornamental articles of confectionery which are of a nature to be unostentatiously removed the kindhearted parent will make a whole household happy without any additional expense beyond the outlay for his ticket there were fragmentary delicacies enough left of one kind and another at any rate to make all the colonels family uncomfortable for the next week it bid fair to take as long to get rid of the remains of the great party as it had taken to make ready for it in the mean time mr bernard had been dreaming as young men dream of gliding shapes with bright eyes and burning cheeks strangely blended with red planets and hissing meteors and shining over all the white unwandering star of the north girt with its tethered constellations after breakfast he walked into the parlor where he found miss darley she was alone and holding a schoolbook in her hand was at work with one of the mornings lessons she hardly noticed him as he entered being very busy with her book and he paused a moment before speaking and looked at her with a kind of reverence it would not have been strictly true to call her beautiful for years since her earliest womanhood those slender hands had taken the bread which repaid the toil of heart and brain from the coarse palms which offered it in the worlds rude market it was not for herself alone that she had bartered away the life of her youth that she had breathed the hot air of schoolrooms that she had forced her intelligence to posture before her will as the exigencies of her place required waking to mental labor sleeping to dream of problems rolling up the stone of education for an endless twelvemonths term to find it at the bottom of the hill again when another year called her to its renewed duties schooling her temper in unending inward and outward conflicts until neither dulness nor obstinacy nor ingratitude nor insolence could reach her serene selfpossession not for herself alone poorly as her prodigal labors were repaid in proportion to the waste of life they cost her value was too well established to leave her without what under other circumstances would have been a more than sufficient compensation but there were others who looked to her in their need and so the modest fountain which might have been filled to its brim was continually drained through silentflowing hidden sluices out of such a life inherited from a race which had lived in conditions not unlike her own beauty in the common sense of the term could hardly find leisure to develop and shape itself for it must be remembered that symmetry and elegance of features and figure like perfectly formed crystals in the mineral world are reached only by insuring a certain necessary repose to individuals and to generations human beauty is an agricultural product in the country growing up in men and women as in corn and cattle where the soil is good it is a luxury almost monopolized by the rich in cities bred under glass like their forced pineapples and peaches both in city and country the evolution of the physical harmonies which make music to our eyes requires a combination of favorable circumstances of which alternations of unburdened tranquillity with intervals of varied excitement of mind and body are among the most important where sufficient excitement is wanting as often happens in the country the features however rich in red and white get heavy and the movements sluggish where excitement is furnished in excess as is frequently the case in cities the contours and colors are impoverished and the nerves begin to make their existence known to the consciousness as the face very soon informs us helen darley could not in the nature of things have possessed the kind of beauty which pleases the common taste her eye was calm sadlooking her features very still except when her pleasant smile changed them for a moment all her outlines were delicate her voice was very gentle but somewhat subdued by years of thoughtful labor and on her smooth forehead one little hinted line whispered already that care was beginning to mark the trace which time sooner or later would make a furrow she could not be a beauty if she had been it would have been much harder for many persons to be interested in her for although in the abstract we all love beauty and although if we were sent naked souls into some ultramundane warehouse of soulless bodies and told to select one to our liking we should each choose a handsome one and never think of the consequences it is quite certain that beauty carries an atmosphere of repulsion as well as of attraction with it alike in both sexes we may be well assured that there are many persons who no more think of specializing their love of the other sex upon one endowed with signal beauty than they think of wanting great diamonds or thousanddollar horses no man or woman can appropriate beauty without paying for it in endowments in fortune in position in selfsurrender or other valuable stock and there are a great many who are too poor too ordinary too humble too busy too proud to pay any of these prices for it so the unbeautiful get many more lovers than the beauties only as there are more of them their lovers are spread thinner and do not make so much show the young master stood looking at helen darley with a kind of tender admiration she was such a picture of the martyr by the slow social combustive process that it almost seemed to him he could see a pale lambent nimbus round her head i did not see you at the great party last evening he said presently she looked up and answered no i have not much taste for such large companies besides i do not feel as if my time belonged to me after it has been paid for there is always something to do some lesson or exercise and it so happened i was very busy last night with the new problems in geometry i hope you had a good time very two or three of our girls were there rosa milburn what a beauty she is i wonder what she feeds on wine and musk and chloroform and coals of fire i believe i didnt think there was such color and flavor in a woman outside the tropics miss darley smiled rather faintly the imagery was not just to her taste femineity often finds it very hard to accept the fact of muliebrity was she stopped short but her question had asked itself elsie there she was for an hour or so she looked frightfully handsome i meant to have spoken to her but she slipped away before i knew it i thought she meant to go to the party said miss darley did she look at you she did why and you did not speak to her no i should have spoken to her but she was gone when i looked for her a strange creature is nt there an odd sort of fascination about her you have not explained all the mystery about the girl what does she come to this school for she seems to do pretty much as she likes about studying miss darley answered in very low tones it was a fancy of hers to come and they let her have her way i dont know what there is about her except that she seems to take my life out of me when she looks at me i dont like to ask other people about our girls she says very little to anybody and studies or makes believe to study almost what she likes i dont know what she is miss darley laid her hand trembling on the young masters sleeve but i can tell when she is in the room without seeing or hearing her oh mr langdon i am weak and nervous and no doubt foolish but if there were women now as in the days of our saviour possessed of devils i should think there was something not human looking out of elsie venners eyes the poor girls breast rose and fell tumultuously as she spoke and her voice labored as if some obstruction were rising in her throat a scene might possibly have come of it but the door opened mr silas peckham miss darley got away as soon as she well could why did not miss darley go to the party last evening said mr bernard well the fact is answered mr silas peckham miss darley shes pooty much took up with the school shes an industris young woman yis she is industris but perhaps she ant quite so spry a worker as some maybe considerin shes paid for her time she is nt fur out o the way in occoopyin herself evenins that is if so be she ant smart enough to finish up all her work in the daytime edoocation is the great business of the institoot amoosements are objecs of a secondary natur accordin to my voo the unspellable pronunciation of this word is the touchstone of new england brahminism mr bernard drew a deep breath his thin nostrils dilating as if the air did not rush in fast enough to cool his blood while silas peckham was speaking the head of the apollinean institute delivered himself of these judicious sentiments in that peculiar acid penetrating tone thickened with a nasal twang which not rarely becomes hereditary after three or four generations raised upon east winds salt fish and large whitebellied pickled cucumbers he spoke deliberately as if weighing his words well so that during his few remarks mr bernard had time for a mental accompaniment with variations accented by certain bodily changes which escaped mr peckhams observation first there was a feeling of disgust and shame at hearing helen darley spoken of like a dumb working animal that sent the blood up into his cheeks then the slur upon her probable want of force her incapacity who made the character of the school and left this man to pocket its profits sent a thrill of the old wentworth fire through him so that his muscles hardened his hands closed and he took the measure of mr silas peckham to see if his head would strike the wall in case he went over backwards all of a sudden this would not do of course and so the thrill passed off and the muscles softened again then came that state of tenderness in the heart overlying wrath in the stomach in which the eyes grow moist like a womans and there is also a great boilingup of objectionable terms out of the deepwater vocabulary so that prudence and propriety and all the other pious ps have to jump upon the lid of speech to keep them from boiling over into fierce articulation all this was internal chiefly and of course not recognized by mr silas peckham the idea that any fullgrown sensible man should have any other notion than that of getting the most work for the least money out of his assistants had never suggested itself to him mr bernard had gone through this paroxysm and cooled down in the period while mr peckham was uttering these words in his thin shallow whine twanging up into the frontal sinuses what was the use of losing his temper and throwing away his place and so among the consequences which would necessarily follow leaving the poor ladyteacher without a friend to stand by her ready to lay his hand on the grandinquisitor before the windlass of his rack had taken one turn too many no doubt mr peckham he said in a grave calm voice there is a great deal of work to be done in the school but perhaps we can distribute the duties a little more evenly after a time i shall look over the girls themes myself after this week perhaps there will be some other parts of her labor that i can take on myself we can arrange a new programme of studies and recitations we can do that said mr silas peckham but i dont propose materlly alterin miss darleys dooties i dont think she works to hurt herself some of the trustees have proposed interdoosin new branches of study and i expect you will be pooty much occoopied with the dooties that belong to your place on the sahbath you will be able to attend divine service three times which is expected of our teachers i shall continoo myself to give sahbath scriptur readins to the young ladies that is a solemn dooty i cant make up my mind to commit to other people my teachers enjoy the lords day as a day of rest in it they do no manner of work except in cases of necessity or mercy such as fillin out diplomas or when we git crowded jest at the end of a term or when there is an extry number of poopils or other providential call to dispense with the ordinance mr bernard had a fine glow in his cheeks by this time doubtless kindled by the thought of the kind consideration mr peckham showed for his subordinates in allowing them the between meetingtime on sundays except for some special reason but the morning was wearing away so he went to the schoolroom taking leave very properly of his respected principal who soon took his hat and departed mr peckham visited certain stores or shops where he made inquiries after various articles in the provisionline and effected a purchase or two two or three barrels of potatoes which had sprouted in a promising way he secured at a bargain a side of feminine beef was also obtained at a low figure he was entirely satisfied with a couple of barrels of flour which being invoiced slightly damaged were to be had at a reasonable price after this silas peckham felt in good spirits he had done a pretty stroke of business it came into his head whether he might not follow it up with a still more brilliant speculation so he turned his steps in the direction of colonel sprowles it was now eleven oclock and the battlefield of last evening was as we left it mr peckhams visit was unexpected perhaps not very well timed but the colonel received him civilly beautifully lighted these rooms last night said mr peckham winterstrained the colonel nodded how much do you pay for your winterstrained the colonel told him the price very hahnsome supper very hahnsome nothin ever seen like it in rockland must have been a great heap of things leftover the compliment was not ungrateful and the colonel acknowledged it by smiling and saying i should think the was a trifle come and look when silas peckham saw how many delicacies had survived the evenings conflict his commercial spirit rose at once to the point of a proposal colonel sprowle said he theres meat and cakes and pies and pickles enough on that table to spread a hahnsome colation if youd like to trade reasonable i think perhaps i should be willin to take em off your hands theres been a talk about our havin a celebration in the parnassian grove and i think i could work in what your folks dont want and make myself whole by chargin a small sum for tickets broken meats of course ant of the same valoo as fresh provisions so i think you might be willin to trade reasonable mr peckham paused and rested on his proposal it would not perhaps have been very extraordinary if colonel sprowle had entertained the proposition there is no telling beforehand how such things will strike people it didnt happen to strike the colonel favorably he had a little redblooded manhood in him sell you them things to make a colation out of the colonel replied walk up to that table mr peckham and help yourself fill your pockets mr peckham fetch a basket and our hired folks shall fill it full for ye send a cart if y like n carry off them leavins to make a celebration for your pupils with only let me tell ye this as sure s my names hezekiah spraowle you ll be known through the taown n through the caounty from that day forrard as the principal of the brokenvictuals institoot even provincial humannature sometimes has a touch of sublimity about it mr silas peckham had gone a little deeper than he meant and come upon the hard pan as the welldiggers call it of the colonels character before he thought of it a militiacolonel standing on his sentiments is not to be despised that was shown pretty well in new england two or three generations ago there were a good many plain officers that talked about their rigiment and their caounty who knew very well how to say make ready take aim fire in the face of a line of grenadiers with bullets in their guns and bayonets on them and though a rustic uniform is not always unexceptionable in its cut and trimmings yet there was many an illmade coat in those old times that was good enough to be shown to the enemys front rank too often to be left on the field with a round hole in its left lapel that matched another going right through the brave heart of the plain country captain or major or colonel who was buried in it under the crimson turf mr silas peckham said little or nothing his sensibilities were not acute but he perceived that he had made a miscalculation he hoped that there was no offence thought it might have been mutooally agreeable conclooded he would give up the idee of a colation and backed himself out as if unwilling to expose the less guarded aspect of his person to the risk of accelerating impulses the colonel shut the door cast his eye on the toe of his right boot as if it had had a strong temptation looked at his watch then round the room and going to a cupboard swallowed a glass of deepred brandy and water to compose his feelings chapter ix the doctor orders the best sulky with a digression on hired help abel slip cassia into the new sulky and fetch her round abel was dr kittredges hired man he was born in new hampshire a queer sort of state with fat streaks of soil and population where they breed giants in mind and body and lean streaks which export imperfectly nourished young men with promising but neglected appetites who may be found in great numbers in all the large towns or could be until of late years when they have been half driven out of their favorite basementstories by foreigners and half coaxed away from them by california new hampshire is in more than one sense the switzerland of new england the granite state being naturally enough deficient in puddingstone its children are apt to wander southward in search of that deposit in the unpetrified condition abel stebbins was a good specimen of that extraordinary hybrid or mule between democracy and chrysocracy a nativeborn newengland servingman the old world has nothing at all like him he is at once an emperor and a subordinate in one hand he holds one fivemillionth part be the same more or less of the power that sways the destinies of the great republic his other hand is in your boot which he is about to polish it is impossible to turn a fellow citizen whose vote may make his master say rather employer governor or president or who may be one or both himself into a flunky that article must be imported readymade from other centres of civilization when a new englander has lost his selfrespect as a citizen and as a man he is demoralized and cannot be trusted with the money to pay for a dinner it may be supposed therefore that this fractional emperor this continentshaper finds his position awkward when he goes into service and that his employer is apt to find it still more embarrassing it is always under protest that the hired man does his duty every act of service is subject to the drawback i am as good as you are this is so common at least as almost to be the rule and partly accounts for the rapid disappearance of the indigenous domestic from the basements above mentioned paleontologists will by and by be examining the floors of our kitchens for tracks of the extinct native species of servingman the female of the same race is fast dying out indeed the time is not far distant when all the varieties of young woman will have vanished from new england as the dodo has perished in the mauritius the young lady is all that we shall have left and the mop and duster of the last ahnira or loizy will be stared at by generations of bridgets and noras as that famous head and foot of the lost bird are stared at in the ashmolean museum abel stebbins the doctors man took the true american view of his difficult position he sold his time to the doctor and having sold it he took care to fulfil his half of the bargain the doctor on his part treated him not like a gentleman because one does not order a gentleman to bring up his horse or run his errands but he treated him like a man every order was given in courteous terms his reasonable privileges were respected as much as if they had been guaranteed under hand and seal the doctor lent him books from his own library and gave him all friendly counsel as if he were a son or a younger brother abel had revolutionary blood in his veins and though he saw fit to hire out he could never stand the word servant or consider himself the inferior one of the two high contracting parties when he came to live with the doctor he made up his mind he would dismiss the old gentleman if he did not behave according to his notions of propriety but he soon found that the doctor was one of the right sort and so determined to keep him the doctor soon found on his side that he had a trustworthy intelligent fellow who would be invaluable to him if he only let him have his own way of doing what was to be done the doctors hired man had not the manners of a french valet he was grave and taciturn for the most part he never bowed and rarely smiled but was always at work in the daytime and always reading in the evening he was hostler and did all the housework that a man could properly do would go to the door or tend table bought the provisions for the family in short did almost everything for them but get their clothing there was no office in a perfectly appointed household from that of steward down to that of stableboy which he did not cheerfully assume his round of work not consuming all his energies he must needs cultivate the doctors garden which he kept in one perpetual bloom from the blowing of the first crocus to the fading of the last dahlia this garden was abels poem its halfdozen beds were so many cantos nature crowded them for him with imagery such as no laureate could copy in the cold mosaic of language the rhythm of alternating dawn and sunset the strophe and antistrophe still perceptible through all the sudden shifts of our dithyrambic seasons and echoed in corresponding floral harmonies made melody in the soul of abel the plain servingman it softened his whole otherwise rigid aspect he worshipped god according to the strict way of his fathers but a florists puritanism is always colored by the petals of his flowers and nature never shows him a black corolla he may or may not figure again in this narrative but as there must be some who confound the new england hired man nativeborn with the servant of foreign birth and as there is the difference of two continents and two civilizations between them it did not seem fair to let abel bring round the doctors mare and sulky without touching his features in halfshadow into our background the doctors mare cassia was so called by her master from her cinnamon color cassia being one of the professional names for that spice or drug she was of the shade we call sorrel or as an englishman would perhaps say chestnut a genuine morgan mare with a low forehand as is common in this breed but with strong quarters and flat hocks well ribbed up with a good eye and a pair of lively ears a firstrate doctors beast would stand until her harness dropped off her back at the door of a tedious case and trot over hill and dale thirty miles in three hours if there was a child in the next county with a bean in its windpipe and the doctor gave her a hint of the fact cassia was not large but she had a good deal of action and was the doctors showhorse there were two other animals in his stable quassia or quashy the black horse and caustic the old bay with whom he jogged round the village a long ride today said abel as he brought up the equipage just out of the village that s all there s a kink in her mane pull it out will you goin to visit some of the great folks abel said to himself wonder who it is then to the doctor anybody get sick at sprowless they say deacon soper had a fit after eatin some o their frozen victuals the doctor smiled he guessed the deacon would do well enough he was only going to ride over to the dudley mansionhouse chapter x the doctor calls on elsie venner if that primitive physician chiron m d appears as a centaur as we look at him

scale he must be set down thus genus homo species rotifer infusorius the wheelanimal of infusions the dudley mansion was not a mile from the doctors but it never occurred to him to think of walking to see any of his patients families if he had any professional object in his visit whenever the narrow sulky turned in at a gate the rustic who was digging potatoes or hoeing corn or swishing through the grass with his scythe in wavelike crescents or stepping short behind a loaded wheelbarrow or trudging lazily by the side of the swinging loosethroated shortlegged oxen rocking along the road as if they had just been landed after a threemonths voyage the toiling native whatever he was doing stopped and looked up at the house the doctor was visiting somebody sick over there t hayness guess th old

was a visit to be made oh that narrow sulky what hopes what fears what comfort what anguish what despair in the roll of its coming or its parting wheels in the spring when the old people get the coughs which give them a few shakes and their lives drop in pieces like the ashes of a burned thread which have kept the threadlike shape until they were stirred in the hot summer noons when the strong man comes in from the fields like the son of the shunamite crying my head my head in the dying autumn days when youth and maiden lie feverstricken in many a household stillfaced dulleyed darkflushed drylipped lowmuttering in their daylight dreams their fingers moving singly like those of slumbering harpers in the dead winter when the white plague of the north has caged its wasted victims shuddering as they think of the frozen soil which must be quarried like rock to receive them if their perpetual convalescence should happen to be interfered with by any untoward accident at every season the narrow sulky rolled round freighted with unmeasured burdens of joy and woe the doctor drove along the southern foot of the mountain the dudley mansion was near the eastern edge of this declivity where it rose steepest with baldest cliffs and densest patches of overhanging wood it seemed almost too steep to climb but a practised eye could see from a distance the zigzag lines of the sheeppaths which scaled it like miniature alpine roads a few hundred feet up the mountains side was a dark deep dell unwooded save for a few spindling crazylooking hackmatacks or native larches with pallid green tufts sticking out fantastically all over them it shelved so deeply that while the hemlocktassels were swinging on the trees around its border all would be still at its springy bottom save that perhaps a single fern would wave slowly backward and forward like a sabre with a twist as of a feathered oar and this when not a breath could be felt and every other stem and blade were motionless there was an old story of one having perished here in the winter of and his body having been found in the spring whence its common name of deadmans hollow higher up there were huge cliffs with chasms and it was thought concealed caves where in old times they said that tories lay hid some hinted not without occasional aid and comfort from the dudleys then living in the mansionhouse still higher and farther west lay the accursed ledge shunned by all unless it were now and then a daring youth or a wandering naturalist who ventured to its edge in the hope of securing some infantile crotalus durissus who had not yet cut his poison teeth long long ago in old colonial times the honorable thomas dudley esquire a man of note and name and great resources allied by descent to the family of tom dudley as the early governor is sometimes irreverently called by our most venerable but still youthful antiquary and to the other public dudleys of course of all of whom he made small account as being himself an english gentleman with little taste for the splendors of provincial office early in the last century thomas dudley had built this mansion for several generations it had been dwelt in by descendants of the same name but soon after the revolution it passed by marriage into the hands of the venners by whom it had ever since been held and tenanted as the doctor turned an angle in the road all at once the stately old house rose before him it was a skilfully managed effect as it well might be for it was no vulgar english architect who had planned the mansion and arranged its position and approach the old house rose before the doctor crowning a terraced garden flanked at the left by an avenue of tall elms the flowerbeds were edged with box which diffused around it that dreamy balsamic odor full of antenatal reminiscences of a lost paradise dimly fragrant as might be the bdellium of ancient havilah the land compassed by the river pison that went out of eden the garden was somewhat neglected but not in disgrace and in the time of tulips and hyacinths of roses of snowballs of honeysuckles of lilacs of syringas it was rich with blossoms from the frontwindows of the mansion the eye reached a far blue mountainsummit no rounded heap such as often shuts in a villagelandscape but a sharp peak cleanangled as ascutney from the dartmouth green a wide gap through miles of woods had opened this distant view and showed more perhaps than all the labors of the architect and the landscapegardener the large style of the early dudleys the great stonechimney of the mansionhouse was the centre from which all the artificial features of the scene appeared to flow the roofs the gables the dormerwindows the porches the clustered offices in the rear all seemed to crowd about the great chimney to this central pillar the paths all converged the single poplar behind the house nature is jealous of proud chimneys and always loves to put a poplar near one so that it may fling a leaf or two down its black throat every autumn the one tall poplar behind the house seemed to nod and whisper to the grave square column the elms to sway their branches towards it and when the blue smoke rose from its summit it seemed to be wafted away to join the azure haze which hung around the peak in the far distance so that both should bathe in a common atmosphere behind the house were clumps of lilacs with a centurys growth upon them and looking more like trees than like shrubs shaded by a group of these was the ancient well of huge circuit and with a low arch opening out of its wall about ten feet below the surface whether the door of a crypt for the concealment of treasure or of a subterranean passage or merely of a vault for keeping provisions cool in hot weather opinions differed on looking at the house it was plain that it was built with oldworld notions of strength and durability and so far as might be with oldworld materials the hinges of the doors stretched out like arms instead of like hands as we make them the bolts were massive enough for a donjonkeep the small windowpanes were actually inclosed in the wood of the sashes instead of being stuck to them with putty as in our modern windows the broad staircase was of easy ascent and was guarded by quaintly turned and twisted balusters the ceilings of the two rooms of state were moulded with medallionportraits and rustic figures such as may have been seen by many readers in the famous old philipse house washingtons headquarters in the town of yorkers the fireplaces worthy of the widethroated central chimney were bordered by pictured tiles some of them with scripture stories some with watteaulike figures tall damsels in slim waists and with spread enough of skirt for a modern ballroom with bowing reclining or musical swains of what everybody calls the conventional sort that is the swain adapted to genteel society rather than to a literal sheepcompelling existence the house was furnished soon after it was completed with many heavy articles made in london from a rare wood just then come into fashion not so rare now and commonly known as mahogany time had turned it very dark and the stately bedsteads and tall cabinets and clawfooted chairs and tables were in keeping with the sober dignity of the ancient mansion the old hangings were yet preserved in the chambers faded but still showing their rich patterns properly entitled to their name for they were literally hung upon flat wooden frames like trelliswork which again were secured to the naked partitions there were portraits of different date on the walls of the various apartments old painted coatsofarms beveledged mirrors and in one sleepingroom a glass case of waxwork flowers and spangly symbols with a legend signifying that e m supposed to be elizabeth mascarene wished not to be forgot when i am dead and layd in dust and all my bones are poor e m poor everybody that sighs for earthly remembrance in a planet with a core of fire and a crust of fossils such was the dudley mansionhouse for it kept its ancient name in spite of the change in the line of descent its spacious apartments looked dreary and desolate for here dudley venner and his daughter dwelt by themselves with such servants only as their quiet mode of life required he almost lived in his library the western room on the groundfloor its window looked upon a small plat of green in the midst of which was a single grave marked by a plain marble slab except this room and the chamber where he slept and the servants wing the rest of the house was all elsies she was always a restless wandering child from her early years and would have her little bed moved from one chamber to another flitting round as the fancy took her sometimes she would drag a mat and a pillow into one of the great empty rooms and wrapping herself in a shawl coil up and go to sleep in a corner nothing frightened her the haunted chamber with the torn hangings that flapped like wings when there was air stirring was one of her favorite retreats she had been a very hard creature to manage her father could influence but not govern her old sophy born of a slave mother in the house could do more with her than anybody knowing her by long instinctive study the other servants were afraid of her her father had sent for governesses but none of them ever stayed long she made them nervous one of them had a strange fit of sickness not one of them ever came back to the house to see her a young spanish woman who taught her dancing succeeded best with her for she had a passion for that exercise and had mastered some of the most difficult dances long before this period she had manifested some most extraordinary singularities of taste or instinct the extreme sensitiveness of her father on this point prevented any allusion to them but there were stories floating round some of them even getting into the papers without her name of course which were of a kind to excite intense curiosity if not more anxious feelings this thing was certain that at the age of twelve she was missed one night and was found sleeping in the open air under a tree like a wild creature very often she would wander off by day always without a companion bringing home with her a nest a flower or even a more questionable trophy of her ramble such as showed that there was no place where she was afraid to venture once in a while she had stayed out over night in which case the alarm was spread and men went in search of her but never successfully so that some said she hid herself in trees and others that she had found one of the old tory caves some of course said she was a crazy girl and ought to be sent to an asylum but old dr kittredge had shaken his head and told them to bear with her and let her have her way as much as they could but watch her as far as possible without making her suspicious of them he visited her now and then under the pretext of seeing her father on business or of only making a friendly call the doctor fastened his horse outside the gate and walked up the gardenalley he stopped suddenly with a start a strange sound had jarred upon his ear it was a sharp prolonged rattle continuous but rising and falling as if in rhythmical cadence he moved softly towards the open window from which the sound seemed to proceed elsie was alone in the room dancing one of those wild moorish fandangos such as a matador hot from the plaza de toros of seville or madrid might love to lie and gaze at she was a figure to look upon in silence the dancing frenzy must have seized upon her while she was dressing for she was in her bodice barearmed her hair floating unbound far below the waist of her barred or banded skirt she had caught up her castanets and rattled them as she danced with a kind of passionate fierceness her lithe body undulating with flexuous grace her diamond eyes glittering her round arms wreathing and unwinding alive and vibrant to the tips of the slender fingers some passion seemed to exhaust itself in this dancing paroxysm for all at once she reeled from the middle of the floor and flung herself as it were in a careless coil upon a great tigersskin which was spread out in one corner of the apartment the old doctor stood motionless looking at her as she lay panting on the tawny blacklined robe of the dead monster which stretched out beneath her its rude flattened outline recalling the terror of the jungle as he crouched for his fatal spring in a few moments her head drooped upon her arm and her glittering eyes closed she was sleeping he stood looking at her still steadily thoughtfully tenderly presently he lifted his hand to his forehead as if recalling some fading remembrance of other years poor catalina this was all he said he shook his head implying that his visit would be in vain today returned to his sulky and rode away as if in a dream chapter xi cousin richards visit the doctor was roused from his revery by the clatter of approaching hoofs he looked forward and saw a young fellow galloping rapidly towards him a common newengland rider with his toes turned out his elbows jerking and the daylight showing under him at every step bestriding a cantering beast of the plebeian breed thick at every point where he should be thin and thin at every point where he should be thick is not one of those noble objects that bewitch the world the best horsemen outside of the cities are the unshod countryboys who ride bareback with only a halter round the horses neck digging their brown heels into his ribs and slanting over backwards but sticking on like leeches and taking the hardest trot as if they loved it this was a different sight on which the doctor was looking the streaming mane and tail of the unshorn savagelooking black horse the dashing grace with which the young fellow in the shadowy sombrero and armed with the huge spurs sat in his highpeaked saddle could belong only to the mustang of the pampas and his master this bold rider was a young man whose sudden apparition in the quiet inland town had reminded some of the good people of a bright curlyhaired boy they had known some eight or ten years before as little dick venner this boy had passed several of his early years at the dudley mansion the playmate of elsie being her cousin two or three years older than herself the son of captain richard venner a south american trader who as he changed his residence often was glad to leave the boy in his brothers charge the captains wife this boys mother was a lady of buenos ayres of spanish descent and had died while the child was in his cradle these two motherless children were as strange a pair as one roof could well cover both handsome wild impetuous unmanageable they played and fought together like two young leopards beautiful but dangerous their lawless instincts showing through all their graceful movements the boy was little else than a young gaucho when he first came to rockland for he had learned to ride almost as soon as to walk and could jump on his pony and trip up a runaway pig with the bolas or noose him with his miniature lasso at an age when some citychildren would hardly be trusted out of sight of a nurserymaid it makes men imperious to sit a horse no man governs his fellows so well as from this living throne and so from marcus aurelius in roman bronze down to the man on horseback in general cushings prophetic speech the saddle has always been the true seat of empire the absolute tyranny of the human will over a noble and powerful beast develops the instinct of personal prevalence and dominion so that horsesubduer and hero were almost synonymous in simpler times and are closely related still an ancestry of wild riders naturally enough bequeaths also those other tendencies which we see in the tartars the cossacks and our own indian centaurs and as well perhaps in the oldfashioned foxhunting squire as in any of these sharp alternations of violent action and selfindulgent repose a hard run and a long revel after it this is what overmuch horse tends to animalize a man into such antecedents may have helped to make little dick venner a selfwilled capricious boy and a rough playmate for elsie elsie was the wilder of the two old sophy who used to watch them with those quick animallooking eyes of hers she was said to be the granddaughter of a cannibal chief and inherited the keen senses belonging to all creatures which are hunted as game old sophy who watched them in their play and their quarrels always seemed to be more afraid for the boy than the girl masse dick masse dick don you be too rough wi dat gal she scratch you las week n some day she bite you n if she bite you masse dick old sophy nodded her head ominously as if she could say a great deal more while in grateful acknowledgment of her caution master dick put his two little fingers in the angles of his mouth and his forefingers on his lower eyelids drawing upon these features until his expression reminded her of something she vaguely recollected in her infancy the face of a favorite deity executed in wood by an african artist for her grandfather brought over by her mother and burned when she became a christian these two wild children had much in common they loved to ramble together to build huts to climb trees for nests to ride the colts to dance to race and to play at boys rude games as if both were boys but wherever two natures have a great deal in common the conditions of a firstrate quarrel are furnished readymade relations are very apt to hate each other just because they are too much alike it is so frightful to be in an atmosphere of family idiosyncrasies to see all the hereditary uncomeliness or infirmity of body all the defects of speech all the failings of temper intensified by concentration so that every fault of our own finds itself multiplied by reflections like our images in a saloon lined with mirrors nature knows what she is about the centrifugal principle which grows out of the antipathy of like to like is only the repetition in character of the arrangement we see expressed materially in certain seedcapsules which burst and throw the seed to all points of the compass a house is a large pod with a human germ or two in each of its cells or chambers it opens by dehiscence of the frontdoor by and by and projects one of its germs to kansas another to san francisco another to chicago and so on and this that smith may not be smithed to death and brown may not be browned into a madhouse but mix in with the world again and struggle back to average humanity elsies father whose fault was to indulge her in everything found that it would never do to let these children grow up together they would either love each other as they got older and pair like wild creatures or take some fierce antipathy which might end nobody could tell where it was not safe to try the boy must be sent away a sharper quarrel than common decided this point master dick forgot old sophys caution and vexed the girl into a paroxysm of wrath in which she sprang at him and bit his arm perhaps they made too much of it for they sent for the old doctor who came at once when he heard what had happened he had a good deal to say about the danger there was from the teeth of animals or human beings when enraged and as he emphasized his remarks by the application of a pencil of lunar caustic to each of the marks left by the sharp white teeth they were like to be remembered by at least one of his hearers so master dick went off on his travels which led him into strange places and stranger company elsie was half pleased and half sorry to have him go the children had a kind of mingled liking and hate for each other just such as is very common among relations whether the girl had most satisfaction in the plays they shared or in teasing him or taking her small revenge upon him for teasing her it would have been hard to say at any rate she was lonely without him she had more fondness for the old black woman than anybody but sophy could not follow her far beyond her own old rockingchair as for her father she had made him afraid of her not for his sake but for her own sometimes she would seem to be fond of him and the parents heart would yearn within him as she twined her supple arms about him and then some look she gave him some halfarticulated expression would turn his cheek pale and almost make him shiver and he would say kindly now go elsie dear and smile upon her as she went and close and lock the door softly after her then his forehead would knot and furrow itself and the drops of anguish stand thick upon it he would go to the western window of his study and look at the solitary mound with the marble slab for its headstone after his grief had had its way he would kneel down and pray for his child as one who has no hope save in that special grace which can bring the most rebellious spirit into sweet subjection all this might seem like weakness in a parent having the charge of one sole daughter of his house and heart but he had tried authority and tenderness by turns so long without any good effect that he had become sore perplexed and surrounding her with cautious watchfulness as he best might left her in the main to her own guidance and the merciful influences which heaven might send down to direct her footsteps meantime the boy grew up to youth and early manhood through a strange succession of adventures he had been at school at buenos ayres had quarrelled with his mothers relatives had run off to the pampas and lived with the gauchos had made friends with the indians and ridden with them it was rumored in some of their savage forays had returned and made up his quarrel had got money by inheritance or otherwise had troubled the peace of certain magistrates had found it convenient to leave the city of wholesome breezes for a time and had galloped off on a fast horse of his so it was said with some officers riding after him who took good care but this was only the popular story not to catch him a few days after this he was taking his ice on the alameda of mendoza and a week or two later sailed from valparaiso for new york carrying with him the horse with which he had scampered over the plains a trunk or two with his newly purchased outfit of clothing and other conveniences and a belt heavy with gold and with a few brazilian diamonds sewed in it enough in value to serve him for a long journey dick venner had seen life enough to wear out the earlier sensibilities of adolescence he was tired of worshipping or tyrannizing over the bistred or umbered beauties of mingled blood among whom he had been living even that piquant exhibition which the rio de mendoza presents to the amateur of breathing sculpture failed to interest him he was thinking of a faroff village on the other side of the equator and of the wild girl with whom he used to play and quarrel a creature of a different race from these degenerate mongrels a game little devil she was sure enough and as dick spoke he bared his wrist to look for the marks she had left on it two small white scars where the two small sharp upper teeth had struck when she flashed at him with her eyes sparkling as bright as those glittering stones sewed up in the belt he wore thats a filly worth noosing said dick to himself as he looked in admiration at the sign of her spirit and passion i wonder if she will bite at eighteen as she did at eight she shall have a chance to try at any rate such was the selfsacrificing disposition with which richard venner esq a passenger by the condor from valparaiso set foot upon his native shore and turned his face in the direction of rockland the mountain and the mansionhouse he had heard something from time to time of his newengland relatives and knew that they were living together as he left them and so he heralded himself to my dear uncle by a letter signed your loving nephew richard venner in which letter he told a very frank story of travel and mercantile adventure expressed much gratitude for the excellent counsel and example which had helped to form his character and preserve him in the midst of temptation inquired affectionately after his uncles health was much interested to know whether his lively cousin who used to be his playmate had grown up as handsome as she promised to be and announced his intention of paying his respects to them both at rockland not long after this came the trunks marked r v which he had sent before him forerunners of his advent he was not going to wait for a reply or an invitation what a sound that is the banging down of the preliminary trunk without its claimant to give it the life which is borrowed by all personal appendages so long as the owners hand or eye is on them if it announce the coming of one loved and longed for how we delight to look at it to sit down on it to caress it in our fancies as a lone exile walking out on a windy pier yearns towards the merchantman lying alongside with the colors of his own native land at her peak and the name of the port he sailed from long ago upon her stern but if it tell the near approach of the undesired inevitable guest what sound short of the muffled noises made by the undertakers as they turn the corners in the dimlighted house with low shuffle of feet and whispered cautions carries such a sense of knockingkneed collapse with it as the thumping down in the front entry of the heavy portmanteau rammed with the changes of uncounted coming weeks whether the r v portmanteaus brought one or the other of these emotions to the tenants of the dudley mansion it might not be easy to settle elsie professed to be pleased with the thought of having an adventurous young stranger with stories to tell an inmate of their quiet not to say dull family under almost any other circumstances her father would have been unwilling to take a young fellow of whom he knew so little under his roof but this was his nephew and anything that seemed like to amuse or please elsie was agreeable to him he had grown almost desperate and felt as if any change in the current of her life and feelings might save her from some strange paroxysm of dangerous mental exaltation or sullen perversion of disposition from which some fearful calamity might come to herself or others dick had been several weeks at the dudley mansion a few days before he had made a sudden dash for the nearest large city and when the doctor met him he was just returning from his visit it had been a curious meeting between the two young persons who had parted so young and after such strange relations with each other when dick first presented himself at the mansion not one in the house would have known him for the boy who had left them all so suddenly years ago he was so dark partly from his descent partly from long habits of exposure that elsie looked almost fair beside him he had something of the family beauty which belonged to his cousin but his eye had a fierce passion in it very unlike the cold glitter of elsies like many people of strong and imperious temper he was softvoiced and very gentle in his address when he had no special reason for being otherwise he soon found reasons enough to be as amiable as he could force himself to be with his uncle and his cousin elsie was to his fancy she had a strange attraction for him quite unlike anything he had ever known in other women there was something too in early associations when those who parted as children meet as man and woman there is always a renewal of that early experience which followed the taste of the forbidden fruit a natural blush of consciousness not without its charm nothing could be more becoming than the behavior of richard venner esquire the guest of dudley venner esquire at his noble mansion as he was announced in the court column of the rockland weekly universe he was pleased to find himself treated with kindness and attention as a relative he made himself very agreeable by abundant details concerning the religious political social commercial and educational progress of the south american cities and states he was himself much interested in everything that was going on about the dudley mansion walked all over it noticed its valuable woodlots with special approbation was delighted with the grand old house and its furniture and would not be easy until he had seen all the family silver and heard its history in return he had much to tell of his father now dead the only one of the venners beside themselves in whose fate his uncle was interested with elsie he was subdued and almost tender in his manner with the few visitors whom they saw shy and silent perhaps a little watchful if any young man happened to be among them young fellows placed on their good behavior are apt to get restless and nervous all ready to fly off into some mischief or other dick venner had his halftamed horse with him to work off his suppressed life with when the savage passion of his young blood came over him he would fetch out the mustang screaming and kicking as these amiable beasts are wont to do strap the spanish saddle tight to his back vault into it and after getting away from the village strike the long spurs into his sides and whirl away in a wild gallop until the black horse was flecked with white foam and the cruel steel points were red with his blood when horse and rider were alike fired he would fling the bridle on his neck and saunter homeward always contriving to get to the stable in a quiet way and coming into the house as calm as a bishop after a sober trot on his steadygoing cob after a few weeks of this kind of life he began to want some more fierce excitement he had tried making downright love to elsie with no great success as yet in his own opinion the girl was capricious in her treatment of him sometimes scowling and repellent sometimes familiar very often as she used to be of old teasing and malicious all this perhaps made her more interesting to a young man who was tired of easy conquests there was a strange fascination in her eyes too which at times was quite irresistible so that he would feel himself drawn to her by a power which seemed to take away his will for the moment it may have been nothing but the common charm of bright eyes but he had never before experienced the same kind of attraction perhaps she was not so very different from what she had been as a child after all at any rate so it seemed to dick venner who as was said before had tried making love to her they were sitting alone in the study one day elsie had round her neck that somewhat peculiar ornament the golden torque which she had worn to the great party youth is adventurous and very curious about necklaces brooches chains and other such adornments so long as they are worn by young persons of the female sex dick was seized with a great passion for examining this curious chain and after some preliminary questions was rash enough to lean towards her and put out his hand toward the neck that lay in the golden coil she threw her head back her eyes narrowing and her forehead drawing down so that dick thought her head actually flattened itself he started involuntarily for she looked so like the little girl who had struck him with those sharp flashing teeth that the whole scene came back and he felt the stroke again as if it had just been given and the two white scars began to sting as they did after the old doctor had burned them with that stick of gray caustic which looked so like a slate pencil and felt so much like the end of a redhot poker it took something more than a gallop to set him right after this the next day he mentioned having received a letter from a mercantile agent with whom he had dealings what his business was is perhaps none of our business at any rate it required him to go at once to the city where his correspondent resided independently of this business which called him there may have been other motives such as have been hinted at people who have been living for a long time in dreary countryplaces without any emotion beyond such as are occasioned by a trivial pleasure or annoyance often get crazy at last for a vital paroxysm of some kind or other in this state they rush to the great cities for a plunge into their turbid lifebaths with a frantic thirst for every exciting pleasure which makes them the willing and easy victims of all those who sell the devils wares on commission the less intelligent and instructed class of unfortunates who venture with their ignorance and their instincts into what is sometimes called the life of great cities are put through a rapid course of instruction which entitles them very commonly to a diploma from the police court but they only illustrate the working of the same tendency in mankind at large which has been occasionally noticed in the sons of ministers and other eminently worthy people by many ascribed to that intense congenital hatred for goodness which distinguishes human nature from that of the brute but perhaps as readily accounted for by considering it as the yawning and stretching of a young soul cramped too long in one moral posture richard veneer was a young man of remarkable experience for his years he ran less risk therefore in exposing himself to the temptations and dangers of a great city than many older men who seeking the livelier scenes of excitement to be found in large towns as a relaxation after the monotonous routine of family life are too often taken advantage of and made the victims of their sentiments or their generous confidence in their fellowcreatures such was not his destiny there was something about him which looked as if he would not take bullying kindly he had also the advantage of being acquainted with most of those ingenious devices by which the proverbial inconstancy of fortune is steadied to something more nearly approaching fixed laws and the dangerous risks which have so often led young men to ruin and suicide are practically reduced to somewhat less than nothing so that mr richard veneer worked off his nervous energies without any troublesome adventure and was ready to return to rockland in less than a week without having lightened the moneybelt he wore round his body or tarnished the long glittering knife he carried in his boot dick had sent his trunk to the nearest town through which the railroad leading to the city passed he rode off on his black horse and left him at the place where he took the cars on arriving at the city station he took a coach and drove to one of the great hotels thither drove also a sagaciouslooking middleaged man who entered his name as w thompson in the book at the office immediately after that of r venner mr thompson kept a carelessly observant eye upon mr venner during his stay at the hotel and followed him to the cars when he left looking over his shoulder when he bought his ticket at the station and seeing him fairly off without obtruding himself in any offensive way upon his attention mr thompson known in other quarters as detective policeman terry got very little by his trouble richard venner did not turn out to be the wifepoisoner the defaulting cashier the riverpirate or the great counterfeiter he paid his hotelbill as a gentleman should always do if he has the money and can spare it the detective had probably overrated his own sagacity when he ventured to suspect mr venner he reported to his chief that there was a knowinglooking fellow he had been round after but he rather guessed he was nothing more than one o them southern sportsmen the poor fellows at the stable where dick had left his horse had had trouble enough with him one of the ostlers was limping about with a lame leg and another had lost a mouthful of his coat which came very near carrying a piece of his shoulder with it when mr venner came back for his beast he was as wild as if he had just been lassoed screaming kicking rolling over to get rid of his saddle and when his rider was at last mounted jumping about in a way to dislodge any common horseman to all this dick replied by sticking his long spurs deeper and deeper into his flanks until the creature found he was mastered and dashed off as if all the thistles of the pampas were pricking him one more gallop juan this was in the last mile of the road before he came to the town which brought him in sight of the mansionhouse it was in this last gallop that the fiery mustang and his rider flashed by the old doctor cassia pointed her sharp ears and shied to let them pass the doctor turned and looked through the little round glass in the back of his sulky dick turpin there will find more than his match said the doctor chapter xii the apollinean institute with extracts from the report of the committee the readers of this narrative will hardly expect any elaborate details of the educational management of the apollinean institute they cannot be supposed to take the same interest in its affairs as was shown by the annual committees who reported upon its condition and prospects as these committees were however an important part of the mechanism of the establishment some general account of their organization and a few extracts from the report of the one last appointed may not be out of place whether mr silas peckham had some contrivance for packing his committees whether they happened always to be made up of optimists by nature whether they were cajoled into goodhumor by polite attentions or whether they were always really delighted with the wonderful acquirements of the pupils and the admirable order of the school it is certain that their annual reports were couched in language which might warm the heart of the most coldblooded and calculating father that ever had a family of daughters to educate in fact these annual reports were considered by mr peckham as his most effective advertisements the first thing therefore was to see that the committee was made up of persons known to the public some wornout politician in that leisurely and amiable transitionstate which comes between official extinction and the paralysis which will finish him as soon as his brain gets a little softer made an admirable chairman for mr peckham when he had the luck to pick up such an article old reputations like old fashions are more prized in the grassy than in the stony districts an effete celebrity who would never be heard of again in the great places until the funeral sermon waked up his memory for one parting spasm finds himself in full flavor of renown a little farther back from the changing winds of the seacoast if such a public character was not to be had so that there was no chance of heading the report with the name of the honorable mr somebody the next best thing was to get the reverend dr somebody to take that conspicuous position then would follow two or three local worthies with esquire after their names if any stray literary personage from one of the great cities happened to be within reach he was pounced upon by mr silas peckham it was a hard case for the poor man who had travelled a hundred miles or two to the outside suburbs after peace and unwatered milk to be pumped for a speech in this unexpected way it was harder still if he had been induced to venture a few tremulous remarks to be obliged to write them out for the rockland weekly universe with the chance of seeing them used as an advertising certificate as long as he lived if he lived as long as the late dr waterhouse did after giving his certificate in favor of whitwells celebrated cephalic snuff the report of the last committee had been signed by the honorable late of as chairman it is with reluctance that the name and titles are left in blank but our public characters are so familiarly known to the whole community that this reserve becomes necessary the other members of the committee were the reverend mr butters of a neighboring town who was to make the prayer before the exercises of the exhibition and two or three notabilities of rockland with geoponic eyes and glabrous bumpless foreheads a few extracts from the report are subjoined the committee have great pleasure in recording their unanimous opinion that the institution was never in so flourishing a condition the health of the pupils is excellent the admirable quality of food supplied shows itself in their appearance their blooming aspect excited the admiration of the committee and bears testimony to the assiduity of the excellent matron moral and religious condition most encouraging which they cannot but attribute to the personal efforts and instruction of the faithful principal who considers religious instruction a solemn duty which he cannot commit to other people great progress in their studies under the intelligent superintendence of the accomplished principal assisted by mr badger mr langdons predecessor miss darley the lady who superintends the english branches miss crabs her assistant and teacher of modern languages and mr schneider teacher of french german latin and music education is the great business of the institute amusements are objects of a secondary nature but these are by no means neglected english compositions of great originality and beauty creditable alike to the head and heart of their accomplished authors several poems of a very high order of merit which would do honor to the literature of any age or country lifelike drawings showing great proficiency many converse fluently in various modern languages perform the most difficult airs with the skill of professional musicians advantages unsurpassed if equalled by those of any institution in the country and reflecting the highest honor on the distinguished head of the establishment silas peckham esquire and his admirable lady the matron with their worthy assistants the perusal of this report did mr bernard more good than a weeks vacation would have done it gave him such a laugh as he had not had for a month the way in which silas peckham had made his committee say what he wanted them to for he recognized a number of expressions in the report as coming directly from the lips of his principal and could not help thinking how cleverly he had forced his phrases as jugglers do the particular card they wish their dupe to take struck him as particularly neat and pleasing he had passed through the sympathetic and emotional stages in his new experience and had arrived at the philosophical and practical state which takes things coolly and goes to work to set them right he had breadth enough of view to see that there was nothing so very exceptional in this educational traders dealings with his subordinates but he had also manly feeling enough to attack the particular individual instance of wrong before him there are plenty of dealers in morals as in ordinary traffic who confine themselves to wholesale business they leave the small necessity of their nextdoor neighbor to the retailers who are poorer in statistics and general facts but richer in the everyday charities mr bernard felt at first as one does who sees a gray rat steal out of a drain and begin gnawing at the bark of some tree loaded with fruit or blossoms which he will soon girdle if he is let alone the first impulse is to murder him with the nearest ragged stone then one remembers that he is a rodent acting after the law of his kind and cools down and is contented to drive him off and guard the tree against his teeth for the future as soon as this is done one can watch his attempts at mischief with a certain amusement this was the kind of process mr bernard had gone through first the indignant surprise of a generous nature when it comes unexpectedly into relations with a mean one then the impulse of extermination a divine instinct intended to keep down vermin of all classes to their working averages in the economy of nature then a return of cheerful tolerance a feeling that if the deity could bear with rats and sharpers he could with a confident trust that in the long run terriers and honest men would have the upperhand and a grateful consciousness that he had been sent just at the right time to come between a patient victim and the master who held her in peonage having once made up his mind what to do mr bernard was as goodnatured and hopeful as ever he had the great advantage from his professional training of knowing how to recognize and deal with the nervous disturbances to which overtasked women are so liable he saw well enough that helen darley would certainly kill herself or lose her wits if he could not lighten her labors and lift off a large part of her weight of cares the worst of it was that she was one of those women who naturally overwork themselves like those horses who will go at the top of their pace until they drop such women are dreadfully unmanageable it is as hard reasoning with them as it would have been reasoning with io when she was flying over land and sea driven by the sting of the neversleeping gadfly this was a delicate interesting game that he played under one innocent pretext or another he invaded this or that special province she had made her own he would collect the themes and have them all read and marked answer all the puzzling questions in mathematics make the other teachers come to him for directions and in this way gradually took upon himself not only all the general superintendence that belonged to his office but stole away so many of the special duties which might fairly have belonged to his assistant that before she knew it she was looking better and feeling more cheerful than for many and many a month before when the nervous energy is depressed by any bodily cause or exhausted by overworking there follow effects which have often been misinterpreted by moralists and especially by theologians the conscience itself becomes neuralgic sometimes actually inflamed so that the least touch is agony of all liars and false accusers a sick conscience is the most inventive and indefatigable the devoted daughter wife mother whose life has been given to unselfish labors who has filled a place which it seems to others only an angel would make good reproaches herself with incompetence and neglect of duty the humble christian who has been a model to others calls himself a worm of the dust on one page of his diary and arraigns himself on the next for coming short of the perfection of an archangel conscience itself requires a conscience or nothing can be more unscrupulous it told saul that he did well in persecuting the christians it has goaded countless multitudes of various creeds to endless forms of selftorture the cities of india are full of cripples it has made the hillsides of syria are riddled with holes where miserable hermits whose lives it had palsied lived and died like the vermin they harbored our libraries are crammed with books written by spiritual hypochondriacs who inspected all their moral secretions a dozen times a day they are full of interest but they should be transferred from the shelf of the theologian to that of the medical man who makes a study of insanity this was the state into which too much work and too much responsibility were bringing helen darley when the new master came and lifted so much of the burden that was crushing her as must be removed before she could have a chance to recover her natural elasticity and buoyancy many of the noblest women suffering like her but less fortunate in being relieved at the right moment die worried out of life by the perpetual teasing of this inflamed neuralgic conscience so subtile is the line which separates the true and almost angelic sensibility of a healthy but exalted nature from the soreness of a soul which is sympathizing with a morbid state of the body that it is no wonder they are often confounded and thus many good women are suffered to perish by that form of spontaneous combustion in which the victim goes on toiling day and night with the hidden fire consuming her until all at once her cheek whitens and as we look upon her she drops away a heap of ashes the more they overwork themselves the more exacting becomes the sense of duty as the draught of the locomotives furnace blows stronger and makes the fire burn more fiercely the faster it spins along the track it is not very likely as was said at the beginning of this chapter that we shall trouble ourselves a great deal about the internal affairs of the apollinean institute these schools are in the nature of things not so very unlike each other as to require a minute description for each particular one among them they have all very much the same general features pleasing and displeasing all feedingestablishments have something odious about them from the wretched countryhouses where paupers are farmed out to the lowest bidder up to the commonstables at colleges and even the fashionable boardinghouse a persons appetite should be at war with no other purse than his own young people especially who have a bonefactory at work in them and have to feed the living looms of innumerable growing tissues should be provided for if possible by those who love them like their own flesh and blood elsewhere their appetites will be sure to make them enemies or what are almost as bad friends whose interests are at variance with the claims of their exacting necessities and demands besides all commercial transactions in regard to the most sacred interests of life are hateful even to those who profit by them the clergyman the physician the teacher must be paid but each of them if his duty be performed in the true spirit can hardly help a shiver of disgust when money is counted out to him for administering the consolations of religion for saving some precious life for sowing the seeds of christian civilization in young ingenuous souls and yet all these schools with their provincial french and their mechanical accomplishments with their cheap parade of diplomas and commencements and other public honors have an ever fresh interest to all who see the task they are performing in our new social order these girls are not being educated for governesses or to be exported with other manufactured articles to colonies where there happens to be a surplus of males most of them will be wives and every americanborn husband is a possible president of these united states any one of these girls may be a fouryears queen there is no sphere of human activity so exalted that she may not be called upon to fill it but there is another consideration of far higher interest the education of our community to all that is beautiful is flowing in mainly through its women and that to a considerable extent by the aid of these large establishments the least perfect of which do something to stimulate the higher tastes and partially instruct them sometimes there is perhaps reason to fear that girls will be too highly educated for their own happiness if they are lifted by their culture out of the range of the practical and everyday working youth by whom they are surrounded but this is a risk we must take our young men come into active life so early that if our girls were not educated to something beyond mere practical duties our material prosperity would outstrip our culture as it often does in large places where money is made too rapidly this is the meaning therefore of that somewhat ambitious programme common to most of these large institutions at which we sometimes smile perhaps unwisely or uncharitably we shall take it for granted that the routine of instruction went on at the apollinean institute much as it does in other schools of the same class people young or old are wonderfully different if we contrast extremes in pairs they approach much nearer if we take them in groups of twenty take two separate hundreds as they come without choosing and you get the gamut of human character in both so completely that you can strike many chords in each which shall be in perfect unison with corresponding ones in the other if we go a step farther and compare the population of two villages of the same race and region there is such a regularly graduated distribution and parallelism of character that it seems as if nature must turn out human beings in sets like chessmen it must be confessed that the position in which mr bernard now found himself had a pleasing danger about it which might well justify all the fears entertained on his account by more experienced friends when they learned that he was engaged in a young ladies seminary the school never went on more smoothly than during the first period of his administration after he had arranged its duties and taken his share and even more than his share upon himself but human nature does not wait for the diploma of the apollinean institute to claim the exercise of it instincts and faculties these young girls saw but little of the youth of the neighborhood the mansionhouse young men were off at college or in the cities or making love to each others sisters or at any rate unavailable for some reason or other there were a few clerks that is young men who attended shops commonly called stores who were fond of walking by the institute when they were off duty for the sake of exchanging a word or a glance with any one of the young ladies they might happen to know if any such were stirring abroad crude young men mostly with a great many sirs and maams in their speech and with that style of address sometimes acquired in the retail business as if the salesman were recommending himself to a customer firstrate family article maam warranted to wear a lifetime just one yard and three quarters in this pattern maam shant i have the pleasure and so forth if there had been ever so many of them and if they had been ever so fascinating the quarantine of the institute was too rigorous to allow any romantic infection to be introduced from without anybody might see what would happen with a goodlooking welldressed wellbred young man who had the authority of a master it is true but the manners of a friend and equal moving about among these young girls day after day his eyes meeting theirs his breath mingling with theirs his voice growing familiar to them never in any harsh tones often soothing encouraging always sympathetic with its male depth and breadth of sound among the chorus of trebles as if it were a river in which a hundred of these little piping streamletsmight lose themselves anybody might see what would happen young girls wrote home to their parents that they enjoyed themselves much this term at the institute and thought they were making rapid progress in their studies there was a great enthusiasm for the young masters readingclasses in english poetry some of the poor little things began to adorn themselves with an extra ribbon or a bit of such jewelry as they had before kept for great occasions dear souls they only half knew what they were doing it for does the bird know why its feathers grow more brilliant and its voice becomes musical in the pairing season and so in the midst of this quiet inland town where a mere accident had placed mr bernard langdon there was a concentration of explosive materials which might at any time change its arcadian and academic repose into a scene of dangerous commotion what said helen darley when she saw with her womans glance that more than one girl when she should be looking at her book was looking over it toward the masters desk was her own heart warmed by any livelier feeling than gratitude as its life began to flow with fuller pulses and the morning sky again looked bright and the flowers recovered their lost fragrance was there any strange mysterious affinity between the master and the dark girl who sat by herself could she call him at will by looking at him could it be that it made her shiver to think of it and who was that strange horseman who passed mr bernard at dusk the other evening looking so like mephistopheles galloping hard to be in season at the witches sabbathgathering that must be the cousin of elsies who wants to marry her they say a dangerouslooking fellow for a rival if one took a fancy to the dark girl and who is she and what by what demon is she haunted by what taint is she blighted by what curse is she followed by what destiny is she marked that her strange beauty has such a terror in it and that hardly one shall dare to love her and her eye glitters always but warms for none some of these questions are ours some were helen darleys some of them mingled with the dreams of bernard langdon as he slept the night after meeting the strange horseman in the morning he happened to be a little late in entering the schoolroom there was something between the leaves of the virgil which lay upon his desk he opened it and saw a freshly gathered mountainflower he looked at elsie instinctively involuntarily she had another such flower on her breast a young girls graceful compliment that is all no doubt no doubt it was odd that the flower should have happened to be laid between the leaves of the fourth book of the aeneid and at this line incipit effari mediaque in voce resistit a remembrance of an ancient superstition flashed through the masters mind and he determined to try the sortes virgilianae he shut the volume and opened it again at a venture the story of laocoon he read with a strange feeling of unwilling fascination from horresco referees to bis medium amplexi and flung the book from him as if its leaves had been steeped in the subtle poisons that princes die of chapter xiii curiosity people will talk ciascun lo dice is a tune that is played oftener than the national air of this country or any other that s what they say means to marry her if she is his cousin got money himself that s the story but wants to come and live in the old place and get the dudley property by and by mothers folks was wealthy twentythree to twentyfive year old he ant more n twenty or twentyone at the outside looks as if he knew too much to be only twenty year old guess hes been through the mill dont look so green anyhow hey did y ever mind that cut over his left eyebrow so they gossiped in rockland the young fellows could make nothing of dick venner he was shy and proud with the few who made advances to him the young ladies called him handsome and romantic but he looked at them like a manytailed pacha who was in the habit of ordering his wives by the dozen what do you think of the young man over there at the veneers said miss arabella thornton to her father handsome said the judge but dangerouslooking his face is indictable at common law do you know my dear i think there is a blank at the sheriffs office with a place for his name in it the judge paused and looked grave as if he had just listened to the verdict of the jury and was going to pronounce sentence have you heard anything against him said the judges daughter nothing but i dont like these mixed bloods and halftold stories besides i have seen a good many desperate fellows at the bar and i have a fancy they all have a look belonging to them the worst one i ever sentenced looked a good deal like this fellow a wicked mouth all our other features are made for us but a man makes his own mouth who was the person you sentenced he was a young fellow that undertook to garrote a man who had won his money at cards the same slender shape the same cunning fierce look smoothed over with a plausible air depend upon it there is an expression in all the sort of people who live by their wits when they can and by worse weapons when their wits fail them that we old lawdoctors know just as well as the medical counsellors know the marks of disease in a mans face dr kittredge looks at a man and says he is going to die i look at another man and say he is going to be hanged if nothing happens i dont say so of this one but i dont like his looks i wonder dudley veneer takes to him so kindly its all for elsies sake said miss thornton i feel quite sure of that he never does anything that is not meant for her in some way i suppose it amuses her to have her cousin about the house she rides a good deal since he has been here have you seen them galloping about together he looks like my idea of a spanish bandit on that wild horse of his possibly he has been one or is one said the judge smiling as men smile whose lips have often been freighted with the life and death of their fellowcreatures i met them riding the other day perhaps dudley is right if it pleases her to have a companion what will happen though if he makes love to her will elsie be easily taken with such a fellow you young folks are supposed to know more about these matters than we middleaged people nobody can tell elsie is not like anybody else the girls who have seen most of her think she hates men all but dudley as she calls her father some of them doubt whether she loves him they doubt whether she can love anything human except perhaps the old black woman who has taken care of her since she was a baby the village people have the strangest stories about her you know what they call her she whispered three words in her fathers ear the judge changed color as she spoke sighed deeply and was silent as if lost in thought for a moment i remember her mother he said so well a sweeter creature never lived elsie has something of her in her look but those are not her mothers eyes they were dark but soft as in all i ever saw of her race her fathers are dark too but mild and even tender i should say i dont know what there is about elsies but do you know my dear i find myself curiously influenced by them i have had to face a good many sharp eyes and hard ones murderers eyes and pirates men who had to be watched in the bar where they stood on trial for fear they should spring on the prosecuting officers like tigers but i never saw such eyes as elsies and yet they have a kind of drawing virtue or power about them i dont know what else to call it have you never observed this his daughter smiled in her turn never observed it why of course nobody could be with elsie venner and not observe it there are a good many other strange things about her did you ever notice how she dresses why handsomely enough i should think the judge answered i suppose she dresses as she likes and sends to the city for what she wants what do you mean in particular we men notice effects in dress but not much in detail you never noticed the colors and patterns of her dresses you never remarked anything curious about her ornaments well i dont believe you men know half the time whether a lady wears a ninepenny collar or a threadlace cape worth a thousand dollars i dont believe you know a silk dress from a bombazine one i dont believe you can tell whether a woman is in black or in colors unless you happen to know she is a widow elsie venner has a strange taste in dress let me tell you she sends for the oddest patterns of stuffs and picks out the most curious things at the jewellers whenever she goes to town with her father they say the old doctor tells him to let her have her way about such matters afraid of her mind if she is contradicted i suppose youve heard about her going to school at that place the institoot as those people call it they say shes bright enough in her way has studied at home you know with her father a good deal knows some modern languages and latin i believe at any rate she would have it so she must go to the institoot they have a very good female teacher there i hear and the new master that young mr langdon looks and talks like a welleducated young man i wonder what they ll make of elsie between them so they talked at the judges in the calm judiciallooking mansionhouse in the grave still library with the troops of wanhued lawbooks staring blindly out of their titles at them as they talked like the ghosts of dead attorneys fixed motionless and speechless each with a thin golden film over his unwinking eyes in the mean time everything went on quietly enough after cousin richards return a man of sense that is a man who knows perfectly well that a cool head is worth a dozen warm hearts in carrying the fortress of a womans affections not yours astarte nor yours viola who knows that men are rejected by women every day because they the men love them and are accepted every day because they do not and therefore can study the arts of pleasing a man of sense when he finds he has established his second parallel too soon retires quietly to his first and begins working on his covered ways again the whole art of love may be read in any encyclopaedia under the title fortification where the terms just used are explained after the little adventure of the necklace dick retreated at once to his first parallel elsie loved riding and would go off with him on a gallop now and then he was a master of all those strange indian horsebackfeats which shame the tricks of the circusriders and used to astonish and almost amuse her sometimes by disappearing from his saddle like a phantom horseman lying flat against the side of the bounding creature that bore him as if he were a hunting leopard with his claws in the horses flank and flattening himself out against his heaving ribs elsie knew a little spanish too which she had learned from the young person who had taught her dancing and dick enlarged her vocabulary with a few soft phrases and would sing her a song sometimes touching the air upon an ancientlooking guitar they had found with the ghostly things in the garret a quaint old instrument marked e m on the back and supposed to have belonged to a certain elizabeth mascarene before mentioned in connection with a work of art a fair dowerless lady who smiled and sung and faded away unwedded a hundred years ago as dowerless ladies not a few are smiling and singing and fading now god grant each of them his love and one human heart as its interpreter as for school elsie went or stayed away as she liked sometimes when they thought she was at her desk in the great schoolroom she would be on the mountain alone always dick wanted to go with her but she would never let him once when she had followed the zigzag path a little way up she looked back and caught a glimpse of him following her she turned and passed him without a word but giving him a look which seemed to make the scars on his wrist tingle went to her room where she locked herself up and did not come out again till evening old sophy having brought her food and set it down not speaking but looking into her eyes inquiringly like a dumb beast trying to feel out his masters will in his face the evening was clear and the moon shining as dick sat at his chamberwindow looking at the mountainside he saw a graydressed figure flit between the trees and steal along the narrow path which led upward elsies pillow was unpressed that night but she had not been missed by the household for dick knew enough to keep his own counsel the next morning she avoided him and went off early to school it was the same morning that the young master found the flower between the leaves of his virgil the girl got over her angry fit and was pleasant enough with her cousin for a few days after this but she shunned rather than sought him she had taken a new interest in her books and especially in certain poetical readings which the master conducted with the elder scholars this gave master langdon a good chance to study her ways when her eye was on her book to notice the inflections of her voice to watch for any expression of her sentiments for to tell the truth he had a kind of fear that the girl had taken a fancy to him and though she interested him he did not wish to study her heart from the inside the more he saw her the more the sadness of her beauty wrought upon him she looked as if she might hate but could not love she hardly smiled at anything spoke rarely but seemed to feel that her natural power of expression lay all in her bright eyes the force of which so many had felt but none perhaps had tried to explain to themselves a person accustomed to watch the faces of those who were ailing in body or mind and to search in every line and tint for some underlying source of disorder could hardly help analyzing the impression such a face produced upon him the light of those beautiful eyes was like the lustre of ice in all her features there was nothing of that human warmth which shows that sympathy has reached the soul beneath the mask of flesh it wears the look was that of remoteness of utter isolation there was in its stony apathy it seemed to him the pathos which we find in the blind who show no film or speck over the organs of sight for nature had meant her to be lovely and left out nothing but love and yet the master could not help feeling that some instinct was working in this girl which was in some way leading her to seek his presence she did not lift her glittering eyes upon him as at first it seemed strange that she did not for they were surely her natural weapons of conquest her color did not come and go like that of young girls under excitement she had a clear brunette complexion a little suntouched it may be for the master noticed once when her necklace was slightly displaced that a faint ring or band of a little lighter shade than the rest of the surface encircled her neck what was the slight peculiarity of her enunciation when she read not a lisp certainly but the least possible imperfection in articulating some of the lingual sounds just enough to be noticed at first and quite forgotten after being a few times heard not a word about the flower on either side it was not uncommon for the schoolgirls to leave a rose or pink or wild flower on the teachers desk finding it in the virgil was nothing after all it was a little delicate flower which looked as if it were made to press and it was probably shut in by accident at the particular place where he found it he took it into his head to examine it in a botanical point of view he found it was not common that it grew only in certain localities and that one of these was among the rocks of the eastern spur of the mountain it happened to come into his head how the swiss youth climb the sides of the alps to find the flower called the edelweiss for the maidens whom they wish to please it is a pretty fancy that of scaling some dangerous height before the dawn so as to gather the flower in its freshness that the favored maiden may wear it to church on sunday morning a proof at once of her lovers devotion and his courage mr bernard determined to explore the region where this flower was said to grow that he might see where the wild girl sought the blossoms of which nature was so jealous it was on a warm fair saturday afternoon that he undertook his landvoyage of discovery he had more curiosity it may be than he would have owned for he had heard of the girls wandering habits and the guesses about her sylvan haunts and was thinking what the chances were that he should meet her in some strange place or come upon traces of her which would tell secrets she would not care to have known the woods are all alive to one who walks through them with his mind in an excited state and his eyes and ears wide open the trees are always talking not merely whispering with their leaves for every tree talks to itself in that way even when it stands alone in the middle of a pasture but grating their boughs against each other as old hornhanded farmers press their dry rustling palms together dropping a nut or a leaf or a twig clicking to the tap of a woodpecker or rustling as a squirrel flashes along a branch it was now the season of singingbirds and the woods were haunted with mysterious tender music the voices of the birds which love the deeper shades of the forest are sadder than those of the open fields these are the nuns who have taken the veil the hermits that have hidden themselves away from the world and tell their griefs to the infinite listening silences of the wilderness for the one deep inner silence that nature breaks with her fitful superficial sounds becomes multiplied as the image of a star in ruffled waters strange the woods at first convey the impression of profound repose and yet if you watch their ways with open ear you find the life which is in them is restless and nervous as that of a woman the little twigs are crossing and twining and separating like slender fingers that cannot be still the stray leaf is to be flattened into its place like a truant curl the limbs sway and twist impatient of their constrained attitude and the rounded masses of foliage swell upward and subside from time to time with long soft sighs and it may be the falling of a few raindrops which had lain hidden among the deeper shadows i pray you notice in the sweet summer days which will soon see you among the mountains this inward tranquillity that belongs to the heart of the woodland with this nervousness for i do not know what else to call it of outer movement one would say that nature like untrained persons could not sit still without nestling about or doing something with her limbs or features and that high breeding was only to be looked for in trim gardens where the soul of the trees is ill at ease perhaps but their manners are unexceptionable and a rustling branch or leaf falling out of season is an indecorum the real forest is hardly still except in the indian summer then there is death in the house and they are waiting for the sharp shrunken months to come with white raiment for the summers burial there were many hemlocks in this neighborhood the grandest and most solemn of all the foresttrees in the mountain regions up to a certain period of growth they are eminently beautiful their boughs disposed in the most graceful pagodalike series of close terraces thick and dark with green crystalline leaflets in spring the tender shoots come out of a paler green fingerlike as if they were pointing to the violets at their feet but when the trees have grown old and their rough boles measure a yard and more through their diameter they are no longer beautiful but they have a sad solemnity all their own too full of meaning to require the hearts comment to be framed in words below all their earthwardlooking branches are sapless and shattered splintered by the weight of many winters snows above they are still green and full of life but their summits overtop all the deciduous trees around them and in their companionship with heaven they are alone on these the lightning loves to fall one such mr bernard saw or rather what had been one such for the bolt had torn the tree like an explosion from within and the ground was strewed all around the broken stump with flakes of rough bark and strips and chips of shivered wood into which the old tree had been rent by the bursting rocket from the thundercloud the master had struck up the mountain obliquely from the western side of the dudley mansionhouse in this way he ascended until he reached a point many hundred feet above the level of the plain and commanding all the country beneath and around almost at his feet he saw the mansionhouse the chimney standing out of the middle of the roof or rather like a black square hole in it the trees almost directly over their stems the fences as lines the whole nearly as an architect would draw a groundplan of the house and the inclosures round it it frightened him to see how the huge masses of rock and old forestgrowths hung over the home below as he descended a little and drew near the ledge of evil name he was struck with the appearance of a long narrow fissure that ran parallel with it and above it for many rods not seemingly of very old standing for there were many fibres of roots which had evidently been snapped asunder when the rent took place and some of which were still succulent in both separated portions mr bernard had made up his mind when he set forth not to come back before he had examined the dreaded ledge he had half persuaded himself that it was scientific curiosity he wished to examine the rocks to see what flowers grew there and perhaps to pick up an adventure in the zoological line for he had on a pair of high stout boots and he carried a stick in his hand which was forked at one extremity so as to be very convenient to hold down a crotalus with if he should happen to encounter one he knew the aspect of the ledge from a distance for its bald and leprouslooking declivities stood out in their nakedness from the wooded sides of the mountain when this was viewed from certain points of the village but the nearer aspect of the blasted region had something frightful in it the cliffs were waterworn as if they had been gnawed for thousands of years by hungry waves in some places they overhung their base so as to look like leaning towers which might topple over at any minute in other parts they were scooped into niches or caverns here and there they were cracked in deep fissures some of them of such width that one might enter them if he cared to run the risk of meeting the regular tenants who might treat him as an intruder parts of the ledge were cloven perpendicularly with nothing but cracks or slightly projecting edges in which or on which a foot could find hold high up on one of these precipitous walls of rock he saw some tufts of flowers and knew them at once for the same that he had found between the leaves of his virgil not there surely no woman would have clung against that steep rough parapet to gather an idle blossom and yet the master looked round everywhere and even up the side of that rock to see if there were no signs of a womans footstep he peered about curiously as if his eye might fall on some of those fragments of dress which women leave after them whenever they run against each other or against anything else in crowded ballrooms in the brushwood after picnics on the fences after rambles scattered round over every place which has witnessed an act of violence where rude hands have been laid upon them nothing stop though one moment that stone is smooth and polished as if it had been somewhat worn by the pressure of human feet there is one twig broken among the stems of that clump of shrubs he put his foot upon the stone and took hold of the closeclinging shrub in this way he turned a sharp angle of the rock and found himself on a natural platform which lay in front of one of the wider fissures whether the mouth of a cavern or not he could not yet tell a flat stone made an easy seat upon which he sat down as he was very glad to do and looked mechanically about him a small fragment splintered from the rock was at his feet he took it and threw it down the declivity a little below where he sat he looked about for a stem or a straw of some kind to bite upon a countryinstinct relic no doubt of the old vegetablefeeding habits of eden is that a stem or a straw he picked it up it was a hairpin to say that mr langdon had a strange sort of thrill shoot through him at the sight of this harmless little implement would be a statement not at variance with the fact of the case that smooth stone had been often trodden and by what foot he could not doubt he rose up from his seat to look round for other signs of a womans visits what if there is a cavern here where she has a retreat fitted up perhaps as anchorites fitted their cells nay it may be carpeted and mirrored and with one of those tigerskins for a couch such as they say the girl loves to lie on let us look at any rate mr bernard walked to the mouth of the cavern or fissure and looked into it his look was met by the glitter of two diamond eyes small sharp cold shining out of the darkness but gliding with a smooth steady motion towards the light and himself he stood fixed struck dumb staring back into them with dilating pupils and sudden numbness of fear that cannot move as in the terror of dreams the two sparks of light came forward until they grew to circles of flame and all at once lifted themselves up as if in angry surprise then for the first time thrilled in mr bernards ears the dreadful sound that nothing which breathes be it man or brute can hear unmoved the long loud stinging whirr as the huge thick bodied reptile shook his manyjointed rattle and adjusted his loops for the fatal stroke his eyes were drawn as with magnets toward the circles of flame his ears rung as in the overture to the swooning dream of chloroform nature was before man with her anaesthetics the cats first shake stupefies the mouse the lions first shake deadens the mans fear and feeling and the crotalus paralyzes before he strikes he waited as in a trance waited as one that longs to have the blow fall and all over as the man who shall be in two pieces in a second waits for the axe to drop but while he looked straight into the flaming eyes it seemed to him that they were losing their light and terror that they were growing tame and dull the charm was dissolving the numbness was passing away he could move once more he heard a light breathing close to his ear and half turning saw the face of elsie venner looking motionless into the reptiles eyes which had shrunk and faded under the stronger enchantment of her own chapter xiv family secrets it was commonly understood in the town of rockland that dudley venner had had a great deal of trouble with that daughter of his so handsome yet so peculiar about whom there were so many strange stories there was no end to the tales which were told of her extraordinary doings yet her name was never coupled with that of any youth or man until this cousin had provoked remark by his visit and even then it was oftener in the shape of wondering conjectures whether he would dare to make love to her than in any pretended knowledge of their relations to each other that the public tongue exercised its villageprerogative of tattle the more common version of the trouble at the mansionhouse was this elsie was not exactly in her right mind her temper was singular her tastes were anomalous her habits were lawless her antipathies were many and intense and she was liable to explosions of ungovernable anger some said that was not the worst of it at nearly fifteen years old when she was growing fast and in an irritable state of mind and body she had had a governess placed over her for whom she had conceived an aversion it was whispered among a few who knew more of the family secrets than others that worried and exasperated by the presence and jealous oversight of this person elsie had attempted to get finally rid of her by unlawful means such as young girls have been known to employ in their straits and to which the sex at all ages has a certain instinctive tendency in preference to more palpable instruments for the righting of its wrongs at any rate this governess had been taken suddenly ill and the doctor had been sent for at midnight old sophy had taken her master into a room apart and said a few words to him which turned him as white as a sheet as soon as he recovered himself he sent sophy out called in the old doctor and gave him some few hints on which he acted at once and had the satisfaction of seeing his patient out of danger before he left in the morning it is proper to say that during the following days the most thorough search was made in every nook and cranny of those parts of the house which elsie chiefly haunted but nothing was found which might be accused of having been the intentional cause of the probably accidental sudden illness of the governess from this time forward her father was never easy should he keep her apart or shut her up for fear of risk to others and so lose every chance of restoring her mind to its healthy tone by kindly influences and intercourse with wholesome natures there was no proof only presumption as to the agency of elsie in the matter referred to but the doubt was worse perhaps than certainty would have been for then he would have known what to do he took the old doctor as his adviser the shrewd old man listened to the fathers story his explanations of possibilities of probabilities of dangers of hopes when he had got through the doctor looked him in the face steadily as if he were saying is that all the fathers eyes fell this was not all there was something at the bottom of his soul which he could not bear to speak of nay which as often as it reared itself through the dark waves of unworded consciousness into the breathing air of thought he trod down as the ruined angels tread down a lost soul trying to come up out of the seething sea of torture only this one daughter no god never would have ordained such a thing there was nothing ever heard of like it it could not be she was ill she would outgrow all these singularities he had had an aunt who was peculiar he had heard that hysteric girls showed the strangest forms of moral obliquity for a time but came right at last she would change all at once when her health got more firmly settled in the course of her growth are there not rough buds that open into sweet flowers are there not fruits which while unripe are not to be tasted or endured which mature into the richest taste and fragrance in gods good time she would come to her true nature her eyes would lose that frightful cold glitter her lips would not feel so cold when she pressed them against his cheek and that faint birthmark her mother swooned when she first saw would fade wholly out it was less marked surely now than it used to be so dudley venner felt and would have thought if he had let his thoughts breathe the air of his soul but the doctor read through words and thoughts and all into the fathers consciousness there are states of mind which may be shared by two persons in presence of each other which remain not only unworded but unthoughted if such a word may be coined for our special need such a mutually interpenetrative consciousness there was between the father and the old physician by a common impulse both of them rose in a mechanical way and went to the western window where each started as he saw the others look directed towards the white stone which stood in the midst of the small plot of green turf the doctor had for a moment forgotten himself but he looked up at the clouds which were angry and said as if speaking of the weather it is dark now but we hope it will clear up by and by there are a great many more clouds than rains and more rains than strokes of lightning and more strokes of lightning than there are people killed we must let this girl of ours have her way as far as it is safe send away this woman she hates quietly get her a foreigner for a governess if you can one that can dance and sing and will teach her in the house old sophy will watch her best out of it you must trust her i am afraid for she will not be followed round and she is in less danger than you think if she wanders at night find her if you can the woods are not absolutely safe if she will be friendly with any young people have them to see her young men especially she will not love any one easily perhaps not at all yet love would be more like to bring her right than anything else if any young person seems in danger of falling in love with her send him to me for counsel dry hard advice but given from a kind hewn with a moist eye and in tones which tried to be cheerful and were full of sympathy this advice was the key to the more than indulgent treatment which as we have seen the girl had received from her father and all about her the old doctor often came in in the kindest most natural sort of way got into pleasant relations with elsie by always treating her in the same easy manner as at the great party encouraging all her harmless fancies and rarely reminding her that he was a professional adviser except when she came out of her own accord as in the talk they had at the party telling him of some wild trick she had been playing let her go to the girls school by all means said the doctor when she had begun to talk about it possibly she may take to some of the girls or of the teachers anything to interest her friendship love religion whatever will set her nature at work we must have headway on or there will be no piloting her action first of all and then we will see what to do with it so when cousin richard came along the doctor though he did not like his looks any too well told her father to encourage his staying for a time if she liked him it was good if she only tolerated him it was better than nothing you know something about that nephew of yours during these last years i suppose the doctor said looks as if he had seen life has a scar that was made by a swordcut and a white spot on the side of his neck that looks like a bulletmark i think he has been what folks call a hard customer dudley venner owned that he had heard little or nothing of him of late years he had invited himself and of course it would not be decent not to receive him as a relative he thought elsie rather liked having him about the house for a while she was very capricious acted as if she fancied him one day and disliked him the next he did not know but sometimes thought that this nephew of his might take a serious liking to elsie what should he do about it if it turned out so the doctor lifted his eyebrows a little he thought there was no fear elsie was naturally what they call a manhater and there was very little danger of any sudden passion springing up between two such young persons let him stay awhile it gives her something to think about so he stayed awhile as we have seen the more mr richard became acquainted with the family that is with the two persons of whom it consisted the more favorably the idea of a permanent residence in the mansionhouse seemed to impress him the estate was large hundreds of acres with woodlands and meadows of great value the father and daughter had been living quietly and there could not be a doubt that the property which came through the dudleys must have largely increased of late years it was evident enough that they had an abundant income from the way in which elsies caprices were indulged she had horses and carriages to suit herself she sent to the great city for everything she wanted in the way of dress even her diamonds and the young man knew something about these gems must be of considerable value and yet she wore them carelessly as it pleased her fancy she had precious old laces too almost worth their weight in diamonds laces which had been snatched from altars in ancient spanish cathedrals during the wars and which it would not be safe to leave a duchess alone with for ten minutes the old house was fat with the deposits of rich generations which had gone before the famous golden fireset was a purchase of one of the family who had been in france during the revolution and must have come from a princely palace if not from one of the royal residences as for silver the iron closet which had been made in the diningroom wall was running over with it teakettles coffeepots heavylidded tankards chafingdishes punchbowls all that all the dudleys had ever used from the caudlecup which used to be handed round the young mothers chamber and the porringer from which children scooped their breadandmilk with spoons as solid as ingots to that ominous vessel on the upper shelf far back in the dark with a spout like a slender italic s out of which the sick and dying all along the last century and since had taken the last drops that passed their lips without being much of a scholar dick could see well enough too that the books in the library had been ordered from the great london houses whose imprint they bore by persons who knew what was best and meant to have it a man does not require much learning to feel pretty sure when he takes one of those solid smooth velvetleaved quartos say a baskerville addison for instance bound in red morocco with a margin of gold as rich as the embroidery of a princes collar as vandyck drew it he need not know much to feel pretty sure that a score or two of shelves full of such books mean that it took a long purse as well as a literary taste to bring them together to all these attractions the mind of this thoughtful young gentleman may be said to have been fully open he did not disguise from himself however that there were a number of drawbacks in the way of his becoming established as the heir of the dudley mansionhouse and fortune in the first place cousin elsie was unquestionably very piquant very handsome game as a hawk and hard to please which made her worth trying for but then there was something about cousin elsie the small white scars began stinging as he said this to himself and he pushed his sleeve up to look at them there was something about cousin elsie he couldnt make out what was the matter with her eyes that they sucked your life out of you in that strange way what did she always wear a necklace for had she some such lovetoken on her neck as the old dons revolver had left on his how safe would anybody feel to live with her besides her father would last forever if he was left to himself and he may take it into his head to marry again that would be pleasant so talked cousin richard to himself in the calm of the night and in the tranquillity of his own soul there was much to be said on both sides it was a balance to be struck after the two columns were added up he struck the balance and came to the conclusion that he would fall in love with elsie venner the intelligent reader will not confound this matured and serious intention of falling in love with the young lady with that mere impulse of the moment before mentioned as an instance of making love on the contrary the moment mr richard had made up his mind that he should fall in love with elsie he began to be more reserved with her and to try to make friends in other quarters sensible men you know care very little what a girls present fancy is the question is who manages her and how can you get at that person or those persons her foolish little sentiments are all very well in their way but business is business and we cant stop for such trifles the old political wirepullers never go near the man they want to gain if they can help it they find out who his intimates and managers are and work through them always handle any positively electrical body whether it is charged with passion or power with some nonconductor between you and it not with your naked hands the above were some of the young gentlemans working axioms and he proceeded to act in accordance with them he began by paying his court more assiduously to his uncle it was not very hard to ingratiate himself in that quarter for his manners were insinuating and his precocious experience of life made him entertaining the old neglected billiard room was soon put in order and dick who was a magnificent player had a series of games with his uncle in which singularly enough he was beaten though his antagonist had been out of play for years he evinced a profound interest in the family history insisted on having the details of its early alliances and professed a great pride in it which he had inherited from his father who though he had allied himself with the daughter of an alien race had yet chosen one with the real azure blood in her veins as proud as if she had castile and aragon for her dower and the cid for her grandpapa he also asked a great deal of advice such as inexperienced young persons are in need of and listened to it with due reverence it is not very strange that uncle dudley took a kinder view of his nephew than the judge who thought he could read a questionable history in his face or the old doctor who knew mens temperaments and organizations pretty well and had his prejudices about races and could tell an old swordcut and a balletmark in two seconds from a scar got by falling against the fender or a mark left by kings evil he could not be expected to share our own prejudices for he had heard nothing of the wild youths adventures or his scamper over the pampas at short notice so then richard venner esquire guest of dudley venner esquire at his elegant mansion prolonged his visit until his presence became something like a matter of habit and the neighbors began to think that the fine old house would be illuminated before long for a grand marriage he had done pretty well with the father the next thing was to gain over the nurse old sophy was as cunning as a red fox or a gray woodchuck she had nothing in the world to do but to watch elsie she had nothing to care for but this girl and her father she had never liked dick too well for he used to make faces at her and tease her when he was a boy and now he was a man there was something about him she could not tell what that made her suspicious of him it was no small matter to get her over to his side the jetblack africans know that gold never looks so well as on the foil of their dark skins dick found in his trunk a string of gold beads such as are manufactured in some of our cities which he had brought from the gold region of chili so he said for the express purpose of giving them to old sophy these africans too have a perfect passion for gaycolored clothing being condemned by nature as it were to a perpetual mourningsuit they love to enliven it with all sorts of variegated stuffs of sprightly patterns aflame with red and yellow the considerate young man had remembered this too and brought home for sophy some handkerchiefs of rainbow hues which had been strangely overlooked till now at the bottom of one of his trunks old sophy took his gifts but kept her black eyes open and watched every movement of the young people all the more closely it was through her that the father had always known most of the actions and tendencies of his daughter in the mean time the strange adventure on the mountain had brought the young master into new relations with elsie she had led him out of danger perhaps saved him from death by the strange power she exerted he was grateful and yet shuddered at the recollection of the whole scene in his dreams he was pursued by the glare of cold glittering eyes whether they were in the head of a woman or of a reptile he could not always tell the images had so run together but he could not help seeing that the eyes of the young girl had been often very often turned upon him when he had been looking away and fell as his own glance met them helen darley told him very plainly that this girl was thinking about him more than about her book dick venner found she was getting more constant in her attendance at school he learned on inquiry that there was a new master a handsome young man the handsome young man would not have liked the look that came over dicks face when he heard this fact mentioned in short everything was getting tangled up together and there would be no chance of disentangling the threads in this chapter chapter xv physiological if master bernard felt a natural gratitude to his young pupil for saving him from an imminent peril he was in a state of infinite perplexity to know why he should have needed such aid he an active muscular courageous adventurous young fellow with a stick in his hand ready to hold down the old serpent himself if he had come in his way to stand still staring into those two eyes until they came up close to him and the strange terrible sound seemed to freeze him stiff where he stood what was the meaning of it again what was the influence this girl had seemingly exerted under which the venomous creature had collapsed in such a sudden way whether he had been awake or dreaming he did not feel quite sure he knew he had gone up the mountain at any rate he knew he had come down the mountain with the girl walking just before him there was no forgetting her figure as she walked on in silence her braided locks falling a little for want of the lost hairpin perhaps and looking like a wreathing coil of shame on such fancies to wrong that supreme crowning gift of abounding nature a rush of shining black hair which shaken loose would cloud her all round like godiva from brow to instep he was sure he had sat down before the fissure or cave he was sure that he was led softly away from the place and that it was elsie who had led him there was the hairpin to show that so far it was not a dream but between these recollections came a strange confusion and the more the master thought the more he was perplexed to know whether she had waked him sleeping as he sat on the stone from some frightful dream such as may come in a very brief slumber or whether she had bewitched him into a trance with those strange eyes of hers or whether it was all true and he must solve its problem as he best might there was another recollection connected with this mountain adventure as they approached the mansionhouse they met a young man whom mr bernard remembered having seen once at least before and whom he had heard of as a cousin of the young girl as cousin richard venner the person in question passed them he took the measure so to speak of mr bernard with a look so piercing so exhausting so practised so profoundly suspicious that the young master felt in an instant that he had an enemy in this handsome youth an enemy too who was like to be subtle and dangerous mr bernard had made up his mind that come what might enemy or no enemy live or die he would solve the mystery of elsie venner sooner or later he was not a man to be frightened out of his resolution by a scowl or a stiletto or any unknown means of mischief of which a whole armory was hinted at in that passing look dick venner had given him indeed like most adventurous young persons he found a kind of charm in feeling that there might be some dangers in the way of his investigations some rumors which had reached him about the supposed suitor of elsie venner who was thought to be a desperate kind of fellow and whom some believed to be an unscrupulous adventurer added a curious romantic kind of interest to the course of physiological and psychological inquiries he was about instituting the afternoon on the mountain was still uppermost in his mind of course he knew the common stories about fascination he had once been himself an eyewitness of the charming of a small bird by one of our common harmless serpents whether a human being could be reached by this subtile agency he had been skeptical notwithstanding the mysterious relation generally felt to exist between man and this creature cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field a relation which some interpret as the fruit of the curse and others hold to be so instinctive that this animal has been for that reason adopted as the natural symbol of evil there was another solution however supplied him by his professional reading the curious work of mr braid of manchester had made him familiar with the phenomena of a state allied to that produced by animal magnetism and called by that writer by the name of hypnotism he found by referring to his notebook the statement was that by fixing the eyes on a bright object so placed as to produce a strain upon the eyes and eyelids and to maintain a steady fixed stare there comes on in a few seconds a very singular condition characterized by muscular rigidity and inability to move with a strange exaltation of most of the senses and generally a closure of the eyelids this condition being followed by torpor now this statement of mr braids well known to the scientific world and the truth of which had been confirmed by mr bernard in certain experiments he had instituted as it has been by many other experimenters went far to explain the strange impressions of which waking or dreaming he had certainly been the subject his nervous system had been in a high state of exaltation at the time he remembered how the little noises that made rings of sound in the silence of the woods like pebbles dropped in still waters had reached his inner consciousness he remembered that singular sensation in the roots of the hair when he came on the traces of the girls presence reminding him of a line in a certain poem which he had read lately with a new and peculiar interest he even recalled a curious evidence of exalted sensibility and irritability in the twitching of the minute muscles of the internal ear at every unexpected sound producing an odd little snap in the middle of the head which proved to him that he was getting very nervous the next thing was to find out whether it were possible that the venomous creatures eyes should have served the purpose of mr braids bright object held very close to the person experimented on or whether they had any special power which could be made the subject of exact observation for this purpose mr bernard considered it necessary to get a live crotalus or two into his possession if this were possible on inquiry he found that there was a certain family living far up the mountainside not a mile from the ledge the members of which were said to have taken these creatures occasionally and not to be in any danger or at least in any fear of being injured by them he applied to these people and offered a reward sufficient to set them at work to capture some of these animals if such a thing were possible a few days after this a dark gypsylooking woman presented herself at his door she held up her apron as if it contained something precious in the bag she made with it y wanted some rattlers said the woman here they be she opened her apron and showed a coil of rattlesnakes lying very peaceably in its fold they lifted their heads up as if they wanted to see what was going on but showed no sign of anger are you crazy said mr bernard youre dead in an hour if one of those creatures strikes you he drew back a little as he spoke it might be simple disgust it might be fear it might be what we call antipathy which is different from either and which will sometimes show itself in paleness and even faintness produced by objects perfectly harmless and not in themselves offensive to any sense lord bless you said the woman rattlers never touches our folks id jest z lieves handle them creaturs as so many striped snakes so saying she put their heads down with her hand and packed them together in her apron as if they had been bits of cartrope mr bernard had never heard of the power or at least the belief in the possession of a power by certain persons which enables them to handle these frightful reptiles with perfect impunity the fact however is well known to others and more especially to a very distinguished professor in one of the leading institutions of the great city of the land whose experiences in the neighborhood of graylock as he will doubtless inform the curious were very much like those of the young master mr bernard had a wired cage ready for his formidable captives and studied their habits and expression with a strange sort of interest what did the creator mean to signify when he made such shapes of horror and as if he had doubly cursed this envenomed wretch had set a mark upon him and sent him forth the cain of the brotherhood of serpents it was a very curious fact that the first train of thoughts mr bernards small menagerie suggested to him was the grave though somewhat worn subject of the origin of evil there is now to be seen in a tall glass jar in the museum of comparative anatomy at cantabridge in the territory of the massachusetts a huge crotalus of a species which grows to more frightful dimensions than our own under the hotter skies of south america look at it ye who would know what is the tolerance the freedom from prejudice which can suffer such an incarnation of all that is devilish to lie unharmed in the cradle of nature learn too that there are many things in this world which we are warned to shun and are even suffered to slay if need be but which we must not hate unless we would hate what god loves and cares for whatever fascination the creature might exercise in his native haunts mr bernard found himself not in the least nervous or affected in any way while looking at his caged reptiles when their cage was shaken they would lift their heads and spring their rattles but the sound was by no means so formidable to listen to as when it reverberated among the chasms of the echoing rocks the expression of the creatures was watchful still grave passionless fatelike suggesting a cold malignity which seemed to be waiting for its opportunity their awful deepcut mouths were sternly closed over the long hollow fangs which rested their roots against the swollen poisongland where the venom had been hoarding up ever since the last stroke had emptied it they never winked for ophidians have no movable eyelids but kept up that awful fixed stare which made the two unwinking gladiators the survivors of twenty pairs matched by one of the roman emperors as pliny tells us in his natural history their eyes did not flash but shone with a cold still light they were of a palegolden or straw color horrible to look into with their stony calmness their pitiless indifference hardly enlivened by the almost imperceptible vertical slit of the pupil through which death seemed to be looking out like the archer behind the long narrow loophole in a blank turretwall on the whole the caged reptiles horrid as they were hardly matched his recollections of what he had seen or dreamed he save at the cavern these looked dangerous enough but yet quiet a treacherous stillness however as the unfortunate new york physician found when he put his foot out to wake up the torpid creature and instantly the fang flashed through his boot carrying the poison into his blood and death with it mr bernard kept these strange creatures and watched all their habits with a natural curiosity in any collection of animals the venomous beasts are looked at with the greatest interest just as the greatest villains are most run after by the unknown public nobody troubles himself for a common striped snake or a petty thief but a cobra or a wifekiller is a centre of attraction to all eyes these captives did very little to earn their living but on the other hand their living was not expensive their diet being nothing but air au naturel months and months these creatures will live and seem to thrive well enough as any showman who has then in his menagerie will testify though they never touch anything to eat or drink in the mean time mr bernard had become very curious about a class of subjects not treated of in any detail in those textbooks accessible in most countrytowns to the exclusion of the more special treatises and especially of the rare and ancient works found on the shelves of the larger citylibraries he was on a visit to old dr kittredge one day having been asked by him to call in for a few moments as soon as convenient the doctor smiled goodhumoredly when he asked him if he had an extensive collection of medical works why no said the old doctor i havent got a great many printed books and what i have i dont read quite as often as i might im afraid i read and studied in the time of it when i was in the midst of the young men who were all at work with their books but its a mighty hard matter when you go off alone into the country to keep up with all thats going on in the societies and the colleges ill tell you though mr langdon when a man thats once started right lives among sick folks for fiveandthirty years as ive done if he has nt got a library of fiveandthirty volumes bound up in his head at the end of that time hed better stop driving round and sell his horse and sulky i know the bigger part of the families within a dozen miles ride i know the families that have a way of living through everything and i know the other set that have the trick of dying without any kind of reason for it i know the years when the fevers and dysenteries are in earnest and when theyre only making believe i know the folks that think theyre dying as soon as theyre sick and the folks that never find out they re sick till theyre dead i dont want to undervalue your science mr langdon there are things i never learned because they came in after my day and i am very glad to send my patients to those that do know them when i am at fault but i know these people about here fathers and mothers and children and grandchildren so as all the science in the world cant know them without it takes time about it and sees them grow up and grow old and how the wear and tear of life comes to them you cant tell a horse by driving him once mr langdon nor a patient by talking half an hour with him do you know much about the veneer family said mr bernard in a natural way enough the doctors talk having suggested the question the doctor lifted his head with his accustomed movement so as to command the young man through his spectacles i know all the families of this place and its neighborhood he answered we have the young lady studying with us at the institute said mr bernard i know it the doctor answered is she a good scholar all this time the doctors eyes were fixed steadily on mr bernard looking through the glasses she is a good scholar enough but i dont know what to make of her sometimes i think she is a little out of her head her father i believe is sensible enough what sort of a woman was her mother doctor i suppose of course you remember all about her yes i knew her mother she was a very lovely young woman the doctor put his hand to his forehead and drew a long breath what is there you notice out of the way about elsie venner a good many things the master answered she shuns all the other girls she is getting a strange influence over my fellowteacher a young lady you know miss helen darley perhaps i am afraid this girl will kill her i never saw or heard of anything like it in prose at least do you remember much of coleridges poems doctor the good old doctor had to plead a negative well no matter elsie would have been burned for a witch in old times i have seen the girl look at miss darley when she had not the least idea of it and all at once i would see her grow pale and moist and sigh and move round uneasily and turn towards elsie and perhaps get up and go to her or else have slight spasmodic movements that looked like hysterics do you believe in the evil eye doctor mr langdon the doctor said solemnly there are strange things about elsie veneer very strange things this was what i wanted to speak to you about let me advise you all to be very patient with the girl but also very careful her love is not to be desired and he spoke in a lower tone her hate is to be dreaded do you think she has any special fancy for anybody else in the school besides miss darley mr bernard could not stand the old doctors spectacled eyes without betraying a little of the feeling natural to a young man to whom a home question involving a possible sentiment is put suddenly i have suspected he said i have had a kind of feeling that she well come doctor i dont know that there s any use in disguising the matter i have thought elsie veneer had rather a fancy for somebody else i mean myself there was something so becoming in the blush with which the young man made this confession and so manly too in the tone with which he spoke so remote from any shallow vanity such as young men who are incapable of love are apt to feel when some loose tendril of a womans fancy which a chance wind has blown against them twines about them for the want of anything better that the old doctor looked at him admiringly and could not help thinking that it was no wonder any young girl should be pleased with him you are a man of nerve mr langdon said the doctor i thought so till very lately he replied i am not easily frightened but i dont know but i might be bewitched or magnetized or whatever it is when one is tied up and cannot move i think i can find nerve enough however if there is any special use you want to put it to let me ask you one more question mr langdon do you find yourself disposed to take a special interest in elsie to fall in love with her in a word pardon me for i do not ask from curiosity but a much more serious motive elsie interests me said the young man interests me strangely she has a wild flavor in her character which is wholly different from that of any human creature i ever saw she has marks of genius poetic or dramatic i hardly know which she read a passage from keatss lamia the other day in the schoolroom in such a way that i declare to you i thought some of the girls would faint or go into fits miss darley got up and left the room trembling all over then i pity her she is so lonely the girls are afraid of her and she seems to have either a dislike or a fear of them they have all sorts of painful stories about her they give her a name which no human creature ought to bear they say she hides a mark on her neck by always wearing a necklace she is very graceful you know and they will have it that she can twist herself into all sorts of shapes or tie herself in a knot if she wants to there is not one of them that will look her in the eyes i pity the poor girl but doctor i do not love her i would risk my life for her if it would do her any good but it would be in cold blood if her hand touches mine it is not a thrill of passion i feel running through me but a very different emotion oh doctor there must be something in that creatures blood which has killed the humanity in her god only knows the cause that has blighted such a soul in so beautiful a body no doctor i do not love the girl mr langdon said the doctor you are young and i am old let me talk to you with an old mans privilege as an adviser you have come to this countrytown without suspicion and you are moving in the midst of perils there are things which i must not tell you now but i may warn you keep your eyes open and your heart shut if through pitying that girl you ever come to love her you are lost if you deal carelessly with her beware this is not all there are other eyes on you beside elsie venners do you go armed i do said mr bernard and he put his hands up in the shape of fists in such a way as to show that he was master of the natural weapons at any rate the doctor could not help smiling but his face fell in an instant you may want something more than those tools to work with come with me into my sanctum the doctor led mr bernard into a small room opening out of the study it was a place such as anybody but a medical man would shiver to enter there was the usual tall box with its bleached rattling tenant there were jars in rows where interesting cases outlived the grief of widows and heirs in alcoholic immortality for your preparationjar is the true monumentum aere perennius there were various semipossibilities of minute dimensions and unpromising developments there were shining instruments of evil aspect and grim plates on the walls and on one shelf by itself accursed and apart coiled in a long cylinder of spirit a huge crotalus roughscaled flatheaded variegated with dull bands one of which partially encircled the neck like a collar an awful wretch to look upon with murder written all over him in horrid hieroglyphics mr bernards look was riveted on this creature not fascinated certainly for its eyes looked like white beads being clouded by the action of the spirits in which it had been long kept but fixed by some indefinite sense of the renewal of a previous impression everybody knows the feeling with its suggestion of some past state of existence there was a scrap of paper on the jar with something written on it he was reaching up to read it when the doctor touched him lightly look here mr langdon he said with a certain vivacity of manner as if wishing to call away his attention this is my armory the doctor threw open the door of a small cabinet where were disposed in artistic patterns various weapons of offence and defence for he was a virtuoso in his way and by the side of the implements of the art of healing had pleased himself with displaying a collection of those other instruments the use of which renders the first necessary see which of these weapons you would like best to carry about you said the doctor mr bernard laughed and looked at the doctor as if he half doubted whether he was in earnest this looks dangerous enough he said for the man who carries it at least he took down one of the prohibited spanish daggers or knives which a traveller may occasionally get hold of and smuggle out of the country the blade was broad trowellike but the point drawn out several inches so as to look like a skewer this must be a jealous bullfighters weapon he said and put it back in its place then he took down an ancientlooking broadbladed dagger with a complex aspect about it as if it had some kind of mechanism connected with it take care said the doctor there is a trick to that dagger he took it and touched a spring the dagger split suddenly into three blades as when one separates the forefinger and the ringfinger from the middle one the outside blades were sharp on their outer edge the stab was to be made with the dagger shut then the spring touched and the split blades withdrawn mr bernard replaced it saying that it would have served for sidearm to old suwarrow who told his men to work their bayonets back and forward when they pinned a turk but to wriggle them about in the wound when they stabbed a frenchman here said the doctor this is the thing you want he took down a much more modern and familiar implement a small beautifully finished revolver i want you to carry this he said and more than that i want you to practise with it often as for amusement but so that it maybe seen and understood that you are apt to have a pistol about you pistolshooting is pleasant sport enough and there is no reason why you should not practise it like other young fellows and now the doctor said i have one other weapon to give you he took a small piece of parchment and shook a white powder into it from one of his medicinejars the jar was marked with the name of a mineral salt of a nature to have been serviceable in case of sudden illness in the time of the borgias the doctor folded the parchment carefully and marked the latin name of the powder upon it here he said handing it to mr bernard you see what it is and you know what service it can render keep these two protectors about your person day and night they will not harm you and you may want one or the other or both before you think of it mr bernard thought it was very odd and not very oldgentlemanlike to be fitting him out for treason stratagem and spoils in this way there was no harm however in carrying a doctors powder in his pocket or in amusing himself with shooting at a mark as he had often done before if the old gentleman had these fancies it was as well to humor him so he thanked old doctor kittredge and shook his hand warmly as he left him the fellows hand did not tremble nor his color change the doctor said as he watched him walking away he is one of the right sort chapter xvi epistolary mr langdon to the professor my dear professor you were kind enough to promise me that you would assist me in any professional or scientific investigations in which i might become engaged i have of late become deeply interested in a class of subjects which present peculiar difficulty and i must exercise the privilege of questioning you on some points upon which i desire information i cannot otherwise obtain i would not trouble you if i could find any person or books competent to enlighten me on some of these singular matters which have so excited me the leading doctor here is a shrewd sensible man but not versed in the curiosities of medical literature i proceed with your leave to ask a considerable number of questions hoping to get answers to some of them at least is there any evidence that human beings can be infected or wrought upon by poisons or otherwise so that they shall manifest any of the peculiarities belonging to beings of a lower nature can such peculiarities be transmitted by inheritance is there anything to countenance the stories long and widely current about the evil eye or is it a mere fancy that such a power belongs to any human being have you any personal experience as to the power of fascination said to be exercised by certain animals what can you make of those circumstantial statements we have seen in the papers of children forming mysterious friendships with ophidians of different species sharing their food with them and seeming to be under some subtile influence exercised by those creatures have you read critically coleridges poem of christabel and keatss lamia if so can you understand them or find any physiological foundation for the story of either there is another set of questions of a different nature i should like to ask but it is hardly fair to put so many on a single sheet there is one however you must answer do you think there may be predispositions inherited or ingrafted but at any rate constitutional which shall take out certain apparently voluntary determinations from the control of the will and leave them as free from moral responsibility as the instincts of the lower animals do you not think there may be a crime which is not a sin pardon me my dear sir for troubling you with such a list of notes of interrogation there are some very strange things going on here in this place countrytown as it is countrylife is apt to be dull but when it once gets going it beats the city hollow because it gives its whole mind to what it is about these rural sinners make terrible work with the middle of the decalogue when they get started however i hope i shall live through my years schoolkeeping without catastrophes though there are queer doings about me which puzzle me and might scare some people if anything should happen you will be one of the first to hear of it no doubt but i trust not to help out the editors of the rockland weekly universe with an obituary of the late lamented who signed himself in life your friend and pupil bernard c langdon the professor to mr langdon my dear mr langdon i do not wonder that you find no answer from your country friends to the curious questions you put they belong to that middle region between science and poetry which sensible men as they are called are very shy of meddling with some people think that truth and gold are always to be washed for but the wiser sort are of opinion that unless there are so many grains to the peck of sand or nonsense respectively it does not pay to wash for either so long as one can find anything else to do i dont doubt there is some truth in the phenomena of animal magnetism for instance but when you ask me to cradle for it i tell you that the hysteric girls cheat so and the professionals are such a set of pickpockets that i can do something better than hunt for the grains of truth among their tricks and lies do you remember what i used to say in my lectures or were you asleep just then or cutting your initials on the rail you see i can ask questions my young friend leverage is everything was what i used to say dont begin to pry till you have got the long arm on your side to please you and satisfy your doubts as far as possible i have looked into the old books into schenckius and turner and kenelm digby and the rest where i have found plenty of curious stories which you must take for what they are worth your first question i can answer in the affirmative upon pretty good authority mizaldus tells in his memorabilia the wellknown story of the girl fed on poisons who was sent by the king of the indies to alexander the great when aristotle saw her eyes sparkling and snapping like those of serpents he said look out for yourself alexander this is a dangerous companion for you and sure enough the young lady proved to be a very unsafe person to her friends cardanus gets a story from avicenna of a certain man bit by a serpent who recovered of his bite the snake dying therefrom this man afterwards had a daughter whom venomous serpents could not harm though she had a fatal power over them i suppose you may remember the statements of old authors about zycanthropy the disease in which men took on the nature and aspect of wolves actius and paulus both men of authority describe it altomaris gives a horrid case and fincelius mentions one occurring as late as the subject of which was captured still insisting that he was a wolf only that the hair of his hide was turned in versipelles it may be remembered was the latin name for these werewolves as for the cases where rabid persons have barked and bit like dogs there are plenty of such on record more singular or at least more rare is the account given by andreas baccius of a man who was struck in the hand by a cock with his beak and who died on the third day thereafter looking for all the world like a fightingcock to the great horror of the spectators as to impressions transmitted at a very early period of existence every one knows the story of king jamess fear of a naked sword and the way it is accounted for sir kenelm digby says i remember when he dubbed me knight in the ceremony of putting the point of a naked sword upon my shoulder he could not endure to look upon it but turned his face another way insomuch that in lieu of touching my shoulder he had almost thrust the point into my eyes had not the duke of buckingham guided his hand aright it is he too who tells the story of the mulberry mark upon the neck of a certain lady of high condition which every year to mulberry season did swell grow big and itch and gaffarel mentions the case of a girl born with the figure of a fish on one of her limbs of which the wonder was that when the girl did eat fish this mark put her to sensible pain but there is no end to cases of this kind and i could give some of recent date if necessary lending a certain plausibility at least to the doctrine of transmitted impressions i never saw a distinct case of evil eye though i have seen eyes so bad that they might produce strange effects on very sensitive natures but the belief in it under various names fascination jettcztura etc is so permanent and universal from egypt to italy and from the days of solomon to those of ferdinand of naples that there must be some peculiarity to say the least on which the opinion is based there is very strong evidence that some such power is exercised by certain of the lower animals thus it is stated on good authority that almost every animal becomes panicstruck at the sight of the rattlesnake and seems at once deprived of the power of motion or the exercise of its usual instinct of selfpreservation other serpents seem to share this power of fascination as the cobra and the buccephalus capensis some think that it is nothing but fright others attribute it to the strange powers that lie within the magic circle of the eye as churchill said speaking of garrick you ask me about those mysterious and frightful intimacies between children and serpents of which so many instances have been recorded i am sure i cannot tell what to make of them i have seen several such accounts in recent papers but here is one published in the seventeenth century which is as striking as any of the more modern ones mr herbert tones of monmouth when he was a little boy was used to eat his milk in a garden in the morning and was no sooner there but a large snake always came and eat out of the dish with him and did so for a considerable time till one morning he striking the snake on the head it hissed at him upon which he told his mother that the baby for so he calld it cryd hiss at him his mother had it killd which occasioned him a great fit of sickness and twas thought would have dyd but did recover there was likewise one william writtle condemned at maidston assizes for a double murder told a minister that was with him after he was condemned that his mother told him that when he was a child there crept always to him a snake wherever she laid him sometimes she would convey him up stairs and leave him never so little she should be sure to find a snake in the cradle with him but never perceived it did him any harm one of the most striking alleged facts connected with the mysterious relation existing between the serpent andthe human species is the influence which the poison of the crotulus taken internally seemed to produce over the moral faculties in the experiments instituted by dr hering at surinam there is something frightful in the disposition of certain ophidians as the whipsnake which darts at the eyes of cattle without any apparent provocation or other motive it is natural enough that the evil principle should have been represented in the form of a serpent but it is strange to think of introducing it into a human being like cowpox by vaccination you know all about the psylli or ancient serpent tamers i suppose savary gives an account of the modern serpenttamers in his letters on egypt these modern jugglers are in the habit of making the venomous naja counterfeit death lying out straight and stiff changing it into a rod as the ancient magicians did with their serpents probably the same animal in the time of moses i am afraid i cannot throw much light on christabel or lamia by any criticism i can offer geraldine in the former seems to be simply a malignant witchwoman with the evil eye but with no absolute ophidian relationship lamia is a serpent transformed by magic into a woman the idea of both is mythological and not in any sense physiological some women unquestionably suggest the image of serpents men rarely or never i have been struck like many others with the ophidian head and eye of the famous rachel your question about inherited predispositions as limiting the sphere of the will and consequently of moral accountability opens a very wide range of speculation i can give you only a brief abstract of my own opinions on this delicate and difficult subject crime and sin being the preserves of two great organized interests have been guarded against all reforming poachers with as great jealousy as the royal forests it is so easy to hang a troublesome fellow it is so much simpler to consign a soul to perdition or say masses for money to save it than to take the blame on ourselves for letting it grow up in neglect and run to ruin for want of humanizing influences they hung poor crazy bellingham for shooting mr perceval the ordinary of newgate preached to women who were to swing at tyburn for a petty theft as if they were worse than other people just as though he would not have been a pickpocket or shoplifter himself if he had been born in a den of thieves and bred up to steal or starve the english law never began to get hold of the idea that a crime was not necessarily a sin till hadfield who thought he was the saviour of mankind was tried for shooting at george the third lucky for him that he did not hit his majesty it is very singular that we recognize all the bodily defects that unfit a man for military service and all the intellectual ones that limit his range of thought but always talk at him as if all his moral powers were perfect i suppose we must punish evildoers as we extirpate vermin but i dont know that we have any more right to judge them than we have to judge rats and mice which are just as good as cats and weasels though we think it necessary to treat them as criminals the limitations of human responsibility have never been properly studied unless it be by the phrenologists you know from my lectures that i consider phrenology as taught a pseudoscience and not a branch of positive knowledge but for all that we owe it an immense debt it has melted the worlds conscience in its crucible and cast it in a new mould with features less like those of moloch and more like those of humanity if it has failed to demonstrate its system of special correspondences it has proved that there are fixed relations between organization and mind and character it has brought out that great doctrine of moral insanity which has done more to make men charitable and soften legal and theological barbarism than any one doctrine that i can think of since the message of peace and goodwill to men automatic action in the moral world the reflex movement which seems to be selfdetermination and has been hanged and howled at as such metaphorically for nobody knows how many centuries until somebody shall study this as marshall hall has studied reflex nervous action in the bodily system i would not give much for mens judgments of each others characters shut up the robber and the defaulter we must but what if your oldest boy had been stolen from his cradle and bred in a northstreet cellar what if you are drinking a little too much wine and smoking a little too much tobacco and your son takes after you and so your poor grandsons brain being a little injured in physical texture he loses the fine moral sense on which you pride yourself and doesnt see the difference between signing another mans name to a draft and his own i suppose the study of automatic action in the moral world you see what i mean through the apparent contradiction of terms may be a dangerous one in the view of many people it is liable to abuse no doubt people are always glad to get hold of anything which limits their responsibility but remember that our moral estimates come down to us from ancestors who hanged children for stealing forty shillings worth and sent their souls to perdition for the sin of being born who punished the unfortunate families of suicides and in their eagerness for justice executed one innocent person every three years on the average as sir james mackintosh tells us i do not know in what shape the practical question may present itself to you but i will tell you my rule in life and i think you will find it a good one treat bad men exactly as if they were insane they are insane out of health morally reason which is food to sound minds is not tolerated still less assimilated unless administered with the greatest caution perhaps not at all avoid collision with them so far as you honorably can keep your temper if you can for one angry man is as good as another restrain them from violence promptly completely and with the least possible injury just as in the case of maniacs and when you have got rid of them or got them tied hand and foot so that they can do no mischief sit down and contemplate them charitably remembering that nine tenths of their perversity comes from outside influences drunken ancestors abuse in childhood bad company from which you have happily been preserved and for some of which you as a member of society may be fractionally responsible i think also that there are special influences which work in the brood lake ferments and i have a suspicion that some of those curious old stories i cited may have more recent parallels have you ever met with any cases which admitted of a solution like that which i have mentioned yours very truly bernard langdon to philip staples my dear philip i have been for some months established in this place turning the main crank of the machinery for the manufactory of accomplishments superintended by or rather worked to the profit of a certain mr silas peckham he is a poor wretch with a little thin fishy blood in his body lean and flat longarmed and largehanded thickjointed and thinmuscled you know those unwholesome weakeyed halffed creatures that look not fit to be round among live folks and yet not quite dead enough to bury if you ever hear of my being in court to answer to a charge of assault and battery you may guess that i have been giving him a thrashing to settle off old scores for he is a tyrant and has come pretty near killing his principal ladyassistant with overworking her and keeping her out of all decent privileges helen darley is this ladys name twenty two or three years old i should think a very sweet pale woman daughter of the usual countryclergyman thrown on her own resources from an early age and the rest a common story but an uncommon person very all conscience and sensibility i should say a cruel worker no kind of regard for herself seems as fragile and supple as a young willowshoot but try her and you find she has the spring in her of a steel crossbow i am glad i happened to come to this place if it were only for her sake i have saved that girls life i am as sure of it as if i had pulled her out of the fire or water of course im in love with her you say we always love those whom we have benefited saved her life her love was the reward of his devotion etc etc as in a regular set novel in love philip well about that i love helen darley very much there is hardly anybody i love so well what a noble creature she is one of those that just go right on do their own work and everybody elses killing themselves inch by inch without ever thinking about it singing and dancing at their toil when they begin worn and saddened after a while but pressing steadily on tottering by and by and catching at the rail by the wayside to help them lift one foot before the other and at last falling face down arms stretched forward philip my boy do you know i am the sort of man that locks his door sometimes and cries his heart out of his eyes that can sob like a woman and not be ashamed of it i come of fightingblood on one side you know i think i could be savage on occasion but i am tender more and more tender as i come into my fulness of manhood i dont like to strike a man laugh if you like i know i hit hard when i do strike but what i cant stand is the sight of these poor patient toiling women who never find out in this life how good they are and never know what it is to be told they are angels while they still wear the pleasing incumbrances of humanity i dont know what to make of these cases to think that a woman is never to be a woman again whatever she may come to as an unsexed angel and that she should die unloved why does not somebody come and carry off this noble woman waiting here all ready to make a man happy philip do you know the pathos there is in the eyes of unsought women oppressed with the burden of an inner life unshared i can see into them now as i could not in those earlier days i sometimes think their pupils dilate on purpose to let my consciousness glide through them indeed i dread them i come so close to the nerve of the soul itself in these momentary intimacies you used to tell me i was a turk that my heart was full of pigeonholes with accommodations inside for a whole flock of doves i dont know but i am still as youngish as ever in my ways brighamyoungish i mean at any rate t always want to give a little love to all the poor things that cannot have a whole man to themselves if they would only be contented with a little here now are two girls in this school where i am teaching one of them rosa m is not more than sixteen years old i think they say but nature has forced her into a tropical luxuriance of beauty as if it were july with her instead of may i suppose it is all natural enough that this girl should like a young mans attention even if he were a grave schoolmaster but the eloquence of this young things look is unmistakable and yet she does not know the language it is talking they none of them do and there is where a good many poor creatures of our goodfornothing sex are mistaken there is no danger of my being rash but i think this girl will cost somebody his life yet she is one of those women men make a quarrel about and fight to the death for the old feral instinct you know pray dont think i am lost in conceit but there is another girl here who i begin to think looks with a certain kindness on me her name is elsie v and she is the only daughter and heiress of an old family in this place she is a portentous and almost fearful creature if i should tell you all i know and half of what i fancy about her you would tell me to get my life insured at once yet she is the most painfully interesting being so handsome so lonely for she has no friends among the girls and sits apart from them with black hair like the flow of a mountainbrook after a thaw with a lowbrowed scowling beauty of face and such eyes as were never seen before i really believe in any human creature philip i dont know what to say about this elsie there is something about her i have not fathomed i have conjectures which i could not utter to any living soul i dare not even hint the possibilities which have suggested themselves to me this i will say that i do take the most intense interest in this young person an interest much more like pity than love in its common sense if what i guess at is true of all the tragedies of existence i ever knew this is the saddest and yet so full of meaning do not ask me any questions i have said more than i meant to already but i am involved in strange doubts and perplexities in dangers too very possibly and it is a relief just to speak ever so guardedly of them to an early and faithful friend yours ever bernard p s i remember you had a copy of fortunius licetus de monstris among your old books cant you lend it to me for a while i am curious and it will amuse me chapter xvii old sophy calls on the reverend doctor the two meetinghouses which faced each other like a pair of fightingcocks had not flapped their wings or crowed at each other for a considerable time the reverend mr fairweather had been dyspeptic and lowspirited of late and was too languid for controversy the reverend doctor honeywood had been very busy with his benevolent associations and had discoursed chiefly on practical matters to the neglect of special doctrinal subjects his senior deacon ventured to say to him that some of his people required to be reminded of the great fundamental doctrine of the worthlessness of all human efforts and motives some of them were altogether too much pleased with the success of the temperance society and the association for the relief of the poor there was a pestilent heresy about concerning the satisfaction to be derived from a good conscience as if anybody ever did anything which was not to be hated loathed despised and condemned the old minister listened gravely with an inward smile and told his deacon that he would attend to his suggestion after the deacon had gone he tumbled over his manuscripts until at length he came upon his firstrate old sermon on human nature he had read a great deal of hard theology and had at last reached that curious state which is so common in good ministers that namely in which they contrive to switch off their logical faculties on the narrow sidetrack of their technical dogmas while the great freighttrain of their substantial human qualities keeps in the main highway of commonsense in which kindly souls are always found by all who approach them by their human side the doctor read his sermon with a pleasant paternal interest it was well argued from his premises here and there he dashed his pen through a harsh expression now and then he added an explanation or qualified abroad statement but his mind was on the logical sidetrack and he followed the chain of reasoning without fairly perceiving where it would lead him if he carried it into real life he was just touching up the final proposition when his granddaughter letty once before referred to came into the room with her smiling face and lively movement miss letty or letitia forrester was a citybred girl of some fifteen or sixteen years old who was passing the summer with her grandfather for the sake of country air and quiet it was a sensible arrangement for having the promise of figuring as a belle by and by and being a little given to dancing and having a voice which drew a pretty dense circle around the piano when she sat down to play and sing it was hard to keep her from being carried into society before her time by the mere force of mutual attraction fortunately she had some quiet as well as some social tastes and was willing enough to pass two or three of the summer months in the country where she was much better bestowed than she would have been at one of those wateringplaces where so many halfformed girls get prematurely hardened in the vice of selfconsciousness miss letty was altogether too wholesome hearty and highstrung a young girl to be a model according to the flatchested and cachectic pattern which is the classical type of certain excellent young females often the subjects of biographical memoirs but the old minister was proud of his granddaughter for all that she was so full of life so graceful so generous so vivacious so ready always to do all she could for him and for everybody so perfectly frank in her avowed delight in the pleasures which this miserable world offered her in the shape of natural beauty of poetry of music of companionship of books of cheerful cooperation in the tasks of those about her that the reverend doctor could not find it in his heart to condemn her because she was deficient in those particular graces and that signal otherworldliness he had sometimes noticed in feeble young persons suffering from various chronic diseases which impaired their vivacity and removed them from the range of temptation when letty therefore came bounding into the old ministers study he glanced up from his manuscript and as his eye fell upon her it flashed across him that there was nothing so very monstrous and unnatural about the specimen of congenital perversion he was looking at with his features opening into their pleasantest sunshine technically according to the fifth proposition of the sermon on human nature very bad no doubt practically according to the fact before him a very pretty piece of the creators handiwork body and soul was it not a conceivable thing that the divine grace might show itself in different forms in a fresh young girl like letitia and in that poor thing he had visited yesterday halfgrown halfcolored in bed for the last year with hipdisease was it to be supposed that this healthy young girl with life throbbing all over her could without a miracle be good according to the invalid pattern and formula and yet there were mysteries in human nature which pointed to some tremendous perversion of its tendencies to some profound radical vice of moral constitution native or transmitted as you will have it but positive at any rate as the leprosy breaking out in the blood of races guard them ever so carefully did he not know the case of a young lady in rockland daughter of one of the first families in the place a very beautiful and noble creature to look at for whose bringing up nothing had been spared a girl who had had governesses to teach her at the house who had been indulged almost too kindly a girl whose father had given himself up to her he being himself a pure and highsouled man and yet this girl was accused in whispers of having been on the very verge of committing a fatal crime she was an object of fear to all who knew the dark hints which had been let fall about her and there were some that believed why what was this but an instance of the total obliquity and degeneration of the moral principle and to what could it be owing but to an innate organic tendency busy grandpapa said letty and without waiting for an answer kissed his cheek with a pair of lips made on purpose for that little function fine but richly turned out the corners tucked in with a finish of pretty dimples the rosebud lips of girlhoods june the old gentleman looked at his granddaughter nature swelled up from his heart in a wave that sent a glow to his cheek and a sparkle to his eye but it is very hard to be interrupted just as we are winding up a string of propositions with the grand conclusion which is the statement in brief of all that has gone before our own startingpoint into which we have been trying to back our reader or listener as one backs a horse into the shafts video meliora proboque i see the better and approve it deteriora sequor i follow after the worse t is that natural dislike to what is good pure holy and true that inrooted selfishness totally insensible to the claims of here the worthy man was interrupted by miss letty do come if you can grandpapa said the young girl here is a poor old black woman wants to see you so much the good minister was as kindhearted as if he had never groped in the dust and ashes of those cruel old abstractions which have killed out so much of the worlds life and happiness with the heart man believeth unto righteousness a mans love is the measure of his fitness for good or bad company here or elsewhere men are tattooed with their special beliefs like so many southsea islanders but a real human heart with divine love in it beats with the same glow under all the patterns of all earths thousand tribes the doctor sighed and folded the sermon and laid the quarto cruden on it he rose from his desk and looking once more at the young girls face forgot his logical conclusions and said to himself that she was a little angel which was in violent contradiction to the leading doctrine of his sermon on human nature and so he followed her out of the study into the wide entry of the oldfashioned countryhouse an old black woman sat on the plain oaken settle which humble visitors waiting to see the minister were wont to occupy she was old but how old it would be very hard to guess she might be seventy she might be ninety one could not swear she was not a hundred black women remain at a stationary age to the eyes of white people at least for thirty years they do not appear to change during this period any more than so many trenton trilobites bent up wrinkled yelloweyed with long upperlip projecting jaws retreating chin still meek features long arms large flat hands with uncolored palms and slightly webbed fingers it was impossible not to see in this old creature a hint of the gradations by which life climbs up through the lower natures to the highest human developments we cannot tell such old womens ages because we do not understand the physiognomy of a race so unlike our own no doubt they see a great deal in each others faces that we cannot changes of color and expression as real as our own blushes and sudden betrayals of feeling just as these two canaries know what their single notes and short sentences and full song with this or that variation mean though it is a mystery to us unplumed mortals this particular old black woman was a striking specimen of her class old as she looked her eye was bright and knowing she wore a redandyellow turban which set off her complexion well and hoops of gold in her ears and beads of gold about her neck and an old funeral ring upon her finger she had that touching stillness about her which belongs to animals that wait to be spoken to and then look up with a kind of sad humility why sophy said the good minister is this you she looked up with the still expression on her face its ol sophy she said why said the doctor i did not believe you could walk so far as this to save the union bring sophy a glass of wine letty wines good for old folks like sophy and me after walking a good way or preaching a good while the young girl stepped into the backparlor where she found the great pewter flagon in which the wine that was left after each communionservice was brought to the ministers house with much toil she managed to tip it so as to get a couple of glasses filled the minister tasted his and made old sophy finish hers i wan to see you n talk wi you all alone she said presently the minister got up and led the way towards his study to be sure he said he had only waited for her to rest a moment before he asked her into the library the young girl took her gently by the arm and helped her feeble steps along the passage when they reached the study she smoothed the cushion of a rockingchair and made the old woman sit down in it then she tripped lightly away and left her alone with the minister old sophy was a member of the reverend doctor honeywoods church she had been put through the necessary confessions in a tolerably satisfactory manner to be sure as her grandfather had been a cannibal chief according to the common story and at any rate a terrible wild savage and as her mother retained to the last some of the prejudices of her early education there was a heathen flavor in her christianity which had often scandalized the elder of the ministers two deacons but the good minister had smoothed matters over had explained that allowances were to be made for those who had been long sitting without the gate of zion that no doubt a part of the curse which descended to the children of ham consisted in having the understanding darkened as well as the skin and so had brought his suspicious senior deacon to tolerate old sophy as one of the communion of fellowsinners poor things how little we know the simple notions with which these rudiments of souls are nourished by the divine goodness did not mrs professor come home this very blessed morning with a story of one of her old black women and how do you feel today mrs robinson oh my dear i have this singing in my head all the time what doctors call tinnitus aurium she s got a cold in the head said old mrs rider oh no my dear whatever im thinking about its all this singing this music when im thinking of the dear redeemer it all turns into this singing and music when the clark came to see me i asked him if he couldnt cure me and he said no it was the holy spirit in me singing to me and all the time i hear this beautiful music and its the holy spirit asinging to me the good man waited for sophy to speak but she did not open her lips as yet i hope you are not troubled in mind or body he said to her at length finding she did not speak the poor old woman took out a white handkerchief and lifted it to her black face she could not say a word for her tears and sobs the minister would have consoled her he was used to tears and could in most cases withstand their contagion manfully but something choked his voice suddenly and when he called upon it he got no answer but a tremulous movement of the muscles which was worse than silence at last she spoke oh no no no its my poor girl my darling my beauty my baby that s grown up to be a woman she will come to a bad end she will do something that will make them kill her or shut her up all her life or doctor doctor save her pray for her it ant her fault it ant her fault if they knew all that i know they would n blame that poor child i must tell you doctor if i should die perhaps nobody else would tell you massa veneer cant talk about it doctor kittredge wont talk about it nobody but old sophy to tell you doctor and old sophy cant die without telling you the kind minister soothed the poor old soul with those gentle quieting tones which had carried peace and comfort to so many chambers of sickness and sorrow to so many hearts overburdened by the trials laid upon them old sophy became quiet in a few minutes and proceeded to tell her story she told it in the low halfwhisper which is the natural voice of lips oppressed wish grief and fears with quick glances around the apartment from time to time as if she dreaded lest the dim portraits on the walls and the dark folios on the shelves might overhear her words it was not one of those conversations which a third person can report minutely unless by that miracle of clairvoyance known to the readers of stories made out of authors brains yet its main character can be imparted in a much briefer space than the old black woman took to give all its details she went far back to the time when dudley venner was born she being then a middleaged woman the heir and hope of a family which had been narrowing down as if doomed to extinction he had been surrounded with every care and trained by the best education he could have in new england he had left college and was studying the profession which gentlemen of leisure most affect when he fell in love with a young girl left in the world almost alone as he was the old woman told the story of his young love and his joyous bridal with a tenderness which had something more even than her family sympathies to account for it had she not hanging over her bed a papercutting of a profile jet black but not blacker than the face it represented of one who would have been her own husband in the small years of this century if the vessel in which he went to sea like jamie in the ballad had not sailed away and never come back to land had she not her bits of furniture stowed away which had been got ready for her own wedding two rockingchairs one worn with long use one kept for him so long that it had grown a superstition with her never to sit in it and might he not come back yet after all had she not her chest of linen ready for her humble housekeeping with store of serviceable huckaback and piles of neatly folded kerchiefs wherefrom this one that showed so white against her black face was taken for that she knew her eyes would betray her in the presence all the first part of the story the old woman told tenderly and yet dwelling upon every incident with a loving pleasure how happy this young couple had been what plans and projects of improvement they had formed how they lived in each other always together so young and fresh and beautiful as she remembered them in that one early summer when they walked arm in arm through the wilderness of roses that ran riot in the garden she told of this as loath to leave it and come to the woe that lay beneath she told the whole storyshall i repeat it not now if in the course of relating the incidents i have undertaken to report it tells itself perhaps this will be better than to run the risk of producing a painful impression on some of those susceptible readers whom it would be illadvised to disturb or excite when they rather require to be amused and soothed in our pictures of life we must show the floweringout of terrible growths which have their roots deep deep underground just how far we shall lay bare the unseemly roots themselves is a matter of discretion and taste and which none of us are infallible the old woman told the whole story of elsie of her birth of her peculiarities of person and disposition of the passionate fears and hopes with which her father had watched the course of her development she recounted all her strange ways from the hour when she first tried to crawl across the carpet and her fathers look as she worked her way towards him with the memory of juliets nurse she told the story of her teething and how the woman to whose breast she had clung dying suddenly about that time they had to struggle hard with the child before she would learn the accomplishment of feeding with a spoon and so of her fierce plays and fiercer disputes with that boy who had been her companion and the whole scene of the quarrel when she struck him with those sharp white teeth frightening her old sophy almost to death for as she said the boy would have died if it hadnt been for the old doctors galloping over as fast as he could gallop and burning the places right out of his arm then came the story of that other incident sufficiently alluded to already which had produced such an ecstasy of fright and left such a nightmare of apprehension in the household and so the old woman came down to this present time that boy she never loved nor trusted was grown to a dark dangerouslooking man and he was under their roof he wanted to marry our poor elsie and elsie hated him and sometimes she would look at him over her shoulder just as she used to look at that woman she hated and she old sophy couldnt sleep for thinking she should hear a scream from the white chamber some night and find him in spasms such as that woman came so near dying with and then there was something about elsie she did not know what to make of she would sit and hang her head sometimes and look as if she were dreaming and she brought home books they said a young gentleman up at the great school lent her and once she heard her whisper in her sleep and she talked as young girls do to themselves when theyre thinking about somebody they have a liking for and think nobody knows it she finished her long story at last the minister had listened to it in perfect silence he sat still even when she had done speaking still and lost in thought it was a very awkward matter for him to have a hand in old sophy was his parishioner but the veneers had a pew in the reverend mr fairweathers meetinghouse it would seem that he mr fairweather was the natural adviser of the parties most interested had he sense and spirit enough to deal with such people was there enough capital of humanity in his somewhat limited nature to furnish sympathy and unshrinking service for his friends in an emergency or was he too busy with his own attacks of spiritual neuralgia and too much occupied with taking account of stock of his own thinblooded offences to forget himself and his personal interests on the small scale and the large and run a risk of his life if need were at any rate give himself up without reserve to the dangerous task of guiding and counselling these distressed and imperilled fellowcreatures the good minister thought the best thing to do would be to call and talk over some of these matters with brother fairweather for so he would call him at times especially if his senior deacon were not within earshot having settled this point he comforted sophy with a few words of counsel and a promise of coming to see her very soon he then called his man to put the old white horse into the chaise and drive sophy back to the mansionhouse when the doctor sat down to his sermon again it looked very differently from the way it had looked at the moment he left it when he came to think of it he did not feel quite so sure practically about that matter of the utter natural selfishness of everybody there was letty now seemed to take a very unselfish interest in that old black woman and indeed in poor people generally perhaps it would not be too much to say that she was always thinking of other people he thought he had seen other young persons naturally unselfish thoughtful for others it seemed to be a family trait in some he had known but most of all he was exercised about this poor girl whose story sophy had been telling if what the old woman believed was true and it had too much semblance of probability what became of his theory of ingrained moral obliquity applied to such a case if by the visitation of god a person receives any injury which impairs the intellect or the moral perceptions is it not monstrous to judge such a person by our common working standards of right and wrong certainly everybody will answer in cases where there is a palpable organic change brought about as when a blow on the head produces insanity fools how long will it be before we shall learn that for every wound which betrays itself to the sight by a scar there are a thousand unseen mutilations that cripple each of them some one or more of our highest faculties if what sophy told and believed was the real truth what prayers could be agonizing enough what tenderness could be deep enough for this poor lost blighted hapless blameless child of misfortune struck by such a doom as perhaps no living creature in all the sisterhood of humanity shared with her the minister thought these matters over until his mind was bewildered with doubts and tossed to and fro on that stormy deep of thought heaving forever beneath the conflict of windy dogmas he laid by his old sermon he put back a pile of old commentators with their eyes and mouths and hearts full of the dust of the schools then he opened the book of genesis at the eighteenth chapter and read that remarkable argument of abrahams with his maker in which he boldly appeals to first principles he took as his text shall not the judge of all the earth do right and began to write his sermon afterwards so famous on the obligations of an infinite creator to a finite creature it astonished the good people who had been accustomed so long to repeat mechanically their oriental hyperboles of selfabasement to hear their worthy minister maintaining that the dignified attitude of the old patriarch insisting on what was reasonable and fair with reference to his fellowcreatures was really much more respectful to his maker and a great deal manlier and more to his credit than if he had yielded the whole matter and pretended that men had not rights as well as duties the same logic which had carried him to certain conclusions with reference to human nature this same irresistible logic carried him straight on from his text until he arrived at those other results which not only astonished his people as was said but surprised himself he went so far in defence of the rights of man that he put his foot into several heresies for which men had been burned so often it was time if ever it could be to acknowledge the demonstration of the argumentum ad ignem he did not believe in the responsibility of idiots he did not believe a newborn infant was morally answerable for other peoples acts he thought a man with a crooked spine would never be called to account for not walking erect he thought if the crook was in his brain instead of his back he could not fairly be blamed for any consequence of this natural defect whatever lawyers or divines might call it he argued that if a person inherited a perfect mind body and disposition and had perfect teaching from infancy that person could do nothing more than keep the moral law perfectly but supposing that the creator allows a person to be born with an hereditary or ingrafted organic tendency and then puts this person into the hands of teachers incompetent or positively bad is not what is called sin or transgression of the law necessarily involved in the premises is not a creator bound to guard his children against the ruin which inherited ignorance might entail on them would it be fair for a parent to put into a childs hands the titledeeds to all its future possessions and a bunch of matches and are not men children nay babes in the eye of omniscience the minister grew bold in his questions had not he as good right to ask questions as abraham this was the dangerous vein of speculation in which the reverend doctor honeywood found himself involved as a consequence of the suggestions forced upon him by old sophys communication the truth was the good man had got so humanized by mixing up with other people in various benevolent schemes that the very moment he could escape from his old scholastic abstractions he took the side of humanity instinctively just as the father of the faithful did all honor be to the noble old patriarch for insisting on the worth of an honest man and making the best terms he could for a very illconditioned metropolis which might possibly however have contained ten righteous people for whose sake it should be spared the consequence of all this was that he was in a singular and seemingly selfcontradictory state of mind when he took his hat and cane and went forth to call on his heretical brother the old minister took it for granted that the reverend mr fairweather knew the private history of his parishioners family he did not reflect that there are griefs men never put into words that there are fears which must not be spoken intimate matters of consciousness which must be carried as bullets which have been driven deep into the living tissues are sometimes carried for a whole lifetime encysted griefs if we may borrow the chirurgeons term never to be reached never to be seen never to be thrown out but to go into the dust with the frame that bore them about with it during long years of anguish known only to the sufferer and his maker dudley venner had talked with his minister about this child of his but he had talked cautiously feeling his way for sympathy looking out for those indications of tact and judgment which would warrant him in some partial communication at least of the origin of his doubts and fears and never finding them there was something about the reverend mr fairweather which repressed all attempts at confidential intercourse what this something was dudley venner could hardly say but he felt it distinctly and it sealed his lips he never got beyond certain generalities connected with education and religious instruction the minister could not help discovering however that there were difficulties connected with this girls management and he heard enough outside of the family to convince him that she had manifested tendencies from an early age at variance with the theoretical opinions he was in the habit of preaching and in a dim way of holding for truth as to the natural dispositions of the human being about this terrible fact of congenital obliquity his new beliefs began to cluster as a centre and to take form as a crystal around its nucleus still he might perhaps have struggled against them had it not been for the little roman catholic chapel he passed every sunday on his way to the meetinghouse such a crowd of worshippers swarming into the pews like bees filling all the aisles running over at the door like berries heaped too full in the measure some kneeling on the steps some standing on the sidewalk hats off heads down lips moving some looking on devoutly from the other side of the street oh could he have followed his own bridget maid of all work into the heart of that steaming throng and bowed his head while the priests intoned their latin prayers could he have snuffed up the cloud of frankincense and felt that he was in the great ark which holds the better half of the christian world while all around it are wretched creatures some struggling against the waves in leaky boats and some on illconnected rafts and some with their heads just above water thinking to ride out the flood which is to sweep the earth clean of sinners upon their own private individual lifepreservers such was the present state of mind of the reverend chauncy fairweather when his clerical brother called upon him to talk over the questions to which old sophy had called his attention chapter viii the reverend doctor calls on brother fairweather for the last few months while all these various matters were going on in rockland the reverend chauncy fairweather had been busy with the records of ancient councils and the writings of the early fathers the more he read the more discontented he became with the platform upon which he and his people were standing they and he were clearly in a minority and his deep inward longing to be with the majority was growing into an engrossing passion he yearned especially towards the good old unquestioning authoritative mother church with her articles of faith which took away the necessity for private judgment with her traditional forms and ceremonies and her whole apparatus of stimulants and anodynes about this time he procured a breviary and kept it in his desk under the loose papers he sent to a catholic bookstore and obtained a small crucifix suspended from a string of beads he ordered his new coat to be cut very narrow in the collar and to be made singlebreasted he began an informal series of religious conversations with miss obrien the young person of irish extraction already referred to as bridget maid of all work these not proving very satisfactory he managed to fall in with father mcshane the catholic priest of the rockland church father mcshane encouraged his nibble very scientifically it would be such a fine thing to bring over one of those protestant heretics and a liberal one too not that there was any real difference between them but it sounded better to say that one of these rationalizing freeandequal religionists had been made a convert than any of those halfway protestants who were the slaves of catechisms instead of councils and of commentators instead of popes the subtle priest played his disciple with his finest tackle it was hardly necessary when anything or anybody wishes to be caught a bare hook and a coarse line are all that is needed if a man has a genuine sincere hearty wish to get rid of his liberty if he is really bent upon becoming a slave nothing can stop him and the temptation is to some natures a very great one liberty is often a heavy burden on a man it involves that necessity for perpetual choice which is the kind of labor men have always dreaded in common life we shirk it by forming habits which take the place of selfdetermination in politics partyorganization saves us the pains of much thinking before deciding how to cast our vote in religious matters there are great multitudes watching us perpetually each propagandist ready with his bundle of finalities which having accepted we may be at peace the more absolute the submission demanded the stronger the temptation becomes to those who have been long tossed among doubts and conflicts so it is that in all the quiet bays which indent the shores of the great ocean of thought at every sinking wharf we see moored the hulks and the razees of enslaved or halfenslaved intelligences they rock peacefully as children in their cradles on the subdued swell which comes feebly in over the bar at the harbors mouth slowly crusting with barnacles pulling at their iron cables as if they really wanted to be free but better contented to remain bound as they are for these no more the round unwalled horizon of the open sea the joyous breeze aloft the furrow the foam the sparkle that track the rushing keel they have escaped the dangers of the wave and lie still henceforth evermore happiest of souls if lethargy is bliss and palsy the chief beatitude america owes its political freedom to religious protestantism but political freedom is reacting on religious prescription with still mightier force we wonder therefore when we find a soul which was born to a full sense of individual liberty an unchallenged right of selfdetermination on every new alleged truth offered to its intelligence voluntarily surrendering any portion of its liberty to a spiritual dictatorship which always proves to rest in the last analysis on a majority vote nothing more nor less commonly an old one passed in those barbarous times when men cursed and murdered each other for differences of opinion and of course were not in a condition to settle the beliefs of a comparatively civilized community in our disgust we are liable to be intolerant we forget that weakness is not in itself a sin we forget that even cowardice may call for our most lenient judgment if it spring from innate infirmity who of us does not look with great tenderness on the young chieftain in the fair maid of perth when he confesses his want of courage all of us love companionship and sympathy some of us may love them too much all of us are more or less imaginative in our theology some of us may find the aid of material symbols a comfort if not a necessity the boldest thinker may have his moments of languor and discouragement when he feels as if he could willingly exchange faiths with the old beldame crossing herself at the cathedraldoor nay that if he could drop all coherent thought and lie in the flowery meadow with the browneyed solemnly unthinking cattle looking up to the sky and all their simple consciousness staining itself blue then down to the grass and life turning to a mere greenness blended with confused scents of herbs no individual mindmovement such as men are teased with but the great calm cattlesense of all time and all places that know the milky smell of herds if he could be like these he would be content to be driven home by the cowboy and share the grassy banquet of the king of ancient babylon let us be very generous then in our judgment of those who leave the front ranks of thought for the company of the meek noncombatants who follow with the baggage and provisions age illness too much wear and tear a halfformed paralysis may bring any of us to this pass but while we can think and maintain the rights of our own individuality against every human combination let us not forget to caution all who are disposed to waver that there is a cowardice which is criminal and a longing for rest which it is baseness to indulge god help him over whose dead soul in his living body must be uttered the sad supplication requiescat in pace a knock at the reverend mr fairweathers study door called his eyes from the book on which they were intent he looked up as if expecting a welcome guest the reverend pierrepont honeywood d d entered the study of the reverend chauncy fairweather he was not the expected guest mr fairweather slipped the book he was reading into a halfopen drawer and pushed in the drawer he slid something which rattled under a paper lying on the table he rose with a slight change of color and welcomed a little awkwardly his unusual visitor goodevening brother fairweather said the reverend doctor in a very cordial goodhumored way i hope i am not spoiling one of those eloquent sermons i never have a chance to hear not at all not at all the younger clergyman answered in a languid tone with a kind of habitual halfquerulousness which belonged to it the vocal expression which we meet with now and then and which says as plainly as so many words could say it i am a suffering individual i am persistently undervalued wronged and imposed upon by mankind and the powers of the universe generally but i endure all i endure you speak i listen it is a burden to me but i even approve i sacrifice myself behold this movement of my lips it is a smile the reverend doctor knew this forlorn way of mr fairweathers and was not troubled by it he proceeded to relate the circumstances of his visit from the old black woman and the fear she was in about the young girl who being a parishioner of mr fairweathers he had thought it best to come over and speak to him about old sophys fears and fancies in telling the old womans story he alluded only vaguely to those peculiar circumstances to which she had attributed so much importance taking it for granted that the other minister must be familiar with the whole series of incidents she had related the old minister was mistaken as we have before seen mr fairweather had been settled in the place only about ten years and if he had heard a strange hint now and then about elsie had never considered it as anything more than idle and ignorant if not malicious villagegossip all that he fully understood was that this had been a perverse and unmanageable child and that the extraordinary care which had been bestowed on her had been so far thrown away that she was a dangerous selfwilled girl whom all feared and almost all shunned as if she carried with her some malignant influence he replied therefore after hearing the story that elsie had always given trouble there seemed to be a kind of natural obliquity about her perfectly unaccountable a very dark case never amenable to good influences had sent her good books from the sundayschool library remembered that she tore out the frontispiece of one of them and kept it and flung the book out of the window it was a picture of eves temptation and he recollected her saying that eve was a good woman and shed have done just so if shed been there a very sad child very sad bad from infancy he had talked himself bold and said all at once doctor do you know i am almost ready to accept your doctrine of the congenital sinfulness of human nature i am afraid that is the only thing which goes to the bottom of the difficulty the old ministers face did not open so approvingly as mr fairweather had expected why yes well many find comfort in it i believe there is much to be said there are many bad people and bad children i cant be so sure about bad babies though they cry very malignantly at times especially if they have the stomachache but i really dont know how to condemn this poor elsie she may have impulses that act in her like instincts in the lower animals and so not come under the bearing of our ordinary rules of judgment but this depraved tendency doctor this unaccountable perverseness my dear sir i am afraid your school is in the right about human nature oh those words of the psalmist shapen in iniquity and the rest what are we to do with them we who teach that the soul of a child is an unstained white tablet king david was very subject to fits of humility and much given to selfreproaches said the doctor in a rather dry way we owe you and your friends a good deal for calling attention to the natural graces which after all may perhaps be considered as another form of manifestation of the divine influence some of our writers have pressed rather too hard on the tendencies of the human soul toward evil as such it maybe questioned whether these views have not interfered with the sound training of certain young persons sons of clergymen and others i am nearer of your mind about the possibility of educating children so that they shall become good christians without any violent transition that is what i should hope for from bringing them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord the younger minister looked puzzled but presently answered possibly we may have called attention to some neglected truths but after all i fear we must go to the old school if we want to get at the root of the matter i know there is an outward amiability about many young persons some young girls especially that seems like genuine goodness but i have been disposed of late to lean toward your view that these human affections as we see them in our children ours i say though i have not the fearful responsibility of training any of my own are only a kind of disguised and sinful selfishness the old minister groaned in spirit his heart had been softened by the sweet influences of children and grandchildren he thought of a halfsized grave in the burialground and the fine brave noblehearted boy he laid in it thirty years before the sweet cheerful child who had made his home all sunshine until the day when he was brought into it his long curls dripping his fresh lips purpled in death foolish dear little blessed creature to throw himself into the deep water to save the drowning boy who clung about him and carried him under disguised selfishness and his granddaughter too whose disguised selfishness was the light of his household dont call it my view he said abstractly perhaps all natures may be considered vitiated but practically as i see it in life the divine grace keeps pace with the perverted instincts from infancy in many natures besides this perversion itself may often be disease bad habits transmitted like drunkenness or some hereditary misfortune as with this elsie we were talking about the younger minister was completely mystified at every step he made towards the doctors recognized theological position the doctor took just one step towards his they would cross each other soon at this rate and might as well exchange pulpits as colonel sprowle once wished they would it may be remembered the doctor though a much clearerheaded man was almost equally puzzled he turned the conversation again upon elsie and endeavored to make her minister feel the importance of bringing every friendly influence to bear upon her at this critical period of her life his sympathies did not seem so lively as the doctor could have wished perhaps he had vastly more important objects of solicitude in his own spiritual interests a knock at the door interrupted them the reverend mr fairweather rose and went towards it as he passed the table his coat caught something which came rattling to the floor it was a crucifix with a string of beads attached as he opened the door the milesian features of father mcshane presented themselves and from their centre proceeded the clerical benediction in irishsounding latin pax vobiscum the reverend doctor honeywood rose and left the priest and his disciple together chapter xix the spider on his thread there was nobody then to counsel poor elsie except her father who had learned to let her have her own way so as not to disturb such relations as they had together and the old black woman who had a real though limited influence over the girl perhaps she did not need counsel to look upon her one might well suppose that she was competent to defend herself against any enemy she was like to have that glittering piercing eye was not to be softened by a few smooth words spoken in low tones charged with the common sentiments which win their way to maidens hearts that round lithe sinuous figure was as full of dangerous life as ever lay under the slender flanks and cleanshaped limbs of a panther there were particular times when elsie was in such a mood that it must have been a bold person who would have intruded upon her with reproof or counsel this is one of her days old sophy would say quietly to her father and he would as far as possible leave her to herself these days were more frequent as old sophys keen concentrated watchfulness had taught her at certain periods of the year it was in the heats of summer that they were most common and most strongly characterized in winter on the other hand she was less excitable and even at times heavy and as if chilled and dulled in her sensibilities it was a strange paroxysmal kind of life that belonged to her it seemed to come and go with the sunlight all winter long she would be comparatively quiet easy to manage listless slow in her motions her eye would lose something of its strange lustre and the old nurse would feel so little anxiety that her whole expression and aspect would show the change and people would say to her why sophy how young youre looking as the spring came on elsie would leave the fireside have her tigerskin spread in the empty southern chamber next the wall and lie there basking for whole hours in the sunshine as the season warmed the light would kindle afresh in her eyes and the old womans sleep would grow restless again for she knew that so long as the glitter was fierce in the girls eyes there was no trusting her impulses or movements at last when the veins of the summer were hot and swollen and the juices of all the poisonplants and the blood of all the creatures that feed upon them had grown thick and strong about the time when the second mowing was in hand and the brown wetfaced men were following up the scythes as they chased the falling waves of grass falling as the waves fall on sicklecurved beaches the foamflowers dropping as the grassflowers drop with sharp semivowel consonantal sounds frsh for that is the way the sea talks and leaves all pure vowelsounds for the winds to breathe over it and all mutes to the unyielding earth about this time of overripe midsummer the life of elsie seemed fullest of its malign and restless instincts this was the period of the year when the rockland people were most cautious of wandering in the leafier coverts which skirted the base of the mountain and the farmers liked to wear thick long boots whenever they went into the bushes but elsie was never so much given to roaming over the mountain as at this season and as she had grown more absolute and uncontrollable she was as like to take the night as the day for her rambles at this season too all her peculiar tastes in dress and ornament came out in a more striking way than at other times she was never so superb as then and never so threatening in her scowling beauty the barred skirts she always fancied showed sharply beneath her diaphanous muslins the diamonds often glittered on her breast as if for her own pleasure rather than to dazzle others the asplike bracelet hardly left her arm she was never seen without some necklace either the golden cord she wore at the great party or a chain of mosaics or simply a ring of golden scales some said that elsie always slept in a necklace and that when she died she was to be buried in one it was a fancy of hers but many thought there was a reason for it nobody watched elsie with a more searching eye than her cousin dick venner he had kept more out of her way of late it is true but there was not a movement she made which he did not carefully observe just so far as he could without exciting her suspicion it was plain enough to him that the road to fortune was before him and that the first thing was to marry elsie what course he should take with her or with others interested after marrying her need not be decided in a hurry he had now done all he could expect to do at present in the way of conciliating the other members of the household the girls father tolerated him if he did not even like him whether he suspected his project or not dick did not feel sure but it was something to have got a foothold in the house and to have overcome any prepossession against him which his uncle might have entertained to be a good listener and a bad billiardplayer was not a very great sacrifice to effect this object then old sophy could hardly help feeling welldisposed towards him after the gifts he had bestowed on her and the court he had paid her these were the only persons on the place of much importance to gain over the people employed about the house and farmlands had little to do with elsie except to obey her without questioning her commands mr richard began to think of reopening his second parallel but he had lost something of the coolness with which he had begun his system of operations the more he had reflected upon the matter the more he had convinced himself that this was his one great chance in life if he suffered this girl to escape him such an opportunity could hardly in the nature of things present itself a second time only one life between elsie and her fortune and lives are so uncertain the girl might not suit him as a wife possibly time enough to find out after he had got her in short he must have the property and elsie venner as she was to go with it and then if he found it convenient and agreeable to lead a virtuous life he would settle down and raise children and vegetables but if he found it inconvenient and disagreeable so much the worse for those who made it so like many other persons he was not principled against virtue provided virtue were a better investment than its opposite but he knew that there might be contingencies in which the property would be better without its incumbrances and he contemplated this conceivable problem in the light of all its possible solutions one thing mr richard could not conceal from himself elsie had some new cause of indifference at least if not of aversion to him with the acuteness which persons who make a sole business of their own interest gain by practice so that fortunehunters are often shrewd where real lovers are terribly simple he fixed at once on the young man up at the school where the girl had been going of late as probably at the bottom of it cousin elsie in love so he communed with himself upon his lonely pillow in love with a yankee schoolmaster what else can it be let him look out for himself hell stand but a bad chance between us what makes you think shes in love with him met her walking with him dont like her looks and ways shes thinking about something anyhow where does she get those books she is reading so often not out of our library that s certain if i could have ten minutes peep into her chamber now i would find out where she got them and what mischief she was up to at that instant as if some tributary demon had heard his wish a shape which could be none but elsies flitted through a gleam of moonlight into the shadow of the trees she was setting out on one of her midnight rambles dick felt his heart stir in its place and presently his cheeks flushed with the old longing for an adventure it was not much to invade a young girls deserted chamber but it would amuse a wakeful hour and tell him some little matters he wanted to know the chamber he slept in was over the room which elsie chiefly occupied at this season there was no great risk of his being seen or heard if he ventured downstairs to her apartment mr richard venner in the pursuit of his interesting project arose and lighted a lamp he wrapped himself in a dressinggown and thrust his feet into a pair of cloth slippers he stole carefully down the stair and arrived safely at the door of elsies room the young lady had taken the natural precaution to leave it fastened carrying the key with her no doubt unless indeed she had got out by the window which was not far from the ground dick could get in at this window easily enough but he did not like the idea of leaving his footprints in the flowerbed just under it he returned to his own chamber and held a council of war with himself he put his head out of his own window and looked at that beneath it was open he then went to one of his trunks which he unlocked and began carefully removing its contents what these were we need not stop to mention only remarking that there were dresses of various patterns which might afford an agreeable series of changes and in certain contingencies prove eminently useful after removing a few of these he thrust his hand to the very bottom of the remaining pile and drew out a coiled strip of leather many yards in length ending in a noose a tough wellseasoned lasso looking as if it had seen service and was none the worse for it he uncoiled a few yards of this and fastened it to the knob of a door then he threw the loose end out of the window so that it should hang by the open casement of elsies room by this he let himself down opposite her window and with a slight effort swung himself inside the room he lighted a match found a candle and having lighted that looked curiously about him as clodius might have done when he smuggled himself in among the vestals elsies room was almost as peculiar as her dress and ornaments it was a kind of museum of objects such as the woods are full of to those who have eyes to see them but many of them such as only few could hope to reach even if they knew where to look for them crows nests which are never found but in the tall trees commonly enough in the forks of ancient hemlocks eggs of rare birds which must have taken a quick eye and a hard climb to find and get hold of mosses and ferns of unusual aspect and quaint monstrosities of vegetable growth such as nature delights in showed that elsie had her tastes and fancies like any naturalist or poet nature when left to her own freaks in the forest is grotesque and fanciful to the verge of license and beyond it the foliage of trees does not always require clipping to make it look like an image of life from those windows at canoe meadow among the mountains we could see all summer long a lion rampant a shanghai chicken and general jackson on horseback done by nature in green leaves each with a single tree but to natures tricks with boughs and roots and smaller vegetable growths there is no end her fancy is infinite and her humor not always refined there is a perpetual reminiscence of animal life in her rude caricatures which sometimes actually reach the point of imitating the complete human figure as in that extraordinary specimen which nobody will believe to be genuine except the men of science and of which the discreet reader may have a glimpse by application in the proper quarter elsie had gathered so many of these sculpturelike monstrosities that one might have thought she had robbed old sophys grandfather of his fetishes they helped to give her room a kind of enchanted look as if a witch had her home in it over the fireplace was a long stafflike branch strangled in the spiral coils of one of those vines which strain the smaller trees in their clinging embraces sinking into the bark until the parasite becomes almost identified with its support with these sylvan curiosities were blended objects of art some of them not less singular but others showing a love for the beautiful in form and color such as a girl of fine organization and nice culture might naturally be expected to feel and to indulge in adorning her apartment all these objects pictures bronzes vases and the rest did not detain mr richard veneer very long whatever may have been his sensibilities to art he was more curious about books and papers a copy of keats lay on the table he opened it and read the name of bernard c langdon on the blank leaf an envelope was on the table with elsies name written in a similar hand but the envelope was empty and he could not find the note it contained her desk was locked and it would not be safe to tamper with it he had seen enough the girl received books and notes from this fellow up at the school this usher this yankee quilldriver he was aspiring to become the lord of the dudley domain then was he elsie had been reasonably careful she had locked up her papers whatever they might be there was little else that promised to reward his curiosity but he cast his eye on everything there was a claspbible among her books dick wondered if she ever unclasped it there was a book of hymns it had her name in it and looked as if it might have been often read what the diablo had elsie to do with hymns mr richard venner was in an observing and analytical state of mind it will be noticed or he might perhaps have been touched with the innocent betrayals of the poor girls chamber had she after all some human tenderness in her heart that was not the way he put the question but whether she would take seriously to this schoolmaster and if she did what would be the neatest and surest and quickest way of putting a stop to all that nonsense all this however he could think over more safely in his own quarters so he stole softly to the window and catching the end of the leathern thong regained his own chamber and drew in the lasso it needs only a little jealousy to set a man on who is doubtful in love or wooing or to make him take hold of his courting in earnest as soon as dick had satisfied himself that the young schoolmaster was his rival in elsies good graces his whole thoughts concentrated themselves more than ever on accomplishing his great design of securing her for himself there was no time to be lost he must come into closer relations with her so as to withdraw her thoughts from this fellow and to find out more exactly what was the state of her affections if she had any so he began to court her company again to propose riding with her to sing to her to join her whenever she was strolling about the grounds to make himself agreeable according to the ordinary understanding of that phrase in every way which seemed to promise a chance for succeeding in that amiable effort the girl treated him more capriciously than ever she would be sullen and silent or she would draw back fiercely at some harmless word or gesture or she would look at him with her eyes narrowed in such a strange way and with such a wicked light in them that dick swore to himself they were too much for him and would leave her for the moment yet she tolerated him almost as a matter of necessity and sometimes seemed to take a kind of pleasure in trying her power upon him this he soon found out and humored her in the fancy that she could exercise a kind of fascination over him though there were times in which he actually felt an influence he could not understand an effect of some peculiar expression about her perhaps but still centring in those diamond eyes of hers which it made one feel so curiously to look into whether elsie saw into his object or not was more than he could tell his idea was after having conciliated the goodwill of all about her as far as possible to make himself first a habit and then a necessity with the girl not to spring any trap of a declaration upon her until tolerance had grown into such a degree of inclination as her nature was like to admit he had succeeded in the first part of his plan he was at liberty to prolong his visit at his own pleasure this was not strange these three persons dudley venner his daughter and his nephew represented all that remained of an old and honorable family had elsie been like other girls her father might have been less willing to entertain a young fellow like dick as an inmate but he had long outgrown all the slighter apprehensions which he might have had in common with all parents and followed rather than led the imperious instincts of his daughter it was not a question of sentiment but of life and death or more than that some dark ending perhaps which would close the history of his race with disaster and evil report upon the lips of all coming generations as to the thought of his nephews making love to his daughter it had almost passed from his mind he had been so long in the habit of looking at elsie as outside of all common influences and exceptional in the law of her nature that it was difficult for him to think of her as a girl to be fallen in love with many persons are surprised when others court their female relatives they know them as good young or old women enough aunts sisters nieces daughters whatever they may be but never think of anybodys falling in love with them any more than of their being struck by lightning but in this case there were special reasons in addition to the common family delusion reasons which seemed to make it impossible that she should attract a suitor who would dare to marry elsie no let her have the pleasure if it was one at any rate the wholesome excitement of companionship it might save her from lapsing into melancholy or a worse form of madness dudley venner had a kind of superstition too that if elsie could only outlive three septenaries twentyone years so that according to the prevalent idea her whole frame would have been thrice made over counting from her birth she would revert to the natural standard of health of mind and feelings from which she had been so long perverted the thought of any other motive than love being sufficient to induce richard to become her suitor had not occurred to him he had married early at that happy period when interested motives are least apt to influence the choice and his single idea of marriage was that it was the union of persons naturally drawn towards each other by some mutual attraction very simple perhaps but he had lived lonely for many years since his wifes death and judged the hearts of others most of all of his brothers son by his own he had often thought whether in case of elsies dying or being necessarily doomed to seclusion he might not adopt this nephew and make him his heir but it had not occurred to him that richard might wish to become his soninlaw for the sake of his property it is very easy to criticise other peoples modes of dealing with their children outside observers see results parents see processes they notice the trivial movements and accents which betray the blood of this or that ancestor they can detect the irrepressible movement of hereditary impulse in looks and acts which mean nothing to the common observer to be a parent is almost to be a fatalist this boy sits with legs crossed just as his uncle used to whom he never saw his grandfathers both died before he was born but he has the movement of the eyebrows which we remember in one of them and the gusty temper of three different generations can tell pretty nearly the range of possibilities and the limitations of a child actual or potential of a given stock errors excepted always because children of the same stock are not bred just alike because the traits of some less known ancestor are liable to break out at any time and because each human being has after all a small fraction of individuality about him which gives him a flavor so that he is distinguishable from others by his friends or in a court of justice and which occasionally makes a genius or a saint or a criminal of him it is well that young persons cannot read these fatal oracles of nature blind impulse is her highest wisdom after all we make our great jump and then she takes the bandage off our eyes that is the way the broad sealevel of average is maintained and the physiological democracy is enabled to fight against the principle of selection which would disinherit all the weaker children the magnificent constituency of mediocrities of which the world is made up the people without biographies whose lives have made a clear solution in the fluid menstruum of time instead of being precipitated in the opaque sediment of history but this is a narrative and not a disquisition chapter xx from without and from within there were not wanting people who accused dudley venner of weakness and bad judgment in his treatment of his daughter some were of opinion that the great mistake was in not breaking her will when she was a little child there was nothing the matter with her they said but that she had been spoiled by indulgence if they had had the charge of her theyd have brought her down shed got the upperhand of her father now but if hed only taken hold of her in season there are people who think that everything may be done if the doer be he educator or physician be only called in season no doubt but in season would often be a hundred or two years before the child was born and people never send so early as that the father of elsie veneer knew his duties and his difficulties too well to trouble himself about anything others might think or say so soon as he found that he could not govern his child he gave his life up to following her and protecting her as far as he could it was a stern and terrible trial for a man of acute sensibility and not without force of intellect and will and the manly ambition for himself and his familyname which belonged to his endowments and his position passive endurance is the hardest trial to persons of such a nature what made it still more a long martyrdom was the necessity for bearing his cross in utter loneliness he could not tell his griefs he could not talk of them even with those who knew their secret spring his minister had the unsympathetic nature which is common in the meaner sort of devotees persons who mistake spiritual selfishness for sanctity and grab at the infinite prize of the great future and elsewhere with the egotism they excommunicate in its hardly more odious forms of avarice and selfindulgence how could he speak with the old physician and the old black woman about a sorrow and a terror which but to name was to strike dumb the lips of consolation in the dawn of his manhood he had found that second consciousness for which young men and young women go about looking into each others faces with their sweet artless aim playing in every feature and making them beautiful to each other as to all of us he had found his other self early before he had grown weary in the search and wasted his freshness in vain longings the lot of many perhaps we may say of most who infringe the patent of our social order by intruding themselves into a life already upon half allowance of the necessary luxuries of existence the life he had led for a brief space was not only beautiful in outward circumstance as old sophy had described it to the reverend doctor it was that delicious process of the tuning of two souls to each other string by string not without little halfpleasing discords now and then when some chord in one or the other proves to be overstrained or overlax but always approaching nearer and nearer to harmony until they become at last as two instruments with a single voice something more than a year of this blissful doubled consciousness had passed over him when he found himself once more alone alone save for the little diamondeyed child lying in the old black womans arms with the coral necklace round her throat and the rattle in her hand he would not die by his own act it was not the way in his family there may have been other perhaps better reasons but this was enough he did not come of suicidal stock he must live for this childs sake at any rate and yet oh yet who could tell with what thoughts he looked upon her sometimes her little features would look placid and something like a smile would steal over them then all his tender feelings would rush up into his eyes and he would put his arms out to take her from the old woman but all at once her eyes would narrow and she would throw her head back and a shudder would seize him as he stooped over his child he could not look upon her he could not touch his lips to her cheek nay there would sometimes come into his soul such frightful suggestions that he would hurry from the room lest the hinted thought should become a momentary madness and he should lift his hand against the hapless infant which owed him life in those miserable days he used to wander all over the mountain in his restless endeavor to seek some relief for inward suffering in outward action he had no thought of throwing himself from the summit of any of the broken cliffs but he clambered over them recklessly as having no particular care for his life sometimes he would go into the accursed district where the venomous reptiles were always to be dreaded and court their worst haunts and kill all he could come near with a kind of blind fury which was strange in a person of his gentle nature one overhanging cliff was a favorite haunt of his it frowned upon his home beneath in a very menacing way he noticed slight seams and fissures that looked ominous what would happen if it broke off some time or other and came crashing down on the fields and roofs below he thought of such a possible catastrophe with a singular indifference in fact with a feeling almost like pleasure it would be such a swift and thorough solution of this great problem of life he was working out in everrecurring daily anguish the remote possibility of such a catastrophe had frightened some timid dwellers beneath the mountain to other places of residence here the danger was most imminent and yet he loved to dwell upon the chances of its occurrence danger is often the best counterirritant in cases of mental suffering he found a solace in careless exposure of his life and learned to endure the trials of each day better by dwelling in imagination on the possibility that it might be the last for him and the home that was his time the great consoler helped these influences and he gradually fell into more easy and less dangerous habits of life he ceased from his more perilous rambles he thought less of the danger from the great overhanging rocks and forests they had hung there for centuries it was not very likely they would crash or slide in his time he became accustomed to all elsies strange looks and ways old sophy dressed her with ruffles round her neck and hunted up the red coral branch with silver bells which the little toothless dudleys had bitten upon for a hundred years by an infinite effort her father forced himself to become the companion of this child for whom he had such a mingled feeling but whose presence was always a trial to him and often a terror at a cost which no human being could estimate he had done his duty and in some degree reaped his reward elsie grew up with a kind of filial feeling for him such as her nature was capable of she never would obey him that was not to be looked for commands threats punishments were out of the question with her the mere physical effects of crossing her will betrayed themselves in such changes of expression and manner that it would have been senseless to attempt to govern her in any such way leaving her mainly to herself she could be to some extent indirectly influenced not otherwise she called her father dudley as if he had been her brother she ordered everybody and would be ordered by none who could know all these things except the few people of the household what wonder therefore that ignorant and shallow persons laid the blame on her father of those peculiarities which were freely talked about of those darker tendencies which were hinted of in whispers to all this talk so far as it reached him he was supremely indifferent not only with the indifference which all gentlemen feel to the gossip of their inferiors but with a charitable calmness which did not wonder or blame he knew that his position was not simply a difficult but an impossible one and schooled himself to bear his destiny as well as he might and report himself only at headquarters he had grown gentle under this discipline his hair was just beginning to be touched with silver and his expression was that of habitual sadness and anxiety he had no counsellor as we have seen to turn to who did not know either too much or too little he had no heart to rest upon and into which he might unburden himself of the secrets and the sorrows that were aching in his own breast yet he had not allowed himself to run to waste in the long time since he was left alone to his trials and fears he had resisted the seductions which always beset solitary men with restless brains overwrought by depressing agencies he disguised no misery to himself with the lying delusion of wine he sought no sleep from narcotics though he lay with throbbing wideopen eyes through all the weary hours of the night it was understood between dudley veneer and old doctor kittredge that elsie was a subject of occasional medical observation on account of certain mental peculiarities which might end in a permanent affection of her reason beyond this nothing was said whatever may have been in the mind of either but dudley veneer had studied elsies case in the light of all the books he could find which might do anything towards explaining it as in all cases where men meddle with medical science for a special purpose having no previous acquaintance with it his imagination found what it wanted in the books he read and adjusted it to the facts before him so it was he came to cherish those two fancies before alluded to that the ominous birthmark she had carried from infancy might fade and become obliterated and that the age of complete maturity might be signalized by an entire change in her physical and mental state he held these vague hopes as all of us nurse our only halfbelieved illusions not for the world would he have questioned his sagacious old medical friend as to the probability or possibility of their being true we are very shy of asking questions of those who know enough to destroy with one word the hopes we live on in this life of comparative seclusion to which the father had doomed himself for the sake of his child he had found time for large and varied reading the learned judge thornton confessed himself surprised at the extent of dudley veneers information doctor kittredge found that he was in advance of him in the knowledge of recent physiological discoveries he had taken pains to become acquainted with agricultural chemistry and the neighboring farmers owed him some useful hints about the management of their land he renewed his old acquaintance with the classic authors he loved to warm his pulses with homer and calm them down with horace he received all manner of new books and periodicals and gradually gained an interest in the events of the passing time yet he remained almost a hermit not absolutely refusing to see his neighbors nor even churlish towards them but on the other hand not cultivating any intimate relations with them he had retired from the world a young man little more than a youth indeed with sentiments and aspirations all of them suddenly extinguished the first had bequeathed him a single huge sorrow the second a single trying duty in due time the anguish had lost something of its poignancy the light of earlier and happier memories had begun to struggle with and to soften its thick darkness and even that duty which he had confronted with such an effort had become an endurable habit at a period of life when many have been living on the capital of their acquired knowledge and their youthful stock of sensibilities until their intellects are really shallower and their hearts emptier than they were at twenty dudley veneer was stronger in thought and tenderer in soul than in the first freshness of his youth when he counted but half his present years he had entered that period which marks the decline of men who have ceased growing in knowledge and strength from forty to fifty a man must move upward or the natural falling off in the vigor of life will carry him rapidly downward at this time his inward nature was richer and deeper than in any earlier period of his life if he could only be summoned to action he was capable of noble service if his sympathies could only find an outlet he was never so capable of love as now for his natural affections had been gathering in the course of all these years and the traces of that ineffaceable calamity of his life were softened and partially hidden by new growths of thought and feeling as the wreck left by a mountainslide is covered over by the gentle intrusion of the softstemmed herbs which will prepare it for the stronger vegetation that will bring it once more into harmony with the peaceful slopes around it perhaps dudley veneer had not gained so much in worldly wisdom as if he had been more in society and less in his study the indulgence with which he treated his nephew was no doubt imprudent a man more in the habit of dealing with men would have been more guarded with a person with dicks questionable story and unquestionable physiognomy but he was singularly unsuspicious and his natural kindness was an additional motive to the wish for introducing some variety into the routine of elsies life if dudley veneer did not know just what he wanted at this period of his life there were a great many people in the town of rockland who thought they did know he had been a widower long enough nigh twenty year want it hed been aout to spraowless party there want anything to hender him why he shouldnt stir raound lk other folks what was the reason he did nt go abaout to taownmeetins n sahbathmeetins n lyceums n school xaminations n spriseparties n funerals and other entertainments where the stillfaced twostory folks were in the habit of looking round to see if any of the mansionhouse gentry were present fac was he was livin too lonesome daown there at the mansionhaouse why shouldnt he make up to the jedges daughter she was genteel enough for him and lets see haow old was she sevennitwenty no sixntwenty born the same year we buried our little anny marl there was no possible objection to this arrangement if the parties interested had seen fit to make it or even to think of it but portia as some of the mansionhouse people called her did not happen to awaken the elective affinities of the lonely widower he met her once in a while and said to himself that she was a good specimen of the grand style of woman and then the image came back to him of a woman not quite so large not quite so imperial in her port not quite so incisive in her speech not quite so judicial in her opinions but with two or three more joints in her frame and two or three soft inflections in her voice which for some absurd reason or other drew him to her side and so bewitched him that he told her half his secrets and looked into her eyes all that he could not tell in less time than it would have takes him to discuss the champion paper of the last quarterly with the admirable portia heu quanto minus how much more was that lost image to him than all it left on earth the study of love is very much like that of meteorology we know that just about so much rain will fall in a season but on what particular day it will shower is more than we can tell we know that just about so much love will be made every year in a given population but who will rain his young affections upon the heart of whom is not known except to the astrologers and fortunetellers and why rain falls as it does and why love is made just as it is are equally puzzling questions the woman a man loves is always his own daughter far more his daughter than the female children born to him by the common law of life it is not the outside woman who takes his name that he loves before her image has reached the centre of his consciousness it has passed through fifty manylayered nervestrainers been churned over by ten thousand pulsebeats and reacted upon by millions of lateral impulses which bandy it about through the mental spaces as a reflection is sent back and forward in a saloon lined with mirrors with this altered image of the woman before him his preexisting ideal becomes blended the object of his love is in part the offspring of her legal parents but more of her lovers brain the difference between the real and the ideal objects of love must not exceed a fixed maximum the hearts vision cannot unite them stereoscopically into a single image if the divergence passes certain limits a formidable analogy much in the nature of a proof with very serious consequences which moralists and matchmakers would do well to remember double vision with the eyes of the heart is a dangerous physiological state and may lead to missteps and serious falls whether dudley veneer would ever find a breathing image near enough to his ideal one to fill the desolate chamber of his heart or not was very doubtful some gracious and gentle woman whose influence would steal upon him as the first low words of prayer after that interval of silent mental supplication known to one of our simpler forms of public worship gliding into his consciousness without hurting its old griefs herself knowing the chastening of sorrow and subdued into sweet acquiescence with the divine will some such woman as this if heaven should send him such might call him back to the world of happiness from which he seemed forever exiled he could never again be the young lover who walked through the gardenalleys all red with roses in the old dead and buried june of long ago he could never forget the bride of his youth whose image growing phantomlike with the lapse of years hovered over him like a dream while waking and like a reality in dreams but if it might be in gods good providence that this desolate life should come under the influence of human affections once more what an ecstasy of renewed existence was in store for him his life had not all been buried under that narrow ridge of turf with the white stone at its head it seemed so for a while but it was not and could not and ought not to be so his first passion had been a true and pure one there was no spot or stain upon it with all his grief there blended no cruel recollection of any word or look he would have wished to forget all those little differences such as young married people with any individual flavor in their characters must have if they are tolerably mated had only added to the music of existence as the lesser discords admitted into some perfect symphony fitly resolved add richness and strength to the whole harmonious movement it was a deep wound that fate had inflicted on him nay it seemed like a mortal one but the weapon was clean and its edge was smooth such wounds must heal with time in healthy natures whatever a false sentiment may say by the wise and beneficent law of our being the recollection of a deep and true affection is rather a divine nourishment for a life to grow strong upon than a poison to destroy it dudley venners habitual sadness could not be laid wholly to his early bereavement it was partly the result of the long struggle between natural affection and duty on one side and the involuntary tendencies these had to overcome on the other between hope and fear so long in conflict that despair itself would have been like an anodyne and he would have slept upon some final catastrophe with the heavy sleep of a bankrupt after his failure is proclaimed alas some new affection might perhaps rekindle the fires of youth in his heart but what power could calm that haggard terror of the parent which rose with every mornings sun and watched with every evening star what power save alone that of him who comes bearing the inverted torch and leaving after him only the ashes printed with his footsteps chapter xxi the widow rowens gives a teaparty there was a good deal of interest felt as has been said in the lonely condition of dudley venner in that fine mansionhouse of his and with that strange daughter who would never be married as many people thought in spite of all the stories the feelings expressed by the good folks who dated from the time when they buried aour little anny mari and others of that homespun stripe were founded in reason after all and so it was natural enough that they should be shared by various ladies who having conjugated the verb to live as far as the preterpluperfect tense were ready to change one of its vowels and begin with it in the present indicative unfortunately there was very little chance of showing sympathy in its active form for a gentleman who kept himself so much out of the way as the master of the dudley mansion various attempts had been made from time to time of late years to get him out of his study which had for the most part proved failures it was a surprise therefore when he was seen at the great party at the colonels but it was an encouragement to try him again and the consequence had been that he had received a number of notes inviting him to various smaller entertainments which as neither he nor elsie had any fancy for them he had politely declined such was the state of things when he received an invitation to take tea sociably with a few friends at hyacinth cottage the residence of the widow rowens relict of the late beeri rowens esquire better known as major rowens major rowens was at the time of his decease a promising officer in the militia in the direct line of promotion as his waistband was getting tighter every year and as all the world knows the militiaofficer who splits off most buttons and fills the largest swordbelt stands the best chance of rising or perhaps we might say spreading to be general major rowens united in his person certain other traits which help a man to eminence in the branch of public service referred to he ran to high colors to wide whiskers to open pores he had the saddleleather skin common in englishmen rarer in americans never found in the brahmin caste oftener in the military and the commodores observing people know what is meant blow the seedarrows from the whitekidlooking button which holds them on a dandelionstalk and the prickedpincushion surface shows you what to look for he had the loud gruff voice which implies the right to command he had the thick hand stubbed fingers with bristled pads between their joints square broad thumbnails and sturdy limbs which mark a constitution made to use in rough outdoor work he had the neverfailing predilection for showy switchtailed horses that step high and sidle about and act as if they were going to do something fearful the next minute in the face of awed and admiring multitudes gathered at mighty musters or imposing cattleshows he had no objection either to holding the reins in a wagon behind another kind of horse a slouching listless beast with a strong slant to his shoulder and a notable depth to his quarter and an emphatic angle at the hock who commonly walked or lounged along in a lazy trot of five or six miles an hour but if a lively colt happened to come rattling up alongside or a brandyfaced old horsejockey took the road to show off a fast nag and threw his dust into the majors face would pick his legs up all at once and straighten his body out and swing off into a threeminute gait in a way that old blue himself need not have been ashamed of for some reason which must be left to the next generation of professors to find out the men who are knowing in horseflesh have an eye also for let a long dash separate the brute creation from the angelic being now to be named for lovely woman of this fact there can be no possible doubt and therefore you shall notice that if a fast horse trots before two one of the twain is apt to be a pretty bit of muliebrity with shapes to her and eyes flying about in all directions major rowens at that time lieutenant of the rockland fusileers had driven and traded horses not a few before he turned his acquired skill as a judge of physical advantages in another direction he knew a neat snug hoof a delicate pastern a broad haunch a deep chest a close ribbedup barrel as well as any other man in the town he was not to be taken in by your thickjointed heavyheaded cattle without any go to them that suit a countryparson nor yet by the gaantedup longlegged animals with all their constitutions bred out of them such as rich greenhorns buy and cover up with their plated trappings whether his equine experience was of any use to him in the selection of the mate with whom he was to go in double harness so long as they both should live we need not stop to question at any rate nobody could find fault with the points of miss marilla van deusen to whom he offered the privilege of becoming mrs rowens the van must have been crossed out of her blood for she was an outandout brunette with hair and eyes black enough for a mohawks daughter a fine style of woman with very striking tints and outlines an excellent match for the lieutenant except for one thing she was marked by nature for a widow she was evidently got up for mourning and never looked so well as in deep black with jet ornaments the man who should dare to marry her would doom himself for how could she become the widow she was bound to be unless he could retire and give her a chance the lieutenant lived however as we have seen to become captain and then major with prospects of further advancement but mrs rowens often said she should never look well in colors at last her destiny fulfilled itself and the justice of nature was vindicated major rowens got overheated galloping about the field on the day of the great muster and had a rush of blood to the head according to the common report at any rate something which stopped him short in his career of expansion and promotion and established mrs rowens in her normal condition of widowhood the widow rowens was now in the full bloom of ornamental sorrow a very shallow crape bonnet frilled and frothlike allowed the parted raven hair to show its glossy smoothness a jet pin heaved upon her bosom with every sigh of memory or emotion of unknown origin jet bracelets shone with every movement of her slender hands cased in closefitting black gloves her sable dress was ridged with manifold flounces from beneath which a small foot showed itself from time to time clad in the same hue of mourning everything about her was dark except the whites of her eyes and the enamel of her teeth the effect was complete grays elegy was not a more perfect composition much as the widow was pleased with the costume belonging to her condition she did not disguise from herself that under certain circumstances she might be willing to change her name again thus for instance if a gentleman not too far gone in maturity of dignified exterior with an ample fortune and of unexceptionable character should happen to set his heart upon her and the only way to make him happy was to give up her weeds and go into those unbecoming colors again for his sake why she felt that it was in her nature to make the sacrifice by a singular coincidence it happened that a gentleman was now living in rockland who united in himself all these advantages who he was the sagacious reader may very probably have divined just to see how it looked one day having bolted her door and drawn the curtains close and glanced under the sofa and listened at the keyhole to be sure there was nobody in the entry just to see how it looked she had taken out an envelope and written on the back of it mrs manilla veneer it made her head swim and her knees tremble what if she should faint or die or have a stroke of palsy and they should break into the room and find that name written how she caught it up and tore it into little shreds and then could not be easy until she had burned the small heap of pieces but these are things which every honorable reader will consider imparted in strict confidence the widow rowens though not of the mansion house set was among the most genteel of the twostory circle and was in the habit of visiting some of the great people in one of these visits she met a dashing young fellow with an olive complexion at the house of a professional gentleman who had married one of the white necks and pairs of fat arms from a distinguished family before referred to the professional gentleman himself was out but the lady introduced the olivecomplexioned young man as mr richard venner the widow was particularly pleased with this accidental meeting had heard mr venners name frequently mentioned hoped his uncle was well and his charming cousin was she as original as ever had often admired that charming creature he rode we had had some fine horses had never got over her taste for riding but could find nobody that liked a good long gallop since well she could nt help wishing she was alongside of him the other day when she saw him dashing by just at twilight the widow paused lifted a flimsy handkerchief with a very deep black border so as to play the jet bracelet pushed the tip of her slender foot beyond the lowest of her black flounces looked up looked down looked at mr richard the very picture of artless simplicity as represented in wellplayed genteel comedy a good bit of stuff dick said to himself and something of it left yet caramba the major had not studied points for nothing and the widow was one of the right sort the young man had been a little restless of late and was willing to vary his routine by picking up an acquaintance here and there so he took the widows hint he should like to have a scamper of half a dozen miles with her some fine morning the widow was infinitely obliged was not sure that she could find any horse in the village to suit her but it was so kind in him would he not call at hyacinth cottage and let her thank him again there thus began an acquaintance which the widow made the most of and on the strength of which she determined to give a teaparty and invite a number of persons of whom we know something already she took a halfsheet of notepaper and made out her list as carefully as a country merchants clerk adds up two and threepence newengland nomenclature and twelve and a half cents figure by figure and fraction by fraction before he can be sure they will make half a dollar without cheating somebody after much consideration the list reduced itself to the following names mr richard venner and mrs blanche creamer the lady at whose house she had met him mansionhouse breed but will come soft on dick dudley venner take care of him herself elsie dick will see to her wont it fidget the creamer woman to see him round her the old doctor he s always handy and theres that young master there up at the school know him well enough to ask him oh yes hell come one two three four five six seven not room enough without the leaf in the table one place empty if the leafs in lets see helen darley she ll do well enough to fill it up why yes just the thing light brown hair blue eyes wont my pattern show off well against her put her down she s worth her tea and toast ten times over nobody knows what a thunderandlightning woman as poor major used to have it is till she gets alongside of one of those oldmaidish girls with hair the color of brown sugar and eyes like the blue of a teacup the widow smiled with a feeling of triumph at having overcome her difficulties and arranged her party arose and stood before her glass threequarters front onequarter profile so as to show the whites of the eyes and the down of the upper lip splendid said the widow and to tell the truth she was not far out of the way and with helen darley as a foil anybody would know she must be foudroyant and pyramidal if these french adjectives may be naturalized for this one particular exigency so the widow sent out her notes the black grief which had filled her heart and had overflowed in surges of crape around her person had left a deposit half an inch wide at the margin of her notepaper her seal was a small youth with an inverted torch the same on which mrs blanche creamer made her spiteful remark that she expected to see that boy of the widows standing on his head yet meaning as dick supposed that she would get the torch rightside up as soon as she had a chance that was after dick had made the widows acquaintance and mrs creamer had got it into her foolish head that she would marry that young fellow if she could catch him how could he ever come to fancy such a quadroonlooking thing as that she should like to know it is easy enough to ask seven people to a party but whether they will come or not is an open question as it was in the case of the spirits of the vasty deep if the note issues from a threestory mansionhouse and goes to twostory acquaintances they will all be in an excellent state of health and have much pleasure in accepting this very polite invitation if the note is from the lady of a twostory family to threestory ones the former highly respectable person will very probably find that an endemic complaint is prevalent not represented in the weekly bills of mortality which occasions numerous regrets in the bosoms of eminently desirable parties that they cannot have the pleasure of andsoforthing in this case there was room for doubt mainly as to whether elsie would take a fancy to come or not if she should come her father would certainly be with her dick had promised and thought he could bring elsie of course the young schoolmaster will come and that poor tiredout looking helen if only to get out of sight of those horrid peckham wretches they dont get such invitations every day the others she felt sure of all but the old doctor he might have some horrid patient or other to visit tell him elsie venners going to be there he always likes to have an eye on her they say oh hed come fast enough without any more coaxing she wanted the doctor particularly it was odd but she was afraid of elsie she felt as if she should be safe enough if the old doctor were there to see to the girl and then she should have leisure to devote herself more freely to the young ladys father for whom all her sympathies were in a state of lively excitement it was a long time since the widow had seen so many persons round her table as she had now invited better have the plates set and see how they will fill it up with the leaf in a little too scattering with only eight plates set if she could find two more people now that would bring the chairs a little closer snug you know which makes the company sociable the widow thought over her acquaintances why how stupid there was her good minister the same who had married her and might might bury her for aught she anew and his granddaughter staying with him nice little girl pretty and not old enough to be dangerous for the widow had no notion of making a teaparty and asking people to it that would be like to stand between her and any little project she might happen to have on anybodys heart not she it was all right now blanche was married and so forth letty was a child elsie was his daughter helen darley was a nice worthy drudge poor thing faded faded colors wouldnt wash just what she wanted to show off against now if the dudley mansionhouse people would only come that was the great point heres a note for us elsie said her father as they sat round the breakfasttable mrs rowens wants us all to come to tea it was one of elsies days as old sophy called them the light in her eyes was still but very bright she looked up so full of perverse and wilful impulses that dick knew he could make her go with him and her father he had his own motives for bringing her to this determination and his own way of setting about it i dont want to go he said what do you say uncle to tell the truth richard i dont mach fancy the majors widow i dont like to see her weeds flowering out quite so strong i suppose you dont care about going elsie elsie looked up in her fathers face with an expression which he knew but too well she was just in the state which the plain sort of people call contrary when they have to deal with it in animals she would insist on going to that teaparty he knew it just as well before she spoke as after she had spoken if dick had said he wanted to go and her father had seconded his wishes she would have insisted on staying at home it was no great matter her father said to himself after all very likely it would amuse her the widow was a lively woman enough perhaps a little comme il ne faut pas socially compared with the thorntons and some other families but what did he care for these petty village distinctions elsie spoke i mean to go you must go with me dudley you may do as you like dick that settled the dudleymansion business of course they all three accepted as fortunately did all the others who had been invited hyacinth cottage was a pretty place enough a little too much choked round with bushes and too much overrun with climbingroses which in the season of slugs and rosebugs were apt to show so brown about the leaves and so coleopterous about the flowers that it might be questioned whether their buds and blossoms made up for these unpleasant animal combinations especially as the smell of whaleoil soap was very commonly in the ascendant over that of the roses it had its patch of grass called the lawn and its glazed closet known as the conservatory according to that system of harmless fictions characteristic of the rural imagination and shown in the names applied to many familiar objects the interior of the cottage was more tasteful and ambitious than that of the ordinary twostory dwellings in place of the prevailing haircloth covered furniture the visitor had the satisfaction of seating himself upon a chair covered with some of the widows embroidery or a sofa luxurious with soft caressing plush the sporting tastes of the late major showed in various prints on the wall herrings plenipotentiary the red bullock of the derby cadland and the colonel crucifix westaustralian fastest of modern racers and among native celebrities ugly game old boston with his straight neck and ragged hips and gray lady suffolk queen in her day not of the turf but of the track extending herself till she measured a rod more or less skimming along within a yard of the ground her legs opening and shutting under her with a snap like the four blades of a compound jackknife these pictures were much more refreshing than those dreary fancy deathbed scenes common in twostory countryhouses in which washington and other distinguished personages are represented as obligingly devoting their last moments to taking a prominent part in a tableau in which weeping relatives attached servants professional assistants and celebrated personages who might by a stretch of imagination be supposed present are grouped in the most approved style of arrangement about the chief actors pillow a single glazed bookcase held the family library which was hidden from vulgar eyes by green silk curtains behind the glass it would have been instructive to get a look at it as it always is to peep into ones neighbors bookshelves from other sources and opportunities a partial idea of it has been obtained the widow had inherited some books from her mother who was something of a reader youngs nightthoughts the preceptor the task a poem by william cowper herveys meditations alonzo and melissa buccaneers of america the triumphs of temper la belle assemblee thomsons seasons and a few others the major had brought in tom jones and peregrine pickle various works by mr pierce egan boxiana the racing calendar and a book of lively songs and jests the widow had added the poems of lord byron and t moore eugene aram the tower of london by harrison ainsworth some of scotts novels the pickwick papers a volume of plays by w shakespeare proverbial philosophy pilgrims progress the whole duty of man a present when she was married with two celebrated religious works one by william law and the other by philip doddridge which were sent her after her husbands death and which she had tried to read but found that they did not agree with her of course the bookcase held a few school manuals and compendiums and one of mr websters dictionaries but the giltedged bible always lay on the centretable next to the magazine with the fashionplates and the scrapbook with pictures from old annuals and illustrated papers the reader need not apprehend the recital at full length of such formidable preparations for the widows teaparty as were required in the case of colonel sprowles social entertainment a teaparty even in the country is a comparatively simple and economical piece of business as soon as the widow found that all her company were coming she set to work with the aid of her smart maidservant and a daughter of her own who was beginning to stretch and spread at a fearful rate but whom she treated as a small child to make the necessary preparations the silver had to be rubbed also the grand plated urn her mothers before hers style of the empire looking as if it might have been made to hold the majors ashes then came the making and baking of cake and gingerbread the smell whereof reached even as far as the sidewalk in front of the cottage so that small boys returning from school snuffed it in the breeze and discoursed with each other on its suggestions so that the widow leech who happened to pass remembered she had nt called on marilly raowens for a considble spell and turned in at the gate and rang three times with long intervals but all in vain the inside widow having spotted the outside one through the blinds and whispered to her aidesdecamp to let the old thing ring away till she pulled the bell out by the roots but not to stir to open the door widow rowens was what they called a real smart capable woman not very great on books perhaps but knew what was what and who was who as well as another knew how to make the little cottage look pretty how to set out a teatable and what a good many women never can find out knew her own style and got herself up tiptop as our young friend master geordie colonel sprowles heirapparent remarked to his friend from one of the freshwater colleges flowers were abundant now and she had dressed her rooms tastefully with them the centretable had two or three giltedged books lying carelessly about on it and some prints and a stereoscope with stereographs to match chiefly groups of picnics weddings etc in which the same somewhat fatigued looking ladies of fashion and brides received the attentions of the same unpleasantlooking young men easily identified under their different disguises consisting of fashionable raiment such as gentlemen are supposed to wear habitually with these however were some pretty english scenes pretty except for the old fellow with the hanging underlip who infests every one of that interesting series and a statue or two especially that famous one commonly called the lahcoon so as to rhyme with moon and spoon and representing an old man with his two sons in the embraces of two monstrous serpents there is no denying that it was a very dashing achievement of the widows to bring together so considerable a number of desirable guests she felt proud of her feat but as to the triumph of getting dudley venner to come out for a visit to hyacinth cottage she was surprised and almost frightened at her own success so much might depend on the impressions of that evening the next thing was to be sure that everybody should be in the right place at the teatable and this the widow thought she could manage by a few words to the older guests and a little shuffling about and shifting when they got to the table to settle everything the widow made out a diagram which the reader should have a chance of inspecting in an authentic copy if these pages were allowed under any circumstances to be the vehicle of illustrations if however he or she really wishes to see the way the pieces stood as they were placed at the beginning of the game the widows gambit he or she had better at once take a sheet of paper draw an oval and arrange the characters according to the following schedule at the head of the table the hostess widow marilla rowens opposite her at the other end rev dr honeywood at the right of the hostess dudley veneer next him helen darley next her dr kittredge next him mrs blanche creamer then the reverend doctor at the left of the hostess bernard langdon next him letty forrester next letty mr richard veneer next him elsie and so to the reverend doctor again the company came together a little before the early hour at which it was customary to take tea in rockland the widow knew everybody of course who was there in rockland she did not know but some of them had to be introduced mr richard veneer to mr bernard mr bernard to miss letty dudley veneer to miss helen darley and so on the two young men looked each other straight in the eyes both full of youthful life but one of frank and fearless aspect the other with a dangerous feline beauty alien to the new england half of his blood the guests talked turned over the prints looked at the flowers opened the proverbial philosophy with gilt edges and the volume of plays by w shakespeare examined the horsepictures on the walls and so passed away the time until tea was announced when they paired off for the room where it was in readiness the widow had managed it well everything was just as she wanted it dudley veneer was between herself and the poor tiredlooking schoolmistress with her faded colors blanche creamer a lax tumbletopieces greuzeish looking blonde whom the widow hated because the men took to her was purgatoried between the two old doctors and could see all the looks that passed between dick venner and his cousin the young schoolmaster could talk to miss letty it was his business to know how to talk to schoolgirls dick would amuse himself with his cousin elsie the old doctors only wanted to be well fed and they would do well enough it would be very pleasant to describe the teatable but in reality it did not pretend to offer a plethoric banquet to the guests the widow had not visited the mansionhouses for nothing and she had learned there that an overloaded teatable may do well enough for farmhands when they come in at evening from their work and sit down unwashed in their shirtsleeves but that for decently bred people such an insult to the memory of a dinner not yet halfassimilated is wholly inadmissible everything was delicate and almost everything of fair complexion white bread and biscuits frosted and sponge cake cream honey strawcolored butter only a shadow here and there where the fire had crisped and browned the surfaces of a stack of dry toast or where a preserve had brought away some of the red sunshine of the last years summer the widow shall have the credit of her wellordered teatable also of her bountiful creampitchers for it is well known that citypeople find cream a very scarce luxury in a good many countryhouses of more pretensions than hyacinth cottage there are no better maims for ladies who give teaparties than these cream is thicker than water large heart never loved little cream pot there is a common feeling in genteel families that the third meal of the day is not so essential a part of the daily bread as to require any especial acknowledgment to the providence which bestows it very devout people who would never sit down to a breakfast or a dinner without the grace before meat which honors the giver of it feel as if they thanked heaven enough for their tea and toast by partaking of them cheerfully without audible petition or ascription but the widow was not exactly mansionhousebred and so thought it necessary to give the reverend doctor a peculiar look which he understood at once as inviting his professional services he therefore uttered a few simple words of gratitude very quietly much to the satisfaction of some of the guests who had expected one of those elaborate effusions with rolling up of the eyes and rhetorical accents so frequent with eloquent divines when they address their maker in genteel company everybody began talking with the person sitting next at hand mr bernard naturally enough turned his attention first to the widow but somehow or other the right side of the widow seemed to be more wide awake than the left side next him and he resigned her to the courtesies of mr dudley venner directing himself not very unwillingly to the young girl next him on the other side miss letty forrester the granddaughter of the reverend doctor was citybred as anybody might see and citydressed as any woman would know at sight a man might only feel the general effect of clear wellmatched colors of harmonious proportions of the cut which makes everything cling like a bathers sleeve where a natural outline is to be kept and ruffle itself up like the hackle of a pitted fightingcock where art has a right to luxuriate in silken exuberance how this citybred and citydressed girl came to be in rockland mr bernard did not know but he knew at any rate that she was his next neighbor and entitled to his courtesies she was handsome too when he came to look very handsome when he came to look again endowed with that city beauty which is like the beauty of wallfruit something finer in certain respects than can be reared off the pavement the miserable routinists who keep repeating invidiously cowpers god made the country and man made the town as if the town were a place to kill out the race in do not know what they are talking about where could they raise such saintmichael pears such saintgermains such brownbeurres as we had until within a few years growing within the walls of our old citygardens is the dark and damp cavern where a ragged beggar hides himself better than a townmansion which fronts the sunshine and backs on its own cool shadow with gas and water and all appliances to suit all needs god made the cavern and man made the house what then there is no doubt that the pavement keeps a deal of mischief from coming up out of the earth and with a dash off of it in summer just to cool the soles of the feet when it gets too hot is the best place for many constitutions as some few practical people have already discovered and just so these beauties that grow and ripen against the citywalls these young fellows with cheeks like peaches and young girls with cheeks like nectarines show that the most perfect forms of artificial life can do as much for the human product as gardenculture for strawberries and blackberries if mr bernard had philosophized or prosed in this way with so pretty nay so lovely a neighbor as miss letty forrester waiting for him to speak to her he would have to be dropped from this narrative as a person unworthy of his goodfortune and not deserving the kind readers further notice on the contrary he no sooner set his eyes fairly on her than he said to himself that she was charming and that he wished she were one of his scholars at the institute so he began talking with her in an easy way for he knew something of young girls by this time and of course could adapt himself to a young lady who looked as if she might be not more than fifteen or sixteen years old and therefore could hardly be a match in intellectual resources for the seventeen and eighteen yearold firstclass scholars of the apollinean institute but citywallfruit ripens early and he soon found that this girls training had so sharpened her wits and stored her memory that he need not be at the trouble to stoop painfully in order to come down to her level the beauty of goodbreeding is that it adjusts itself to all relations without effort true to itself always however the manners of those around it may change selfrespect and respect for others the sensitive consciousness poises itself in these as the compass in the ships binnacle balances itself and maintains its true level within the two concentric rings which suspend it on their pivots this thoroughbred schoolgirl quite enchanted mr bernard he could not understand where she got her style her way of dress her enunciation her easy manners the minister was a most worthy gentleman but this was not the rockland nativeborn manner some new element had come in between the good plain worthy man and this young girl fit to be a crown princes partner where there were a thousand to choose from he looked across to helen darley for he knew she would understand the glance of admiration with which he called her attention to the young beauty at his side and helen knew what a young girl could be as compared with what too many a one is as well as anybody this poor dear helen of ours how admirable the contrast between her and the widow on the other side of dudley venner but what was very odd that gentleman apparently thought the contrast was to the advantage of this poor dear helen at any rate instead of devoting himself solely to the widow he happened to be just at that moment talking in a very interested and apparently not uninteresting way to his righthand neighbor who on her part never looked more charmingly as mr bernard could not help saying to himself but to be sure he had just been looking at the young girl next him so that his eyes were brimful of beauty and may have spilled some of it on the first comer for you know m becquerel has been showing us lately how everything is phosphorescent that it soaks itself with light in an instants exposure so that it is wet with liquid sunbeams or if you will tremulous with luminous vibrations when first plunged into the negative bath of darkness and betrays itself by the light which escapes from its surface whatever were the reason this poor dear helen never looked so sweetly her plainly parted brown hair her meek blue eyes her cheek just a little tinged with color the almost sad simplicity of her dress and that look he knew so well so full of cheerful patience so sincere that he had trusted her from the first moment as the believers of the larger half of christendom trust the blessed virgin mr bernard took this all in at a glance and felt as pleased as if it had been his own sister dorothea elizabeth that he was looking at as for dudley veneer mr bernard could not help being struck by the animated expression of his countenance it certainly showed great kindness on his part to pay so much attention to this quiet girl when he had the thunderandlightning widow on the other side of him mrs marilla rowens did not know what to make of it she had made her teaparty expressly for mr dudley veneer she had placed him just as she wanted between herself and a meek delicate woman who dressed in gray wore a plain breastpin with hair in it who taught a pack of girls up there at the school and looked as if she were born for a teacher the very best foil that she could have chosen and here was this man polite enough to herself to be sure but turning round to that very undistinguished young person as if he rather preferred her conversation of the two the truth was that dudley veneer and helen darley met as two travellers might meet in the desert wearied both of them with their long journey one having food but no water the other water but no food each saw that the other had been in long conflict with some trial for their voices were low and tender as patiently borne sorrow and humbly uttered prayers make every human voice through these tones more than by what they said they came into natural sympathetic relations with each other nothing could be more unstudied as for dudley venner no beauty in all the world could have so soothed and magnetized him as the very repose and subdued gentleness which the widow had thought would make the best possible background for her own more salient and effective attractions no doubt helen on her side was almost too readily pleased with the confidence this new acquaintance she was making seemed to show her from the very first she knew so few men of any condition mr silas peckham he was her employer and she ought to think of him as well as she could but every time she thought of him it was with a shiver of disgust mr bernard langdon a noble young man a true friend like a brother to her god bless him and send him some young heart as fresh as his own but this gentleman produced a new impression upon her quite different from any to which she was accustomed his rich low tones had the strangest significance to her she felt sure he must have lived through long experiences sorrowful like her own elsies father she looked into his dark eyes as she listened to him to see if they had any glimmer of that peculiar light diamondbright but cold and still which she knew so well in elsies anything but that never was there more tenderness it seemed to her than in the whole look and expression of elsies father she must have been a great trial to him yet his face was that of one who had been saddened not soured by his discipline knowing what elsie must be to him how hard she must make any parents life helen could not but be struck with the interest mr dudley venner showed in her as his daughters instructress he was too kind to her again and again she meekly turned from him so as to leave him free to talk to the showy lady at his other side who was looking all the while like the night of cloudless realms and starry skies but still mr dudley venner after a few courteous words came back to the blue eyes and brown hair still he kept his look fixed upon her and his tones grew sweeter and lower as he became more interested in talk until this poor dear helen what with surprise and the bashfulness natural to one who had seen little of the gay world and the stirring of deep confused sympathies with this suffering father whose heart seemed so full of kindness felt her cheeks glowing with unwonted flame and betrayed the pleasing trouble of her situation by looking so sweetly as to arrest mr bernards eye for a moment when he looked away from the young beauty sitting next him elsie meantime had been silent with that singular still watchful look which those who knew her well had learned to fear her head just a little inclined on one side perfectly motionless for whole minutes her eyes seeming to grow small and bright as always when she was under her evil influence she was looking obliquely at the young girl on the other side of her cousin dick and next to bernard langdon as for dick himself she seemed to be paying very little attention to him sometimes her eyes would wander off to mr bernard and their expression as old dr kittredge who watched her for a while pretty keenly noticed would change perceptibly one would have said that she looked with a kind of dull hatred at the girl but with a halfrelenting reproachful anger at mr bernard miss letty forrester at whom elsie had been looking from time to time in this fixed way was conscious meanwhile of some unusual influence first it was a feeling of constraint then as it were a diminished power over the muscles as if an invisible elastic cobweb were spinning round her then a tendency to turn away from mr bernard who was making himself very agreeable and look straight into those eyes which would not leave her and which seemed to be drawing her towards them while at the same time they chilled the blood in all her veins mr bernard saw this influence coming over her all at once he noticed that she sighed and that some little points of moisture began to glisten on her forehead but she did not grow pale perceptibly she had no involuntary or hysteric movements she still listened to him and smiled naturally enough perhaps she was only nervous at being stared at at any rate she was coming under some unpleasant influence or other and mr bernard had seen enough of the strange impression elsie sometimes produced to wish this young girl to be relieved from it whatever it was he turned toward elsie and looked at her in such a way as to draw her eyes upon him then he looked steadily and calmly into them it was a great effort for some perfectly inexplicable reason at one instant he thought he could not sit where he was he must go and speak to elsie then he wanted to take his eyes away from hers there was something intolerable in the light that came from them but he was determined to look her down and he believed he could do it for he had seen her countenance change more than once when he had caught her gaze steadily fixed on him all this took not minutes but seconds presently she changed color slightly lifted her head which was inclined a little to one side shut and opened her eyes two or three times as if they had been pained or wearied and turned away baffled and shamed as it would seem and shorn for the time of her singular and formidable or at least evilnatured power of swaying the impulses of those around her it takes too long to describe these scenes where a good deal of life is concentrated into a few silent seconds mr richard veneer had sat quietly through it all although this short pantomime had taken place literally before his face he saw what was going on well enough and understood it all perfectly well of course the schoolmaster had been trying to make elsie jealous and had succeeded the little schoolgirl was a decoyduck that was all estates like the dudley property were not to be had every day and no doubt the yankee usher was willing to take some pains to make sure of elsie does nt elsie look savage dick involuntarily moved his chair a little away from her and thought he felt a pricking in the small white scars on his wrist a daredevil fellow but somehow or other this girl had taken strange hold of his imagination and he often swore to himself that when he married her he would carry a loaded revolver with him to his bridal chamber mrs blanche creamer raged inwardly at first to find herself between the two old gentlemen of the party it very soon gave her great comfort however to see that marilla rowens had just missed it in her calculations and she chuckled immensely to find dudley veneer devoting himself chiefly to helen darley if the rowens woman should hook dudley she felt as if she should gnaw all her nails off for spite to think of seeing her barouching about rockland behind a pair of longtailed bays and a coachman with a band on his hat while she blanche creamer was driving herself about in a onehorse carriage recovering her spirits by degrees she began playing her surfaces off at the two old doctors just by way of practice first she heaved up a glaring white shoulder the right one so that the reverend doctor should be stunned by it if such a thing might be the reverend doctor was human as the apostle was not ashamed to confess himself halfdevoutly and halfmischievously he repeated inwardly resist the devil and he will flee from you as the reverend doctor did not show any lively susceptibility she thought she would try the left shoulder on old dr kittredge that worthy and experienced student of science was not at all displeased with the manoeuvre and lifted his head so as to command the exhibition through his glasses blanche is good for half a dozen years or so if she is careful the doctor said to himself and then she must take to her prayerbook after this spasmodic failure of mrs blanche creamers to stir up the old doctors she returned again to the pleasing task of watching the widow in her evident discomfiture but dark as the widow looked in her halfconcealed pet she was but as a pale shadow compared to elsie in her silent concentration of shame and anger well there is one good thing said mrs blanche creamer dick doesnt get much out of that cousin of his this evening does nt he look handsome though so mrs blanche being now a good deal taken up with her observations of those friends of hers and ours began to be rather careless of her two old doctors who naturally enough fell into conversation with each other across the white surfaces of that lady perhaps not very politely but under the circumstances almost as a matter of necessity when a minister and a doctor get talking together they always have a great deal to say and so it happened that the company left the table just as the two doctors were beginning to get at each others ideas about various interesting matters if we follow them into the other parlor we can perhaps pick up something of their conversation chapter xxii why doctors differ the company rearranged itself with some changes after leaving the teatable dudley veneer was very polite to the widow but that lady having been called off for a few moments for some domestic arrangement he slid back to the side of helen darley his daughters faithful teacher elsie had got away by herself and was taken up in studying the stereoscopic laocoon dick being thus set free had been seized upon by mrs blanche creamer who had diffused herself over threequarters of a sofa and beckoned him to the remaining fourth mr bernard and miss letty were having a snug feteafete in the recess of a baywindow the two doctors had taken two armchairs and sat squared off against each other their conversation is perhaps as well worth reporting as that of the rest of the company and as it was carried on in a louder tone was of course more easy to gather and put on record it was a curious sight enough to see those two representatives of two great professions brought face to face to talk over the subjects they had been looking at all their lives from such different points of view both were old old enough to have been moulded by their habits of thought and life old enough to have all their beliefs fretted in as vintners say thoroughly worked up with their characters each of them looked his calling the reverend doctor had lived a good deal among books in his study the doctor as we will call the medical gentleman had been riding about the country for between thirty and forty years his face looked tough and weatherworn while the reverend doctors hearty as it appeared was of finer texture the doctors was the graver of the two there was something of grimness about it partly owing to the northeasters he had faced for so many years partly to long companionship with that stern personage who never deals in sentiment or pleasantry his speech was apt to be brief and peremptory it was a way he had got by ordering patients but he could discourse somewhat on occasion as the reader may find out the reverend doctor had an open smiling expression a cheery voice a hearty laugh and a cordial way with him which some thought too lively for his cloth but which children who are good judges of such matters delighted in so that he was the favorite of all the little rogues about town but he had the clerical art of sobering down in a moment when asked to say grace while somebody was in the middle of some particularly funny story and though his voice was so cheery in common talk in the pulpit like almost all preachers he had a wholly different and peculiar way of speaking supposed to be more acceptable to the creator than the natural manner in point of fact most of our antipapal and antiprelatical clergymen do really intone their prayers without suspecting in the least that they have fallen into such a romish practice this is the way the conversation between the doctor of divinity and the doctor of medicine was going on at the point where these notes take it up obi tres medici duo athei you know doctor your profession has always had the credit of being lax in doctrine though pretty stringent in practice ha ha some priest said that the doctor answered dryly they always talked latin when they had a bigger lie than common to get rid of good said the reverend doctor im afraid they would lie a little sometimes but isnt there some truth in it doctor dont you think your profession is apt to see nature in the place of the god of nature to lose sight of the great first cause in their daily study of secondary causes ive thought about that the doctor answered and ive talked about it and read about it and ive come to the conclusion that nobody believes in god and trusts in god quite so much as the doctors only it is nt just the sort of deity that some of your profession have wanted them to take up with there was a student of mine wrote a dissertation on the natural theology of health and disease and took that old lying proverb for his motto he knew a good deal more about books than ever i did and had studied in other countries ill tell you what he said about it he said the old heathen doctor galen praised god for his handiwork in the human body just as if he had been a christian or the psalmist himself he said they had this sentence set up in large letters in the great lectureroom in paris where he attended i dressed his wound and god healed him that was an old surgeons saying and he gave a long list of doctors who were not only christians but famous ones i grant you though ministers and doctors are very apt to see differently in spiritual matters thats it said the reverend doctor you are apt to see nature where we see god and appeal to science where we are contented with revelation we dont separate god and nature perhaps as you do the doctor answered when we say that god is omnipresent and omnipotent and omniscient we are a little more apt to mean it than your folks are we think when a wound heals that gods presence and power and knowledge are there healing it just as that old surgeon did we think a good many theologians working among their books dont see the facts of the world they live in when we tell em of these facts they are apt to call us materialists and atheists and infidels and all that we cant help seeing the facts and we dont think its wicked to mention em do tell me the reverend doctor said some of these facts we are in the habit of overlooking and which your profession thinks it can see and understand thats very easy the doctor replied for instance you dont understand or dont allow for idiosyncrasies as we learn to we know that food and physic act differently with different people but you think the same kind of truth is going to suit or ought to suit all minds we dont fight with a patient because he cant take magnesia or opium but you are all the time quarrelling over your beliefs as if belief did not depend very much on race and constitution to say nothing of early training do you mean to say that every man is not absolutely free to choose his beliefs the men you write about in your studies are but not the men we see in the real world there is some apparently congenital defect in the indians for instance that keeps them from choosing civilization and christianity so with the gypsies very likely everybody knows that catholicism or protestantism is a good deal a matter of race constitution has more to do with belief than people think for i went to a universalist church when i was in the city one day to hear a famous man whom all the world knows and i never saw such pewsfull of broad shoulders and florid faces and substantial wholesomelooking persons male and female in all my life why it was astonishing either their creed made them healthy or they chose it because they were healthy your folks have never got the hang of human nature i am afraid this would be considered a degrading and dangerous view of human beliefs and responsibility for them the reverend doctor replied prove to a man that his will is governed by something outside of himself and you have lost all hold on his moral and religious nature there is nothing bad men want to believe so much as that they are governed by necessity now that which is at once degrading and dangerous cannot be true no doubt the doctor replied all large views of mankind limit our estimate of the absolute freedom of the will but i dont think it degrades or endangers us for this reason that while it makes us charitable to the rest of mankind our own sense of freedom whatever it is is never affected by argument conscience wont be reasoned with we feel that we can practically do this of that and if we choose the wrong we know we are responsible but observation teaches us that this or that other race or individual has not the same practical freedom of choice i dont see how we can avoid this conclusion in the instance of the american indians the science of ethnology has upset a good many theoretical notions about human nature science said the reverend doctor science that was a word the apostle paul did not seem to think much of if we may judge by the epistle to timothy oppositions of science falsely so called i own that i am jealous of that word and the pretensions that go with it science has seemed to me to be very often only the handmaid of skepticism doctor the physician said emphatically science is knowledge nothing that is not known properly belongs to science whenever knowledge obliges us to doubt we are always safe in doubting astronomers foretell eclipses say how long comets are to stay with us point out where a new planet is to be found we see they know what they assert and the poor old roman catholic church has at last to knock under so geology proves a certain succession of events and the best christian in the world must make the earths history square with it besides i dont think you remember what great revelations of himself the creator has made in the minds of the men who have built up science you seem to me to hold his human masterpieces very cheap dont you think the inspiration of the almighty gave newton and cuvier understanding the reverend doctor was not arguing for victory in fact what he wanted was to call out the opinions of the old physician by a show of opposition being already predisposed to agree with many of them he was rather trying the common arguments as one tries tricks of fence merely to learn the way of parrying but just here he saw a tempting opening and could not resist giving a homethrust yes but you surely would not consider it inspiration of the same kind as that of the writers of the old testament that cornered the doctor and he paused a moment before he replied then he raised his head so as to command the reverend doctors face through his spectacles and said i did not say that you are clear i suppose that the omniscient spoke through solomon but that shakespeare wrote without his help the reverend doctor looked very grave it was a bold blunt way of putting the question he turned it aside with the remark that shakespeare seemed to him at times to come as near inspiration as any human being not included among the sacred writers doctor the physician began as from a sudden suggestion you wont quarrel with me if i tell you some of my real thoughts will you say on my dear sir say on the minister answered with his most genial smile your real thoughts are just what i want to get at a mans real thoughts are a great rarity if i dont agree with you i shall like to hear you the doctor began and in order to give his thoughts more connectedly we will omit the conversational breaks the questions and comments of the clergyman and all accidental interruptions when the old ecclesiastics said that where there were three doctors there were two atheists they lied of course they called everybody who differed from them atheists until they found out that not believing in god was nt nearly so ugly a crime as not believing in some particular dogma then they called them heretics until so many good people had been burned under that name that it began to smell too strong of roasting flesh and after that infidels which properly means people without faith of whom there are not a great many in any place or time but then of course there was some reason why doctors shouldnt think about religion exactly as ministers did or they never would have made that proverb it s very likely that something of the same kind is true now whether it is so or not i am going to tell you the reasons why it would not be strange if doctors should take rather different views from clergymen about some matters of belief i dont of course mean all doctors nor all clergymen some doctors go as far as any old new england divine and some clergymen agree very well with the doctors that think least according to rule to begin with their ideas of the creator himself they always see him trying to help his creatures out of their troubles a man no sooner gets a cut than the great physician whose agency we often call nature goes to work first to stop the blood and then to heal the wound and then to make the scar as small as possible if a mans pain exceeds a certain amount he faints and so gets relief if it lasts too long habit comes in to make it tolerable if it is altogether too bad he dies that is the best thing to be done under the circumstances so you see the doctor is constantly in presence of a benevolent agency working against a settled order of things of which pain and disease are the accidents so to speak well no doubt they find it harder than clergymen to believe that there can be any world or state from which this benevolent agency is wholly excluded this may be very wrong but it is not unnatural they can hardly conceive of a permanent state of being in which cuts would never try to heal nor habit render suffering endurable this is one effect of their training then again their attention is very much called to human limitations ministers work out the machinery of responsibility in an abstract kind of way they have a sort of algebra of human nature in which friction and strength or weakness of material are left out you see a doctor is in the way of studying children from the moment of birth upwards for the first year or so he sees that they are just as much pupils of their maker as the young of any other animals well their maker trains them to pure selfishness why in order that they may be sure to take care of themselves so you see when a child comes to be we will say a year and a day old and makes his first choice between right and wrong he is at a disadvantage for he has that vis a tergo as we doctors call it that force from behind of a whole years life of selfishness for which he is no more to blame than a calf is to blame for having lived in the same way purely to gratify his natural appetites then we see that baby grow up to a child and if he is fat and stout and red and lively we expect to find him troublesome and noisy and perhaps sometimes disobedient more or less thats the way each new generation breaks its eggshell but if he is very weak and thin and is one of the kind that may be expected to die early he will very likely sit in the house all day and read good books about other little sharpfaced children just like himself who died early having always been perfectly indifferent to all the outdoor amusements of the wicked little redcheeked children some of the little folks we watch grow up to be young women and occasionally one of them gets nervous what we call hysterical and then that girl will begin to play all sorts of pranks to lie and cheat perhaps in the most unaccountable way so that she might seem to a minister a good example of total depravity we dont see her in that light we give her iron and valerian and get her on horseback if we can and so expect to make her will come all right again by and by we are called in to see an old baby threescore years and ten or more old we find this old baby has never got rid of that first years teaching which led him to fill his stomach with all he could pump into it and his hands with everything he could grab people call him a miser we are sorry for him but we cant help remembering his first years training and the natural effect of money on the great majority of those that have it so while the ministers say he shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven we like to remind them that with god all things are possible once more we see all kinds of monomania and insanity we learn from them to recognize all sorts of queer tendencies in minds supposed to be sane so that we have nothing but compassion for a large class of persons condemned as sinners by theologians but considered by us as invalids we have constant reasons for noticing the transmission of qualities from parents to offspring and we find it hard to hold a child accountable in any moral point of view for inherited bad temper or tendency to drunkenness as hard as we should to blame him for inheriting gout or asthma i suppose we are more lenient with human nature than theologians generally are we know that the spirits of men and their views of the present and the future go up and down with the barometer and that a permanent depression of one inch in the mercurial column would affect the whole theology of christendom ministers talk about the human will as if it stood on a high lookout with plenty of light and elbowroom reaching to the horizon doctors are constantly noticing how it is tied up and darkened by inferior organization by disease and all sorts of crowding interferences until they get to look upon hottentots and indians and a good many of their own race as a kind of selfconscious bloodclocks with very limited power of selfdetermination thats the tendency i say of a doctors experience but the people to whom they address their statements of the results of their observation belong to the thinking class of the highest races and they are conscious of a great deal of liberty of will so in the face of the fact that civilization with all it offers has proved a dead failure with the aboriginal races of this country on the whole i say a dead failure they talk as if they knew from their own will all about that of a digger indian we are more apt to go by observation of the facts in the case we are constantly seeing weakness where you see depravity i dont say were right i only tell what you must often find to be the fact right or wrong in talking with doctors you see too our notions of bodily and moral disease or sin are apt to go together we used to be as hard on sickness as you were on sin we know better now we dont look at sickness as we used to and try to poison it with everything that is offensive burnt toads and earthworms and viperbroth and worse things than these we know that disease has something back of it which the body isnt to blame for at least in most cases and which very often it is trying to get rid of just so with sin i will agree to take a hundred newborn babes of a certain stock and return seventyfive of them in a dozen years true and honest if not pious children and i will take another hundred of a different stock and put them in the hands of certain annstreet or fivepoints teachers and seventyfive of them will be thieves and liars at the end of the same dozen years i have heard of an old character colonel jaques i believe it was a famous cattlebreeder who used to say he could breed to pretty much any pattern he wanted to well we doctors see so much of families how the tricks of the blood keep breaking out just as much in character as they do in looks that we cant help feeling as if a great many people hadnt a fair chance to be what is called good and that there isnt a text in the bible better worth keeping always in mind than that one judge not that ye be not judged as for our getting any quarter at the hands of theologians we dont expect it and have no right to you dont give each other any quarter i have had two religious books sent me by friends within a week or two one is mr brownsons he is as fair and square as euclid a real honest strong thinker and one that knows what he is talking about for he has tried all sorts of religions pretty much he tells us that the roman catholic church is the one through which alone we can hope for heaven the other is by a worthy episcopal rector who appears to write as if he were in earnest and he calls the papacy the devils masterpiece and talks about the satanic scheme of that very church through which alone as mr brownson tells us we can hope for heaven whats the use in our caring about hard words after this atheists heretics infidels and the like theyre after all only the cinders picked up out of those heaps of ashes round the stumps of the old stakes where they used to burn men women and children for not thinking just like other folks they ll crock your fingers but they cant burn us doctors are the bestnatured people in the world except when they get fighting with each other and they have some advantages over you you inherit your notions from a set of priests that had no wives and no children or none to speak of and so let their humanity die out of them it did nt seem much to them to condemn a few thousand millions of people to purgatory or worse for a mistake of judgment they didnt know what it was to have a child look up in their faces and say father it will take you a hundred or two more years to get decently humanized after so many centuries of dehumanizing celibacy besides though our libraries are perhaps not commonly quite so big as yours god opens one book to physicians that a good many of you dont know much about the book of life that is none of your dusty folios with black letters between pasteboard and leather but it is printed in bright red type and the binding of it is warm and tender to every touch they reverence that book as one of the almightys infallible revelations they will insist on reading you lessons out of it whether you call them names or not these will always be lessons of charity no doubt nothing can be more provoking to listen to but do beg your folks to remember that the smithfield fires are all out and that the cinders are very dirty and not in the least dangerous theyd a great deal better be civil and not be throwing old proverbs in the doctors faces when they say that the man of the old monkish notions is one thing and the man they watch from his cradle to his coffin is something very different it has cost a good deal of trouble to work the doctors talk up into this formal shape some of his sentences have been rounded off for him and the whole brought into a more rhetorical form than it could have pretended to if taken as it fell from his lips but the exact course of his remarks has been followed and as far as possible his expressions have been retained though given in the form of a discourse it must be remembered that this was a conversation much more fragmentary and colloquial than it seems as just read the reverend doctor was very far from taking offence at the old physicians freedom of speech he knew him to be honest kind charitable selfdenying wherever any sorrow was to be alleviated always reverential with a cheerful trust in the great father of all mankind to be sure his senior deacon old deacon shearer who seemed to have got his scriptureteachings out of the vinegar bible the one where vineyard is misprinted vinegar which a good many people seem to have adopted as the true reading his senior deacon had called dr kittredge an infidel but the reverend doctor could not help feeling that unless the text by their fruits ye shall know them were an interpolation the doctor was the better christian of the two whatever his senior deacon might think about it he said to himself that he shouldnt be surprised if he met the doctor in heaven yet inquiring anxiously after old deacon shearer he was on the point of expressing himself very frankly to the doctor with that benevolent smile on his face which had sometimes come near giving offence to the readers of the vinegar edition but he saw that the physicians attention had been arrested by elsie he looked in the same direction himself and could not help being struck by her attitude and expression there was something singularly graceful in the curves of her neck and the rest of her figure but she was so perfectly still that it seemed as if she were hardly breathing her eyes were fixed on the young girl with whom mr bernard was talking he had often noticed their brilliancy but now it seemed to him that they appeared dull and the look on her features was as of some passion which had missed its stroke mr bernards companion seemed unconscious that she was the object of this attention and was listening to the young master as if he had succeeded in making himself very agreeable of course dick veneer had not mistaken the game that was going on the schoolmaster meant to make elsie jealous and he had done it that s it get her savage first and then come wheedling round her a sure trick if he isnt headed off somehow but dick saw well enough that he had better let elsie alone just now and thought the best way of killing the evening would be to amuse himself in a little lively talk with mrs blanche creamer and incidentally to show elsie that he could make himself acceptable to other women if not to herself the doctor presently went up to elsie determined to engage her in conversation and get her out of her thoughts which he saw by her look were dangerous her father had been on the point of leaving helen darley to go to her but felt easy enough when he saw the old doctor at her side and so went on talking the reverend doctor being now left alone engaged the widow rowens who put the best face on her vexation she could but was devoting herself to all the underground deities for having been such a fool as to ask that palefaced thing from the institute to fill up her party there is no space left to report the rest of the conversation if there was anything of any significance in it it will turn up by and by no doubt at ten oclock the reverend doctor called miss letty who had no idea it was so late mr bernard gave his arm to helen mr richard saw to mrs blanche creamer the doctor gave elsie a cautioning look and went off alone thoughtful dudley venner and his daughter got into their carriage and were whirled away the widows gambit was played and she had not won the game chapter xxiii the wild huntsman the young master had not forgotten the old doctors cautions without attributing any great importance to the warning he had given him mr bernard had so far complied with his advice that he was becoming a pretty good shot with the pistol it was an amusement as good as many others to practise and he had taken a fancy to it after the first few days the popping of a pistol at odd hours in the backyard of the institute was a phenomenon more than sufficiently remarkable to be talked about in rockland the viscous intelligence of a countryvillage is not easily stirred by the winds which ripple the fluent thought of great cities but it holds every straw and entangles every insect that lights upon it it soon became rumored in the town that the young master was a wonderful shot with the pistol some said he could hit a fopencehapenny at three rod some that he had shot a swallow flying with a single ball some that he snuffed a candle five times out of six at ten paces and that he could hit any button in a mans coat he wanted to in other words as in all such cases all the common feats were ascribed to him as the current jokes of the day are laid at the door of any noted wit however innocent he may be of them in the natural course of things mr richard venner who had by this time made some acquaintances as we have seen among that class of the population least likely to allow a live cinder of gossip to go out for want of air had heard incidentally that the master up there at the institute was all the time practising with a pistol that they say he can snuff a candle at ten rods that was mrs blanche creamers version and that he could hit anybody he wanted to right in the eye as far as he could see the white of it dick did not like the sound of all this any too well without believing more than half of it there was enough to make the yankee schoolmaster too unsafe to be trifled with however shooting at a mark was pleasant work enough he had no particular objection to it himself only he did not care so much for those little popgun affairs that a man carries in his pocket and with which you could nt shoot a fellow a robber say without getting the muzzle under his nose pistols for boys longrange rifles for men there was such a gun lying in a closet with the fowlingpieces he would go out into the fields and see what he could do as a marksman the nature of the mark which dick chose for experimenting upon was singular he had found some panes of glass which had been removed from an old sash and he placed these successively before his target arranging them at different angles he found that a bullet would go through the glass without glancing or having its force materially abated it was an interesting fact in physics and might prove of some practical significance hereafter nobody knows what may turn up to render these outoftheway facts useful all this was done in a quiet way in one of the bare spots high up the side of the mountain he was very thoughtful in taking the precaution to get so far away riflebullets are apt to glance and come whizzing about peoples ears if they are fired in the neighborhood of houses dick satisfied himself that he could be tolerably sure of hitting a pane of glass at a distance of thirty rods more or less and that if there happened to be anything behind it the glass would not materially alter the force or direction of the bullet about this time it occurred to him also that there was an old accomplishment of his which he would be in danger of losing for want of practice if he did not take some opportunity to try his hand and regain its cunning if it had begun to be diminished by disuse for his first trial he chose an evening when the moon was shining and after the hour when the rockland people were like to be stirring abroad he was so far established now that he could do much as he pleased without exciting remark the prairie horse he rode the mustang of the pampas wild as he was had been trained to take part in at least one exercise this was the accomplishment in which mr richard now proposed to try himself for this purpose he sought the implement of which as it may be remembered he had once made an incidental use the lasso or long strip of hide with a slipnoose at the end of it he had been accustomed to playing with such a thong from his boyhood and had become expert in its use in capturing wild cattle in the course of his adventures unfortunately there were no wild bulls likely to be met with in the neighborhood to become the subjects of his skill a stray cow in the road an ox or a horse in a pasture must serve his turn dull beasts but moving marks to aim at at any rate never since he had galloped in the chase over the pampas had dick venner felt such a sense of life and power as when he struck the long spurs into his wild horses flanks and dashed along the road with the lasso lying like a coiled snake at the saddlebow in skilful hands the silent bloodless noose flying like an arrow but not like that leaving a wound behind it sudden as a pistolshot but without the telltale explosion is one of the most fearful and mysterious weapons that arm the hand of man the old romans knew how formidable even in contest with a gladiator equipped with sword helmet and shield was the almost naked retiarius with his net in one hand and his threepronged javelin in the other once get a net over a mans head or a cord round his neck or what is more frequently done nowadays bonnet him by knocking his hat down over his eyes and he is at the mercy of his opponent our soldiers who served against the mexicans found this out too well many a poor fellow has been lassoed by the fierce riders from the plains and fallen an easy victim to the captor who had snared him in the fatal noose but imposing as the sight of the wild huntsmen of the pampas might have been dick could not help laughing at the mock sublimity of his situation as he tried his first experiment on an unhappy milky mother who had strayed from her herd and was wandering disconsolately along the road laying the dust as slue went with thready streams from her swollen swinging udders here goes the don at the windmill said dick and tilted full speed at her whirling the lasso round his head as he rode the creature swerved to one side of the way as the wild horse and his rider came rushing down upon her and presently turned and ran as only cows and it would nt be safe to say it can run just before he passed at twenty or thirty feet from her the lasso shot from his hand uncoiling as it flew and in an instant its loop was round her horns well cast said dick as he galloped up to her side and dexterously disengaged the lasso now for a horse on the run he had the good luck to find one presently grazing in a pasture at the roadside taking down the rails of the fence at one point he drove the horse into the road and gave chase it was a lively young animal enough and was easily roused to a pretty fast pace as his gallop grew more and more rapid dick gave the reins to the mustang until the two horses stretched themselves out in their longest strides if the first feat looked like play the one he was now to attempt had a good deal the appearance of real work he touched the mustang with the spur and in a few fierce leaps found himself nearly abreast of the frightened animal he was chasing once more he whirled the lasso round and round over his head and then shot it forth as the rattlesnake shoots his head from the loops against which it rests the noose was round the horses neck and in another instant was tightened so as almost to stop his breath the prairie horse knew the trick of the cord and leaned away from the captive so as to keep the thong tensely stretched between his neck and the peak of the saddle to which it was fastened struggling was of no use with a halter round his windpipe and he very soon began to tremble and stagger blind no doubt and with a roaring in his ears as of a thousand battletrumpets at any rate subdued and helpless that was enough dick loosened his lasso wound it up again laid it like a pet snake in a coil at his saddlebow turned his horse and rode slowly along towards the mansionhouse the place had never looked more stately and beautiful to him than as he now saw it in the moonlight the undulations of the land the grand mountain screen which sheltered the mansion from the northern blasts rising with all its hanging forests and parapets of naked rock high towards the heavens the ancient mansion with its square chimneys and bodyguard of old trees and cincture of low walls with marblepillared gateways the fields with their various coverings the beds of flowers the plots of turf one with a gray column in its centre bearing a sundial on which the rays of the moon were idly shining another with a white stone and a narrow ridge of turf over all these objects harmonized with all their infinite details into one fair whole by the moonlight the prospective heir as he deemed himself looked with admiring eyes but while he looked the thought rose up in his mind like waters from a poisoned fountain that there was a deep plot laid to cheat him of the inheritance which by a double claim he meant to call his own every day this icecold beauty this dangerous handsome cousin of his went up to that place that ushers girltrap everyday regularly now it used to be different did she go only to get out of his her cousins reach was she not rather becoming more and more involved in the toils of this plotting yankee if mr bernard had shown himself at that moment a few rods in advance the chances are that in less than one minute he would have found himself with a noose round his neck at the heels of a mounted horseman providence spared him for the present mr richard rode his horse quietly round to the stable put him up and proceeded towards the house he got to his bed without disturbing the family but could not sleep the idea had fully taken possession of his mind that a deep intrigue was going on which would end by bringing elsie and the schoolmaster into relations fatal to all his own hopes with that ingenuity which always accompanies jealousy he tortured every circumstance of the last few weeks so as to make it square with this belief from this vein of thought he naturally passed to a consideration of every possible method by which the issue he feared might be avoided mr richard talked very plain language with himself in all these inward colloquies supposing it came to the worst what could be done then first an accident might happen to the schoolmaster which should put a complete and final check upon his projects and contrivances the particular accident which might interrupt his career must evidently be determined by circumstances but it must be of a nature to explain itself without the necessity of any particular persons becoming involved in the matter it would be unpleasant to go into particulars but everybody knows well enough that men sometimes get in the way of a stray bullet and that young persons occasionally do violence to themselves in various modes by firearms suspension and other means in consequence of disappointment in love perhaps oftener than from other motives there was still another kind of accident which might serve his purpose if anything should happen to elsie it would be the most natural thing in the world that his uncle should adopt him his nephew and only near relation as his heir unless indeed uncle dudley should take it into his head to marry again in that case where would he dick be this was the most detestable complication which he could conceive of and yet he had noticed he could not help noticing that his uncle had been very attentive to and as it seemed very much pleased with that young woman from the school what did that mean was it possible that he was going to take a fancy to her it made him wild to think of all the several contingencies which might defraud him of that goodfortune which seemed but just now within his grasp he glared in the darkness at imaginary faces sometimes at that of the handsome treacherous schoolmaster sometimes at that of the meeklooking but no doubt scheming ladyteacher sometimes at that of the dark girl whom he was ready to make his wife sometimes at that of his much respected uncle who of course could not be allowed to peril the fortunes of his relatives by forming a new connection it was a frightful perplexity in which he found himself because there was no one single life an accident to which would be sufficient to insure the fitting and natural course of descent to the great dudley property if it had been a simple question of helping forward a casualty to any one person there was nothing in dicks habits of thought and living to make that a serious difficulty he had been so much with lawless people that a life between his wish and his object seemed only as an obstacle to be removed provided the object were worth the risk and trouble but if there were two or three lives in the way manifestly that altered the case his southern blood was getting impatient there was enough of the newenglander about him to make him calculate his chances before he struck but his plans were liable to be defeated at any moment by a passionate impulse such as the darkhued races of southern europe and their descendants are liable to he lay in his bed sometimes arranging plans to meet the various difficulties already mentioned sometimes getting into a paroxysm of blind rage in the perplexity of considering what object he should select as the one most clearly in his way on the whole there could be no doubt where the most threatening of all his embarrassments lay it was in the probable growing relation between elsie and the schoolmaster if it should prove as it seemed likely that there was springing up a serious attachment tending to a union between them he knew what he should do if he was not quite so sure how he should do it there was one thing at least which might favor his projects and which at any rate would serve to amuse him he could by a little quiet observation find out what were the schoolmasters habits of life whether he had any routine which could be calculated upon and under what circumstances a strictly private interview of a few minutes with him might be reckoned on in case it should be desirable he could also very probably learn some facts about elsie whether the young man was in the habit of attending her on her way home from school whether she stayed about the schoolroom after the other girls had gone and any incidental matters of interest which might present themselves he was getting more and more restless for want of some excitement a mad gallop a visit to mrs blanche creamer who had taken such a fancy to him or a chat with the widow rowens who was very lively in her talk for all her sombre colors and reminded him a good deal of same of his earlier friends the senoritas all these were distractions to be sure but not enough to keep his fiery spirit from fretting itself in longings for more dangerous excitements the thought of getting a knowledge of all mr bernards ways so that he would be in his power at any moment was a happy one for some days after this he followed elsie at a long distance behind to watch her until she got to the schoolhouse one day he saw mr bernard join her a mere accident very probably for it was only once this happened she came on her homeward way alone quite apart from the groups of girls who strolled out of the schoolhouse yard in company sometimes she was behind them all which was suggestive could she have stayed to meet the schoolmaster if he could have smuggled himself into the school he would have liked to watch her there and see if there was not some understanding between her and the master which betrayed itself by look or word but this was beyond the limits of his audacity and he had to content himself with such cautious observations as could be made at a distance with the aid of a pocketglass he could make out persons without the risk of being observed himself mr silos peckhams corps of instructors was not expected to be off duty or to stand at ease for any considerable length of time sometimes mr bernard who had more freedom than the rest would go out for a ramble in the daytime but more frequently it would be in the evening after the hour of retiring as bedtime was elegantly termed by the young ladies of the apollinean institute he would then not unfrequently walk out alone in the common roads or climb up the sides of the mountain which seemed to be one of his favorite resorts here of course it was impossible to follow him with the eye at a distance dick had a hideous gnawing suspicion that somewhere in these deep shades the schoolmaster might meet elsie whose evening wanderings he knew so well but of this he was not able to assure himself secrecy was necessary to his present plans and he could not compromise himself by overeager curiosity one thing he learned with certainty the master returned after his walk one evening and entered the building where his room was situated presently a light betrayed the window of his apartment from a wooded bank some thirty or forty rods from this building dick venner could see the interior of the chamber and watch the master as he sat at his desk the light falling strongly upon his face intent upon the book or manuscript before him dick contemplated him very long in this attitude the sense of watching his every motion himself meanwhile utterly unseen was delicious how little the master was thinking what eyes were on him well there were two things quite certain one was that if he chose he could meet the schoolmaster alone either in the road or in a more solitary place if he preferred to watch his chance for an evening or two the other was that he commanded his position as he sat at his desk in the evening in such a way that there would be very little difficulty so far as that went of course however silence is always preferable to noise and there is a great difference in the marks left by different casualties very likely nothing would come of all this espionage but at any rate the first thing to be done with a man you want to have in your power is to learn his habits since the teaparty at the widow rowenss elsie had been more fitful and moody than ever dick understood all this well enough you know it was the working of her jealousy against that young schoolgirl to whom the master had devoted himself for the sake of piquing the heiress of the dudley mansion was it possible in any way to exasperate her irritable nature against him and in this way to render her more accessible to his own advances it was difficult to influence her at all she endured his company without seeming to enjoy it she watched him with that strange look of hers sometimes as if she were on her guard against him sometimes as if she would like to strike at him as in that fit of childish passion she ordered him about with a haughty indifference which reminded him of his own way with the darkeyed women whom he had known so well of old all this added a secret pleasure to the other motives he had for worrying her with jealous suspicions he knew she brooded silently on any grief that poisoned her comfort that she fed on it as it were until it ran with every drop of blood in her veins and that except in some paroxysm of rage of which he himself was not likely the second time to be the object or in some deadly vengeance wrought secretly against which he would keep a sharp lookout so far as he was concerned she had no outlet for her dangerous smouldering passions beware of the woman who cannot find free utterance for all her stormy inner life either in words or song so long as a woman can talk there is nothing she cannot bear if she cannot have a companion to listen to her woes and has no musical utterance vocal or instrumental then if she is of the real woman sort and has a few heartfuls of wild blood in her and you have done her a wrong doublebolt the door which she may enter on noiseless slipper at midnight look twice before you taste of any cup whose draught the shadow of her hand may have darkened but let her talk and above all cry or if she is one of the coarsergrained tribe give her the run of all the redhot expletives in the language and let her blister her lips with them until she is tired she will sleep like a lamb after it and you may take a cup of coffee from her without stirring it up to look for its sediment so if she can sing or play on any musical instrument all her wickedness will run off through her throat or the tips of her fingers how many tragedies find their peaceful catastrophe in fierce roulades and strenuous bravuras how many murders are executed in doublequick time upon the keys which stab the air with their daggerstrokes of sound what would our civilization be without the piano are not erard and broadwood and chickering the true humanizers of our time therefore do i love to hear the allpervading tum tum jarring the walls of little parlors in houses with double doorplates on their portals looking out on streets and courts which to know is to be unknown and where to exist is not to live according to any true definition of living therefore complain i not of modern degeneracy when even from the open window of the small unlovely farmhouse tenanted by the hardhanded man of bovine flavors and the flatpatterned woman of brokendown countenance issue the same familiar sounds for who knows that almira but for these keys which throb away her wild impulses in harmless discords would not have been floating dead in the brown stream which slides through the meadows by her fathers door or living with that other current which runs beneath the gaslights over the slimy pavement choking with wretched weeds that were once in spotless flower poor elsie she never sang nor played she never shaped her inner life in words such utterance was as much denied to her nature as common articulate speech to the deaf mute her only language must be in action watch her well by day and by night old sophy watch her well or the long line of her honored name may close in shame and the stately mansion of the dudleys remain a hissing and a reproach till its roof is buried in its cellar chapter xxiv on his tracks able said the old doctor one morning after youve harnessed caustic come into the study a few minutes will you abel nodded he was a man of few words and he knew that the will you did not require an answer being the true newengland way of rounding the corners of an employers order a tribute to the personal independence of an american citizen the hired man came into the study in the course of a few minutes his face was perfectly still and he waited to be spoken to but the doctors eye detected a certain meaning in his expression which looked as if he had something to communicate well said the doctor hes up to mischief o some kind i guess said abel i jest happened daown by the mansionhaouse last night n he come aout o the gate on that queerlookin creator o his i watched him n he rid very slow all raoun by the institoot n acted as ef he was spyin abaout he looks to me like a man thats calclatin to do some kind of illturn to somebody i should nt like to have him raoun me f there want a pitchfork or an eelspear or some sech weepn within reach he may be all right but i dont like his looks n i dont see what hes lurkin raoun the institoot for after folks is abed have you watched him pretty close for the last few days said the doctor wll yes ive had my eye on him considble o the time i haf to be pooty shy abaout it or hell find aout tht im on his tracks i don want him to get a spite aginst me f i cn help it he looks to me like one o them kind that kerries what they call slungshot n hits ye on the side o th head with em so suddin y never know what hurts ye why said the doctor sharply have you ever seen him with any such weapon about him wll no i caant say that i hev abel answered ony he looks kin o dangerous maybe hes all jest z he ought to be i caant say that he ant but hes aout late nights n lurkin raonn jest z ef he was spyin somebody n somehaow i caant help mistrustin them portageelookin fellahs i caant keep the run o this chap all the time but ive a notion that old black woman daown t the mansionhaouse knows z much abaout him z anybody the doctor paused a moment after hearing this report from his private detective and then got into his chaise and turned caustics head in the direction of the dudley mansion he had been suspicious of dick from the first he did not like his mixed blood nor his looks nor his ways he had formed a conjecture about his projects early he had made a shrewd guess as to the probable jealousy dick would feel of the schoolmaster had found out something of his movements and had cautioned mr bernard as we have seen he felt an interest in the young man a student of his own profession an intelligent and ingenuously unsuspecting young fellow who had been thrown by accident into the companionship or the neighborhood of two persons one of whom he knew to be dangerous and the other he believed instinctively might be capable of crime the doctor rode down to the dudley mansion solely for the sake of seeing old sophy he was lucky enough to find her alone in her kitchen he began taking with her as a physician he wanted to know how her rheumatism had been the shrewd old woman saw through all that with her little beady black eyes it was something quite different he had come for and old sophy answered very briefly for her aches and ails old folks bones ant like young folks she said its the lords doins n t ant much matter i shan be long roan this kitchen its the young missis doctor it s our elsie it s the baby as we use t call her don you remember doctor seventeen year ago n her poor mother cryin for her where is she where is she let me see her n how i run upstairs i could run then n got the coral necklace n put it round her little neck n then showed her to her mother n how her mother looked at her n looked n then put out her poor thin fingers n lifted the necklace n fell right back on her piller as white as though she was laid out to bury the doctor answered her by silence and a look of grave assent he had never chosen to let old sophy dwell upon these matters for obvious reasons the girl must not grow up haunted by perpetual fears and prophecies if it were possible to prevent it well how has elsie seemed of late he said after this brief pause the old woman shook her head then she looked up at the doctor so steadily and searchingly that the diamond eyes of elsie herself could hardly have pierced more deeply the doctor raised his head by his habitual movement and met the old womans look with his own calm and scrutinizing gaze sharpened by the glasses through which he now saw her sophy spoke presently in an awed tone as if telling a vision we shall be havin trouble before long the s somethin comin from the lord ive had dreams doctor its many a year ive been adreamin but now theyre comin over n over the same thing three times ive dreamed one thing doctor one thing and what was that the doctor said with that shade of curiosity in his tone which a metaphysician would probably say is an index of a certain tendency to belief in the superstition to which the question refers i can jestly tell y what it was doctor the old woman answered as if bewildered and trying to clear up her recollections but it was somethin fearful with a great noise n a great cryin o people like the las day doctor the lord have mercy on my poor chil n take care of her if anything happens but is feared shell never live to see the las day f t don come pooty quick poor sophy only the third generation from cannibalism was not unnaturally somewhat confused in her theological notions some of the secondadvent preachers had been about and circulated their predictions among the kitchen population of rockland this was the way in which it happened that she mingled her fears in such a strange manner with their doctrines the doctor answered solemnly that of the day and hour we knew not but it became us to be always ready is there anything going on in the household different from common old sophys wrinkled face looked as full of life and intelligence when she turned it full upon the doctor as if she had slipped off her infirmities and years like an outer garment all those fine instincts of observation which came straight to her from her savage grandfather looked out of her little eyes she had a kind of faith that the doctor was a mighty conjurer who if he would could bewitch any of them she had relieved her feelings by her long talk with the minister but the doctor was the immediate adviser of the family and had watched them through all their troubles perhaps he could tell them what to do she had but one real object of affection in the world this child that she had tended from infancy to womanhood troubles were gathering thick round her how soon they would break upon her and blight or destroy her no one could tell but there was nothing in all the catalogue of terrors which might not come upon the household at any moment her own wits had sharpened themselves in keeping watch by day and night and her face had forgotten its age in the excitement which gave life to its features doctor old sophy said theres strange things goin on here by night and by day i don like that man that dick i never liked him he giv me some o these things i got on i take em cos i know it make him mad if i no take em i wear em so that he need n feel as if i did n like him but doctor i hate him jes as much as a member of the church has the lords leave to hate anybody her eyes sparkled with the old savage light as if her illwill to mr richard veneer might perhaps go a little farther than the christian limit she had assigned but remember that her grandfather was in the habit of inviting his friends to dine with him upon the last enemy he had bagged and that her grandmothers teeth were filed down to points so that they were as sharp as a sharks what is that you have seen about mr richard veneer that gives you such a spite against him sophy asked the doctor what i seen bout dick veneer she replied fiercely ill tell y what i seen dick wans to marry our elsie that s what he wans n he don love her doctor he hates her doctor as bad as i hate him he wans to marry our elsie in live here in the big house n have nothin to do but jes lay still n watch massa venner n see how long t ill take him to die n f he don die fas puff help him some way t die

elsie but of sophy she no like any other creator tht ever drawed the bref o life if she can marry one man cos she love him she marry another man cos she hate him marry a man because she hates him sophy no woman ever did such a thing as that or ever will do it who tol you elsie was a woman doctor said old sophy with a flash of strange intelligence in her eyes the doctors face showed that he was startled the old woman could not know much about elsie that he did not know but what strange superstition had got into her head he was puzzled to guess he had better follow sophys lead and find out what she meant i should call elsie a woman and a very handsome one he said you dont mean that she has any mark about her except you know under the necklace the old woman resented the thought of any deformity about her darling i did n say she had nothin but j es that you know my beauty have anything ugly shes the beautifullestshaped lady that ever had a shinin silk gown drawed over her shoulders ony she ant like no other woman in none of her ways she dont cry n laugh like other women an she han got the same kind o feelins as other women do you know that young genmn up at the school doctor yes sophy ive met him sometimes hes a very nice sort of young man handsome too and i dont much wonder elsie takes to him tell me sophy what do you think would happen if he should chance to fall in love with elsie and she with him and he should marry her put your ear close to my lips doctor dear she whispered a little to the doctor then added aloud he die thats all but surely sophy you ant afraid to have dick marry her if she would have him for any reason are you he can take care of himself if anybody can doctor sophy answered nobody can take care of hisself that live wi elsie nobody never in all this worl mus live wi elsie but of sophy i tell you you don think i care for dick what do i care if dick venner die he wams to marry our elsie so s to live in the big house n get all the money n all

theyll take her n hang her or hell get mad with her n choke her oh i know his chokin tricks he don leave his keys roun for nothin whats that you say sophy tell me what you mean by all that so poor sophy had to explain certain facts not in all respects to her credit she had taken the opportunity of his absence to look about his chamber and having found a key in one of his drawers had applied it to a trunk and finding that it opened the trunk had made a kind of inspection for contraband articles and seeing the end of a leather thong had followed it up until she saw that it finished with a noose which from certain appearances she inferred to have seen service of at least doubtful nature an unauthorized search but old sophy considered that a game of life and death was going on in the household and that she was bound to look out for her darling the doctor paused a moment to think over this odd piece of information without sharing sophys belief as to the kind of use this mischievouslooking piece of property had been put to it was certainly very odd that dick should have such a thing at the bottom of his trunk the doctor remembered reading or hearing something about the lasso and the lariat and the bolas and had an indistinct idea that they had been sometimes used as weapons of warfare or private revenge but they were essentially a huntsmans implements after all and it was not very strange that this young man had brought one of them with him not strange perhaps but worth noting do you really think dick means mischief to anybody that he has such dangerouslooking things the doctor said presently i tell you doctor dick means to have elsie if he can get her he never let nobody else have her oh dick s a dark man doctor i know him i member him when he was little boy he always cunin i think he mean mischief to somebody he come home late nights come in softly oh i hear him i lay awake n got sharp ears i hear the cats walkin over the roofs n i hear dick veneer when he comes up in his stockinfeet as still as a cat i think he mean mischief to somebody i no like his looks these las days is that a very pooty genlmn up at the schoolhouse doctor i told you he was goodlooking what if he is i should like to see him doctor i should like to see the pooty genlmn that my poor elsie loves she mus n never marry nobody but oh doctor i should like to see him n jes think a little how it would ha been if the lord had n been so hard on elsie she wept and wrung her hands the kind doctor was touched and left her a moment to her thoughts and how does mr dudley veneer take all this he said by way of changing the subject a little oh massa veneer he good man but he don know nothin bout elsie as of sophy do i keep close by her i help her when she go to bed n set by her sometime when she sleep i come to her in th mornin n help her put on her things then in a whisper doctor elsie lets of sophy take off that necklace for her what you think she do f anybody else tech it i dont know im sure sophy strike the person perhaps oh yes strike em but not with her hans doctor the old womans significant pantomime must be guessed at but you havent told me sophy what mr dudley veneer thinks of his nephew nor whether he has any notion that dick wants to marry elsie i tell you massa venner he good man but he no see nothin bout what goes on here in the house he sort o brokenhearted you know sort o giv up don know what to do wi elsie xcep say yes yes dick always look smilin n behave well before him one time i thought massa veneer blieve dick was goin

n look out at her grave n then come up n look at the babys neck n say its fadin sophy ant it n then go down in the study n walk n walk n them kneel down n pray doctor there was two places in the old carpet that was all threadbare where his knees had worn em an sometimes you remember bout all that hed go off up into the mountain n be gone all day n kill all the ugly things he could find up there oh doctor i don like to think o them days an by n by he grew kin o still n begun to read a little n t las he got s quiets a lamb n thats the way he is now i think hes got religion doctor but he ant so bright about whats goin on n i don believe he never suspec nothin till somethin happens for the s somethin goin to happen doctor if the las day does n come to stop it n you mus tell us what to do n save my poor elsie my baby that the lord has n took care of like all his other childer the doctor assured the old woman that he was thinking a great deal about them all and that there were other eyes on dick besides her own let her watch him closely about the house and he would keep a lookout elsewhere if there was anything new she must let him know at once send up one of the menservants and he would come down at a moments warning there was really nothing definite against this young man but the doctor was sure that he was meditating some evil design or other he rode straight up to the institute there he saw mr bernard and had a brief conversation with him principally on matters relating to his personal interests that evening for some unknown reason mr bernard changed the place of his desk and drew down the shades of his windows late that night mr richard venner drew the charge of a rifle and put the gun back among the fowlingpieces swearing that a leather halter was worth a dozen of it chapter xxv the perilous hour up to this time dick venner had not decided on the particular mode and the precise period of relieving himself from the unwarrantable interference which threatened to defeat his plans the luxury of feeling that he had his man in his power was its own reward one who watches in the dark outside while his enemy in utter unconsciousness is illuminating his apartment and himself so that every movement of his head and every button on his coat can be seen and counted experiences a peculiar kind of pleasure if he holds a loaded rifle in his hand which he naturally hates to bring to its climax by testing his skill as a marksman upon the object of his attention besides dick had two sides in his nature almost as distinct as we sometimes observe in those persons who are the subjects of the condition known as double consciousness on his new england side he was cunning and calculating always cautious measuring his distance before he risked his stroke as nicely as if he were throwing his lasso but he was liable to intercurrent fits of jealousy and rage such as the lighthued races are hardly capable of conceiving blinding paroxysms of passion which for the time overmastered him and which if they found no ready outlet transformed themselves into the more dangerous forces that worked through the instrumentality of his cool craftiness he had failed as yet in getting any positive evidence that there was any relation between elsie and the schoolmaster other than such as might exist unsuspected and unblamed between a teacher and his pupil a book or a note even did not prove the existence of any sentiment at one time he would be devoured by suspicions at another he would try to laugh himself out of them and in the mean while he followed elsies tastes as closely as he could determined to make some impression upon her to become a habit a convenience a necessity whatever might aid him in the attainment of the one end which was now the aim of his life it was to humor one of her tastes already known to the reader that he said to her one morning come elsie take your castanets and let us have a dance he had struck the right vein in the girls fancy for she was in the mood for this exercise and very willingly led the way into one of the more empty apartments what there was in this particular kind of dance which excited her it might not be easy to guess but those who looked in with the old doctor on a former occasion and saw her will remember that she was strangely carried away by it and became almost fearful in the vehemence of her passion the sound of the castanets seemed to make her alive all over dick knew well enough what the exhibition would be and was almost afraid of her at these moments for it was like the dancing mania of eastern devotees more than the ordinary light amusement of joyous youth a convulsion of the body and the mind rather than a series of voluntary modulated motions elsie rattled out the triple measure of a saraband her eyes began to glitter more brilliantly and her shape to undulate in freer curves presently she noticed that dicks look was fixed upon her necklace his face betrayed his curiosity he was intent on solving the question why she always wore something about her neck the chain of mosaics she had on at that moment displaced itself at every step and he was peering with malignant searching eagerness to see if an unsunned ring of fairer hue than the rest of the surface or any less easily explained peculiarity were hidden by her ornaments she stopped suddenly caught the chain of mosaics and settled it hastily in its place flung down her castanets drew herself back and stood looking at him with her head a little on one side and her eyes narrowing in the way he had known so long and well what is the matter cousin elsie what do you stop for he said elsie did not answer but kept her eyes on him full of malicious light the jealousy which lay covered up under his surfacethoughts took this opportunity to break out you would nt act so if you were dancing with mr langdon would you elsie he asked it was with some effort that he looked steadily at her to see the effect of his question elsie colored not much but still perceptibly dick could not remember that he had ever seen her show this mark of emotion before in all his experience of her fitful changes of mood it had a singular depth of significance therefore for him he knew how hardly her color came blushing means nothing in some persons in others it betrays a profound inward agitation a perturbation of the feelings far more trying than the passions which with many easily moved persons break forth in tears all who have observed much are aware that some men who have seen a good deal of life in its less chastened aspects and are anything but modest will blush often and easily while there are delicate and sensitive women who can faint or go into fits if necessary but are very rarely seen to betray their feelings in their cheeks even when their expression shows that their inmost soul is blushing scarlet presently she answered abruptly and scornfully mr langdon is a gentleman and would not vex me as you do a gentleman dick answered with the most insulting accent a gentleman come elsie you ve got the dudley blood in your veins and it does nt do for you to call this poor sneaking schoolmaster a gentleman he stopped short elsies bosom was heaving the faint flush on her cheek was becoming a vivid glow whether it were shame or wrath he saw that he had reached some deeplying centre of emotion there was no longer any doubt in his mind with another girl these signs of confusion might mean little or nothing with her they were decisive and final elsie venner loved bernard langdon the sudden conviction absolute overwhelming which rushed upon him had wellnigh led to an explosion of wrath and perhaps some terrible scene which might have fulfilled some of old sophys predictions this however would never do dicks face whitened with his thoughts but he kept still until he could speak calmly ive nothing against the young fellow he said only i dont think theres anything quite good enough to keep the company of people that have the dudley blood in them you ant as proud as i am i cant quite make up my mind to call a schoolmaster a gentleman though this one may be well enough i ve nothing against him at any rate elsie made no answer but glided out of the room and slid away to her own apartment she bolted the door and drew her curtains close then she threw herself on the floor and fell into a dull slow ache of passion without tears without words almost without thoughts so she remained perhaps for a halfhour at the end of which time it seemed that her passion had become a sullen purpose she arose and looking cautiously round went to the hearth which was ornamented with curious old dutch tiles with pictures of scripture subjects one of these represented the lifting of the brazen serpent she took a hairpin from one of her braids and insinuating its points under the edge of the tile raised it from its place a small leaden box lay under the tile which she opened and taking from it a little white powder which she folded in a scrap of paper replaced the box and the tile over it whether dick had by any means got a knowledge of this proceeding or whether he only suspected some unmentionable design on her part there is no sufficient means of determining at any rate when they met an hour or two after these occurrences he could not help noticing how easily she seemed to have got over her excitement she was very pleasant with him too pleasant dick thought it was not elsies way to come out of a fit of anger so easily as that she had contrived some way of letting off her spite that was certain dick was pretty cunning as old sophy had said and whether or not he had any means of knowing elsies private intentions watched her closely and was on his guard against accidents for the first time he took certain precautions with reference to his diet such as were quite alien to his common habits on coming to the dinnertable that day he complained of headache took but little food and refused the cup of coffee which elsie offered him saying that it did not agree with him when he had these attacks here was a new complication obviously enough he could not live in this way suspecting everything but plain bread and water and hardly feeling safe in meddling with them not only had this schoolkeeping wretch come between him and the scheme by which he was to secure his future fortune but his image had so infected his cousins mind that she was ready to try on him some of those tricks which as he had heard hinted in the village she had once before put in practice upon a person who had become odious to her something must be done and at once to meet the double necessities of this case every day while the young girl was in these relations with the young man was only making matters worse they could exchange words and looks they could arrange private interviews they would be stooping together over the same book her hair touching his cheek her breath mingling with his all the magnetic attractions drawing them together with strange invisible effluences as her passion for the schoolmaster increased her dislike to him her cousin would grow with it and all his dangers would be multiplied it was a fearful point he had reached he was tempted at one moment to give up all his plans and to disappear suddenly from the place leaving with the schoolmaster who had come between him and his object an anonymous token of his personal sentiments which would be remembered a good while in the history of the town of rockland this was but a momentary thought the great dudley property could not be given up in that way something must happen at once to break up all this order of things he could think of but one providential event adequate to the emergency an event foreshadowed by various recent circumstances but hitherto floating in his mind only as a possibility its occurrence would at once change the course of elsies feelings providing her with something to think of besides mischief and remove the accursed obstacle which was thwarting all his own projects every possible motive then his interest his jealousy his longing for revenge and now his fears for his own safety urged him to regard the happening of a certain casualty as a matter of simple necessity this was the selfdestruction of mr bernard langdon such an event though it might be surprising to many people would not be incredible nor without many parallel cases he was poor a miserable fag under the control of that mean wretch up there at the school who looked as if he had sour buttermilk in his veins instead of blood he was in love with a girl above his station rich and of old family but strange in all her ways and it was conceivable that he should become suddenly jealous of her or she might have frightened him with some display of her peculiarities which had filled him with a sudden repugnance in the place of love any of these things were credible and would make a probable story enough so thought dick over to himself with the newengland half of his mind unfortunately men will not always take themselves out of the way when so far as their neighbors are concerned it would be altogether the most appropriate and graceful and acceptable service they could render there was at this particular moment no special reason for believing that the schoolmaster meditated any violence to his own person on the contrary there was good evidence that he was taking some care of himself he was looking well and in good spirits and in the habit of amusing himself and exercising as if to keep up his standard of health especially of taking certain eveningwalks before referred to at an hour when most of the rockland people had retired or in vulgar language gone to bed dick veneer settled it however in his own mind that mr bernard langdon must lay violent hands upon himself he even went so far as to determine the precise hour and the method in which the rash act as it would undoubtedly be called in the next issue of the rockland weekly universe should be committed time this evening method asphyxia by suspension it was unquestionably taking a great liberty with a man to decide that he should become felo de se without his own consent such however was the decision of mr richard veneer with regard to mr bernard langdon if everything went right then there would be a coroners inquest tomorrow upon what remained of that gentleman found suspended to the branch of a tree somewhere within a mile of the apollinean institute the weekly universe would have a startling paragraph announcing a sad event which had thrown the town into an intense state of excitement mr barnard langden a wellknown teacher at the appolinian institute was found etc etc the vital spark was extinct the motive to the rash act can only be conjectured but is supposed to be disappointed affection the name of an accomplished young lady of the highest respectability and great beauty is mentioned in connection with this melancholy occurrence dick venner was at the teatable that evening as usual no he would take green tea if she pleased the same that her father drank it would suit his headache better nothing he was much obliged to her he would help himself which he did in a little different way from common naturally enough on account of his headache he noticed that elsie seemed a little nervous while she was rinsing some of the teacups before their removal theres something going on in that witchs head he said to himself i know her she d be savage now if she had nt got some trick in hand let s see how she looks tomorrow dick announced that he should go to bed early that evening on account of this confounded headache which had been troubling him so much in fact he went up early and locked his door after him with as much noise as he could make he then changed some part of his dress so that it should be dark throughout slipped off his boots drew the lasso out from the bottom of the contents of his trunk and carrying that and his boots in his hand opened his door softly locked it after him and stole down the backstairs so as to get out of the house unnoticed he went straight to the stable and saddled the mustang he took a rope from the stable with him mounted his horse and set forth in the direction of the institute mr bernard as we have seen had not been very profoundly impressed by the old doctors cautions enough however to follow out some of his hints which were not troublesome to attend to he laughed at the idea of carrying a loaded pistol about with him but still it seemed only fair as the old doctor thought so much of the matter to humor him about it as for not going about when and where he liked for fear he might have some lurking enemy that was a thing not to be listened to nor thought of there was nothing to be ashamed of or troubled about in any of his relations with the schoolgirls elsie no doubt showed a kind of attraction towards him as did perhaps some others but he had been perfectly discreet and no father or brother or lover had any just cause of quarrel with him to be sure that dark young man at the dudley mansionhouse looked as if he were his enemy when he had met him but certainly there was nothing in their relations to each other or in his own to elsie that would be like to stir such malice in his mind as would lead him to play any of his wild southern tricks at his mr bernards expense yet he had a vague feeling that this young man was dangerous and he had been given to understand that one of the risks he ran was from that quarter on this particular evening he had a strange unusual sense of some impending peril his recent interview with the doctor certain remarks which had been dropped in his hearing but above all an unaccountable impression upon his spirits all combined to fill his mind with a foreboding conviction that he was very near some overshadowing danger it was as the chill of the icemountain toward which the ship is steering under full sail he felt a strong impulse to see helen darley and talk with her she was in the common parlor and fortunately alone helen he said for they were almost like brother and sister now i have been thinking what you would do if i should have to leave the school at short notice or be taken away suddenly by any accident do she said her cheek growing paler than its natural delicate hue why i do not know how i could possibly consent to live here if you left us since you came my life has been almost easy before it was getting intolerable you must not talk about going my dear friend you have spoiled me for my place who is there here that i can have any true society with but you you would not leave us for another school would you no no my dear helen mr bernard said if it depends on myself i shall stay out my full time and enjoy your company and friendship but everything is uncertain in this world i have been thinking that i might be wanted elsewhere and called when i did not think of it it was a fancy perhaps but i cant keep it out of my mind this evening if any of my fancies should come true helen there are two or three messages i want to leave with you i have marked a book or two with a cross in pencil on the flyleaf these are for you there is a little hymnbook i should like to have you give to elsie from me it may be a kind of comfort to the poor girl helens eyes glistened as she interrupted him what do you mean you must not talk so mr langdon why you never looked better in your life tell me now you are not in earnest are you but only trying a little sentiment on me mr bernard smiled but rather sadly about half in earnest he said i have had some fancies in my head superstitions i suppose at any rate it does no harm to tell you what i should like to have done if anything should happen very likely nothing ever will send the rest of the books home if you please and write a letter to my mother and helen you will find one small volume in my desk enveloped and directed you will see to whom give this with your own hands it is a keepsake the tears gathered in her eyes she could not speak at first presently why bernard my dear friend my brother it cannot be that you are in danger tell me what it is and if i can share it with you or counsel you in any way it will only be paying back the great debt i owe you no no it cant be true you are tired and worried and your spirits have got depressed i know what that is i was sure one winter that i should die before spring but i lived to see the dandelions and buttercups go to seed come tell me it was nothing but your imagination she felt a tear upon her cheek but would not turn her face away from him it was the tear of a sister i am really in earnest helen he said i dont know that there is the least reason in the world for these fancies if they all go off and nothing comes of them you may laugh at me if you like but if there should be any occasion remember my requests you dont believe in presentiments do you oh dont askme i beg you helen answered i have had a good many frights for every one real misfortune i have suffered sometimes i have thought i was warned beforehand of coming trouble just as many people are of changes in the weather by some unaccountable feeling but not often and i dont like to talk about such things i wouldnt think about these fancies of yours i dont believe you have exercised enough dont you think its confinement in the school has made you nervous perhaps it has but it happens that i have thought more of exercise lately and have taken regular evening walks besides playing my old gymnastic tricks every day they talked on many subjects but through all he said helen perceived a pervading tone of sadness and an expression as of a dreamy foreboding of unknown evil they parted at the usual hour and went to their several rooms the sadness of mr bernard had sunk into the heart of helen and she mingled many tears with her prayers that evening earnestly entreating that he might be comforted in his days of trial and protected in his hour of danger mr bernard stayed in his room a short time before setting out for his evening walk his eye fell upon the bible his mother had given him when he left home and he opened it in the new testament at a venture it happened that the first words he read were these lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping in the state of mind in which he was at the moment the text startled him it was like a supernatural warning he was not going to expose himself to any particular danger this evening a walk in a quiet village was as free from risk as helen darley or his own mother could ask yet he had an unaccountable feeling of apprehension without any definite object at this moment he remembered the old doctors counsel which he had sometimes neglected and blushing at the feeling which led him to do it he took the pistol his suspicious old friend had forced upon him which he had put away loaded and thrusting it into his pocket set out upon his walk the moon was shining at intervals for the night was partially clouded there seemed to be nobody stirring though his attention was unusually awake and he could hear the whirr of the bats overhead and the pulsating croak of the frogs in the distant pools and marshes presently he detected the sound of hoofs at some distance and looking forward saw a horseman coming in his direction the moon was under a cloud at the moment and he could only observe that the horse and his rider looked like a single dark object and that they were moving along at an easy pace mr bernard was really ashamed of himself when he found his hand on the butt of his pistol when the horseman was within a hundred and fifty yards of him the moon shone out suddenly and revealed each of them to the other the rider paused for a moment as if carefully surveying the pedestrian then suddenly put his horse to the full gallop and dashed towards him rising at the same instant in his stirrups and swinging something round his head what mr bernard could not make out it was a strange manoeuvre so strange and threatening in aspect that the young man forgot his nervousness in an instant cocked his pistol and waited to see what mischief all this meant he did not wait long as the rider came rushing towards him he made a rapid motion and something leaped fiveandtwenty feet through the air in mr bernards direction in an instant he felt a ring as of a rope or thong settle upon his shoulders there was no time to think he would be lost in another second he raised his pistol and fired not at the rider but at the horse his aim was true the mustang gave one bound and fell lifeless shot through the head the lasso was fastened to his saddle and his last bound threw mr bernard violently to the earth where he lay motionless as if stunned in the mean time dick venner who had been dashed down with his horse was trying to extricate himself one of his legs being held fast under the animal the long spur on his boot having caught in the saddlecloth he found however that he could do nothing with his right arm his shoulder having been in some way injured in his fall but his southern blood was up and as he saw mr bernard move as if he were coming to his senses he struggled violently to free himself i ll have the dog yet he said only let me get at him with the knife he had just succeeded in extricating his imprisoned leg and was ready to spring to his feet when he was caught firmly by the throat and looking up saw a clumsy barbed weapon commonly known as a hay fork within an inch of his breast hold on there what n thunder r y abaout y darned portagee said a voice with a decided nasal tone in it but sharp and resolute dick looked from the weapon to the person who held it and saw a sturdy plain man standing over him with his teeth clinched and his aspect that of one all ready for mischief lay still naow said abel stebbins the doctors man f y dont ill stick ye z sure z y r alive i been aafter ye fr a week n i got y naow i knowed id ketch ye at some darned trick or nother fore id done ith ye dick lay perfectly still feeling that he was crippled and helpless thinking all the time with the yankee half of his mind what to do about it he saw mr bernard lift his head and look around him he would get his senses again in a few minutes very probably and then he mr richard venner would be done for let me up let me up he cried in a low hurried voice i ll give you a hundred dollars in gold to let me go the man ant hurt dont you see him stirring hell come to himself in two minutes let me up ill give you a hundred and fifty dollars in gold now here on the spot and the watch out of my pocket take it yourself with your own hands ill see y darned fust ketch me lettn go was abels emphatic answer yeou lay still n wait tll that man comes tew he kept the hayfork ready for action at the slightest sign of resistance mr bernard in the mean time had been getting first his senses and then some few of his scattered wits a little together what is it he said whoshurt whats happened come along here z quick z y ken abel answered n haalp me fix this fellah y been hurt yrself n the s murder come pooty nigh happenin mr bernard heard the answer but presenth stared about and asked again whos hurt whats happened y r hurt yrself i tell ye said abel n the s been a murder pooty nigh mr bernard felt something about his neck and putting his hands up found the loop of the lasso which he loosened but did not think to slip over his head in the confusion of his perceptions and thoughts it was a wonder that it had not choked him but he had fallen forward so as to slacken it by this time he was getting some notion of what he was about and presently began looking round for his pistol which had fallen he found it lying near him cocked it mechanically and walked somewhat unsteadily towards the two men who were keeping their position as still as if they were performing in a tableau quick naow said abel who had heard the click of cocking the pistol and saw that he held it in his hand as he came towards him gi me that pistil and yeou fetch that ere rope layin there i ll have this here fellah fixed n less n two minutes mr bernard did as abel said stupidly and mechanically for he was but half right as yet abel pointed the pistol at dicks head naow hold up yr hands yeou fellah he said n keep em up while this man puts the rope mound yr wrists dick felt himself helpless and rather than have his disabled arm roughly dealt with held up his hands mr bernard did as abel said he was in a purely passive state and obeyed orders like a child abel then secured the rope in a most thorough and satisfactory complication of twists and knots naow get up will ye he said and the unfortunate dick rose to his feet whos hurt whats happened asked poor mr bernard again his memory having been completely jarred out of him for the time come look here naow yeou don stan askin questions over n over t beats all hant i tol y a dozen times as abel spoke he turned and looked at mr bernard hullo what n thunders that ere raoun yr neck ketched ye ith a slippernoose hey wal if that ant the craowner i hol on a minute capn n ill show ye what that ere halters good for abel slipped the noose over mr bernards head and put it round the neck of the miserable dick veneer who made no sign of resistance whether on account of the pain he was in or from mere helplessness or because he was waiting for some unguarded moment to escape since resistance seemed of no use i m gon to kerry y home said abel t th ol doctor hes got a gret curosity t see ye jes step along naow off that way will ye n i ill hol on t th bridle f fear y shd run away he took hold of the leather thong but found that it was fastened at the other end to the saddle this was too much for abel wal naow yeou be a pooty chap to hev raound a fellahs neck in a slippernoose at one eend of a halter n a hors on th full spring at t other eend he looked at him from head to foot as a naturalist inspects a new specimen his clothes had suffered in his fall especially on the leg which had been caught under the horse hullo look o there naow whats that ere stickin aout o yr boot it was nothing but the handle of an ugly knife which abel instantly relieved him of the party now took up the line of march for old doctor kittredges house abel carrying the pistol and knife and mr bernard walking in silence still halfstunned holding the hayfork which abel had thrust into his hand it was all a dream to him as yet he remembered the horseman riding at him and his firing the pistol but whether he was alive and these walls around him belonged to the village of rockland or whether he had passed the dark river and was in a suburb of the new jerusalem he could not as yet have told they were in the street where the doctors house was situated i guess ill fire off one o these here berrils said abel he fired presently there was a noise of opening windows and the nocturnal headdresses of rockland flowered out of them like so many developments of the nightblooming cereus white cotton caps and red bandanna handkerchiefs were the prevailing forms of efflorescence the main point was that the village was waked up the old doctor always waked easily from long habit and was the first among those who looked out to see what had happened why abel he called out what have you got there and what s all this noise about weve ketched the portagee abel answered as laconically as the hero of lake erie in his famous dispatch go in there you fellah the prisoner was marched into the house and the doctor who had bewitched his clothes upon him in a way that would have been miraculous in anybody but a physician was down in presentable form as soon as if it had been a child in a fit that he was sent for richard veneer the doctor exclaimed what is the meaning of all this mr langdon has anything happened to you mr bernard put his hand to his head my mind is confused he said ive had a fall oh yes wait a minute and it will all come back to me sit down sit down the doctor said abel will tell me about it slight concussion of the brain cant remember very well for an hour or two will come right by tomorrow been stunded abel said he cant tell nothin abel then proceeded to give a napoleonic bulletin of the recent combat of cavalry and infantry and its results none slain one captured the doctor looked at the prisoner through his spectacles what s the matter with your shoulder venner dick answered sullenly that he didnt know fell on it when his horse came down the doctor examined it as carefully as he could through his clothes out of joint untie his hands abel by this time a small alarm had spread among the neighbors and there was a circle around dick who glared about on the assembled honest people like a hawk with a broken wing when the doctor said untie his hands the circle widened perceptibly isnt it a leetle rash to give him the use of his hands i see theres females and children standin near this was the remark of our old friend deacon soper who retired from the front row as he spoke behind a respectablelooking but somewhat hastily dressed person of the defenceless sex the female help of a neighboring household accompanied by a boy whose unsmoothed shock of hair looked like a last years crowsnest but abel untied his hands in spite of the deacons considerate remonstrance now said the doctor the first thing is to put the joint back stop said deacon soper stop a minute dont you think it will be safer for the womenfolks jest to wait till mornin afore you put that jint into the socket colonel sprowle who had been called by a special messenger spoke up at this moment let the womenfolks and the deacons go home if theyre scared and put the fellahs jint in as quick as you like i ll resk him jint in or out i want one of you to go straight down to dudley venners with a message the doctor said i will have the young mans shoulder in quick enough dont send that message said dick in a hoarse voice do what you like with my arm but dont send that message let me go i can walk and ill be off from this place theres nobody hurt but myself damn the shoulder let me go you shall never hear of me again mr bernard came forward my friends he said i am not injured seriously at least nobody need complain against this man if i dont the doctor will treat him like a human being at any rate and then if he will go let him there are too many witnesses against him here for him to want to stay the doctor in the mean time without saying a word to all this had got a towel round the shoulder and chest and another round the arm and had the bone replaced in a very few minutes abel put cassia into the new chaise he said quietly my friends and neighbors leave this young man to me colonel sprowle youre a justice of the peace said deacon soper and you know what the law says in cases like this it ant so clear that it wont have to come afore the grand jury whether we will or no i guess well set that jint tomorrow mornin said colonel sprowle which made a laugh at the deacons expense and virtually settled the question now trust this young man in my care said the old doctor and go home and finish your naps i knew him when he was a boy and ill answer for it he wont trouble you any more the dudley blood makes folks proud i can tell you whatever else they are the good people so respected and believed in the doctor that they left the prisoner with him presently cassia the fast morgan mare came up to the frontdoor with the wheels of the new light chaise flashing behind her in the moonlight the doctor drove dick forty miles at a stretch that night out of the limits of the state do you want money he said before he left him dick told him the secret of his golden belt where shall i send your trunk after you from your uncles dick gave him a direction to a seaport town to which he himself was going to take passage for a port in south america goodbye richard said the doctor try to learn something from tonights lesson the southern impulses in dicks wild blood overcame him and he kissed the old doctor on both cheeks crying as only the children of the sun can cry after the first hours in the dewy morning of life so dick venner disappears from this story an hour after dawn cassia pointed her fine ears homeward and struck into her square honest trot as if she had not been doing anything more than her duty during her four hours stretch of the last night abel was not in the habit of questioning the doctors decisions its all right he said to mr bernard the fellah s squire venners relation anyhaow dont you want to wait here jest a little while till i come back thes a considable nice saddle n bridle on a dead boss thats layin daown there in the road n i guess the ant no use in lettin on em spite so ill jest step aout n fetch em along i kind o calclate t wont pay to take the creturs shoes n hide off tonight n the wont be much iron on that hoses huffs an haour after daylight ill bate ye a quarter ill walk along with you said mr bernard i feel as if i could get along well enough now so they set off together there was a little crowd round the dead mustang already principally consisting of neighbors who had adjourned from the doctors house to see the scene of the late adventure in addition to these however the assembly was honored by the presence of mr principal silas peckham who had been called from his slumbers by a message that master langdon was shot through the head by a highwayrobber but had learned a true version of the story by this time his voice was at that moment heard above the rest sharp but thin like bad cidervinegar i take charge of that property i say master langdon s actin under my orders and i claim that hoss and all thats on him hiram jest slip off that saddle and bridle and carry em up to the institoot and bring down a pair of pinchers and a file and stop fetch a pair of shears too theres hosshair enough in that mane and tail to stuff a bolster with you let that hoss alone spoke up colonel sprowle when a fellah goes out huntin and shoots a squirrel do you think hes gon to let another fellah pick him up and kerry him off not if hes got a doubleberril gun and tother berril hant been fired off yet i should like to see the mahn thatll take off that seddle n bridle excep the one tht hez a fair right to the whole concern hiram was from one of the lean streaks in new hampshire and not being overfed in mr silas peckhams kitchen was somewhat wanting in stamina as well as in stomach for so doubtful an enterprise as undertaking to carry out his employers orders in the face of the colonels defiance just then mr bernard and abel came up together here they be said the colonel stan beck gentlemen mr bernard who was pale and still a little confused but gradually becoming more like himself stood and looked in silence for a moment all his thoughts seemed to be clearing themselves in this interval he took in the whole series of incidents his own frightful risk the strange instinctive nay providential impulse which had led him so suddenly to do the one only thing which could possibly have saved him the sudden appearance of the doctors man but for which he might yet have been lost and the discomfiture and capture of his dangerous enemy it was all past now and a feeling of pity rose in mr bernards heart he loved that horse no doubt he said and no wonder a beautiful wild looking creature take off those things that are on him abel and have them carried to mr dudley veneers if he does not want them you may keep them yourself for all that i have to say one thing more i hope nobody will lift his hand against this noble creature to mutilate him in any way after you have taken off the saddle and bridle abel bury him just as he is under that old beechtree will be a good place youll see to it wont yon abel abel nodded assent and mr bernard returned to the institute threw himself in his clothes on the bed and slept like one who is heavy with wine following mr bernards wishes abel at once took off the highpeaked saddle and the richly ornamented bridle from the mustang then with the aid of two or three others he removed him to the place indicated spades and shovels were soon procured and before the moon had set the wild horse of the pampas was at rest under the turf at the wayside in the far village among the hills of new england chapter xxvi the news reaches the dudley mansion early the next morning abel stebbins made his appearance at dudley veneers and requested to see the maan o the haouse abaout somethin o consequence mr veneer sent word that the messenger should wait below and presently appeared in the study where abel was making himself at home as is the wont of the republican citizen when he hides the purple of empire beneath the apron of domestic service good mornin squire said abel as mr venner entered my names stebbins n im stoppin fr a spell ith of doctor kittredge well stebbins said mr dudley veneer have you brought any special message from the doctor y hant heerd nothin abaout it squire d ye mean t say said abel beginning to suspect that he was the first to bring the news of last evenings events about what asked mr veneer with some interest dew tell naow waal that beats all why that ere portagee relation o yourn z been tryin t ketch a fellah n a slippernoose n got ketched himself thats all y hant heerd nothn abaout it sit down said mr dudley veneer calmly and tell me all you have to say so abel sat down and gave him an account of the events of the last evening it was a strange and terrible surprise to dudley veneer to find that his nephew who had been an inmate of his house and the companion of his daughter was to all intents and purposes guilty of the gravest of crimes but the first shock was no sooner over than he began to think what effect the news would have on elsie he imagined that there was a kind of friendly feeling between them and he feared some crisis would be provoked in his daughters mental condition by the discovery he would wait however until she came from her chamber before disturbing her with the evil tidings abel did not forget his message with reference to the equipments of the dead mustang the was some things on the hoss squire that the man he ketched said he did n care no gret abaout but perhaps youd like to have em fetched to the mansionhaouse ef y did n care abaout em though i should n min keepin on em they might come handy some time or nother they say holt on t anything for ten year n there ll be some kin o use for t keep everything said dudley veneer i dont want to see anything belonging to that young man so abel nodded to mr veneer and left the study to find some of the men about the stable to tell and talk over with them the events of the last evening he presently came upon elbridge chief of the equine department and driver of the familycoach good mornin abe said elbridge whats fetched y daown here so allfired airly youre a darned pooty lot daown here you be abel answered better keep your portagees t home nex time ketchin folks ith

into that ere stable o yourn y wont curry that ere longtailed black hoss no more n y wont set yr eyes on the fellah that rid him agin in a hurry elbridge walked straight to the stable without saying a word found the door unlocked and went in th critters gone sure enough he said glad on t the darndest kickinest bitinest beast tht ever i see r ever wan t see agin good reddance don wan no snappinturkles in my stable whars the man gone tht brought the critter whar hes gone guess y better go n ask my ol man he kerried him off lass night n when he comes back mebbe he ll tell ye whar hes

daown on his straw must ha been took aout somewhere abaout ten r levee oclock i know that ere critters ways the fellahs had him aout nights afore bt i never thought nothin o no mischief he s a kin o haalf injin what is t the chaps been adoin on tell s all abaout it abel sat down on a mealchest picked up a straw and put it into his mouth elbridge sat down at the other end pulled out his jackknife opened the penknifeblade and began sticking it into the lid of the mealchest the doctors man had a story to tell and he meant to get all the enjoyment out of it so he told it with every luxury of circumstance mr veneers man heard it all with open mouth no listener in the gardens of stamboul could have found more rapture in a tale heard amidst the perfume of roses and the voices of birds and tinkling of fountains than elbridge in following abels narrative as they sat there in the aromatic ammoniacal atmosphere of the stable the grinding of the horses jaws keeping evenly on through it all with now and then the interruption of a stamping hoof and at intervals a ringing crow from the barnyard elbridge stopped a minute to think after abel had finished whos took care o them things that was on the hoss he said gravely waal langden he seemed to kin o think id ought to have em n the squire he did n seem to have no bjection n so waal i calclate i shll jes holt on to em myself they ant good f r much but theyre curous t keep t look at mr veneers man did not appear much gratified by this arrangement especially as he had a shrewd suspicion that some of the ornaments of the bridle were of precious metal having made occasional examinations of them with the edge of a file but he did not see exactly what to do about it except to get them from abel in the way of bargain waal no they ant good for much xcep to look at f y ever rid on that seddle once y would n try it agin very spry not f y cd haalp yrsaalf i tried it darned f i sot daown fr th nex week eat all my victuals stanin i shd like t hev them things wal enough to heng up n the stable f y want t trade some day fetch em along daown abel rather expected that elbridge would have laid claim to the saddle and bridle on the strength of some promise or other presumptive title and thought himself lucky to get off with only offering to think abaout tradin when elbridge returned to the house he found the family in a state of great excitement mr venner had told old sophy and she had informed the other servants everybody knew what had happened excepting elsie her father had charged them all to say nothing about it to her he would tell her when she came down he heard her step at last alight gliding step so light that her coming was often unheard except by those who perceived the faint rustle that went with it she was paler than common this morning as she came into her fathers study after a few words of salutation he said quietly elsie my dear your cousin richard has left us she grew still paler as she asked is he dead dudley venner started to see the expression with which elsie put this question he is living but dead to us from this day forward said her father he proceeded to tell her in a general way the story he had just heard from abel there could be no doubting it he remembered him as the doctors man and as abel had seen all with his own eyes as dicks chamber when unlocked with a spare key was found empty and his bed had not been slept in he accepted the whole account as true when he told of dicks attempt on the young schoolmaster you know mr langdon very well elsie a perfectly inoffensive young man as i understand elsie turned her face away and slid along by the wall to the window which looked out oh the little grassplot with the white stone standing in it her father could not see her face but he knew by her movements that her dangerous mood was on her when she heard the sequel of the story the discomfiture and capture of dick she turned round for an instant with a look of contempt and of something like triumph upon her face her father saw that her cousin had become odious to her he knew well by every change of her countenance by her movements by every varying curve of her graceful figure the transitions front passion to repose from fierce excitement to the dull languor which often succeeded her threatening paroxysms she remained looking out at the window a group of white fantailed pigeons had lighted on the green plot before it and clustered about one of their companions who lay on his back fluttering in a strange way with outspread wings and twitching feet elsie uttered a faint cry these were her special favorites and often fed from her hand she threw open the long window sprang out caught up the white fantail and held it to her bosom the bird stretched himself out and then lay still with open eyes lifeless she looked at him a moment and sliding in through the open window and through the study sought her own apartment where she locked herself in and began to sob and moan like those that weep but the gracious solace of tears seemed to be denied her and her grief like her anger was a dull ache longing like that to finish itself with a fierce paroxysm but wanting its natural outlet this seemingly trifling incident of the death of her favorite appeared to change all the current of her thought whether it were the sight of the dying bird or the thought that her own agency might have beep concerned in it or some deeper grief which took this occasion to declare itself some dark remorse or hopeless longing whatever it might be there was an unwonted tumult in her soul to whom should she go in her vague misery only to him who knows all his creatures sorrows and listens to the faintest human cry she knelt as she had been taught to kneel from her childhood and tried to pray but her thoughts refused to flow in the language of supplication she could not plead for herself as other women plead in their hours of anguish she rose like one who should stoop to drink and find dust in the place of water partly from restlessness partly from an attraction she hardly avowed to herself she followed her usual habit and strolled listlessly along to the school of course everybody at the institute was full of the terrible adventure of the preceding evening mr bernard felt poorly enough but he had made it a point to show himself the next morning as if nothing had happened helen darley knew nothing of it all until she hard risen when the gossipy matron of the establishment made her acquainted with all its details embellished with such additional ornamental appendages as it had caught up in transmission from lip to lip she did not love to betray her sensibilities but she was pale and tremulous and very nearly tearful when mr bernard entered the sittingroom showing on his features traces of the violent shock he had received and the heavy slumber from which he had risen with throbbing brows what the poor girls impulse was on seeing him we need not inquire too curiously if he had been her own brother she would have kissed him and cried on his neck but something held her back there is no galvanism in kissyourbrother it is copper against copper but alien bloods develop strange currents when they flow close to each other with only the films that cover lip and cheek between them mr bernard as some of us may remember violated the proprieties and laid himself open to reproach by his enterprise with a bouncing villagegirl to whose rosy cheek an honest smack was not probably an absolute novelty he made it all up by his discretion and good behavior now he saw by helens moist eye and trembling lip that her womans heart was off its guard and he knew by the infallible instinct of sex that he should be forgiven if he thanked her for her sisterly sympathies in the most natural way expressive and at the same time economical of breath and utterance he would not give a false look to their friendship by any such demonstration helen was a little older than himself but the aureole of young womanhood had not yet begun to fade from around her she was surrounded by that enchanted atmosphere into which the girl walks with dreamy eyes and out of which the woman passes with a story written on her forehead some people think very little of these refinements they have not studied magnetism and the law of the square of the distance so mr bernard thanked helen for her interest without the aid of the twentyseventh letter of the alphabet the love labial the limping consonant which it takes two to speak plain indeed he scarcely let her say a word at first for he saw that it was hard for her to conceal her emotion no wonder he had come within a hairsbreadth of losing his life and he had been a very kind friend and a very dear companion to her there were some curious spiritual experiences connected with his last evenings adventure which were working very strongly in his mind it was borne in upon him irresistibly that he had been dead since he had seen helen as dead as the son of the widow of nain before the bier was touched and he sat up and began to speak there was an interval between two conscious moments which appeared to him like a temporary annihilation and the thoughts it suggested were worrying him with strange perplexities he remembered seeing the dark figure on horseback rise in the saddle and something leap from its hand he remembered the thrill he felt as the coil settled on his shoulders and the sudden impulse which led him to fire as he did with the report of the pistol all became blank until he found himself in a strange bewildered state groping about for the weapon which he had a vague consciousness of having dropped but according to abels account there must have been an interval of some minutes between these recollections and he could not help asking where was the mind the soul the thinking principle all this time a man is stunned by a blow with a stick on the head he becomes unconscious another man gets a harder blow on the head from a bigger stick and it kills him does he become unconscious too if so when does he come to his consciousness the man who has had a slight or moderate blow comes to himself when the immediate shock passes off and the organs begin to work again or when a bit of the skull is pried up if that happens to be broken suppose the blow is hard enough to spoil the brain and stop the play of the organs what happens them a british captain was struck by a cannonball on the head just as he was giving an order at the battle of the nile fifteen months afterwards he was trephined at greenwich hospital having been insensible all that time immediately after the operation his consciousness returned and he at once began carrying out the order he was giving when the shot struck him suppose he had never been trephined when would his consciousness have returned when his breath ceased and his heart stopped beating when mr bernard said to helen i have been dead since i saw you it startled her not a little for his expression was that of perfect good faith and she feared that his mind was disordered when he explained not as has been done just now at length but in a hurried imperfect way the meaning of his strange assertion and the fearful sadduceeisms which it had suggested to his mind she looked troubled at first and then thoughtful she did not feel able to answer all the difficulties he raised but she met them with that faith which is the strength as well as the weakness of women which makes them weak in the hands of man but strong in the presence of the unseen it is a strange experience she said but i once had something like it i fainted and lost some five or ten minutes out of my life as much as if i had been dead but when i came to myself i was the same person every way in my recollections and character so i suppose that loss of consciousness is not death and if i was born out of unconsciousness into infancy with many familytraits of mind and body i can believe from my own reason even without help from revelation that i shall be born again out of the unconsciousness of death with my individual traits of mind and body if death is as it should seem to be a loss of consciousness that does not shake my faith for i have been put into a body once already to fit me for living here and i hope to be in some way fitted after this life to enjoy a better one but it is all trust in god and in his word these are enough for me i hope they are for you helen was a ministers daughter and familiar from her childhood with this class of questions especially with all the doubts and perplexities which are sure to assail every thinking child bred in any inorganic or not thoroughly vitalized faith as is too often the case with the children of professional theologians the kind of discipline they are subjected to is like that of the flathead indian pappooses at five or ten or fifteen years old they put their hands up to their foreheads and ask what are they strapping down my brains in this way for so they tear off the sacred bandages of the great flathead tribe and there follows a mighty rush of blood to the longcompressed region this accounts in the most lucid manner for those sudden freaks with which certain children of this class astonish their worthy parents at the period of life when they are growing fast and the frontal pressure beginning to be felt as something intolerable they tear off the holy compresses the hour for school came and they went to the great hall for study it would not have occurred to mr silas peckham to ask his assistant whether he felt well enough to attend to his duties and mr bernard chose to be at his post a little headache and confusion were all that remained of his symptoms later in the course of the forenoon elsie venner came and took her place the girls all stared at her naturally enough for it was hardly to have been expected that she would show herself after such an event in the household to which she belonged her expression was somewhat peculiar and of course was attributed to the shock her feelings had undergone on hearing of the crime attempted by her cousin and daily companion when she was looking on her book or on any indifferent object her countenance betrayed some inward disturbance which knitted her dark brows and seemed to throw a deeper shadow over her features but from time to time she would lift her eyes toward mr bernard and let them rest upon him without a thought seemingly that she herself was the subject of observation or remark then they seemed to lose their cold glitter and soften into a strange dreamy tenderness the deep instincts of womanhood were striving to grope their way to the surface of her being through all the alien influences which overlaid them she could be secret and cunning in working out any of her dangerous impulses but she did not know how to mask the unwonted feeling which fixed her eyes and her thoughts upon the only person who had ever reached the spring of her hidden sympathies the girls all looked at elsie whenever they could steal a glance unperceived and many of them were struck with this singular expression her features wore they had long whispered it around among each other that she had a liking for the master but there were too many of them of whom something like this could be said to make it very remarkable now however when so many little hearts were fluttering at the thought of the peril through which the handsome young master had so recently passed they were more alive than ever to the supposed relation between him and the dark schoolgirl some had supposed there was a mutual attachment between them there was a story that they were secretly betrothed in accordance with the rumor which had been current in the village at any rate some conflict was going on in that still remote clouded soul and all the girls who looked upon her face were impressed and awed as they had never been before by the shadows that passed over it one of these girls was more strongly arrested by elsies look than the others this was a delicate pallid creature with a high forehead and wideopen pupils which looked as if they could take in all the shapes that flit in what to common eyes is darkness a girl said to be clairvoyant under certain influences in the recess as it was called or interval of suspended studies in the middle of the forenoon this girl carried her autographbook for she had one of those indispensable appendages of the boardingschool miss of every degree and asked elsie to write her name in it she had an irresistible feeling that sooner or later and perhaps very soon there would attach an unusual interest to this autograph elsie took the pen and wrote in her sharp italian hand elsie venner infelix it was a remembrance doubtless of the forlorn queen of the aeneid but its coming to her thought in this way confirmed the sensitive schoolgirl in her fears for elsie and she let fall a tear upon the page before she closed it of course the keen and practised observation of helen darley could not fail to notice the change of elsies manner and expression she had long seen that she was attracted to the young master and had thought as the old doctor did that any impression which acted upon her affections might be the means of awakening a new life in her singularly isolated nature now however the concentration of the poor girls thoughts upon the one object which had had power to reach her deeper sensibilities was so painfully revealed in her features that helen began to fear once more lest mr bernard in escaping the treacherous violence of an assassin had been left to the equally dangerous consequences of a violent engrossing passion in the breast of a young creature whose love it would be ruin to admit and might be deadly to reject she knew her own heart too well to fear that any jealousy might mingle with her new apprehensions it was understood between bernard and helen that they were too good friends to tamper with the silences and edging proximities of lovemaking she knew too the simply human not masculine interest which mr bernard took in elsie he had been frank with helen and more than satisfied her that with all the pity and sympathy which overflowed his soul when he thought of the stricken girl there mingled not one drop of such love as a youth may feel for a maiden it may help the reader to gain some understanding of the anomalous nature of elsie veneer if we look with helen into mr bernards opinions and feelings with reference to her as they had shaped themselves in his consciousness at the period of which we are speaking at first he had been impressed by her wild beauty and the contrast of all her looks and ways with those of the girls around her presently a sense of some illdefined personal element which halfattracted and halfrepelled those who looked upon her and especially those on whom she looked began to make itself obvious to him as he soon found it was painfully sensible to his more susceptible companion the ladyteacher it was not merely in the cold light of her diamond eyes but in all her movements in her graceful postures as she sat in her costume and he sometimes thought even in her speech that this obscure and exceptional character betrayed itself when helen had said that if they were living in times when human beings were subject to possession she should have thought there was something not human about elsie it struck an unsuspected vein of thought in his own mind which he hated to put in words but which was continually trying to articulate itself among the dumb thoughts which lie under the perpetual stream of mental whispers mr bernards professional training had made him slow to accept marvellous stories and many forms of superstition yet as a man of science he well knew that just on the verge of the demonstrable facts of physics and physiology there is a nebulous borderland which what is called common sense perhaps does wisely not to enter but which uncommon sense or the fine apprehension of privileged intelligences may cautiously explore and in so doing find itself behind the scenes which make up for the gazing world the show which is called nature it was with something of this finer perception perhaps with some degree of imaginative exaltation that he set himself to solving the problem of elsies influence to attract and repel those around her his letter already submitted to the reader hints in what direction his thoughts were disposed to turn here was a magnificent organization superb in vigorous womanhood with a beauty such as never comes but after generations of culture yet through all this rich nature there ran some alien current of influence sinuous and dark as when a clouded streak seams the white marble of a perfect statue it would be needless to repeat the particular suggestions which had come into his mind as they must probably have come into that of the reader who has noted the singularities of elsies tastes and personal traits the images which certain poets had dreamed of seemed to have become a reality before his own eyes then came that unexplained adventure of the mountain almost like a dream in recollection yet assuredly real in some of its main incidents with all that it revealed or hinted this girl did not fear to visit the dreaded region where danger lurked in every nook and beneath every tuft of leaves did the tenants of the fatal ledge recognize some mysterious affinity which made them tributary to the cold glitter of her diamond eyes was she from her birth one of those frightful children such as he had read about and the professor had told him of who form unnatural friendships with cold writhing ophidians there was no need of so unwelcome a thought as this she had drawn him away from the dark opening in the rock at the moment when he seemed to be threatened by one of its malignant denizens that was all he could be sure of the counterfascination might have been a dream a fancy a coincidence all wonderful things soon grow doubtful in our own minds as do even common events if great interests prove suddenly to attach to their truth or falsehood i who am telling of these occurrences saw a friend in the great city on the morning of a most memorable disaster hours after the time when the train which carried its victims to their doom had left i talked with him and was for some minutes at least in his company when i reached home i found that the story had gone before that he was among the lost and i alone could contradict it to his weeping friends and relatives i did contradict it but alas i began soon to doubt myself penetrated by the contagion of their solicitude my recollection began to question itself the order of events became dislocated and when i heard that he had reached home in safety the relief was almost as great to me as to those who had expected to see their own brothers face no more mr bernard was disposed then not to accept the thought of any odious personal relationship of the kind which had suggested itself to him when he wrote the letter referred to that the girl had something of the feral nature her wild lawless rambles in forbidden and blasted regions of the mountain at all hours her familiarity with the lonely haunts where any other human foot was so rarely seen proved clearly enough but the more he thought of all her strange instincts and modes of being the more he became convinced that whatever alien impulse swayed her will and modulated or diverted or displaced her affections came from some impression that reached far back into the past before the days when the faithful old sophy had rocked her in the cradle he believed that she had brought her ruling tendency whatever it was into the world with her when the school was over and the girls had all gone helen lingered in the schoolroom to speak with mr bernard did you remark elsies ways this forenoon she said no not particularly i have not noticed anything as sharply as i commonly do my head has been a little queer and i have been thinking over what we were talking about and how near i came to solving the great problem which every day makes clear to such multitudes of people what about elsie bernard her liking for you is growing into a passion i have studied girls for a long while and i know the difference between their passing fancies and their real emotions i told you you remember that rosa would have to leave us we barely missed a scene i think if not a whole tragedy by her going at the right moment but elsie is infinitely more dangerous to herself and others womens love is fierce enough if it once gets the mastery of them always but this poor girl does not know what to do with a passion mr bernard had never told helen the story of the flower in his virgil or that other adventure which he would have felt awkwardly to refer to but it had been perfectly understood between them that elsie showed in her own singular way a wellmarked partiality for the young master why dont they take her away from the school if she is in such a strange excitable state said mr bernard i believe they are afraid of her helen answered it is just one of those cases that are ten thousand thousand times worse than insanity i dont think from what i hear that her father has ever given up hoping that she will outgrow her peculiarities oh these peculiar children for whom parents go on hoping every morning and despairing every night if i could tell you half that mothers have told me you would feel that the worst of all diseases of the moral sense and the will are those which all the bedlams turn away from their doors as not being cases of insanity do you think her father has treated her judiciously said mr bernard i think said helen with a little hesitation which mr bernard did not happen to notice i think he has been very kind and indulgent and i do not know that he could have treated her otherwise with a better chance of success he must of course be fond of her mr bernard said there is nothing else in the world for him to love helen dropped a book she held in her hand and stooping to pick it up the blood rushed into her cheeks it is getting late she said you must not stay any longer in this close schoolroom pray go and get a little fresh air before dinnertime chapter xxvii a soul in distress the events told in the last two chapters had taken place toward the close of the week on saturday evening the reverend chauncy fairweather received a note which was left at his door by an unknown person who departed without saying a word its words were these one who is in distress of mind requests the prayers of this congregation that god would be pleased to look in mercy upon the soul that he has afflicted there was nothing to show from whom the note came or the sex or age or special source of spiritual discomfort or anxiety of the writer the handwriting was delicate and might well be a womans the clergyman was not aware of any particular affliction among his parishioners which was likely to be made the subject of a request of this kind surely neither of the venners would advertise the attempted crime of their relative in this way but who else was there the more he thought about it the more it puzzled him and as he did not like to pray in the dark without knowing for whom he was praying he could think of nothing better than to step into old doctor kittredges and see what he had to say about it the old doctor was sitting alone in his study when the reverend mr fairweather was ushered in he received his visitor very pleasantly expecting as a matter of course that he would begin with some new grievance dyspeptic neuralgic bronchitic or other the minister however began with questioning the old doctor about the sequel of the other nights adventure for he was already getting a little jesuitical and kept back the object of his visit until it should come up as if accidentally in the course of conversation it was a pretty bold thing to go off alone with that reprobate as you did said the minister i dont know what there was bold about it the doctor answered all he wanted was to get away he was not quite a reprobate you see he didnt like the thought of disgracing his family or facing his uncle i think he was ashamed to see his cousin too after what he had done did he talk with you on the way not much for half an hour or so he did nt speak a word then he asked where i was driving him i told him and he seemed to be surprised into a sort of grateful feeling bad enough no doubt but might be worse has some humanity left in him yet let him go god can judge him i cant you are too charitable doctor the minister said i condemn him just as if he had carried out his project which they say was to make it appear as if the schoolmaster had committed suicide thats what people think the rope found by him was for he has saved his neck but his soul is a lost one i am afraid beyond question i cant judge mens souls the doctor said i can judge their acts and hold them responsible for those but i dont know much about their souls if you or i had found our soul in a halfbreed body and been turned loose to run among the indians we might have been playing just such tricks as this fellow has been trying what if you or i had inherited all the tendencies that were born with his cousin elsie oh that reminds me the minister said in a sudden way i have received a note which i am requested to read from the pulpit tomorrow i wish you would just have the kindness to look at it and see where you think it came from the doctor examined it carefully it was a womans or girls note he thought might come from one of the schoolgirls who was anxious about her spiritual condition handwriting was disguised looked a little like elsie veneers but not characteristic enough to make it certain it would be a new thing if she had asked public prayers for herself and a very favorable indication of a change in her singular moral nature it was just possible elsie might have sent that note nobody could foretell her actions it would be well to see the girl and find out whether any unusual impression had been produced on her mind by the recent occurrence or by any other cause the reverend mr fairweather folded the note and put it into his pocket i have been a good deal exercised in mind lately myself he said the old doctor looked at him through his spectacles and said in his usual professional tone put out your tongue the minister obeyed him in that feeble way common with persons of weak character for people differ as much in their mode of performing this trifling act as gideons soldiers in their way of drinking at the brook the doctor took his hand and placed a finger mechanically on his wrist it is more spiritual i think than bodily said the reverend mr fairweather is your appetite as good as usual the doctor asked pretty good the minister answered but my sleep my sleep doctor i am greatly troubled at night with lying awake and thinking of my future i am not at ease in mind he looked round at all the doors to be sure they were shut and moved his chair up close to the doctors you do not know the mental trials i have been going through for the last few months i think i do the old doctor said you want to get out of the new church into the old one dont you the minister blushed deeply he thought he had been going on in a very quiet way and that nobody suspected his secret as the old doctor was his counsellor in sickness and almost everybodys confidant in trouble he had intended to impart cautiously to him some hints of the change of sentiments through which he had been passing he was too late with his information it appeared and there was nothing to be done but to throw himself on the doctors good sense and kindness which everybody knew and get what hints he could from him as to the practical course he should pursue he began after an awkward pause you would not have me stay in a communion which i feel to be alien to the true church would you have you stay my friend said the doctor with a pleasant friendly look have you stay not a month nor a week nor a day if i could help it you have got into the wrong pulpit and i have known it from the first the sooner you go where you belong the better and im very glad you dont mean to stop halfway dont you know youve always come to me when youve been dyspeptic or sick anyhow and wanted to put yourself wholly into my hands so that i might order you like a child just what to do and what to take that s exactly what you want in religion i dont blame you for it you never liked to take the responsibility of your own body i dont see why you should want to have the charge of your own soul but im glad youre going to the old mother of all you wouldnt have been contented short of that the reverend mr fairweather breathed with more freedom the doctor saw into his soul through those awful spectacles of his into it and beyond it as one sees through a thin fog but it was with a real human kindness after all he felt like a child before a strong man but the strong man looked on him with a fathers indulgence many and many a time when he had come desponding and bemoaning himself on account of some contemptible bodily infirmity the old doctor had looked at him through his spectacles listened patiently while he told his ailments and then in his large parental way given him a few words of wholesome advice and cheered him up so that he went off with a light heart thinking that the heaven he was so much afraid of was not so very near after all it was the same thing now he felt as feeble natures always do in the presence of strong ones overmastered circumscribed shut in humbled but yet it seemed as if the old doctor did not despise him any more for what he considered weakness of mind than he used to despise him when he complained of his nerves or his digestion men who see into their neighbors are very apt to be contemptuous but men who see through them find something lying behind every human soul which it is not for them to sit in judgment on or to attempt to sneer out of the order of gods manifold universe little as the doctor had said out of which comfort could be extracted his genial manner had something grateful in it a film of gratitude came over the poor mans cloudy uncertain eye and a look of tremulous relief and satisfaction played about his weak mouth he was gravitating to the majority where he hoped to find rest but he was dreadfully sensitive to the opinions of the minority he was on the point of leaving the old doctor saw plainly enough what was going on in his mind i shant quarrel with you he said you know that very well but you mustnt quarrel with me if i talk honestly with you it isnt everybody that will take the trouble you flatter yourself that you will make a good many enemies by leaving your old communion not so many as you think this is the way the common sort of people will talk you have got your ticket to the feast of life as much as any other man that ever lived protestantism says help yourself heres a clean plate and a knife and fork of your own and plenty of fresh dishes to choose from the old mother says give me your ticket my dear and ill feed you with my gold spoon off these beautiful old wooden trenchers such nice bits as those good old gentlemen have left for you there is no quarrelling with a man who prefers broken victuals thats what the rougher sort will say and then where one scolds ten will laugh but mind you i dont either scold or laugh i dont feel sure that you could very well have helped doing what you will soon do you know you were never easy without some medicine to take when you felt ill in body im afraid ive given you trashy stuff sometimes just to keep you quiet now let me tell you there is just the same difference in spiritual patients that there is in bodily ones one set believes in wholesome ways of living and another must have a great list of specifics for all the souls complaints you belong with the last and got accidentally shuffled in with the others the minister smiled faintly but did not reply of course he considered that way of talking as the result of the doctors professional training it would not have been worth while to take offence at his plain speech if he had been so disposed for he might wish to consult him the next day as to what he should take for his dyspepsia or his neuralgia he left the doctor with a hollow feeling at the bottom of his soul as if a good piece of his manhood had been scooped out of him his hollow aching did not explain itself in words but it grumbled and worried down among the unshaped thoughts which lie beneath them he knew that he had been trying to reason himself out of his birthright of reason he knew that the inspiration which gave him understanding was losing its throne in his intelligence and the almighty majorityvote was proclaiming itself in its stead he knew that the great primal truths which each successive revelation only confirmed were fast becoming hidden beneath the mechanical forms of thought which as with all new converts engrossed so large a share of his attention the peace the rest which he had purchased were dearly bought to one who had been trained to the arms of thought and whose noble privilege it might have been to live in perpetual warfare for the advancing truth which the next generation will claim as the legacy of the present the reverend mr fairweather was getting careless about his sermons he must wait the fitting moment to declare himself and in the mean time he was preaching to heretics it did not matter much what he preached under such circumstances he pulled out two old yellow sermons from a heap of such and began looking over that for the forenoon naturally enough he fell asleep over it and sleeping he began to dream he dreamed that he was under the high arches of an old cathedral amidst a throng of worshippers the light streamed in through vast windows dark with the purple robes of royal saints or blazing with yellow glories around the heads of earthly martyrs and heavenly messengers the billows of the great organ roared among the clustered columns as the sea breaks amidst the basaltic pillars which crowd the stormy cavern of the hebrides the voice of the alternate choirs of singing boys swung back and forward as the silver censer swung in the hands of the whiterobed children the sweet cloud of incense rose in soft fleecy mists full of penetrating suggestions of the east and its perfumed altars the knees of twenty generations had worn the pavement their feet had hollowed the steps their shoulders had smoothed the columns dead bishops and abbots lay under the marble of the floor in their crumbled vestments dead warriors in rusted armor were stretched beneath their sculptured effigies and all at once all the buried multitudes who had ever worshipped there came thronging in through the aisles they choked every space they swarmed into all the chapels they hung in clusters over the parapets of the galleries they clung to the images in every niche and still the vast throng kept flowing and flowing in until the living were lost in the rush of the returning dead who had reclaimed their own then as his dream became more fantastic the huge cathedral itself seemed to change into the wreck of some mighty antediluvian vertebrate its flyingbuttresses arched round like ribs its piers shaped themselves into limbs and the sound of the organblast changed to the wind whistling through its thousandjointed skeleton and presently the sound lulled and softened and softened until it was as the murmur of a distant swarm of bees a procession of monks wound along through an old street chanting as they walked in his dream he glided in among them and bore his part in the burden of their song he entered with the long train under a low arch and presently he was kneeling in a narrow cell before an image of the blessed maiden holding the divine child in her arms and his lips seemed to whisper sancta maria ora pro nobis he turned to the crucifix and prostrating himself before the spare agonizing shape of the holy sufferer fell into a long passion of tears and broken prayers he rose and flung himself wornout upon his hard pallet and seeming to slumber dreamed again within his dream once more in the vast cathedral with throngs of the living choking its aisles amidst jubilant peals from the cavernous depths of the great organ and choral melodies ringing from the fluty throats of the singing boys a day of great rejoicings for a prelate was to be consecrated and the bones of the mighty skeletonminster were shaking with anthems as if there were life of its own within its buttressed ribs he looked down at his feet the folds of the sacred robe were flowing about them he put his hand to his head it was crowned with the holy mitre a long sigh as of perfect content in the consummation of all his earthly hopes breathed through the dreamers lips and shaped itself as it escaped into the blissful murmur ego sum episcopus one grinning gargoyle looked in from beneath the roof through an opening in a stained window it was the face of a mocking fiend such as the old builders loved to place under the eaves to spout the rain through their open mouths it looked at him as he sat in his mitred chair with its hideous grin growing broader and broader until it laughed out aloud such a hard stony mocking laugh that he awoke out of his second dream through his first into his common consciousness and shivered as he turned to the two yellow sermons which he was to pick over and weed of the little thought they might contain for the next days service the reverend chauncy fairweather was too much taken up with his own bodily and spiritual condition to be deeply mindful of others he carried the note requesting the prayers of the congregation in his pocket all day and the soul in distress which a single tender petition might have soothed and perhaps have saved from despair or fatal error found no voice in the temple to plead for it before the throne of mercy chapter xxviii the secret is whispered the reverend chauncy fairweathers congregation was not large but select the lines of social cleavage run through religious creeds as if they were of a piece with position and fortune it is expected of persons of a certain breeding in some parts of new england that they shall be either episcopalians or unitarians the mansionhouse gentry of rockland were pretty fairly divided between the little chapel with the stained window and the trained rector and the meetinghouse where the reverend mr fairweather officiated it was in the latter that dudley venner worshipped when he attended service anywhere which depended very much on the caprice of elsie he saw plainly enough that a generous and liberally cultivated nature might find a refuge and congenial souls in either of these two persuasions but he objected to some points of the formal creed of the older church and especially to the mechanism which renders it hard to get free from its outworn and offensive formulae remembering how archbishop tillotson wished in vain that it could be well rid of the athanasian creed this and the fact that the meetinghouse was nearer than the chapel determined him when the new rector who was not quite up to his mark in education was appointed to take a pew in the liberal worshippers edifice elsie was very uncertain in her feeling about going to church in summer she loved rather to stroll over the mountain on sundays there was even a story that she had one of the caves before mentioned fitted up as an oratory and that she had her own wild way of worshipping the god whom she sought in the dark chasms of the dreaded cliffs mere fables doubtless but they showed the common belief that elsie with all her strange and dangerous elements of character had yet strong religious feeling mingled with them the hymnbook which dick had found in his midnight invasion of her chamber opened to favorite hymns especially some of the methodist and quietist character many had noticed that certain tunes as sung by the choir seemed to impress her deeply and some said that at such times her whole expression would change and her stormy look would soften so as to remind them of her poor sweet mother on the sunday morning after the talk recorded in the last chapter elsie made herself ready to go to meeting she was dressed much as usual excepting that she wore a thick veil turned aside but ready to conceal her features it was natural enough that she should not wish to be looked in the face by curious persons who would be staring to see what effect the occurrence of the past week had had on her spirits her father attended her willingly and they took their seats in the pew somewhat to the surprise of many who had hardly expected to see them after so humiliating a family development as the attempted crime of their kinsman had just been furnishing for the astonishment of the public the reverend mr fairweather was now in his coldest mood he had passed through the period of feverish excitement which marks a change of religious opinion at first when he had began to doubt his own theological positions he had defended them against himself with more ingenuity and interest perhaps than he could have done against another because men rarely take the trouble to understand anybodys difficulties in a question but their own after this as he began to draw off from different points of his old belief the cautious disentangling of himself from one mesh after another gave sharpness to his intellect and the tremulous eagerness with which he seized upon the doctrine which piece by piece under various pretexts and with various disguises he was appropriating gave interest and something like passion to his words but when he had gradually accustomed his people to his new phraseology and was really adjusting his sermons and his service to disguise his thoughts he lost at once all his intellectual acuteness and all his spiritual fervor elsie sat quietly through the first part of the service which was conducted in the cold mechanical way to be expected her face was hidden by her veil but her father knew her state of feeling as well by her movements and attitudes as by the expression of her features the hymn had been sung the short prayer offered the bible read and the long prayer was about to begin this was the time at which the notes of any who were in affliction from loss of friends the sick who were doubtful of recovery those who had cause to be grateful for preservation of life or other signal blessing were wont to be read just then it was that dudley veneer noticed that his daughter was trembling a thing so rare so unaccountable indeed under the circumstances that he watched her closely and began to fear that some nervous paroxysm or other malady might have just begun to show itself in this way upon her the minister had in his pocket two notes one in the handwriting of deacon soper was from a member of this congregation returning thanks for his preservation through a season of great peril supposed to be the exposure which he had shared with others when standing in the circle around dick veneer the other was the anonymous one in a female hand which he had received the evening before he forgot them both his thoughts were altogether too much taken up with more important matters he prayed through all the frozen petitions of his expurgated form of supplication and not a single heart was soothed or lifted or reminded that its sorrows were struggling their way up to heaven borne on the breath from a human soul that was warm with love the people sat down as if relieved when the dreary prayer was finished elsie alone remained standing until her father touched her then she sat down lifted her veil and looked at him with a blank sad look as if she had suffered some pain or wrong but could not give any name or expression to her vague trouble she did not tremble any longer but remained ominously still as if she had been frozen where she sat can a man love his own soul too well who on the whole constitute the nobler class of human beings those who have lived mainly to make sure of their own personal welfare in another and future condition of existence or they who have worked with all their might for their race for their country for the advancement of the kingdom of god and left all personal arrangements concerning themselves to the sole charge of him who made them and is responsible to himself for their safekeeping is an anchorite who has worn the stone floor of his cell into basins with his knees bent in prayer more acceptable than the soldier who gives his life for the maintenance of any sacred right or truth without thinking what will specially become of him in a world where there are two or three million colonists a month from this one planet to be cared for these are grave questions which must suggest themselves to those who know that there are many profoundly selfish persons who are sincerely devout and perpetually occupied with their own future while there are others who are perfectly ready to sacrifice themselves for any worthy object in this world but are really too little occupied with their exclusive personality to think so much as many do about what is to become of them in another the reverend chauncy fairweather did not most certainly belong to this latter class there are several kinds of believers whose history we find among the early converts to christianity there was the magistrate whose social position was such that he preferred a private interview in the evening with the teacher to following him with the streetcrowd he had seen extraordinary facts which had satisfied him that the young galilean had a divine commission but still he crossquestioned the teacher himself he was not ready to accept statements without explanation that was the right kind of man see how he stood up for the legal rights of his master when the people were for laying hands on him and again there was the government official intrusted with public money which in those days implied that he was supposed to be honest a single look of that heavenly countenance and two words of gentle command were enough for him neither of these men the early disciple nor the evangelist seems to have been thinking primarily about his own personal safety but now look at the poor miserable turnkey whose occupation shows what he was like to be and who had just been thrusting two respectable strangers taken from the hands of a mob covered with stripes and stripped of clothing into the inner prison and making their feet fast in the stocks his thought in the moment of terror is for himself first suicide then what he shall do not to save his household not to fulfil his duty to his office not to repair the outrage he has been committing but to secure his own personal safety truly character shows itself as much in a mans way of becoming a christian as in any other elsie sat statuelike through the sermon it would not be fair to the reader to give an abstract of that when a man who has been bred to free thought and free speech suddenly finds himself stepping about like a dancer amidst his eggs among the old addled majorityvotes which he must not tread upon he is a spectacle for men and angels submission to intellectual precedent and authority does very well for those who have been bred to it we know that the underground courses of their minds are laid in the roman cement of tradition and that stately and splendid structures may be reared on such a foundation but to see one laying a platform over heretical quicksands thirty or forty or fifty years deep and then beginning to build upon it is a sorry sight a new convert from the reformed to the ancient faith may be very strong in the arms but he will always have weak legs and shaky knees he may use his hands well and hit hard with his fists but he will never stand on his legs in the way the man does who inherits his belief the services were over at last and dudley venner and his daughter walked home together in silence he always respected her moods and saw clearly enough that some inward trouble was weighing upon her there was nothing to be said in such cases for elsie could never talk of her griefs an hour or a day or a week of brooding with perhaps a sudden flash of violence this was the way in which the impressions which make other women weep and tell their griefs by word or letter showed their effects in her mind and acts she wandered off up into the remoter parts of the mountain that day after their return no one saw just where she went indeed no one knew its forestrecesses and rocky fastnesses as she did she was gone until late at night and when old sophy who had watched for her bound up her long hair for her sleep it was damp with the cold dews the old black woman looked at her without speaking but questioning her with every feature as to the sorrow that was weighing on her suddenly she turned to old sophy you want to know what there is troubling me she said nobody loves me i cannot love anybody what is love sophy its what poor ol sophys got for her elsie the old woman answered tell me darlin don you love somebody don you love you know oh tell me darlin don you love to see the genlman that keeps up at the school where you go they say hes the pootiest genlman that was ever in the town here don be fraid of poor ol sophy darlin she loved a man once see here oh ive showed you this often enough she took from her pocket a half of one of the old spanish silver coins such as were current in the earlier part of this century the other half of it had been lying in the deep seasand for more than fifty years elsie looked her in the face but did not answer in words what strange intelligence was that which passed between them through the diamond eyes and the little beady black ones what subtile intercommunication penetrating so much deeper than articulate speech this was the nearest approach to sympathetic relations that elsie ever had a kind of dumb intercourse of feeling such as one sees in the eyes of brute mothers looking on their young but subtile as it was it was narrow and individual whereas an emotion which can shape itself in language opens the gate for itself into the great community of human affections for every word we speak is the medal of a dead thought or feeling struck in the die of some human experience worn smooth by innumerable contacts and always transferred warm from one to another by words we share the common consciousness of the race which has shaped itself in these symbols by music we reach those special states of consciousness which being without form cannot be shaped with the mosaics of the vocabulary the language of the eyes runs deeper into the personal nature but it is purely individual and perishes in the expression if we consider them all as growing out of the consciousness as their root language is the leaf music is the flower but when the eyes meet and search each other it is the uncovering of the blanched stem through which the whole life runs but which has never taken color or form from the sunlight for three days elsie did not return to the school much of the time she was among the woods and rocks the season was now beginning to wane and the forest to put on its autumnal glory the dreamy haze was beginning to soften the landscape and the mast delicious days of the year were lending their attraction to the scenery of the mountain it was not very singular that elsie should be lingering in her old haunts from which the change of season must soon drive her but old sophy saw clearly enough that some internal conflict was going on and knew very well that it must have its own way and work itself out as it best could as much as looks could tell elsie had told her she had said in words to be sure that she could not love something warped and thwarted the emotion which would have been love in another no doubt but that such an emotion was striving with her against all malign influences which interfered with it the old woman had a perfect certainty in her own mind everybody who has observed the working of emotions in persons of various temperaments knows well enough that they have periods of incubation which differ with the individual and with the particular cause and degree of excitement yet evidently go through a strictly selflimited series of evolutions at the end of which their result an act of violence a paroxysm of tears a gradual subsidence into repose or whatever it may be declares itself like the last stage of an attack of fever and ague no one can observe children without noticing that there is a personal equation to use the astronomers language in their tempers so that one sulks an hour over an offence which makes another a fury for five minutes and leaves him or her an angel when it is over at the end of three days elsie braided her long glossy black hair and shot a golden arrow through it she dressed herself with more than usual care and came down in the morning superb in her stormy beauty the brooding paroxysm was over or at least her passion had changed its phase her father saw it with great relief he had always many fears for her in her hours and days of gloom but for reasons before assigned had felt that she must be trusted to herself without appealing to actual restraint or any other supervision than such as old sophy could exercise without offence she went off at the accustomed hour to the school all the girls had their eyes on her none so keen as these young misses to know an inward movement by an outward sign of adornment if they have not as many signals as the ships that sail the great seas there is not an end of ribbon or a turn of a ringlet which is not a hieroglyphic with a hidden meaning to these little cruisers over the ocean of sentiment the girls all looked at elsie with a new thought for she was more sumptuously arrayed than perhaps ever before at the school and they said to themselves that she had come meaning to draw the young masters eyes upon her that was it what else could it be the beautiful cold girl with the diamond eyes meant to dazzle the handsome young gentleman he would be afraid to love her it couldnt be true that which some people had said in the village she was nt the kind of young lady to make mr langdon happy those dark people are never safe so one of the young blondes said to herself elsie was not literary enough for such a scholar so thought miss charlotte ann wood the young poetess she couldnt have a good temper with those scowling eyebrows this was the opinion of several broadfaced smiling girls who thought each in her own snug little mental sanctum that if etc etc she could make him so happy elsie had none of the still wicked light in her eyes that morning she looked gentle but dreamy played with her books did not trouble herself with any of the exercises which in itself was not very remarkable as she was always allowed under some pretext or other to have her own way the schoolhours were over at length the girls went out but she lingered to the last she then came up to mr bernard with a book in her hand as if to ask a question will you walk towards my home with me today she said in a very low voice little more than a whisper mr bernard was startled by the request put in such a way he had a presentiment of some painful scene or other but there was nothing to be done but to assure her that it would give him great pleasure so they walked along together on their way toward the dudley mansion i have no friend elsie said all at once nothing loves me but one old woman i cannot love anybody they tell me there is something in my eyes that draws people to me and makes them faint look into them will you she turned her face toward him it was very pale and the diamond eyes were glittering with a film such as beneath other lids would have rounded into a tear beautiful eyes elsie he said sometimes very piercing but soft now and looking as if there were something beneath them that friendship might draw out i am your friend elsie tell me what i can do to render your life happier love me said elsie venner what shall a man do when a woman makes such a demand involving such an avowal it was the tenderest cruellest humblest moment of mr bernards life he turned pale he trembled almost as if he had been a woman listening to her lovers declaration elsie he said presently i so long to be of some use to you to have your confidence and sympathy that i must not let you say or do anything to put us in false relations i do love you elsie as a suffering sister with sorrows of her own as one whom i would save at the risk of my happiness and life as one who needs a true friend more than any of all the young girls i have known more than this you would not ask me to say you have been through excitement and trouble lately and it has made you feel such a need more than ever give me your hand dear elsie and trust me that i will be as true a friend to you as if we were children of the same mother elsie gave him her hand mechanically it seemed to him that a cold aura shot from it along his arm and chilled the blood running through his heart he pressed it gently looked at her with a face full of grave kindness and sad interest then softly relinquished it it was all over with poor elsie they walked almost in silence the rest of the way mr bernard left her at the gate of the mansionhouse and returned with sad forebodings elsie went at once to her own room and did not come from it at the usual hours at last old sophy began to be alarmed about her went to her apartment and finding the door unlocked entered cautiously she found elsie lying on her bed her brows strongly contracted her eyes dull her whole look that of great suffering her first thought was that she had been doing herself a harm by some deadly means or other but elsie saw her fear and reassured her no she said there is nothing wrong such as you are thinking of i am not dying you may send for the doctor perhaps he can take the pain from my head that is all i want him to do there is no use in the pain that i know of if he can stop it let him so they sent for the old doctor it was not long before the solid trot of caustic the old bay horse and the crashing of the gravel under the wheels gave notice that the physician was driving up the avenue the old doctor was a model for visiting practitioners he always came into the sickroom with a quiet cheerful look as if he had a consciousness that he was bringing some sure relief with him the way a patient snatches his first look at his doctors face to see whether he is doomed whether he is reprieved whether he is unconditionally pardoned has really something terrible about it it is only to be met by an imperturbable mask of serenity proof against anything and everything in a patients aspect the physician whose face reflects his patients condition like a mirror may do well enough to examine people for a lifeinsurance office but does not belong to the sickroom the old doctor did not keep people waiting in dread suspense while he stayed talking about the case the patient all the time thinking that he and the friends are discussing some alarming symptom or formidable operation which he himself is byandby to hear of he was in elsies room almost before she knew he was in the house he came to her bedside in such a natural quiet way that it seemed as if he were only a friend who had dropped in for a moment to say a pleasant word yet he was very uneasy about elsie until he had seen her he never knew what might happen to her or those about her and came prepared for the worst sick my child he said in a very soft low voice elsie nodded without speaking the doctor took her hand whether with professional views or only in a friendly way it would have been hard to tell so he sat a few minutes looking at her all the time with a kind of fatherly interest but with it all noting how she lay how she breathed her color her expression all that teaches the practised eye so much without a single question being asked he saw she was in suffering and said presently you have pain somewhere where is it she put her hand to her head as she was not disposed to talk he watched her for a while questioned old sophy shrewdly a few minutes and so made up his mind as to the probable cause of disturbance and the proper remedies to be used some very silly people thought the old doctor did not believe in medicine because he gave less than certain poor halftaught creatures in the smaller neighboring towns who took advantage of peoples sickness to disgust and disturb them with all manner of illsmelling and illbehaving drugs in truth he hated to give anything noxious or loathsome to those who were uncomfortable enough already unless he was very sure it would do good in which case he never played with drugs but gave good honest efficient doses sometimes he lost a family of the more boorish sort because they did not think they got their moneys worth out of him unless they had something more than a taste of everything he carried in his saddlebags he ordered some remedies which he thought would relieve elsie and left her saying he would call the next day hoping to find her better but the next day came and the next and still elsie was on her bed feverish restless wakeful silent at night she tossed about and wandered and it became at length apparent that there was a settled attack something like what they called formerly a nervous fever on the fourth day she was more restless than common one of the women of the house came in to help to take care of her but she showed an aversion to her presence send me helen darley she said at last the old doctor told them that if possible they must indulge this fancy of hers the caprices of sick people were never to be despised least of all of such persons as elsie when rendered irritable and exacting by pain and weakness so a message was sent to mr silas peckham at the apollinean institute to know if he could not spare miss helen darley for a few days if required to give her attention to a young lady who attended his school and who was now lying ill no other person than the daughter of dudley venner a mean man never agrees to anything without deliberately turning it over so that he may see its dirty side and if he can sweating the coin he pays for it if an archangel should offer to save his soul for sixpence he would try to find a sixpence with a hole in it a gentleman says yes to a great many things without stopping to think a shabby fellow is known by his caution in answering questions for fear of compromising his pocket or himself mr silas peckham looked very grave at the request the dooties of miss darley at the institoot were important very important he paid her large sums of money for her time more than she could expect to get in any other institootion for the edoocation of female youth a deduction from her selary would be necessary in case she should retire from the sphere of her dooties for a season he should be put to extry expense and have to perform additional labors himself he would consider of the matter if any arrangement could be made he would send word to squire venners folks miss darley said silas peckham the s a message from squire venners that his daughter wants you down at the mansionhouse to see her shes got a fever so they inform me if its any kind of ketchin fever of course you wont think of goin near the mansionhouse if doctor kittredge says its safe perfecly safe i cant object to your goin on sech conditions as seem to be fair to all concerned you will give up your pay for the whole time you are absent portions of days to be caounted as whole days you will be charged with board the same as if you eat your victuals with the household the victuals are of no use after theyre cooked but to be eat and your bein away is no savin to our folks i shall charge you a reasonable compensation for the demage to the school by the absence of a teacher if miss crabs undertakes any dooties belongin to your department of instruction she will look to you for sech pecooniary considerations as you may agree upon between you on these conditions i am willin to give my consent to your temporary absence from the post of dooty i will step down to doctor kittredges myself and make inquiries as to the natur of the complaint mr peckham took up a rusty and very narrowbrimmed hat which he cocked upon one side of his head with an air peculiar to the rural gentry it was the hour when the doctor expected to be in his office unless he had some special call which kept him from home he found the reverend chauncy fairweather just taking leave of the doctor his hand was on the pit of his stomach and his countenance was expressive of inward uneasiness shake it before using said the doctor and the sooner you make up your mind to speak right out the better it will be for your digestion oh mr peckham walk in mr peckham nobody sick up at the school i hope the haalth of the school is fustrate replied mr peckham the sitooation is uncommonly favorable to saloobrity these last words were from the annual report of the past year providence has spared our female youth in a remarkable measure ive come with reference to another consideration dr kittredge is there any ketchin complaint goin about in the village well yes said the doctor i should say there was something of that sort measles mumps and sin thats always catching the old doctors eye twinkled once in a while he had his little touch of humor silas peckham slanted his eye up suspiciously at the doctor as if he was getting some kind of advantage over him that is the way people of his constitution are apt to take a bit of pleasantry i dont mean sech things doctor i mean fevers is there any ketchin fevers bilious or nervous or typus or whatever you call em now goin round this village thats what i want to ascertain if theres no impropriety the old doctor looked at silas through his spectacles hard and sour as a green ciderapple he thought to himself no he said i dont know any such cases whats the matter with elsie venner asked silas sharply as if he expected to have him this time a mild feverish attack i should call it in anybody else but she has a peculiar constitution and i never feel so safe about her as i should about most people anything ketchin about it silas asked cunningly no indeed said the doctor catching no what put that into your head mr peckham well doctor the conscientious principal answered i naterally feel a graat responsibility a very gmaaat responsibility for the noomerous and lovely young ladies committed to my charge it has been a question whether one of my assistants should go accordin to request to stop with miss venner for a season nothin restrains my givin my full and free consent to her goin but the fear lest contagious maladies should be introdooced among those lovely female youth i shall abide by your opinion i understan you to say distincly her complaint is not ketchin and urge upon miss darley to fulfil her dooties to a sufferin fellowcreature at any cost to myself and my establishment we shall miss her very much but it is a good cause and she shall go and i shall trust that providence will enable us to spare her without permanent demage to the interests of the institootion saying this the excellent principal departed with his rusty narrowbrimmed hat leaning over as if it had a sixknot breeze abeam and its gunwale so to speak was dipping into his coatcollar he announced the result of his inquiries to helen who had received a brief note in the mean time from a poor relation of elsies mother then at the mansionhouse informing her of the critical situation of elsie and of her urgent desire that helen should be with her she could not hesitate she blushed as she thought of the comments that might be made but what were such considerations in a matter of life and death she could not stop to make terms with silas peckham she must go he might fleece her if he would she would not complain not even to bernard who she knew would bring the principal to terms if she gave the least hint of his intended extortions so helen made up her bundle of clothes to be sent after her took a book or two with her to help her pass the time and departed for the dudley mansion it was with a great inward effort that she undertook the sisterly task which was thus forced upon her she had a kind of terror of elsie and the thought of having charge of her of being alone with her of coming under the full influence of those diamond eyes if indeed their light were not dimmed by suffering and weariness was one she shrank from but what could she do it might be a turningpoint in the life of the poor girl and she must overcome all her fears all her repugnance and go to her rescue is helen come said elsie when she heard with her fine sense quickened by the irritability of sickness a light footfall on the stair with a cadence unlike that of any inmate of the house its a strange womans step said old sophy who with her exclusive love for elsie was naturally disposed to jealousy of a newcomer let ol sophy set at th foot o th bed if th young missis sets by th piller won y darlin the s nobody thats white can love y as th of black woman does don sen her away now there s a dear soul elsie motioned her to sit in the place she had pointed to and helen at that moment entered the room dudley venner followed her she is your patient he said except while the doctor is here she has been longing to have you with her and we shall expect you to make her well in a few days so helen darley found herself established in the most unexpected manner as an inmate of the dudley mansion she sat with elsie most of the time by day and by night soothing her and trying to enter into her confidence and affections if it should prove that this strange creature was really capable of truly sympathetic emotions what was this unexplained something which came between her soul and that of every other human being with whom she was in relations helen perceived or rather felt that she had folded up in the depths of her being a true womanly nature through the cloud that darkened her aspect now and then a ray would steal forth which like the smile of stern and solemn people was all the more impressive from its contrast with the expression she wore habitually it might well be that pain and fatigue had changed her aspect but at any rate helen looked into her eyes without that nervous agitation which their cold glitter had produced on her when they were full of their natural light she felt sure that her mother must have been a lovely gentle woman there were gleams of a beautiful nature shining through some illdefined medium which disturbed and made them flicker and waver as distant images do when seen through the rippling upward currents of heated air she loved in her own way the old black woman and seemed to keep up a kind of silent communication with her as if they did not require the use of speech she appeared to be tranquillized by the presence of helen and loved to have her seated at the bedside yet something whatever it was prevented her from opening her heart to her kind companion and even now there were times when she would lie looking at her with such a still watchful almost dangerous expression that helen would sigh and change her place as persons do whose breath some cunning orator had been sucking out of them with his spongy eloquence so that when he stops they must get some air and stir about or they feel as if they should be half smothered and palsied it was too much to keep guessing what was the meaning of all this helen determined to ask old sophy some questions which might probably throw light upon her doubts she took the opportunity one evening when elsie was lying asleep and they were both sitting at some distance from her bed tell me sophy she said was elsie always as shy as she seems to be now in talking with those to whom she is friendly alway jes so miss darlin ever sense she was little chil when she was five six year old she lisp some call me thophy that make her kin o shamed perhaps after she grow up she never lisp but she kin o got the way o not talkin much fac is she don like talkin as common gals do xcep jes once in a while wi some particlar folks n then not much how old is elsie eighteen year this las september how long ago did her mother die helen asked with a little trembling in her voice eighteen year ago this october said old sophy helen was silent for a moment then she whispered almost inaudibly for her voice appeared to fail her what did her mother die of sophy the old womans small eyes dilated until a ring of white showed round their beady centres she caught helen by the hand and clung to it as if in fear she looked round at elsie who lay sleeping as of she might be listening then she drew helen towards her and led her softly out of the room sh sh she said as soon as they were outside the door don never speak in this house bout what elsies mother died of she said nobody never says nothin bout it oh god has made ugly things wi death in their mouths miss darlin an he knows what theyre for but my poor elsie to have her blood changed in her before it was in july mistress got her death but she liv till three week after my poor elsie was born she could speak no more she had said enough helen remembered the stories she had heard on coming to the village and among them one referred to in an early chapter of this narrative all the unaccountable looks and tastes and ways of elsie came back to her in the light of an antenatal impression which had mingled an alien element in her nature she knew the secret of the fascination which looked out of her cold glittering eyes she knew the significance of the strange repulsion which she felt in her own intimate consciousness underlying the inexplicable attraction which drew her towards the young girl in spite of this repugnance she began to look with new feelings on the contradictions in her moral nature the longing for sympathy as shown by her wishing for helens company and the impossibility of passing beyond the cold circle of isolation within which she had her being the fearful truth of that instinctive feeling of hers that there was something not human looking out of elsies eyes came upon her with a sudden flash of penetrating conviction there were two warring principles in that superb organization and proud soul one made her a woman with all a womans powers and longings the other chilled all the currents of outlet for her emotions it made her tearless and mute when another woman would have wept and pleaded and it infused into her soul something it was cruel now to call it malice which was still and watchful and dangerous which waited its opportunity and then shot like an arrow from its bow out of the coil of brooding premeditation even those who had never seen the white scars on dick venners wrist or heard the halftold story of her supposed attempt to do a graver mischief knew well enough by looking at her that she was one of the creatures not to be tampered with silent in anger and swift in vengeance helen could not return to the bedside at once after this communication it was with altered eyes that she must look on the poor girl the victim of such an unheardof fatality all was explained to her now but it opened such depths of solemn thought in her awakened consciousness that it seemed as if the whole mystery of human life were coming up again before her for trial and judgment oh she thought if while the will lies sealed in its fountain it may be poisoned at its very source so that it shall flow dark and deadly through its whole course who are we that we should judge our fellowcreatures by ourselves then came the terrible question how far the elements themselves are capable of perverting the moral nature if valor and justice and truth the strength of man and the virtue of woman may not be poisoned out of a race by the food of the australian in his forest by the foul air and darkness of the christians cooped up in the tenementhouses close by those who live in the palaces of the great cities she walked out into the garden lost in thought upon these dark and deep matters presently she heard a step behind her and elsies father came up and joined her since his introduction to helen at the distinguished teaparty given by the widow rowens and before her coming to sit with elsie mr dudley venner had in the most accidental way in the world met her on several occasions once after church when she happened to be caught in a slight shower and he insisted on holding his umbrella over her on her way home once at a small party at one of the mansionhouses where the quickeyed lady of the house had a wonderful knack of bringing people together who liked to see each other perhaps at other times and places but of this there is no certain evidence they naturally spoke of elsie her illness and the aspect it had taken but helen noticed in all that dudley venner said about his daughter a morbid sensitiveness as it seemed to her an aversion to saying much about her physical condition or her peculiarities a wish to feel and speak as a parent should and yet a shrinking as if there were something about elsie which he could not bear to dwell upon she thought she saw through all this and she could interpret it all charitably there were circumstances about his daughter which recalled the great sorrow of his life it was not strange that this perpetual reminder should in some degree have modified his feelings as a father but what a life he must have been leading for so many years with this perpetual source of distress which he could not name helen knew well enough now the meaning of the sadness which had left such traces in his features and tones and it made her feel very kindly and compassionate towards him so they walked over the crackling leaves in the garden between the lines of box breathing its fragrance of eternity for this is one of the odors which carry us out of time into the abysses of the unbeginning past if we ever lived on another ball of stone than this it must be that there was box growing on it so they walked finding their way softly to each others sorrows and sympathies each matching some counterpart to the others experience of life and startled to see how the different yet parallel lessons they had been taught by suffering had led them step by step to the same serene acquiescence in the orderings of that supreme wisdom which they both devoutly recognized old sophy was at the window and saw them walking up and down the gardenalleys she watched them as her grandfather the savage watched the figures that moved among the trees when a hostile tribe was lurking about his mountain therell be a weddin in the ol house she said before theres roses on them bushes agin but it won be my poor elsies weddin n ol sophy won be there when helen prayed in the silence of her soul that evening it was not that elsies life might be spared she dared not ask that as a favor of heaven what could life be to her but a perpetual anguish and to those about her but an everpresent terror might she but be so influenced by divine grace that what in her was most truly human most purely womanlike should overcome the dark cold unmentionable instinct which had pervaded her being like a subtile poison that was all she could ask and the rest she left to a higher wisdom and tenderer love than her own chapter xxix the white ash when helen returned to elsies bedside it was with a new and still deeper feeling of sympathy such as the story told by old sophy might well awaken she understood as never before the singular fascination and as singular repulsion which she had long felt in elsies presence it had not been without a great effort that she had forced herself to become the almost constant attendant of the sick girl and now she was learning but not for the first time the blessed truth which so many good women have found out for themselves that the hardest duty bravely performed soon becomes a habit and tends in due time to transform itself into a pleasure the old doctor was beginning to look graver in spite of himself the fever if such it was went gently forward wasting the young girls powers of resistance from day to day yet she showed no disposition to take nourishment and seemed literally to be living on air it was remarkable that with all this her look was almost natural and her features were hardly sharpened so as to suggest that her life was burning away he did not like this nor various other unobtrusive signs of danger which his practised eye detected a very small matter might turn the balance which held life and death poised against each other he surrounded her with precautions that nature might have every opportunity of cunningly shifting the weights from the scale of death to the scale of life as she will often do if not rudely disturbed or interfered with little tokens of goodwill and kind remembrance were constantly coming to her from the girls in the school and the good people in the village some of the mansionhouse people obtained rare flowers which they sent her and her table was covered with fruits which tempted her in vain several of the schoolgirls wished to make her a basket of their own handiwork and filling it with autumnal flowers to send it as a joint offering mr bernard found out their project accidentally and wishing to have his share in it brought home from one of his long walks some boughs full of variously tinted leaves such as were still clinging to the stricken trees with these he brought also some of the already fallen leaflets of the white ash remarkable for their rich olivepurple color forming a beautiful contrast with some of the lighterhued leaves it so happened that this particular tree the white ash did not grow upon the mountain and the leaflets were more welcome for their comparative rarity so the girls made their basket and the floor of it they covered with the rich olivepurple leaflets such late flowers as they could lay their hands upon served to fill it and with many kindly messages they sent it to miss elsie venner at the dudley mansionhouse elsie was sitting up in her bed when it came languid but tranquil and helen was by her as usual holding her hand which was strangely cold helen thought for one who was said to have some kind of fever the schoolgirls basket was brought in with its messages of love and hopes for speedy recovery old sophy was delighted to see that it pleased elsie and laid it on the bed before her elsie began looking at the flowers and taking them from the basket that she might see the leaves all at once she appeared to be agitated she looked at the basket then around as if there were some fearful presence about her which she was searching for with her eager glances she took out the flowers one by one her breathing growing hurried her eyes staring her hands trembling till as she came near the bottom of the basket she flung out all the rest with a hasty movement looked upon the olivepurple leaflets as if paralyzed for a moment shrunk up as it were into herself in a curdling terror dashed the basket from her and fell back senseless with a faint cry which chilled the blood of the startled listeners at her bedside take it away take it away quick said old sophy as she hastened to her mistresss pillow it s the leaves of the tree that was always death to her take it away she cant live wi it in the room the poor old woman began chafing elsies hands and helen to try to rouse her with hartshorn while a third frightened attendant gathered up the flowers and the basket and carried them out of the apartment she came to herself after a time but exhausted and then wandering in her delirium she talked constantly as if she were in a cave with such exactness of circumstance that helen could not doubt at all that she had some such retreat among the rocks of the mountain probably fitted up in her own fantastic way where she sometimes hid herself from all human eyes and of the entrance to which she alone possessed the secret all this passed away and left her of course weaker than before but this was not the only influence the unexplained paroxysm had left behind it from this time forward there was a change in her whole expression and her manner the shadows ceased flitting over her features and the old woman who watched her from day to day and from hour to hour as a mother watches her child saw the likeness she bore to her mother coming forth more and more as the cold glitter died out of the diamond eyes and the stormy scowl disappeared from the dark brows and low forehead with all the kindness and indulgence her father had bestowed upon her elsie had never felt that he loved her the reader knows well enough what fatal recollections and associations had frozen up the springs of natural affection in his breast there was nothing in the world he would not do for elsie he had sacrificed his whole life to her his very seeming carelessness about restraining her was all calculated he knew that restraint would produce nothing but utter alienation just so far as she allowed him he shared her studies her few pleasures her thoughts but she was essentially solitary and uncommunicative no person as was said long ago could judge him because his task was not merely difficult but simply impracticable to human powers a nature like elsies had necessarily to be studied by itself and to be followed in its laws where it could not be led every day at different hours during the whole of his daughters illness dudley venner had sat by her doing all he could to soothe and please her always the same thin film of some emotional nonconductor between them always that kind of habitual regard and familyinterest mingled with the deepest pity on one side and a sort of respect on the other which never warmed into outward evidences of affection it was after this occasion when she had been so profoundly agitated by a seemingly insignificant cause that her father and old sophy were sitting one at one side of her bed and one at the other she had fallen into a light slumber as they were looking at her the same thought came into both their minds at the same moment old sophy spoke for both as she said in a low voice it s her mothers look it s her mothers own face right over again she never look so before the lords hand is on her his will be done when elsie woke and lifted her languid eyes upon her fathers face she saw in it a tenderness a depth of affection such as she remembered at rare moments of her childhood when she had won him to her by some unusual gleam of sunshine in her fitful temper elsie dear he said we were thinking how much your expression was sometimes like that of your sweet mother if you could but have seen her so as to remember her the tender look and tone the yearning of the daughters heart for the mother she had never seen save only with the unfixed undistinguishing eyes of earliest infancy perhaps the underthought that she might soon rejoin her in another state of being all came upon her with a sudden overflow of feeling which broke through all the barriers between her heart and her eyes and elsie wept it seemed to her father as if the malign influence evil spirit it might almost be called which had pervaded her being had at last been driven forth or exorcised and that these tears were at once the sign and the pledge of her redeemed nature but now she was to be soothed and not excited after her tears she slept again and the look her face wore was peaceful as never before old sophy met the doctor at the door and told him all the circumstances connected with the extraordinary attack from which elsie had suffered it was the purple leaves she said she remembered that dick once brought home a branch of a tree with some of the same leaves on it and elsie screamed and almost fainted then she sophy had asked her after she had got quiet what it was in the leaves that made her feel so bad elsie could nt tell her did nt like to speak about it shuddered whenever sophy mentioned it this did not sound so strangely to the old doctor as it does to some who listen to his narrative he had known some curious examples of antipathies and remembered reading of others still more singular he had known those who could not bear the presence of a cat and recollected the story often told of a persons hiding one in a chest when one of these sensitive individuals came into the room so as not to disturb him but he presently began to sweat and turn pale and cried out that there must be a cat hid somewhere he knew people who were poisoned by strawberries by honey by different meats many who could not endure cheese some who could not bear the smell of roses if he had known all the stories in the old books he would have found that some have swooned and become as dead men at the smell of a rose that a stout soldier has been known to turn and run at the sight or smell of rue that cassia and even oliveoil have produced deadly faintings in certain individuals in short that almost everything has seemed to be a poison to somebody bring me that basket sophy said the old doctor if you can find it sophy brought it to him for he had not yet entered elsies apartment these purple leaves are from the white ash he said you dont know the notion that people commonly have about that tree sophy i know they say the ugly things never go where the white ash grows sophy answered oh doctor dear what im thinkin of ant true is it the doctor smiled sadly but did not answer he went directly to elsies room nobody would have known by his manner that he saw any special change in his patient he spoke with her as usual made some slight alteration in his prescriptions and left the room with a kind cheerful look he met her father on the stairs is it as i thought said dudley veneer there is everything to fear the doctor said and not much i am afraid to hope does not her face recall to you one that you remember as never before yes her father answered oh yes what is the meaning of this change which has come over her features and her voice her temper her whole being tell me oh tell me what is it can it be that the curse is passing away and my daughter is to be restored to me such as her mother would have had her such as her mother was walk out with me into the garden the doctor said and i will tell you all i know and all i think about this great mystery of elsies life they walked out together and the doctor began she has lived a double being as it were the consequence of the blight which fell upon her in the dim period before consciousness you can see what she might have been but for this you know that for these eighteen years her whole existence has taken its character from that influence which we need not name but you will remember that few of the lower forms of life last as human beings do and thus it might have been hoped and trusted with some show of reason as i have always suspected you hoped and trusted perhaps more confidently than myself that the lower nature which had become engrafted on the higher would die out and leave the real womans life she inherited to outlive this accidental principle which had so poisoned her childhood and youth i believe it is so dying out but i am afraid yes i must say it i fear it has involved the centres of life in its own decay there is hardly any pulse at elsies wrist no stimulants seem to rouse her and it looks as if life were slowly retreating inwards so that byandby she will sleep as those who lie down in the cold and never wake strange as it may seem her father heard all this not without deep sorrow and such marks of it as his thoughtful and tranquil nature long schooled by suffering claimed or permitted but with a resignation itself the measure of his past trials dear as his daughter might become to him all he dared to ask of heaven was that she might be restored to that truer self which lay beneath her false and adventitious being if he could once see that the icy lustre in her eyes had become a soft calm light that her soul was at peace with all about her and with him above this crumb from the childrens table was enough for him as it was for the syrophoenician woman who asked that the dark spirit might go out from her daughter there was little change the next day until all at once she said in a clear voice that she should like to see her master at the school mr langdon he came accordingly and took the place of helen at her bedside it seemed as if elsie had forgotten the last scene with him might it be that pride had come in and she had sent for him only to show how superior she had grown to the weakness which had betrayed her into that extraordinary request so contrary to the instincts and usages of her sex or was it that the singular change which had come over her had involved her passionate fancy for him and swept it away with her other habits of thought and feeling or could it be that she felt that all earthly interests were becoming of little account to her and wished to place herself right with one to whom she had displayed a wayward movement of her unbalanced imagination she welcomed mr bernard as quietly as she had received helen darley he colored at the recollection of that last scene when he came into her presence but she smiled with perfect tranquillity she did not speak to him of any apprehension but he saw that she looked upon herself as doomed so friendly yet so calm did she seem through all their interview that mr bernard could only look back upon her manifestation of feeling towards him on their walk from the school as a vagary of a mind laboring under some unnatural excitement and wholly at variance with the true character of elsie venner as he saw her before him in her subdued yet singular beauty he looked with almost scientific closeness of observation into the diamond eyes but that peculiar light which he knew so well was not there she was the same in one sense as on that first day when he had seen her coiling and uncoiling her golden chain yet how different in every aspect which revealed her state of mind and emotion something of tenderness there was perhaps in her tone towards him she would not have sent for him had she not felt more than an ordinary interest in him but through the whole of his visit she never lost her gracious selfpossession the dudley race might well be proud of the last of its daughters as she lay dying but unconquered by the feeling of the present or the fear of the future as for mr bernard he found it very hard to look upon her and listen to her unmoved there was nothing that reminded him of the stormy browed almost savage girl he remembered in her fierce loveliness nothing of all her singularities of air and of costume nothing yes one thing weak and suffering as she was she had never parted with one particular ornament such as a sick person would naturally as it might be supposed get rid of at once the golden cord which she wore round her neck at the great party was still there a bracelet was lying by her pillow she had unclasped it from her wrist before mr bernard left her she said i shall never see you again some time or other perhaps you will mention my name to one whom you love give her this from your scholar and friend elsie he took the bracelet raised her hand to his lips then turned his face away in that moment he was the weaker of the two goodbye she said thank you for coming his voice died away in his throat as he tried to answer her she followed him with her eyes as he passed from her sight through the door and when it closed after him sobbed tremulously once or twice but stilled herself and met helen as she entered with a composed countenance i have had a very pleasant visit from mr langdon elsie said sit by me helen awhile without speaking i should like to sleep if i can and to dream chapter xxx the golden cord is loosed the reverend chauncy fairweather hearing that his parishioners daughter elsie was very ill could do nothing less than come to the mansionhouse and tender such consolations as he was master of it was rather remarkable that the old doctor did not exactly approve of his visit he thought that company of every sort might be injurious in her weak state he was of opinion that mr fairweather though greatly interested in religious matters was not the most sympathetic person that could be found in fact the old doctor thought he was too much taken up with his own interests for eternity to give himself quite so heartily to the need of other people as some persons got up on a rather more generous scale our good neighbor dr honeywood for instance could do however all these things had better be arranged to suit her wants if she would like to talk with a clergyman she had a great deal better see one as often as she liked and run the risk of the excitement than have a hidden wish for such a visit and perhaps find herself too weak to see him byandby the old doctor knew by sad experience that dreadful mistake against which all medical practitioners should be warned his experience may well be a guide for others do not overlook the desire for spiritual advice and consolation which patients sometimes feel and with the frightful mauvaise honte peculiar to protestantism alone among all human beliefs are ashamed to tell as a part of medical treatment it is the physicians business to detect the hidden longing for the food of the soul as much as for any form of bodily nourishment especially in the higher walks of society where this unutterably miserable false shame of protestantism acts in proportion to the general acuteness of the cultivated sensibilities let no unwillingness to suggest the sick persons real need suffer him to languish between his want and his morbid sensitiveness what an infinite advantage the mussulmans and the catholics have over many of our more exclusively spiritual sects in the way they keep their religion always by them and never blush for it and besides this spiritual longing we should never forget that on some fond breast the parting soul relies and the minister of religion in addition to the sympathetic nature which we have a right to demand in him has trained himself to the art of entering into the feelings of others the reader must pardon this digression which introduces the visit of the reverend chauncy fairweather to elsie veneer it was mentioned to her that he would like to call and see how she was and she consented not with much apparent interest for she had reasons of her own for not feeling any very deep conviction of his sympathy for persons in sorrow but he came and worked the conversation round to religion and confused her with his hybrid notions half made up of what he had been believing and teaching all his life and half of the new doctrines which he had veneered upon the surface of his old belief he got so far as to make a prayer with her a cool wellguarded prayer which compromised his faith as little as possible and which if devotion were a game played against providence might have been considered a cautious and sagacious move when he had gone elsie called old sophy to her sophy she said dont let them send that cold hearted man to me any more if your old minister comes to see you i should like to hear him talk he looks as if he cared for everybody and would care for me and sophy if i should die one of these days i should like to have that old minister come and say whatever is to be said over me it would comfort dudley more i know than to have that hard man here when youre in trouble for some of you will be sorry when im gone wont you sophy the poor old black woman could not stand this question the cold minister had frozen elsie until she felt as if nobody cared for her or would regret her and her question had betrayed this momentary feeling don talk so don talk so darlin she cried passionately when you go ol sophyll go n where you go ol sophyll go n well both go t th place where th lord takes care of all his children whether their faces are white or black oh darlin darlin if th lord should let me die firs you shall fin all ready for you when you come after me ony don go n leave poor ol sophy all lone in th world helen came in at this moment and quieted the old woman with a look such scenes were just what were most dangerous in the state in which elsie was lying but that is one of the ways in which an affectionate friend sometimes unconsciously wears out the life which a hired nurse thinking of nothing but her regular duties and her wages would have spared from all emotional fatigue the change which had come over elsies disposition was itself the cause of new excitements how was it possible that her father could keep away from her now that she was coming back to the nature and the very look of her mother the bride of his youth how was it possible to refuse her when she said to old sophy that she should like to have her minister come in and sit by her even though his presence might perhaps prove a new source of excitement but the reverend doctor did come and sit by her and spoke such soothing words to her words of such peace and consolation that from that hour she was tranquil as never before all true hearts are alike in the hour of need the catholic has a reserved fund of faith for his fellowcreatures trying moment and the calvinist reveals those springs of human brotherhood and charity in his soul which are only covered over by the iron tables inscribed with the harder dogmas of his creed it was enough that the reverend doctor knew all elsies history he could not judge her by any formula like those which have been moulded by past ages out of their ignorance he did not talk with her as if she were an outside sinner worse than himself he found a bruised and languishing soul and bound up its wounds a blessed office one which is confined to no sect or creed but which good men in all times under various names and with varying ministries to suit the need of each age of each race of each individual soul have come forward to discharge for their suffering fellowcreatures after this there was little change in elsie except that her heart beat more feebly every day so that the old doctor himself with all his experience could see nothing to account for the gradual failing of the powers of life and yet could find no remedy which seemed to arrest its progress in the smallest degree be very careful he said that she is not allowed to make any muscular exertion any such effort when a person is so enfeebled may stop the heart in a moment and if it stops it will never move again helen enforced this rule with the greatest care elsie was hardly allowed to move her hand or to speak above a whisper it seemed to be mainly the question now whether this trembling flame of life would be blown out by some light breath of air or whether it could be so nursed and sheltered by the hollow of these watchful hands that it would have a chance to kindle to its natural brightness her father came in to sit with her in the evening he had never talked so freely with her as during the hour he had passed at her bedside telling her little circumstances of her mothers life living over with her all that was pleasant in the past and trying to encourage her with some cheerful gleams of hope for the future a faint smile played over her face but she did not answer his encouraging suggestions the hour came for him to leave her with those who watched by her goodnight my dear child he said and stooping down kissed her cheek elsie rose by a sudden effort threw her arms round his neck kissed him and said goodnight my dear father the suddenness of her movement had taken him by surprise or he would have checked so dangerous an effort it was too late now her arms slid away from him like lifeless weights her head fell back upon her pillow along sigh breathed through her lips she is faint said helen doubtfully bring me the hartshorn sophy the old woman had started from her place and was now leaning over her looking in her face and listening for the sound of her breathing she s dead elsie s dead my darlin s dead she cried aloud filling the room with her utterance of anguish dudley venner drew her away and silenced her with a voice of authority while helen and an assistant plied their restoratives it was all in vain the solemn tidings passed from the chamber of death through the family the daughter the hope of that old and honored house was dead in the freshness of her youth and the home of its solitary representative was hereafter doubly desolate a messenger rode hastily out of the avenue a little after this the people of the village and the outlying farmhouses were startled by the sound of a bell one two three four they stopped in every house as far as the wavering vibrations reached and listened five six seven it was not the little child which had been lying so long at the point of death that could not be more than three or four years old eight nine ten and so on to fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen the pulsations seemed to keep on but it was the brain and not the bell that was throbbing now elsie s dead was the exclamation at a hundred firesides eighteen year old said old widow peake rising from her chair eighteen year ago i laid two gold eagles on her mothers eyes he wouldnt have anything but gold touch her eyelids and now elsies to be straightened the lord have mercy on her poor sinful soul dudley venner prayed that night that he might be forgiven if he had failed in any act of duty or kindness to this unfortunate child of his now freed from all the woes born with her and so long poisoning her soul he thanked god for the brief interval of peace which had been granted her for the sweet communion they had enjoyed in these last days and for the hope of meeting her with that other lost friend in a better world helen mingled a few broken thanks and petitions with her tears thanks that she had been permitted to share the last days and hours of this poor sister in sorrow petitions that the grief of bereavement might be lightened to the lonely parent and the faithful old servant old sophy said almost nothing but sat day and night by her dead darling but sometimes her anguish would find an outlet in strange sounds something between a cry and a musical note such as noise had ever heard her utter before these were old remembrances surging up from her childish days coming through her mother from the cannibal chief her grandfather deathwails such as they sing in the mountains of western africa when they see the fires on distant hillsides and know that their own wives and children are undergoing the fate of captives the time came when elsie was to be laid by her mother in the small square marked by the white stone it was not unwillingly that the reverend chauncy fairweather had relinquished the duty of conducting the service to the reverend doctor honeywood in accordance with elsies request he could not by any reasoning reconcile his present way of thinking with a hope for the future of his unfortunate parishioner any good old roman catholic priest born and bred to his faith and his business would have found a loophole into some kind of heaven for her by virtue of his doctrine of invincible ignorance or other special proviso but a recent convert cannot enter into the working conditions of his new creed beliefs must be lived in for a good while before they accommodate themselves to the souls wants and wear loose enough to be comfortable the reverend doctor had no such scruples like thousands of those who are classed nominally with the despairing believers he had never prayed over a departed brother or sister without feeling and expressing a guarded hope that there was mercy in store for the poor sinner whom parents wives children brothers and sisters could not bear to give up to utter ruin without a word and would not as he knew full well in virtue of that human love and sympathy which nothing can ever extinguish and in this poor elsies history he could read nothing which the tears of the recording angel might not wash away as the good physician of the place knew the diseases that assailed the bodies of men and women so he had learned the mysteries of the sickness of the soul so many wished to look upon elsies face once more that her father would not deny them nay he was pleased that those who remembered her living should see her in the still beauty of death helen and those with her arrayed her for this farewellview all was ready for the sad or curious eyes which were to look upon her there was no painful change to be concealed by any artifice even her round neck was left uncovered that she might be more like one who slept only the golden cord was left in its place some searching eye might detect a trace of that birthmark which it was whispered she had always worn a necklace to conceal at the last moment when all the preparations were completed old sophy stooped over her and with trembling hand loosed the golden cord she looked intently for some little space there was no shade nor blemish where the ring of gold had encircled her throat she took it gently away and laid it in the casket which held her ornaments the lord be praised the old woman cried aloud he has taken away the mark that was on her shes fit to meet his holy angels now so elsie lay for hours in the great room in a kind of state with flowers all about her her black hair braided as in life her brows smooth as if they had never known the scowl of passion and on her lips the faint smile with which she had uttered her last good night the young girls from the school looked at her one after another and passed on sobbing carrying in their hearts the picture that would be with them all their days the great people of the place were all there with their silent sympathy the lesser kind of gentry and many of the plainer folk of the village halfpleased to find themselves passing beneath the stately portico of the ancient mansionhouse crowded in until the ample rooms were overflowing all the friends whose acquaintance we have made were there and many from remoter villages and towns there was a deep silence at last the hour had come for the parting words to be spoken over the dead the good old ministers voice rose out of the stillness subdued and tremulous at first but growing firmer and clearer as he went on until it reached the ears of the visitors who were in the far desolate chambers looking at the pictured hangings and the old dusty portraits he did not tell her story in his prayer he only spoke of our dear departed sister as one of many whom providence in its wisdom has seen fit to bring under bondage from their cradles it was not for us to judge them by any standard of our own he who made the heart alone knew the infirmities it inherited or acquired for all that our dear sister had presented that was interesting and attractive in her character we were to be grateful for whatever was dark or inexplicable we must trust that the deep shadow which rested on the twilight dawn of her being might render a reason before the bar of omniscience for the grace which had lightened her last days we should pour out our hearts in thankful acknowledgment from the life and the death of this our dear sister we should learn a lesson of patience with our fellowcreatures in their inborn peculiarities of charity in judging what seem to us wilful faults of character of hope and trust that by sickness or affliction or such inevitable discipline as life must always bring with it if by no gentler means the soul which had been left by nature to wander into the path of error and of suffering might be reclaimed and restored to its true aim and so led on by divine grace to its eternal welfare he closed his prayer by commending each member of the afflicted family to the divine blessing then all at once rose the clear sound of the girls voices in the sweet sad melody of a funeral hymn one of those which elsie had marked as if prophetically among her own favorites and so they laid her in the earth and showered down flowers upon her and filled her grave and covered it with green sods by the side of it was another oblong ridge with a white stone standing at its head mr bernard looked upon it as he came close to the place where elsie was laid and read the inscription catalina wife to dudley venner died october th aged xx years a gentle rain fell on the turf after it was laid this was the beginning of a long and dreary autumnal storm a deferred equinoctial as many considered it the mountain streams were all swollen and turbulent and the steep declivities were furrowed in every direction by new channels it made the house seem doubly desolate to hear the wind howling and the rain beating upon the roofs the poor relation who was staying at the house would insist on helens remaining a few days old sophy was in such a condition that it kept her in continual anxiety and there were many cares which helen could take off from her the old black womans life was buried in her darlings grave she did nothing but moan and lament for her at night she was restless and would get up and wander to elsies apartment and look for her and call her by name at other times she would lie awake and listen to the wind and the rain sometimes with such a wild look upon her face and with such sudden starts and exclamations that it seemed as if she heard spiritvoices and were answering the whispers of unseen visitants with all this were mingled hints of her old superstition forebodings of something fearful about to happen perhaps the great final catastrophe of all things according to the prediction current in the kitchens of rockland hark old sophy would say don you hear th crackin n th snappin up in th mountain n th rollin o th big stones the s somethin stirrin among th rocks i hear th soun of it in th night when th wind has stopped blowin oh stay by me a little while miss darlin stay by me for its th las day maybe thats close on us n i feel as if i could n meet th lord all alone it was curious but helen did certainly recognize sounds during the lull of the storm which were not of falling rain or running streams short snapping sounds as of tense cords breaking long uneven sounds as of masses rolling down steep declivities but the morning came as usual and as the others said nothing of these singular noises helen did not think it necessary to speak of them all day long she and the humble relative of elsies mother who had appeared as poor relations are wont to in the great prises of life were busy in arranging the disordered house and looking over the various objects which elsies singular tastes had brought together to dispose of them as her father might direct they all met together at the usual hour for tea one of the servants came in looking very blank and said to the poor relation the well is gone dry we have nothing but rainwater dudley venners countenance changed he sprang to his feet and went to assure himself of the fact and if he could of the reason of it for a well to dry up during such a rainstorm was extraordinary it was ominous he came back looking very anxious did any of you notice any remarkable sounds last night he said or this morning hark do you hear anything now they listened in perfect silence for a few moments then there came a short cracking sound and two or three snaps as of parting cords dudley venner called all his household together we are in danger here as i think tonight he said not very great danger perhaps but it is a risk i do not wish you to run these heavy rains have loosed some of the rocks above and they may come down and endanger the house harness the horses elbridge and take all the family away miss darley will go to the institute the others will pass the night at the mountain house i shall stay here myself it is not at all likely that anything will come of these warnings but if there should i choose to be there and take my chance it needs little generally to frighten servants and they were all ready enough to go the poor relation was one of the timid sort and was terribly uneasy to be got out of the house this left no alternative of course for helen but to go also they all urged upon dudley veneer to go with them if there was danger why should he remain to risk it when he sent away the others old sophy said nothing until the time came for her to go with the second of elbridges carriageloads come sophy said dudley veneer get your things and go they will take good care of you at the mountain house and when we have made sure that there is no real danger you shall come back at once no masse sophy answered ive seen elsie into th ground n i ant goin away to come back n fin masse veneer buried under th rocks my darlin s gone n now if masse goes n th of place goes its time for ol sophy to go too no masse veneer well both stay in th of mansion n wait for th lord nothing could change the old womans determination and her master who only feared but did not really expect the longdeferred catastrophe was obliged to consent to her staying the sudden drying of the well at such a time was the most alarming sign for he remembered that the same thing had been observed just before great mountainslides this long rain too was just the kind of cause which was likely to loosen the strata of rock piled up in the ledges if the dreaded event should ever come to pass it would be at such a time he paced his chamber uneasily until long past midnight if the morning came without accident he meant to have a careful examination made of all the rents and fissures above of their direction and extent and especially whether in case of a mountainslide the huge masses would be like to reach so far to the east and so low down the declivity as the mansion at two oclock in the morning he was dozing in his chair old sophy had lain down on her bed and was muttering in troubled dreams all at once a loud crash seemed to rend the very heavens above them a crack as of the thunder that follows close upon the bolt a rending and crashing as of a forest snapped through all its stems torn twisted splintered dragged with all its ragged boughs into one chaotic ruin the ground trembled under them as in an earthquake the old mansion shuddered so that all its windows chattered in their casements the great chimney shook off its heavy capstones which came down on the roof with resounding concussions and the echoes of the mountain roared and bellowed in long reduplication as if its whole foundations were rent and this were the terrible voice of its dissolution dudley venner rose from his chair folded his arms and awaited his fate there was no knowing where to look for safety and he remembered too well the story of the family that was lost by rushing out of the house and so hurrying into the very jaws of death he had stood thus but for a moment when he heard the voice of old sophy in a wild cry of terror its th las day its th las day the lord is comin to take us all sophy he called but she did not hear him or heed him and rushed out of the house the worst danger was over if they were to be destroyed it would necessarily be in a few seconds from the first thrill of the terrible convulsion he waited in awful suspense but calm not more than one or two minutes could have passed before the frightful tumult and all its sounding echoes had ceased he called old sophy but she did not answer he went to the western window and looked forth into the darkness he could not distinguish the outlines of the landscape but the white stone was clearly visible and by its side the newmade mound nay what was that which obscured its outline in shape like a human figure he flung open the window and sprang through it was all that there was left of poor old sophy stretched out lifeless upon her darlings grave he had scarcely composed her limbs and drawn the sheet over her when the neighbors began to arrive from all directions each was expecting to hear of houses overwhelmed and families destroyed but each came with the story that his own household was safe it was not until the morning dawned that the true nature and extent of the sudden movement was ascertained a great seam had opened above the long cliff and the terrible rattlesnake ledge with all its envenomed reptiles its dark fissures and black caverns was buried forever beneath a mighty incumbent mass of ruin chapter xxxi mr silas peckham renders his account the morning rose clear and bright the long storm was over and the calm autumnal sunshine was now to return with all its infinite repose and sweetness with the earliest dawn exploring parties were out in every direction along the southern slope of the mountain tracing the ravages of the great slide and the track it had followed it proved to be not so much a slide as the breaking off and falling of a vast line of cliff including the dreaded ledge it had folded over like the leaves of a halfopened book when they close crushing the trees below piling its ruins in a glacis at the foot of what had been the overhanging wall of the cliff and filling up that deep cavity above the mansionhouse which bore the illomened name of dead mans hollow this it was which had saved the dudley mansion the falling masses or huge fragments breaking off from them would have swept the house and all around it to destruction but for this deep shelving dell into which the stream of ruin was happily directed it was indeed one of natures conservative revolutions for the fallen masses made a kind oz shelf which interposed a level break between the inclined planes above and below it so that the nightmarefancies of the dwellers in the dudley mansion and in many other residences under the shadow of the mountain need not keep them lying awake hereafter to listen for the snapping of roots and the splitting of the rocks above them twentyfour hours after the falling of the cliff it seemed as if it had happened ages ago the new fact had fitted itself in with all the old predictions forebodings fears and acquired the solidarity belonging to all events which have slipped out of the fingers of time and dissolved in the antecedent eternity old sophy was lying dead in the dudley mansion if there were tears shed for her they could not be bitter ones for she had lived out her full measure of days and gone who could help fondly believing it to rejoin her beloved mistress they made a place for her at the foot of the two mounds it was thus she would have chosen to sleep and not to have wronged her humble devotion in life by asking to lie at the side of those whom she had served so long and faithfully there were very few present at the simple ceremony helen darley was one of these few the old black woman had been her companion in all the kind offices of which she had been the ministering angel to elsie after it was all over helen was leaving with the rest when dudley veneer begged her to stay a little and he would send her back it was a long walk besides he wished to say some things to her which he had not had the opportunity of speaking of course helen could not refuse him there must be many thoughts coming into his mind which he would wish to share with her who had known his daughter so long and been with filer in her last days she returned into the great parlor with the wrought cornices and the medallionportraits on the ceiling i am now alone in the world dudley veneer said helen must have known that before he spoke but the tone in which he said it had so much meaning that she could not find a word to answer him with they sat in silence which the old tall clock counted out in long seconds but it was silence which meant more than any words they had ever spoken alone in the world helen the freshness of my life is gone and there is little left of the few graces which in my younger days might have fitted me to win the love of women listen to me kindly if you can forgive me at least half my life has been passed in constant fear and anguish without any near friend to share my trials my task is done now my fears have ceased to prey upon me the sharpness of early sorrows has yielded something of its edge to time you have bound me to you by gratitude in the tender care you have taken of my poor child more than this i must tell you all now out of the depth of this trouble through which i am passing i have loved you from the moment we first met and if my life has anything left worth accepting it is yours will you take the offered gift helen looked in his face surprised bewildered this is not for me not for me she said i am but a poor faded flower not worth the gathering of such a one as you no no i have been bred to humble toil all my days and i could not be to you what you ought to ask i am accustomed to a kind of loneliness and selfdependence i have seen nothing almost of the world such as you were born to move in leave me to my obscure place and duties i shall at least have peace and you you will surely find in due time some one better fitted by nature and training to make you happy no miss darley dudley venner said almost sternly you must not speak to a man who has lived through my experiences of looking about for a new choice after his heart has once chosen say that you can never love me say that i have lived too long to share your young life say that sorrow has left nothing in me for love to find his pleasure in but do not mock me with the hope of a new affection for some unknown object the first look of yours brought me to your side the first tone of your voice sunk into my heart from this moment my life must wither out or bloom anew my home is desolate come under my roof and make it bright once more share my life with me or i shall give the halls of the old mansion to the bats and the owls and wander forth alone without a hope or a friend to find herself with a mans future at the disposal of a single word of hers a man like this too with a fascination for her against which she had tried to shut her heart feeling that he lived in another sphere than hers working as she was for her bread a poor operative in the factory of a hard master and jealous overseer the salaried drudge of mr silas peckham why she had thought he was grateful to her as a friend of his daughter she had even pleased herself with the feeling that he liked her in her humble place as a woman of some cultivation and many sympathetic points of relation with himself but that he loved her that this deep fine nature in a man so far removed from her in outward circumstance should have found its counterpart in one whom life had treated so coldly as herself that dudley venner should stake his happiness on a breath of hers poor helen darleys it was all a surprise a confusion a kind of fear not wholly fearful ah me women know what it is that mist over the eyes that trembling in the limbs that faltering of the voice that sweet shamefaced unspoken confession of weakness which does not wish to be strong that sudden overflow in the soul where thoughts loose their hold on each other and swim single and helpless in the flood of emotion women know what it is no doubt she was a little frightened and a good deal bewildered and that her sympathies were warmly excited for a friend to whom she had been brought so near and whose loneliness she saw and pitied she lost that calm selfpossession she had hoped to maintain if i thought that i could make you happy if i should speak from my heart and not my reason i am but a weak woman yet if i can be to you what can i say what more could this poor dear helen say elbridge harness the horses and take miss darley back to the school what conversation had taken place since helens rhetorical failure is not recorded in the minutes from which this narrative is constructed but when the man who had been summoned had gone to get the carriage ready helen resumed something she had been speaking of not for the world everything must go on just as it has gone on for the present there are proprieties to be consulted i cannot be hard with you that out of your very affliction has sprung this this well you must name it for me but the world will never listen to explanations i am to be helen darley lady assistant in mr silas peckhams school as long as i see fit to hold my office and i mean to attend to my scholars just as before so that i shall have very little time for visiting or seeing company i believe though you are one of the trustees and a member of the examining committee so that if you should happen to visit the school i shall try to be civil to you every lady sees of course that helen was quite right but perhaps here and there one will think that dudley venner was all wrong that he was too hasty that he should have been too full of his recent grief for such a confession as he has just made and the passion from which it sprung perhaps they do not understand the sudden recoil of a strong nature long compressed perhaps they have not studied the mystery of allotropism in the emotions of the human heart go to the nearest chemist and ask him to show you some of the darkred phosphorus which will not burn without fierce heating but at deg fahrenheit changes back again to the inflammable substance we know so well grief seems more like ashes than like fire but as grief has been love once so it may become love again this is emotional allotropism helen rode back to the institute and inquired for mr peckham she had not seen him during the brief interval between her departure from the mansionhouse and her return to old sophys funeral there were various questions about the school she wished to ask oh hows your haalth miss darley silas began weve missed you considable glad to see you back at the post of dooty hope the squire treated you hahnsomely liberal pecooniary compensation hey ant much of a loser i guess by acceptin his propositions helen blushed at this last question as if silas had meant something by it beyond asking what money she had received but his own doublemeaning expression and her blush were too nice points for him to have taken cognizance of he was engaged in a mental calculation as to the amount of the deduction he should make under the head of demage to the institootion this depending somewhat on that of the pecooniary compensation she might have received for her services as the friend of elsie venner so helen slid back at once into her routine the same faithful patient creature she had always been but what was this new light which seemed to have kindled in her eyes what was this look of peace which nothing could disturb which smiled serenely through all the little meannesses with which the daily life of the educational factory surrounded her which not only made her seem resigned but overflowed all her features with a thoughtful subdued happiness mr bernard did not know perhaps he did not guess the inmates of the dudley mansion were not scandalized by any mysterious visits of a veiled or unveiled lady the vibrating tongues of the female youth of the institute were not set in motion by the standing of an equipage at the gate waiting for their ladyteacher the servants at the mansion did not convey numerous letters with superscriptions in a bold manly hand sealed with the arms of a wellknown house and directed to miss helen darley nor on the other hand did hiram the man from the lean streak in new hampshire carry sweetsmelling rosehued manylayered crisscrossed finestitchlettered packages of notepaper directed to dudley venner esq and all too scanty to hold that incredible expansion of the famous three words which a woman was born to say that perpetual miracle which astonishes all the gobetweens who wear their shoes out in carrying a womans infinite variations on the theme i love you but the reader must remember that there are walks in countrytowns where people are liable to meet by accident and that the hollow of an old tree has served the purpose of a postoffice sometimes so that he has her choice to divide the pronouns impartially of various hypotheses to account for the new glory of happiness which seemed to have irradiated our poor helens features as if her dreary life were awakening in the dawn of a blessed future with all the alleviations which have been hinted at mr dudley venner thought that the days and the weeks had never moved so slowly as through the last period of the autumn that was passing elsie had been a perpetual source of anxiety to him but still she had been a companion he could not mourn for her for he felt that she was safer with her mother in that world where there are no more sorrows and dangers than she could have been with him but as he sat at his window and looked at the three mounds the loneliness of the great house made it seem more like the sepulchre than these narrow dwellings where his beloved and her daughter lay close to each other side by side catalina the bride of his youth and elsie the child whom he had nurtured with poor old sophy who had followed them like a black shadow at their feet under the same soft turf sprinkled with the brown autumnal leaves it was not good for him to be thus alone how should he ever live through the long months of november and december the months of november and december did in some way or other get rid of themselves at last bringing with them the usual events of villagelife and a few unusual ones some of the geologists had been up to look at the great slide of which they gave those prolix accounts which everybody remembers who read the scientific journals of the time the engineers reported that there was little probability of any further convulsion along the line of rocks which overhung the more thickly settled part of the town the naturalists drew up a paper on the probable extinction of the crotalus durissus in the township of rockland the engagement of the widow rowens to a little millionville merchant was announced sudding n onexpected widow leech said waalthy or she wouldnt ha looked at him fifty year old if he is a day n hunt got a white hair in his head the reverend chauncy fairweather had publicly announced that he was going to join the roman catholic communion not so much to the surprise or consternation of the religious world as he had supposed several old ladies forthwith proclaimed their intention of following him but as one or two of them were deaf and another had been threatened with an attack of that mild but obstinate complaint dementia senilis many thought it was not so much the force of his arguments as a kind of tendency to jump as the bellwether jumps well known in flocks not included in the christian fold his bereaved congregation immediately began pulling candidates on and off like new boots on trial some pinched in tender places some were too loose some were too squaretoed some were too coarse and did nt please some were too thin and would nt last in short they could nt possibly find a fit at last people began to drop in to hear old doctor honeywood they were quite surprised to find what a human old gentleman he was and went back and told the others that instead of being a case of confluent sectarianism as they supposed the good old minister had been so well vaccinated with charitable virus that he was now a true opensouled christian of the mildest type the end of all which was that the liberal people went over to the old minister almost in a body just at the time that deacon shearer and the vinegarbible party split off and that not long afterwards they sold their own meetinghouse to the malecontents so that deacon soper used often to remind colonel sprowle of his wish that our little man and him the reverend doctor would swop pulpits and tell him it had pooty nigh come trew but this is anticipating the course of events which were much longer in coming about for we have but just got through that terrible long month as mr dudley venner found it of december on the first of january mr silas peckham was in the habit of settling his quarterly accounts and making such new arrangements as his convenience or interest dictated new year was a holiday at the institute no doubt this accounted for helens being dressed so charmingly always to be sure in her own simple way but yet with such a true ladys air that she looked fit to be the mistress of any mansion in the land she was in the parlor alone a little before noon when mr peckham came in im ready to settle my accaount with you now miss darley said silas as you please mr peckham helen answered very graciously before payin you your selary the principal continued i wish to come to an understandin as to the futur i consider that ive been payin high very high for the work you do womens wages cant be expected to do more than feed and clothe em as a gineral thing with a little savin in case of sickness and to bury em if they break daown as all of em are liable to do at any time if i ant misinformed you not only support yourself out of my establishment but likewise relatives of yours who i dont know that im called upon to feed and clothe there is a young woman not burdened with destitute relatives has signified that she would be glad to take your dooties for less pecooniary compensation by a considable amaount than you now receive i shall be willin however to retain your services at sech redooced rate as we shall fix upon provided sech redooced rate be as low or lower than the same services can be obtained elsewhere as you please mr peckham helen answered with a smile so sweet that the principal who of course had trumped up this oppositionteacher for the occasion said to himself she would stand being cut down a quarter perhaps a half of her salary here is your accaount miss darley and the balance doo you said silas peckham handing her a paper and a small roll of infectiousflavored bills wrapping six poisonous coppers of the old coinage she took the paper and began looking at it she could not quite make up her mind to touch the feverish bills with the cankering coppers in them and left them airing themselves on the table the document she held ran as follows silas peckham esq principal of the apollinean institute in account with helen darley assist teacher dr cr to salary for quarter by deduction for absence ending jan st per week days quarter board lodging etc for days cts per day damage to institution by absence of teacher from duties say stationary furnished postagestamp balance due helen darley rockland jan st now helen had her own private reasons for wishing to receive the small sum which was due her at this time without any unfair deduction reasons which we need not inquire into too particularly as we may be very sure that they were right and womanly so when she looked over this account of mr silas peckhams and saw that he had contrived to pare down her salary to something less than half its stipulated amount the look which her countenance wore was as near to that of righteous indignation as her gentle features and soft blue eyes would admit of its being why mr peckham she said do you mean this if i am of so much value to you that you must take off twentyfive dollars for ten days absence how is it that my salary is to be cut down to less than seventyfive dollars a quarter if i remain here i gave you fair notice said silas i have a minute of it i took down immedately after the intervoo he lugged out his large pocketbook with the strap going all round it and took from it a slip of paper which confirmed his statement besides he added slyly i presoom you have received a liberal pecooniary compensation from squire venner for nussin his daughter helen was looking over the bill while he was speaking board and lodging for ten days mr peckham whose board and lodging pray the door opened before silas peckham could answer and mr bernard walked into the parlor helen was holding the bill in her hand looking as any woman ought to look who has been at once wronged and insulted the last turn of the thumbscrew said mr bernard to himself what is it helen you look troubled she handed him the account he looked at the footing of it then he looked at the items then he looked at silas peckham at this moment silas was sublime he was so transcendently unconscious of the emotions going on in mr bernards mind at the moment that he had only a single thought the accaounts correcly cast i presoom if the s any mistake of figgers or addin em up itll be made all right everythings accordin to agreement the minute written immedately after the intervoo is here in my possession mr bernard looked at helen just what would have happened to silas peckham as he stood then and there but for the interposition of a merciful providence nobody knows or ever will know for at that moment steps were heard upon the stairs and hiram threw open the parlordoor for mr dudley venner to enter he saluted them all gracefully with the goodwishes of the season and each of them returned his compliment helen blushing fearfully of course but not particularly noticed in her embarrassment by more than one silas peckham reckoned with perfect confidence on his trustees who had always said what he told them to and done what he wanted it was a good chance now to show off his power and by letting his instructors know the unstable tenure of their offices make it easier to settle his accounts and arrange his salaries there was nothing very strange in mr venners calling he was one of the trustees and this was new years day but he had called just at the lucky moment for mr peckhams object i have thought some of makin changes in the department of instruction he began several accomplished teachers have applied to me who would be glad of sitooations i understand that there never have been so many fustrate teachers male and female out of employment as doorin the present season if i can make sahtisfahctory arrangements with my present corpse of teachers i shall be glad to do so otherwise i shell with the permission of the trustees make sech noo arrangements as circumstahnces compel you may make arrangements for a new assistant in my department mr peckham said mr bernard at once this day this hour i am not safe to be trusted with your person five minutes out of this ladys presence of whom i beg pardon for this strong language mr venner i must beg you as one of the trustees of this institution to look at the manner in which its principal has attempted to swindle this faithful teacher whose toils and sacrifices and selfdevotion to the school have made it all that it is in spite of this miserable traders incompetence will you look at the paper i hold dudley venner took the account and read it through without changing a feature then he turned to silas peckham you may make arrangements for anew assistant in the branches this lady has taught miss helen darley is to be my wife i had hoped to have announced this news in a less abrupt and ungraceful manner but i came to tell you with my own lips what you would have learned before evening from my friends in the village mr bernard went to helen who stood silent with downcast eyes and took her hand warmly hoping she might find all the happiness she deserved then he turned to dudley venner and said she is a queen but has never found it out the world has nothing nobler than this dear woman whom you have discovered in the disguise of a teacher god bless her and you dudley venner returned his friendly grasp without answering a word in articulate speech silas remained dumb and aghast for a brief space coming to himself a little he thought there might have been some mistake about the items would like to have miss barleys bill returned would make it all right had no idee that squire venner had a special intrest in miss barley was sorry he had given offence if he might take that bill and look it over no mr peckham said mr dudley venner there will be a full meeting of the board next week and the bill and such evidence with reference to the management of the institution and the treatment of its instructors as mr langdon sees fit to bring forward will be laid before them miss helen darley became that very day the guest of miss arabella thornton the judges daughter mr bernard made his appearance a week or two later at the lectures where the professor first introduced him to the reader he stayed after the class had left the room ah mr langdon how do you do very glad to see you back again how have you been since our correspondence on fascination and other curious scientific questions it was the professor who spoke whom the reader will recognize as myself the teller of this story i have been well mr bernard answered with a serious look which invited a further question i hope you have had none of those painful or dangerous experiences you seemed to be thinking of when you wrote at any rate you have escaped having your obituary written i have seen some things worth remembering shall i call on you this evening and tell you about them i shall be most happy to see you this was the way in which i the professor became acquainted with some of the leading events of this story they interested me sufficiently to lead me to avail myself of all those other extraordinary methods of obtaining information well known to writers of narrative mr langdon seemed to me to have gained in seriousness and strength of character by his late experiences he threw his whole energies into his studies with an effect which distanced all his previous efforts remembering my former hint he employed his spare hours in writing for the annual prizes both of which he took by a unanimous vote of the judges those who heard him read his thesis at the medical commencement will not soon forget the impression made by his fine personal appearance and manners nor the universal interest excited in the audience as he read with his beautiful enunciation that striking paper entitled unresolved nebulae in vital science it was a general remark of the faculty and old doctor kittredge who had come down on purpose to hear mr langdon heartily agreed to it that there had never been a diploma filled up since the institution which conferred upon him the degree of doctor medicdnce was founded which carried with it more of promise to the profession than that which bore the name of bernardus caryl langdon chapter xxxii conclusion mr bernard langdon had no sooner taken his degree than in accordance with the advice of one of his teachers whom he frequently consulted he took an office in the heart of the city where he had studied he had thought of beginning in a suburb or some remoter district of the city proper no said his teacher to wit myself dont do any such thing you are made for the best kind of practice dont hamper yourself with an outside constituency such as belongs to a practitioner of the second class when a fellow like you chooses his beat he must look ahead a little take care of all the poor that apply to you but leave the halfpay classes to a different style of doctor the people who spend one half their time in taking care of their patients and the other half in squeezing out their money go for the swellfronts and southexposure houses the folks inside are just as good as other people and the pleasantest on the whole to take care of they must have somebody and they like a gentleman best dont throw yourself away you have a good presence and pleasing manners you wear white linen by inherited instinct you can pronounce the word view you have all the elements of success go and take it be polite and generous but dont undervalue yourself you will be useful at any rate you may just as well be happy while you are about it the highest social class furnishes incomparably the best patients taking them by and large besides when they wont get well and bore you to death you can send em off to travel mind me now and take the tops of your sparrowgrass somebody must have em why shouldnt you if you dont take your chance youll get the buttends as a matter of course mr bernard talked like a young man full of noble sentiments he wanted to be useful to his fellowbeings their social differences were nothing to him he would never court the rich he would go where he was called he would rather save the life of a poor mother of a family than that of half a dozen old gouty millionnaires whose heirs had been yawning and stretching these ten years to get rid of them generous emotions i exclaimed cherish em cling to em till you are fifty till you are seventy till you are ninety but do as i tell you strike for the best circle of practice and you ll be sure to get it mr langdon did as i told him took a genteel office furnished it neatly dressed with a certain elegance soon made a pleasant circle of acquaintances and began to work his way into the right kind of business i missed him however for some days not long after he had opened his office on his return he told me he had been up at rockland by special invitation to attend the wedding of mr dudley venner and miss helen darley he gave me a full account of the ceremony which i regret that i cannot relate in full helen looked like an angel that i am sure was one of his expressions as for her dress i should like to give the details but am afraid of committing blunders as men always do when they undertake to describe such matters white dress anyhow that i am sure of with orangeflowers and the most wonderful lace veil that was ever seen or heard of the reverend doctor honeywood performed the ceremony of course the good people seemed to have forgotten they ever had had any other minister except deacon shearer and his set of malcontents who were doing a dull business in the meetinghouse lately occupied by the reverend mr fairweather who was at the wedding everybody pretty much they wanted to keep it quiet but it was of no use married at church front pews old dr kittredge and all the mansionhouse people and distinguished strangers colonel sprowle and family including matildas young gentleman a graduate of one of the freshwater colleges mrs pickins late widow rowens and husband deacon soper and numerous parishioners a little nearer the door abel the doctors man and elbridge who drove them to church in the familycoach father fairweather as they all call him now came in late with father mcshane and silas peckham oh silas had left the school and rockland cut up altogether too badly in the examination instituted by the trustees had removed over to tamarack and thought of renting a large house and farming the townpoor some time after this as i was walking with a young friend along by the swellfronts and southexposures whom should i see but mr bernard langdon looking remarkably happy and keeping step by the side of a very handsome and singularly welldressed young lady he bowed and lifted his hat as we passed who is that pretty girl my young doctor has got there i said to my companion who is that he answered you dont know why that is neither more nor less than miss letitia forrester daughter of of why the great banking firm you know bilyuns brothers forrester got acquainted with her in the country they say there s a story that theyre engaged or like to be if the firm consents oh i said i did not like the look of it in the least too young too young has not taken any position yet no right to ask for the hand of bilyuns brothers cos daughter besides it will spoil him for practice if he marries a rich girl before he has formed habits of work i looked in at his office the other day a box of white kids was lying open on the table a threecornered note directed in a very delicate ladyshand was distinguishable among a heap of papers i was just going to call him to account for his proceedings when he pushed the threecornered note aside and took up a letter with a great corporationseal upon it he had received the offer of a professors chair in an ancient and distinguished institution pretty well for threeandtwenty my boy i said i suppose youll think you must be married one of these days if you accept this office mr langdon blushed there had been stories about him he knew his name had been mentioned in connection with that of a very charming young lady the current reports were not true he had met this young lady and been much pleased with her in the country at the house of her grandfather the reverend doctor honeywood you remember miss letitia forrester whom i have mentioned repeatedly on coming to town he found his countryacquaintance in a social position which seemed to discourage his continued intimacy he had discovered however that he was a not unwelcome visitor and had kept up friendly relations with her but there was no truth in the current reports none at all some months had passed after this visit when i happened one evening to stroll into a box in one of the principal theatres of the city a small party sat on the seats before me a middleaged gentleman and his lady in front and directly behind them my young doctor and the same very handsome young lady i had seen him walking with on the sidewalk before the swellfronts and southexposures as professor langdon seemed to be very much taken up with his companion and both of them looked as if they were enjoying themselves i determined not to make my presence known to my young friend and to withdraw quietly after feasting my eyes with the sight of them for a few minutes it looks as if something might come of it i said to myself at that moment the young lady lifted her arm accidentally in such a way that the light fell upon the clasp of a chain which encircled her wrist my eyes filled with tears as i read upon the clasp in sharpcut italic letters e y they were tears at once of sad remembrance and of joyous anticipation for the ornament on which i looked was the double pledge of a dead sorrow and a living affection it was the golden bracelet the partinggift of elsie venner
