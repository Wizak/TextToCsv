 prologue discipline the planet below him was hidden to all of sharlss senses save for the neutrino screen the neudar what had been a gas giant planet a billion years ago was still a world two and a half times the size of the earth an egg of rock and nickeliron hidden in worldsized storms the storms spread out into a cloudy ring occupying the en tirety of goldblatts worlds orbit around the neutron star sharls watched storms spin outward from the gas giant streams of fog and cloud and dust ran slow near the smoke rings outer rim faster at the smoke ring median faster yet as they neared levoys star and everywhere there were flattened whorls of hurricane the gravity gra dient was savage this near the ancient neutron star the innermost limits of the smoke ring circled levoys star every two hours the smoke ring was tinged with green it had its own billionyearold ecology and somewhere in that cloud were men larry niven the temptation to go to them was a constant lowlevel irritant when moving between stars discipline burned the nearinfinite hydrogen of interstellar space but discipline had been at rest for a long time now and onboard fuel was limited refueling could not have progressed far when the mutiny came sharlss supply of deuteriumtrit ium mix was finite he had no way of knowing how long he must wait for the children of disciplines crew to re discover civilization to build their own spacecraft to come to him he was always short of power the solar collectors on his two remaining carms didnt give him much sharls ignored the stars most of the time he watched the smoke ring when the boredom became too much for him he edited it from his memory boredom was a recurring surprise five hundred and thirtytwo earth years was one hundred and ninetytwo orbits of levoys star round its companion star but the natives of the smoke ring mea sured years from the passings of the neutron star levoys star voy across the face of the yellow dwarf t sun so a smoke ring year was earth years sharls had been waiting in the l point behind goldblatts world for three hundred and eightyfour smoke ring years best to sit it out in a stable orbit and watch and wait for men to develop civilization best to edit the memory of boredom disciplines computer autopilot stored its information as a human brain did or a hologram though sharls could feel differences memories from his time aboard disci pline were sharp and vivid those he had edited were gone completely but memories from his time as a man trans the smoke ring ferred long ago from a human brain now long dead were blurred hard to retrieve so it wasnt like a relay clicking over but somewhere in the computer there was a change of state five hundred and thirtytwo years and enough is enough sharls davis kendy was done with waiting section one citizens tree chapter one the pond from the citizens tree cassettes year sm ponds water droplets come in all sizes here clouds may hold everything from fine mist to globules the size of a fist to spheroids that house all manner of life the biggest pond weve seen massed ten million metric tons or so but the tide from levoys star had pulled it into two lobes and the differential winds were tearing it apart the ecology of the ponds is one rather than many life is queer and wonderful but in every pond we have examined it is the same life ponds are temporary pond life must occasionally mi grate in the smoke ring even the fish can fly carol burnes life support lawri and jepfer swam beneath murky pondwa ter trailing forty square meters of fabric stretched across larry niven the net more commonly used to sieve harebrains from the sky they gripped its corners in strong toes and swam with their arms the sheet tesisted the leading edge tried to crumple tethers at the comers of the harebrain net got in their way we could have had some help jeffer thought lawri wouldnt have it lawris idea lawns project shed be doing this by herself if she possibly could air he slapped her thigh she dropped the sheet and they swam toward the light air is the sweetest taste though one must risk drown ing to appreciate it they were at the arc of the pond nearest citizens tree the center of the trunk was a mere three klomters east seventy klomters of trunk ran out and in from the pond ending in paired curved tufts the in tuft home looked greenish black with voys blue pinpoint shining almost behind it a single line ran from the trunk and divided the sheet was a ghostly shadow deep within the pond lines ran from the comers up through the water and out to join the main cable that ran to the trunk almost in place lawri said doubtfully close enough all right you go get the carm ready ill draft some hands to pull it in jeffer nodded his legs scissored and shot him into the air he drifted toward the main cable in a spray of drop lets it was easier than arguing lawri would not leave jeffer to organize the final stage when lawri the scientist got an idea nobody else got credit particularly not citizens trees other scientist her husband partway around the curve of the pond minya and gavving floated in the interface between air and water surrounded by thrashing children the smoke ring lines ran from each child toward the cable from cit izens tree the children were taught the backstroke first it kept their faces in the air some preferred the frogkick that let them look beneath the water swimming was a balance of surface tension versus the thrust of arms and legs if a child kicked himself entirely out of the water an adult must go after him a child who went beneath the surface could panic and must be pulled out before he drowned there were carnivores among the waterbirds minya and gavving wore harpoons they had three of their own among the swimmers gavving used lazy strokes to change his attitude mov ing his field of view in a clockwise circle look at rather minya said the oldest of the children were swimming together daughter of two jungle giants goldenblond jill had grown to merely normal height in the tide of citizens tree she was thirty ce meters shorter than her parents but the contrast between jill and rather was startling at four teen minyas darkhaired firstborn son was less than two meters in height jill had more than half a meter on him yet minya never spoke of rathers height gavving looked again and said right rather rather paddled over reluctantly fine green fur barely visible grew a mimeter long on his left cheek gavving gripped the boys arm and lifted him partway out of the water against surface tension the green could be traced down rathers neck over his shoulder and part way across his chest fluff gavving said why didnt you tell some one rather grinned guiltily ive never swum before minya snapped you go straight no finish your swim youll pay for it youve seen your last of the sun for a while have we raised a fool its almost reached your eye larry niven rather nodded solemnly and paddled away minya watched him go her mouth pursed in anger her husband wriggled and was silently underwater kicked and was beneath her grasped an ankle and dove minya doubled back on herself and kicked him across the jaw gavving reached through the defense of her waving arms and legs and had her head between his hands pulled her to him by main strength and kissed her hard she laughed bub bles he kicked toward the surface with minya in tow they blew water from their faces before they inhaled and were back on duty before any child could get into trouble debby was some distance from where the children swam she stayed just under the surface motionless peering her spear poised she expelled stale air which stayed before her as a bubble raised her head snatched a breath ducked again debby had lived her first nineteen years in freefall fourteen years in the tree tide had put muscle on her without shrinking her height her children and lisas the children they had borne to anthon were no taller than ordinary tree dwellers but debby was two and a half meters tall her fingers were long and fragile her toes were sturdier if less agile and the big toes measured six cemeters her rich brown hair was beginning to show gray but she still wore it a meter long for swimming she wore it looped in a braid around her throat the water was murky this was a new skill for debby but she was learning she struck the ripple other thrust expanded outward around the great globule past playing children and the scientists working their cloth sheet a silver shape wriggled on debbys spearpoint debby reached above her head tugged hard at the tether and gasped as her head broke the surface the waterbird sud denly thrust into air expanded its small wings and the smoke ring thrashed mightily a blow to the head end quieted it debby pushed it into a net bag to join five others her chest still heaved with the need for air she rested quietly on her back her hands fluttering from time to time to keep surface tension from pulling her under eastward a thousand klomters past citizens tree the cloud patterns thickened into a flattened whirlpool the smoke ring converged beyond and below the whorl in a stream of white touched with bluegreen narrowing as it dropped toward the dazzling point of voy things tended to collect in that special part of the smoke ring east of gold by sixty degrees of arc the citizens had reason to know that the stormwhorl around gold was dangerous they assumed that the clump was too they had never taken the tree nearer than this they had never visited a jungle human beings certainly lived elsewhere in the smoke ring but citizens tree had never attempted to contact them citizens tree was placid safe working within the pond was as much excitement as debby ever got these days life in carther states had been different the oc casional raids from london tree forced the citizens to be always prepared for war until in one magnificent raid they had ended london trees power forever debbys connection with the jungle warriors had ended too a mixed group of copsiks and warriors had stolen london trees carm the vehicle was old science pow erful and unfamiliar they and their prisoners had been lucky to bring the carm to any kind of safety but carther states was lost somewhere in the sky beyond gold from westward came a cheerful cry citizens we need muscle debby saw lawri the scientist floating in the sky with one hand on the main tether debby snatched at the net bag six was a nice days catch kicked herself into the sky and began reeling her larry niven line in she was first to reach the scientist clave and minya and mark the silver man were leaving the pond reeling in lines gavving had stayed to gather the children four tethers led to the corners of the sheetcovered net which was now deep underwater lawri stationed them along the main tether as they arrived gather it in she directed them make loops steady pull debby wrapped her toes and her fingers around the cable and did her savage best to contract her body no loop formed she knew she wasnt as strong as a tree dweller but the others were having trouble too lawn called good its coming straight out that was not obvious to debby she strained and gradually the pond bulged the sheet and its net backing were rising carrying tons of water debby pulled until her knees and elbows met then shifted her grip and con tinued pulling the pond stretched and tore a baby pond pulled clear leaving a trail of droplets the size of a mans head water flowed over the edges of the cloth but was not lost for surface tension held it the main pond pulsed as sur face tension tried to form the sphere again keep pulling lawri shouted steady okay that should do it the citizens relaxed the budpond continued to move east on its own momentum toward the tree with the net and sheet now in the middle of a pulsing sphere debby coiled line that was now slack glancing toward the trunk she saw what the curve of the pond had hidden earlier parallel to the trunk and many klomters beyond it floated a slender dark line a young tree no more than thirty klomters long and injured for the in tuft was miss ing chopped away somehow the view was confusing for the midtrunk was wreathed in cloud dark dirty cloud smoke debby tugged abruptly at another line the motion set the smoke ring her drifting toward the chairman clave caught her ankle as she arrived something debby pointed with her toes that tree its on fire i believe youre right treefodder itll be com ing apart two fires to worry about debby had never seen a tree break in half but clave spoke from dreadful experience they might have to move the tree it would take time to get the carm ready clave had already thought that far his voice became a whipcrack roar citizens its getting toward dinner time and weve got all these waterbirds lets break up the swim his voice dropped you go now debby tell jeffer we may need the carm well get the women and chil dren down into the tuft if weve got time your eyes are better than mine do you see anything leaving the tree like clouds of insects there were black specks big enough to show detail not insects something bigger three four birds doesnt matter get going it had taken jeffer the scientist a fifth of a day to cross three klomters of line freefall brought back memories when quinn tribe was lost in the sky after daltonquinn tree came apart his crew would have given eyes and limbs to reach a pond fourteen years later the grandmother of all ponds floated three klomters from citizens tree and now their main problem was to get rid of most of it jeffer wondered if the children appreciated their wealth perhaps they did most of citizens tree thirty naked adults and children had come to swim in that shimmering sphere of water there was no foliage on the high trunk it was thick rough bark with fissures deep enough to hide a man jef fer found and donned his tunic and pants then anchored larry niven his toes in a crevice and thrust to send himself gliding out along the bark toward the carm the lift cable ended two hundred meters short of the carms dock the citizens may have feared that careless use of the carm might spray fire across a rising cage more likely they feared the carm itself they would not lightly come too near that ancient scientific thing the carm was old science it was roughly brick shaped four meters by ten by thirtytwo and made of starstuff metal and glass and plastic sheathed with darkly luminous stuff that took the energy from sunlight the bulk of it was tanks for hydrogen and oxygen and water nostrils at the aft end four at each corner and a larger one in the middle would spurt blue fire on com mand they had neglected the carm of late and jeffer ac cepted some of the blame the carm made two fla vors of fuel out of water and the power in the batteries the batteries held their full scientific charge they filled themselves somehow as long as sunlight could reach the carms glassy surface but the hydrogen and oxygen tanks were almost empty it was high time they filled the water tank the carms bow was moored in a dock of wooden beams double doors led into a hut with cradles for pas sengers moorings for cargo and a broad transparent win dow the window looked forth on nothing but bark ventral to the window was a gray sheet of glass and a row of colored buttons jeffer went forward a touch of a blue button lit the gray glass panel blue governed what moved the carm the motors the two flavors of fuel supply the water tank fuel flow jeffer read the blue script h oz hzo power the smoke ring the batteries danced with energy why not the carm wasnt using power nobody in citizens tree had bothered to fill the water tank in seven years so power wasnt needed to split water into hydrogen and oxygen the water tank was virtually dry and he could get something done while he waited for lawns pond jeffer touched the blue button the panel went blank and the yellow there appeared a line diagram of the carms bow the hut section he touched a yel low dot in the image and turned his fingertip then he moved aft the residual goop in pond water stayed in the tank after the pure water was gone jeffers finger motions had mag ically scientifically caused a spigot in the aft wall to ooze brown mud he cupped the globule in his hands he tossed it at the airlock and most of it got through another globule formed and he sent it after the first he wiped his hands on his tunic the mud flow had stopped next he pulled several loops of hose from cargo hooks he rotated one end onto the spigot then tossed the coil through the twin doors done when lawris blob of pond arrived she would find the carm ready to be fueled jeffer returned to the controls he had a surprise for his wife two sleeps ago while the rest of the tribe was roasting waterbirds from the pond lawri had held one of the crea tures up for his perusal have you ever really looked at these jeffer had seen waterbirds before but hed kept his mouth shut and looked there were no feathers the modified trilateral sym metry common to smoke ring life expressed itself in two wings and a tailfin all in smooth membrane on collapsible ribs the wings could be held half collapsed for motion within the denser medium of water only one of the three eyes looked like a normal birds eye the others were big and bulbous with large pupils and thick lids the bodies were slipperysmooth larry niven ive eaten them but youre right ive seen everything from mobies to triunes to flashers to drillbits and they dont look like this earthlife doesnt either do you think its so they can move through water ive tried looking them up in the cassettes lawri had said i tried bird i tried water and pond theres nothing jeffers next sleep had ended with a dream fading in his mind leaving a single phrase even the fish can fly hed had to wait until now to try it he tapped yellow then white white read the cassettes white summoned voice pri kazyvat voice he said the voice of the carm was a throaty bass as deep as mark the dwarfs voice ready jeffer the scientist prikazyvat read fish read it aloud the cassette was one that jeffer had stolen from lon don tree but it was no different from quinn tribes lost records of smoke ring life forms as voice spoke print scrolled down the display screen words recorded long ago by one of disciplines abandoned crew fish if the birds within the smoke ring resemble fish legless designed to move through air wehhtlessly as a fish moves through water then the fish that live within the ponds resemble birds every fish we have examined breathes air they are not mammals but lungfish the single class of exceptions gillfish are discussed else where some can extrude a tube to the ponds surface the smoke ring a pew can expand the size of their pins via mem branes to make them serve as wings one form core fish inflates itself with air dives to the center of a pond and expels a bubble it can stay submerged for up to a day several smoke ring days rebreathing its air bubble making forays to hunt and then returning the whalesized moby uses its pond as a lair from which it bursts to sweep through passing clouds of insects mob vis a compromise form and there are others clearly even the largest ponds can break up or evaporate or be torn apart by storm every creature that lives in a pond must be prepared to migrate to another to behave like a bird even gillfish prikazyvat stop jeffer said this memory that had surfaced from his adolescent training under quinn tribes scientist was going to put him one up on his wife back to work he tapped white then green then each of the five green rectangles now onscreen within the great window that faced the bark five smaller windows appeared looking starboard port dorsal ventral and aft the ventral view had a blur and a flicker to it the rest were clear like the window itself the aft view looked along the line that led west to the pond citizens were returning to the tree behind them a bud of pond was already drifting toward the tree with the harebrain net showing as a shadow within lawris crazy idea was working they swarmed back along the cable toward the mid point of citizens tree gavving and minya and anthon hung back counting heads to be sure that all children were accounted for a girl lost her grip and drifted she was larry niven chortling and trying to swim through the air when anthon scooped her up as children arrived clave herded the smaller ones with some difficulty into a rectangular frame with a slat ted floor the lift cage he stopped when twelve children were inside leave room for a couple of adults the rest clung to the rough bark or floated like balloons on their tethers there were wrestling matches eight yearold arth was getting good at using the recoil of his opponents line he was claves youngest and just be ginning the tremendous growth of adolescence debby had arrived first clave could see her a hundred meters out along the bark climbing toward the carm the budpond continued to move lawri wore a pro prietary smile still citizens tree had better have more line next time they tried this the pond was too close if the tree had brushed it there would have been a flood the lift now held a score of children whoever was in the treadmill would have a problem braking that weight it couldnt be helped clave looked about mark and an thon looked ludicrous together mark short and wide an thon long and narrow their heads pointing in opposite directions he called anthon mark take the chil dren down and bring back any adult you can find be prepared to fight a fire anthon stared in astonishment fire burning tree its around the other side of the trunk now go down and get some help rather where on earth is rather mark pointed outward i didnt know any reason to stop them he said defensively they wont fit in the lift this trip clave cursed silently as he watched rather and jill clawing their way out along the bark there was no tide to hurt them here if they slipped someone would go get them but he could have used their help the smoke ring jeffer couldnt guess how long it took him to realize that the background had changed behind the five camera views superimposed upon it the window no longer showed bark a few cemeters distant it showed a huge face strong with massive bones the brutal face of a dwarf chapter two discipline from the citizens tree cassettes year sm fire making a cookpre in freefall is an exces sively interesting experience if what you really wanted was dinner its taken me eight state years to perfect my technique the first lesson is that a flame doesnt rise in freefall i learned that with a candle when i was a cadet dreaming of strange worlds if theres no wind the can dle flame seems to go out but it isnt out yet theres wax vapor and theres the air around it and at the interface is an envelope of plasma where gas and oxygen in teract it can stay hot for minutes combustion continues at tfie interface wave the candle and pop the flame is back the smoke ring in the case of a cookfire the wood continues to char wait an hour then blow on the coals with a bellows the fire jumps to life and there went your eyebrows dennis quinn captain discipline had been deteriorating cameras outside the hull showed rainbowhued scars from matter that had penetrated the electromagnetic ram scoop while discipline was in flight they also showed newer micrometeorite pocks sharls could ward off any thing big enough to see coming by turning on those mag netic shields for a few seconds but they ate power in great gulps one day he might regret even the little power he used to maintain the gardens and the cats within the hull time had discolored metal and plastic the air was dustfree metal was clean but not recently polished many of the servomechs had worn out all but a few of the crew cubicles were kept cold and dark and airless kitchen machinery was in storage with power shut down some of the bedding had decayed water mat tresses had been drained and stored sharls kept the control room free of water vapor and almost cold enough to freeze carbon dioxide he hoped that the computer and its extensions would survive longer in the cold but the gardens and corridors and even some of the cubicles were kept habitable sharls left the lighting on a daynight cycle for the birds and cats and plants the gardens were surviving nicely it was true that some of the plants had died out completely but after all his ecosystem was missing its most important factor human crew were supposed to be in that cycle and they had been gone for half a thousand years scores of cats prowled the ship hunting hundreds of larry niven rats and a lesser number of turkeys and pigeons the tur keys made a formidable enemy the cats had learned to attack them in pairs sharls trained the cats to respond to his voice he had released the experimental rats long ago the birds were already loose they must have been released during that blank spot in his memory the mutiny but by themselves they wouldnt have fed the cats they were too agile for one thing with all of the animal life in the system now the gardens had a better chance of surviving by watching the cats and rats and plants and turkeys and pigeons interact sharls hoped to learn how an eco logical system would behave in a freefall environment like the larger ecosystem that flowed beneath dis cipline in endless rivers of curdled cloud or had he simply become lonely in his youth sharls had never been a cat lover a sudden memory his hand swelling with white patches rimmed in red itching hor ribly a kitten had scratched him playfully while he was stroking it and now they didnt obey orders worth a damn but neither had his crew a computer program would hardly have retained al lergies but who would expect a computer program to be come lonely discipline skimmed above the curdled whorl of the fourth lagrange point a fraction of sharls davis kendys attention watched on various wavelengths this close he could confirm an earlier sighting minor amounts of car bon were being burned at sites around the edges of that endless storm this was no forest fire too small and it had gone on for years it might indicate human industry at a primitive level now where was carm funny that the cats hadnt gone with the muti neers the crew had loved cats somewhere in the lost part of his memory there must be a reason perhaps sharls had pulled free of the smoke ring without warning the smoke ring he might have done that if the mutineers planned some thing really foul like cutting the computer out and trying to run discipline manually the mutiny was a blank to sharls he had edited those memories he even remembered why the descendants of the mutineers would need sharls davis kendy someday it was not good that he hold grudges against specific ancestors against old names but had he been too thorough there carm s communications system had come alive it was a thousand kilometers behind him and something less than six thousand kilometers in toward voy kendy did several things at once before his new orbit could carry him away he restarted the drive he beamed kendy for the state kendy for the state the carm autopilot responded link to me beam records hed made mistakes enough during that unexpected contact twenty earth years ago at least hed accom plished something hed broken the program that denied him access to the cargo and repair module the drive systems were beyond his reach the original mutineers must have physically cut the fiberoptic cable but the carm would talk to him hed instructed the autopilot to take photographs at tenminute intervals reentry was in progress when he sent that message static might well have fuzzed him out but pictures were streaming in time passed at a furious rate carm flamed as it plowed through thickening air veering from plants and ponds and creatures it dipped into a pond to refuel then bedded itself in the voyward tuft of the largest of a clus ter of integral trees it stayed there with not much of a view at all for most of a smoke ring year flickering shapes carved cavities through the foliage and wove small branches into waspsnest structures ab larry niven ruptly the carm backed into the sky skittered outward under inexpert handling and docked at the midpoint of the tree with another part of his mind kendy fiddled with dis ciplines fusion motor he could not match his orbit to that of the carm he must stay well outside the smoke ring to protect discipline from corrosion the best he could do was twice the carms orbital period to dip low above the carms position once every ten hours and eight minutes but hed be in range for half an hour while his motor was firing more of his attention went to watching the carms lone occupant in real time jeffer the scientist was stored in memory he had aged twenty earth years hair and beard going gray wrin kles across his forehead broken by a white line of scar that was a healing pink wound in kendys records and knuckles turning knobby height meters mass kilograms long arms and legs toes like stubby fingers fingers like a spiders legs long fragile the hands of a field surgeon the smoke ring had altered disciplines descendants the tribes of london tree and daltonquinn tree had all looked like that the jungle giants who had grown up with out tidal gravity were hardly human freakishly tall with long fragile agile fingers and toes and one of the twelve was a cripple and others had legs of different length only mark the silver man had looked like a normal state cit izen they had called him dwarf they were savages but they had learned to use state technology in the form of the carm still human per haps they could be made citizens again to kendy who thought with the speed of a computer the scientist moved much too slowly now he was at the controls auditing a cassette now checking the camera views in present time the incoming carm records showed clouds and the smoke ring ponds and trees and trilaterally symmetric fishlike birds swirling across the sky natives flickered through the carm cabin the same savages growing older a growing handful of children at fifteen years minustime the carm backed out of its timber dock for a journey of exploration it visited a green puffball several kilometers across and when it emerged there was vegetation like a houseful of green spaghetti bound to its dorsal surface it hovered in the open sky while men darted among a flock of birds real birds with real wings turkeys and returned to its dock with prisoners at thirteen years minustime it left the trunk to return with a dubious prize several tons of black mud there were no more such forays the cargo and repair module had become a motor for the tree it was docked when the main drive fired for several hours kendy watched side views as the integral tree drifted across the sky it had been circling too far from the neutron star air grew thin away from the smoke ring median the tree was lower now the air would be as thick as mountain air on earth and now the carm was not being used at all but there was plenty to watch the smoke ring environment was fascinating huge spheres of water storms jungles like tremendous puffs of green cot ton candy in present time the aft carm camera showed nearly thirty natives maneuvering between the tree and a tre mendous globule of water they were using the freefall environment better than any state astronaut the state had need of these people disciplines own telescope had found the foreshor tened tree with the pond to mark it and what was that on the opposite side of the tree infrared light glowed near its center half a thousand years of sensory deprivation were larry niven being compensated in a few minutes after more than five hundred years sharls kendy had left the stable point be hind goldblatts world he had burned irreplaceable fuel and it was worth it sharls tried to absorb it all integrate it all but that could wait the scientist might leave at any minute he beamed interrupt records it was twenty earth years of nothing happening and the tiny carm autopilot couldnt handle too many tasks at once activate voice voice on the second delay was almost too short to notice send he displayed a picture of himself as a human being with minor improvements at age fortytwo kendy had been handsome healthy mature firm of jaw authoritative a recruitmentposter version of a state checker these were not obedient state citizens they hadnt trusted him twenty years ago what words might give him a handle on jeffer the scientist he sent kendy for the state jeffer the scientist your citizens have been idle too long jeffer jumped like a thief caught in the act two long seconds passed before he found his voice checker speaking how stands your tribe out beyond the terrible whorl of storm that surrounded gold out where water boiled and froze at the same time and the legendary stars were a visible truth lived kendy the checker he had claimed to be something like an elab orate cassette the recording of a man he had claimed authority over every human being in the smoke ring he had offered knowledge and power while they were still near enough to hear his ravings perhaps he was only a madman trapped somehow aboard the spacecraft that had brought men from the stars but he had knowledge he had coached them the smoke ring through that terrible fall back into the smoke ring four teen years ago the face in the carms window had not been seen since it was the face of a dwarf a brutal throwback the jaw and orbital ridges were more massive even than marks the musculature more prominent we lived through the reentry jeffer told him lisa and merril are dead now there are children jeffer your tribe has possessed the carm for four teen of your years in that time you have moved the tree twice and thenceforth done nothing at all what have you learned of the people of the fourth lagrange point the what i dont understand the question sixty degrees ahead of goldblatts world on the arc of the smoke ring and sixty degrees behind are regions where matter grows dense they are points of stability in goldblatts worlds orbit material tends to collect there the dwarfs brutal features registered impati ence east of you by twelve hundred kilometers a vast sluggish permanent storm the clump youre saying there are people in the clump i sense activity there a civilization is growing twelve hundred kilometers from where your tree has floated for fifteen earth years jeffer where is your curiosity has it been bred out of you what do you want from me checker kendy said i can be in range to advise you every ten hours and eight minutes once every two of your days i want to know more of the people of the smoke ring in particular i want to know about you and about the clump civilization i think you should link with them perhaps rule them jeffers one previous experience indicated that kendy was harmless for good or ill he could only talk jeffer gathered his courage and said kendy the tales say that larry niven you abandoned us here long ago now i expect youre bored and i am and you want to talk to someone you also claim authority wont grant you why should i listen are you aware that you are being invaded what the face ofkendy was suddenly replaced by a dizzying view jeffer looked into a river of storm streaming faster as the eye moved inward toward a tiny brilliant violet pinpoint jeffer had seen this once before the smoke ring seen from outside before he could remember to breathe the view jumped he was looking at what had been the center of the picture vastly enlarged look scarlet arrowheads appeared pointing here your tree citizens tree from the out tuft yeah and that must be the pond both were tiny opposite the pond was another tree and dark cloud clinging to the trunk the view jumped again through the blur and flicker in the illusion of a window jeffer watched a tree on fire moving between the two trees were creatures he had never seen before treefodder everybodys on the other side of the trunk those birdthings will be on the tree before anyone knows it look in infrared the picture changed again to red blobs on black jeffer couldnt tell what he was looking at the scarlet arrowhead pointed again you are seeing heat this is fire in the intruder tree here these five points are just the temperature of a man jeffer shook his head it doesnt mean anything the enlarged picture returned and suddenly those tiny creatures jumped into perspective winged men i would have called those enlarged swimming fins the smoke ring rather than wings never mind have you ever heard tales of winged men no theres nothing in the cassettes either ive got to do something about this prikazyvat voice off jeffer made for the airlock without waiting to see the face fade his citizens wouldnt have a chance against winged war riors the sun was at three oclock dead east just above where the smoke ring began to take definite shape kendy can only talk sure but he talks with pictures and he tells things nobody can know hell be in range every other day at this time do i want to know that but jeffer had other concerns and the rest of that thought lay curled unfinished in the bottom of his mind jill was leaving rather behind she glanced back once and moved on and there was laughter in the sound of her panting jill was his elder by half a year when he wanted com pany it was generally jill he wanted but they did compete there had been a year during which she could beat him at wrestling when she suddenly grew tall and hed lagged behind shed taught him the riblock the hard way shed held his floating ribs shut with her knees so that he couldnt breathe he could wrestle her now he was a boy and a dwarf but her longer arms and legs gave her an unbeatable advantage at racing hed never catch her so he moved outward at his own pace giving due care to his handholds and footholds in the rough bark follow ing the blond girl in the scarlet tunic her longlimbed mother had already reached the carm ahead of them at fourteenplus rather was considered an adult he was built wide and muscular with heavy cheek jaw and orbital bones his fingers were short and stubby and his toes though strong were too short to be much use his hair was black and curly like his mothers his beard was sparse without much curl to it yet his eyes were green larry niven and green tinged his cheek with a growth of fluff that would be many days healing he stood a meter and three quarters tall dwarf arms too short legs too short he should have gone around the trunk jill could have told the scientist about the burning tree debby might already know he could have been getting a closer look the carm loomed ahead of him it was as big no bigger than the citizens tree commons debby shouted into the airlock someone emerged jeffer they talked heads bobbing debby moved to the front of the carm jeffer was about to go back inside rather heard jill calling scientist theres a burning tree coming toward us she paused to catch her breath we saw it me and rather we while we were swim ming jeffer called back debby told me did you see any thing like winged men no okay help debby with the moorings there at the bow he noticed rather struggling in jills wake get rather to help you debby and jill were both fighting knots and jill was muttering treefodder treefodder treefodder when rather caught up i bent my finger she said debby said i hate to cut lines see what you can do the carms tethers hadnt been moved in years and the knots were tight rathers stubby fingers worked them loose dwarf clumsy but strong presently the carm was held by nothing but its own inertia jill did not look pleased debby and rather grinned at each other it was something to do a thing an adult warrior could not jeffer called from the airlock twelve meters beyond the bark come aboard debby jumped and jill followed rather hesitated until he saw them bump against the airlock door the jump the smoke ring looked dangerous tide was gentle but one could fa into the sky rather had never been inside the carm and he wasnt sure he wanted to be the starstuff box was like nothing else in or on the tree but he had to follow he caught the edge of the outer door as it passed pivoted on the strength of his arms and entered feet first cant jump right cant reach far what if ia missed it was weird inside the carm there were openings in the back wall and hard round loops sticking out of the dorsal and side walls farther toward the front were rows of cradles almost the size of an adult ten in all made of nothing like wood or cloth rather made his way forward the others were in the first row of cradles take a seat and strap yourself in jeffer ordered here like this he fastened two elastic tethers across jills torso lawri showed me how to work these years ago the cradle had a headrest that fitted nicely behind his ears jills and debbys dug into their shoulders its true rather thought suddenly the carm was built for dwarves he liked the thought the winged men werent very close the scientist said weve got time his fingers drummed against the flat panel below the window there was tide pulling rather forward and a whisper roar like a steady wind the bark receded the tree backed into the sky jill gripped the armrests of her cradle her mouth was wide debby said clave didnt say take off scientist he said get ready no time theyre headed for the trunk also the carm is mine debby we settled that once tell it to clave clave knows the invaders kicked themselves through the air slowly in the last stages of exhaustion five it looked larry niven like until rather realized that the older woman carried a halfgrown girl in her arms jeffer nudged the carm toward them in along the trunk smoke ring people came long longer or dwarf these invaders were of the longer persuasion like jungle giants born and raised in freefall they were quite human an older man and woman and four girls the wings were ar tificial bound to their shins made of cloth over splayed ribs one girl trailed behind struggling along with only one wing they were in sorry shape closer now and rather could see details the mans hair was burned and the loose sheet that covered him was charred the wingless girl was coughing she didnt even have the strength to cling to the woman who carried her their legs stopped pumping as one by one they saw the carm debby said i dont see anything like bows or har poons can we take them aboard i thought of that but look at them the carm scares them worse than being lost in the sky anyway the mans almost there the burned man hadnt seen them kicking steadily far ahead of the others he reached the bark and clung without a pause he pounded a stake into the bark moored a coil of line and hurled the coil at the older woman she freed a hand and caught it pulled herself toward the tree then snapped the line to send a sine wave rolling toward the trunk the nearer girl caught the line in her toes as it bowed toward her clave came around the bulge of the bark he slowed when he saw the strangers gavving and minya joined him they moved toward the strangers there were four on the trunk now a girl the man and the older woman with her coughing burden rather the smoke ring watched clave take the burned mans line hurl a sine wave across the onewinged girls torso and pull her in looks okay the scientist murmured clave looked up and waved jeffer nodded and set the carm moving its all right he said they sure dont look dangerous i wonder what happened to them where are they row i never saw strangers before jill said i dont know what to think that burning tree is still coming at us rather said jeffer nodded the carm surged turning black smoke wreathed the middle section of the tree flame glowed sluggishly from within illuminating blurred curves and oblongs debby said theres stuff in the fire made stuff machinery itll burn up that was knowledge burning in the core of the fire jeffer hated what he had to say we cant save it if we had mark and the silver suit no that might burn even him youre not taking us into the fire we can push anywhere the tide will hold the tree straight jeffer had already taken them below the inward limit of the firecloud where a black plume drifted east the carm was passing north of the trunk jeffer tapped the carm turned its still dangerous the tree could come apart while were on it he moved in on the trunk the bow grated against bark jeffers crew surged forward against their elastic bands i think the carm was built for pushing he said he tapped a blue dash in the center of the panel and the whisper of power became a whistling roar tide surged against his back this was what it was to be a scientist knowledge power mastery of a universe this was what kendy the checker had to offer at what price who but a scientist would have the strength to resist larry niven the sun passed zenith and started down its arc jeffer had changed the display he watched sets of letters and numbers the roar of the main motor strummed his bones chapter three refugees from the citizens tree cassettes year sm time weve been trying to keep to earth time but that word day is about as useful as balls on a checker the closer you get to voy the shorter the days get down to about two hours closer than that the airs too thin and theres no water to speak of at a tenhour orbit same thing theres nothing to breathe weve been keeping to shiptime twentyfour hours consti tute a sleep a day is one orbit around voy wherever you happen to be golds orbit is a standard day the state takes its dates from the year of its founding weve done the same dating smoke ring years from four years ago our years are larry niven the smoke ring half a rotation of voy and its companion sun half because its more convenient if discipline ever does come back for us kendy will have to learn a whole new lan guage michelle michaels communications the huts of citizens tree were enclosures made by weaving living spine branches into a kind of wickerwork the scientists hut was larger than most and more clut tered too the scientists were the tribes teachers and doctors any hut would have harpoons protruding from the walls and high ceiling but here the wicker sprouted starstuff knives pots of herbs and pastes and tools for writing the hut was crowded lawri stepped carefully among five sleeping jungle giants shed covered their wounds in undyed cloth the strangers moaned and twisted in their sleep the youngest girl with her hair burned down to the scalp on one side of her head was holding herself half in the air the noise from outside wasnt helping lawri bent to get through the doorway could you hold it down she whispersnarled these citizens dont need oh clave chairman im trying to give them some quiet can you take the talk to the commons clave and anthon were intimidated into silence jeffer asked can any of them answer questions theyre asleep they havent said anything sensi ble her husband merely nodded lawri went back in rus tling sounds receded for a moment she felt remorse jef fer would want to see the strangers as much as anyone when the burns healed the strangers would be hand some but in weird fashion only birds wore the gaudy colors of their scorched clothing their skin was dark their lips and noses were broad their hair was like black pillows the youngest girl stirred thrashed and opened her eyes tide she said wonderingly the dark eyes fo cused whore you im lawri the scientist youre in citizens tree youre safe now the girl twisted to see the others wend one of you died the girl moaned can you tell me who you are and how you came here im carlot the girl said two tears were growing were serjent house loggers there was afire the whole tree caught fire wend got caught when the water tank let go she shook her head teardrop globules flew wide all right carlot have some water then go to sleep carlots drinking technique was surprising she took the pottery vessel set two fingers to nearly block the opening then jerked the pottery vessel toward her face the jet of water struck her lower lip she tried again and reached her mouth would you like something to eat foliage whats that lawri went out to strip some branchlets of their foli age carlot looked dubiously at the fluffy green stuff oh its greens you know it ive been in a tree tuft she tasted it this is sweet older tree she continued eating lawri said later ill get you some stew you should sleep now carlot patted the wicker floor how can i sleep with this pushing up against me all my blood wants to settle on one side larry niven london tree lawns home had been bigger with a stronger tide in citizens tree you could drop a stone from eye level and draw a slow breath and let it out before the stone struck but this carlot must be used to no tide at all she turned over gingerly her eyes closed and she was asleep they moved through the green gloom of the corridor back toward the commons anthon said i always won dered lawri doesnt take orders from you either does she jeffer laughed treefodder no clave said i really wanted to ask them some ques tions before we tackle the firetree we cant wait jeffer said lets go see what we can scavenge this is the most interesting thing that has happened to us in fourteen years its bound to bring changes like what clave grinned at jeffer theyve already changed your home life you cant sleep in the scientists hut and lawri wont leave ive got the children too im living in the bachelors longhut with my three kids and rather look i want to go now before that burned tree drifts too far anthon ready said the jungle giant clave nodded reluctantly just us three stet well round up some kids to run the treadmill and lets take those wings along i want to try them the tree still burned fire had eaten six or seven klom ters in from the midpoint along the lee side progressing alongside the waterfall channel where there was partial protection from the wind the flames streamed east like the mane of a skyhorse at the midpoint there were only red patches glowing in black char in the center of the the smoke ring burn was a prominent uneven lump jeffer eased the i carm toward that clave said i dont understand why it hasnt come apart anthon nodded uneasily jeffer said it s a short tree i with a tuft missing its even shorter tide would pull harder on a grown tree but that thing could still come apart while were on it i dont ever want to go through that again anthon asked why do trees come apart they do it when theyre dying clave said jeffer said when a tree drifts too far away from the smoke ring median it starves it saves itself by coming i apart the tide takes half of it out half in one half falls back to where the water and fertilizer are the other half dies i guess i still dont see any bugs clave said its the bugs that eat a tree apart isnt it the tree isnt getting fed so the bark lets the bugs get inside i dont know everything clave pity they were close enough now to make out black lumps at the center of the charred region there a shape like a huge seed pod split open from inside there a thin shell of char a bell shape not unlike the firespitting nostrils at the carms aft end a ridge of white ash joined the bell to the split pod beyond several fragile sheets of charred wood the remains of an oblong hut with interior walls clave reached for the wings hed bound to cargo hooks scientist can you hold the carm here well go see what there is to see if the tree breaks in half youll still have us tethered i jeffer stifled a protest he ached to explore that ruined structure but i can handle it take lines too i the sun would be dead east in a few tens of breaths a stick protruded from the butt end of each fanshaped larry niven wing after some experimentation they settled for lining the stick along their shins and binding them with the straps the wings tended to hang up on things even when folded clave and anthon wriggled through the airlock and flapped into the sky jeffer tapped the white button prikazyvat voice he said the carm said ready jeffer the scientist clave and anthon fluttered erratically through the air suddenly anthon moved purposefully toward the blister of charred machinery moving easily as if he had always been a bird clave moved after him fighting a tendency to veer left they swept away the white ash that lay between the bell and the tank the ash enclosed them in cloud when the cloud dispersed they had exposed a length of tube and a loose webbing of metal strands around it kendy for the state hello jeffer jeffer didnt jump hello kendy what do you make of all this youd know more about the injured plant than i ive been studying the machinery within the bow window the metal strands and the enclosed pipe began blinking an outline of red light these the pipe and the chicken wire are metal the ruptured tank another blinking outline appears to have been a large seed pod the cone is half of a similar seed pod the ash around the pipe appears to be wood ash were looking at a steam rocket jeffer your invad ers used a wood fire to heat the pipe they ran water through the pipe and into the nozzle very inefficient but in your peculiar environment they could move a tree with that slowly of course why would they pick an injured tree ask them did any survive ones dead five more are in bad shape my wife wont let me near them wait a few days and see the smoke ring clave and anthon flew along the split in the great tank they reached the cluster of black oblongs at the other end the checker said their wounds wont become in fected we didnt bring disease bacteria what i was thinking aloud i want to talk to your invaders take them on a tour jeffer when theyre ready show them the carm kendy im not sure i want them to know about you i will observe only clave and anthon were flapping back to the carm they carried blackened cargo and they no longer wore tethers company coming jeffer said jeffer youve concealed your contact with me from the rest of your tribe havent you i havent mentioned it to them yet ill keep my silence while others are aboard play the game any way you like clave and anthon returned black with soot they un tied the nowclumsy wings then wiggled in pushing arm fuls of blackened salvage ahead of them clave crowed i love it its really flying you never did like tide did you clave hows the leg it never gets any better clave flexed his right leg the misshapen lump on his thighbone bulged beneath the skin and muscle the compound fracture hed suffered in carther states had healed but in the jungle there had been no tide to tell the bone to stop growing it feels like i strained it if i have to fly any distance ill use just one wing they set to mooring their loot along the walls two tremendous hooks wood stiffened with metal a meters length of metal band with tiny teeth along one edge a larry niven hardwood tube had kept its shape if not its strength the remnants of charred plastic hose clung to one end weapons and tools clave said there was wire twisted together like a harebrain net but it was burned through in too many places nothing else worth taking except the pipe weve got to have that pipe we moored the lines to it jeffer lets pull it loose it must be important given that youve moored the carm to a tree thats about to come apart why just because its metal ive got a vague idea what this setup is for clave said we could duplicate everything except the pipe in theory anyway the pipe isnt just metal its starstuff something out of the old science why do you say that we couldnt find a seam anthon said it gleams when you rub away the soot clave im not sure i like any of this jeffers right that tree could come apart and throw us spinning across the sky and for what wings sure those are wonderful but the rest of this is just weird clave the chairman said pull that pipe out scien tist anthon fumed and was silent jeffer said strap down lets hope the tethers hold under attitude jets the carm shuddered and lurched then six meters of metal pipe two hundred cemeters across pulled loose in a cloud of ash when anthon and clave went out to retrieve it jeffer went too they watched grinning while he thrashed and spun and suddenly he was flying kicking stifflegged across the sky like any swordbird they bound the pipe up against the hull and took the carm back to citizens tree the burning tree continued to drift west and in lawri kept the citizens away from her hut for five days the smoke ring a full wakingsleeping cycle that became impossible when she sent rather for food rather came back with waterbird stew and clave jeffer gavving minya debby jayan jinny mark jill and a host of children she kept them outside while the strangers ate then she and jeffer pulled the huts entrance apart it could be re built later the man named himself booce serjent he shaped his words strangely he named the others his wife ryllin and their daughters mishael karilly and carlot weve delayed the funeral until youre strong enough clave said can you make yourself discuss funeral practices booce shrugged painfully we cremate the ashes go into the earthlife tanks what do you do here the dead go to feed the tree all right chairman clave what has happened to logbearert i dont understand logbearer is our ship you saw a burning tree the fire started around logbearer in the middle we went there we brought back a metal pipe and some other stuff you saved the main feed pipe how we used the carm its an old starstuff relic still working we use it to move the tree booce smiled and sighed and seemed about to drift off to sleep lawri asked what are you carlot said loggers let him alone im awake the older woman sounded tired im ryllin yes were loggers we take lumber back to the clump and sell it there chairman clave asked you mean there are men in there ryllins laugh chopped off as if it had hurt her more than a thousand with children near two thousand larry niven the smot thousands huh and you move trees dont you have trees in the clump no the tides wrong how do you move a tree you cut off one tuft then the wind only blows on the other tuft booce generally takes us west so of course we want the log to go east so we cut the in tuft the wind pushes just on the out tuft so it pushes the tree west and that slows it down the tree drops closer to voy and speeds up the children and some adults were looking confused we taught them this lawri thought angrily west takes you in pushing a tree against the smoke rings rotation west would drop it closer to voy lower orbits were faster orbits the tree would move east toward the clump but of course we need the rocket too ryllin was saying a rocket is a tank of water and a nozzle and a metal pipe with a fire around it you run water through the pipe the steam sprays away from where you want to go without the pipe theres no log bearer you un derstand reaction effects the citizens looked at each other children understood the law of reaction before they could speak ryllin said well when you get to the clump you sever the other tuft and work the log to a mooring with the steam rocket then you have to sell it weve done it all our lives but the pipefire got away from us lawri im tired gavving said sell forget it ryllin everybody out lawri ordered chairman can you move them the citizens drifted away in clumps of heated discus sion four sleeps after reaching citizens tree all of the ser jents were on their feet various citizens volunteered to lead them about they moved tentatively slowed by heal ing bums and unaccustomed to tide tb tently and spoke in voweltwisting aecen words but for karilly who huddled ck of her family silent booce and his family came back tired t was primitive and roomy and oddly bea izens had managed well with so little lawri the scientist looked them over ai well enough to attend a funeral chapter four the in tuft from the citizens tree cassettes year sm integral trees these integral trees grow to tremendous size when such a plant reaches its full growth it stabilizes by tidal effect it forms a long slender trunk tufted with green at both ends tens of thousands of radial spokes circling le voys star each scores of kilometers long like many plants of the smoke ring the in tegral tree is a soil collector the endpoints are subjectto tidal gravity and wind the tufts are in a perpetual wind blowing from the west at the inner tuft and from the east at the outer tuft the tideoriented trunk bows to the winds curving into a single nearly horizontal branch at each end giving it the appearance of an in the smoke ring tegration sign the tufts sift fertilizer from the wind soil water even animals and plants smashed by impact freefall conditions prevail everywhere ex cept in the integral trees the medical dangers of life in freefall are well known if discipline has indeed abandoned us if we are indeed ma rooned within this weird environment we could do worse than to settle the tufts of the integral trees claire dalton sociology medicine foliage framed half a world of sky the treemouth faced west at the junction between branch and trunk spine branches migrated west along the branch carrying whatever their foliage had picked up from the wind to be swallowed by the conical pit citi zens came too to feed the tree the treemouth was their toilet their garbage disposal and their cemetery lawri the scientist had described all of this in advance booce tried to tell himself that it made sense it was rea sonable in context it only took getting used to wend had been placed at the lip of the pit shed had time to ride the spine branches halfway into the cone of the treemouth booce was glad that he could not see her better burning was cleaner reducing the body to ashes burned away memories too how was karilly taking it karilly was the quiet one she obeyed orders but rarely showed initiative she almost never spoke to strangers a good child but booce had never really understood her she hadnt been burned all of them had watched wend die how could it be worse for karilly but she hadnt spoken a word since the fire larry niven chairman clave spoke welcoming wend into the tribe lawri spoke of a citizens last duty to feed the tree ryllin spoke her memories of her lost daughter karilly cried silently the tears sheathed her eyes in crystal older citizens ate first booce saw his daughters hang ing back they had learned that much already while a citizens tree girlchild filled his bowl with waterbird stew from a large crude ceramic pot he lurched away across the wovenspinebranch floor of the commons following his wife trying to keep his bowl upright you think of the tide as something to fight his wife said softly think of it as a convenience hah tide gives you a preferred direction something to push against look with the bowl held in one hand ryllin leapt onelegged into the air and spun in a slow circle before her feet touched the floor again she hadnt spilled a drop moving isnt unpleasant in a tide its just different these ah citizens make us look clumsy but we can ad just love we will adjust stet ive climbed trees all my life company they were surrounded by children a pudgy half grown girl said how do you move a tree without a carm booee said lets sit down and ill tell you a dozen children waited patiently while booce and ryllin nested themselves in foliage then they all settled at once booce thought while he ate he said you need a rocket my rocket was logbearer and it was my fathers rocket before me to make a rocket you need a rocket one asked how did anyone build the first rocket booce smiled at the dwarf boy the first rocket was given by discipline it had a mind the library and the admiralty still has that with more knowledge in it than the smoke ring youll find in your little cassettes anyway youve got to have a rocket so you can get to the pod groves a woman of booces own size settled within earshot booce pretended not to notice the biggest pod you can find in the pod grove becomes your water tank you cut another pod in half and its your rocket nozzle you run the pipe into the stem end you wrap sikenwire around the pipe to hold the firebark you light the firebark you pump water through the hot pipe and it turns to steam and goes racing out the nozzle and that pushes you the other way the pudgy girl though all the children looked a bit pudgy well fed and compressed by tide asked where does pipe come from i dont know discipline maybe if there ever was a discipline the children snickered booce didnt know why so he ignored it theres a hundred and twenty meters of pipe in the empire so they tell me and forty eight of that makes up the pipes in eleven logging ships woodsman carried a spare pipe but theyre richer than we are so a rocket is one and a half pods and a pipe and some sikenwire and the hut complex at the other end of the tank you need big hooks for towing saws to carve up wood and crossbows because youve got to find your own food a trip takes a year or two most of us travel in families now you find a sting jungle the honey hornets live in the sting jungles and theres nothing so big they cant kill it you need to cover yourself all over to get at the nest honey is sticky red stuff sweeter than foliage now you pick a tree if its more than forty klomters long the woodll be too coarse and youll be forever com ing home thirtys about right you moor your rocket at the midpoint but you dont use it yet you paint a line of honey down the trunk to one of the tufts then you gash the bark in a circle above the tuft and paint honey larry niven along that you know the bugs that eat a tree apart if it starts to die heads nodded the serjents had been told of the death of daltonquinn tree children must hear that tale early booce said the bugs follow the honey down they eat the honey above the tuft then theyre stuck because theyve eaten all the honey theres nothing left to eat but wood after a few sleeps the tuft drops off there were sounds of dismay we dont use occupied trees you know booce said gently the tree would die anyway when it gets near the clump integral trees want a straightforward tidal pull straight through voy the pudgy girl asked a little coldly how many trees have you killed booce saw that she was almost an adult her height had fooled him the tide had stunted her growth ten the dwarf an adult too with beard beginning to sprout asked why do you cut off the tuft to move you know the rule west takes you in in takes you east i want the tree to move east back to the clump so i cut the in tuft now ive got a west wind blowing on the out tuft and nothing at the in stump to catch the wind the tree accelerates west it drops toward voy things move faster when their orbits are closer to voy so the tree moves east after a while im in from the clump and still moving thats when i need the rocket i have to cut off the other tuft then fire the rocket to move the tree into the clump the dwarf boy asked what then then i sell the log for what i can get and hope nobody else brought a log in at the same time if there are two of us competing we might not get enough to pay us for the work most of the children looked puzzled the dwarf asked what went wrong this time booces throat closed up his decision with some re r the smoke ring lief he heard ryllin say we were in a hurry we thought we could get more water for the rocket so we set the rocket going before the tuft dropped off that started a fire wend was trying to get out of the huts when the water tank well it got too hot and booce jumped in hastily the water tank split open wend got caught cariot and i were burned pulling her out of the steam we were steering the log for that pond out there and your tree moved in front of it so it was the closest so we made for it and you found six of us clinging to the trunk like toes in hair and and wend was dead and the rest of us were ready to die i think the adults had all been served the children drifted toward the cookpot booce ate hed let his stew get cold likely he would never see the clump again it was as well he and his family would be paupers there he had never owned anything but logbearer itself and even that was gone but was it really beyond belief that these people could build another logbearer when all the adults were eating the children drifted into line at the cookpot rather was just ahead of three tall and dark young women and just behind his brother harry take jills place rather told harry why should i beats me will you do it all right the favor would be repaid rather would take harrys place at the cookpot or in the treadmill or show him a wrestling trick something these things didnt need dis cussion harry stepped out of line and talked to jill where she was serving stew jill served herself and harry took her place the blond girl joined rather whats that for she asked but she seemed pleased ive been listening to the old ones now i want to larry niven talk to the girls come along if they wouldnt talk to a dwarf boy maybe theyd talk to a girl they followed the serjent girls as they made their ex aggeratedly careful way across the commons wicker floor the refugees settled slowly into the foliage keeping their eyes fixed on their bowls stew still slopped over the edge ofcariots bowl the holes too big she said you just need practice im jill hes rather how do you eat when youre at the midpoint jill and rather settled across from them rather stripped four branchlets for chopsticks jill said id take a smoked turkey along what do you use bowls with smaller holes yes and we carry these carlot produced a pair of bone sticks ornately carved youre lucky youve al ways got spine branches these are branchlets the spine branches are the big ones the third girl karilly had not spoken she was con centrating fully on her bowl mishael said you seem to be happy rather found the comment disconcerting what do you mean you all of you youve got your tree and its all you need lumber from the bare end of the branch the clothes you wear the cloth comes from branchlet fibers doesnt it its foliage with the sugar washed out and the dye is from berries water comes running down the trunk into that basin and you eat foliage and catch meat from the sky and theres the carm without the carm youd have to build a rocket to move the tree right rather thought we dont know how to do that the carm is all that keeps us from being savages is that how they see us we had to leave the tree to get our lines and the adults keep talking about earthlife crops they couldnt bring seeds and eggs with them the smoke ring you could buy them in the market if you were rich enough jill said we dont know those words rich buy carlot said rich means you can have whatever you want like being chairman no mishael took over look suppose you want earthlife seeds or pigeons or turkeys stet you go to the market and you find what you want then youve got to buy it you need something to give the owner metal maybe we dont have much metal rather said what are the people like like you sometimes carlot said what do you mean tall dark we get dark and light short and well mostly were about as tall as me and the men are taller no dwarves oh of course there are dwarves in the navy what do you think of dwarves he hadnt meant to ask so directly he hadnt realized how important the question was to him carlot asked what do you think of my legs rather blushed theyre fine they were hidden anyway carlot was wearing the scarlet tunic and pan taloons of citizens tree ones longer than the other my teachers got one leg longer than mine and one leg like yours and it never both ers him and the admirals got an arm like a turkey wish bone ive seen him were all kinds rather it was marks habit to eat near the cauldron where others might find him rarely did he get company this day he was mildly surprised when clave and minya set tled themselves across from him they plucked branchlets and ate presently clave asked what do you think of the serjents theyre doing all right larry niven that wasnt what i meant clave said while minya was saying what will they do to citizens tree oh mark thought it over half of you came from the in tuft of a broken tree you were from the out tuft minya three from carther states lawri and me from london tree london tree used to raid carther states for copsiks fourteen years weve been living here and nobodys killed anyone yet we can live with the serjents too clave said oh we can live with them while minya wondered what do they think of us clave snorted they think were a little backward and theyd like to talk us into going to the clump where was this leading mark asked are you think ing they want the carm no not that not impossible either have you talked to gavving or debby lately they dont like my company neither do you minya minya ignored that theyre trying to figure out how to build a steam rocket starting with just the metal tube they brought back uh a mark saw the point now they can build us a machine that moves trees around they can tell us why we should all go to the clump so youre a little nervous chairman we could lose half the tribe lawri keeps saying there arent enough of us now and what do you want mark mark would have wished for a wife or three but he saw no point in telling clave or minya that i want noth ing from the clump were here twelve adults twenty children happy as dumbos in citizens tree we shouldnt be announcing that all over the sky even if the clump doesnt keep copsiks maybe somebody out there does things arent perfect here but theyre good i wouldnt want to wind up as somebodys copsik clave nodded thats what im afraid of the smoke ring minya said we worked so hard to make this our home gavving knows how close we came to dying how can he risk what weve got we seem to be agreed clave said briskly well what do we do about it lawri and jeffer were missing dinner lawri had led her husband east along the branch beyond the region of the huts in a dark womb of foliage and branchlets they were making babies resting relaxed for the first time in many days lawri plucked foliage and put it in jeffers mouth he talked around it indistinctly does this remind you of being young she lost her smile no he leered little london tree boys and girls never snuck off into the foliage she shook her head violently it isnt like that for a girl in london tree when boys get old enough they dont need us they go to the in tuft copsik women be long to any male citizen jeffer you know that much i should thats how mark got minya pregnant be fore we got loose she changed position to lie along his length if he did any man can father a dwarf even rather doesnt believe that bother him yeah but women had children in london tree didnt they and married yes if we were willing to act like copsiks ourselves how else could we compete i wouldve been some mans copsik if i wanted to make babies so i never made ba bies jeffer looked into her eyes as if seeing her for the first time are you glad i came she nodded perhaps he couldnt see her blushing in the neardarkness larry niven why didnt you ever tell me that was a stupid question knowing how she needed him hed use his advantage to win arguments this wasnt what we came to talk about did we come to talk what did you find on the burned tree we didnt keep any secrets thats right you wer ent there when booce was telling us what we had well we got a pot full of charred stuff honey he said and a metal thing for cutting wood and hooks miscella neous stuff and the metal pipe everything else that burned ive forgotten what he called it all but it can all be replaced except the what did booce call it the sik enwire i want to go to the clump lawri said me too clave would never let both scientists go jeffer kissed her cheek lets wait till the last minute and then fight about it what about the sikenwire well think of something do you think clave will let us take the carm no she felt him shrug okay we go as loggers she nodded and he said id guess clump citizens will all look like jungle giants we should have a few anthon and debbyll come a couple of the serjents for guides defenses we wouldnt want to risk the carm in the clump but we could take the silver suit wrong a lot of citizens dont want anything changed clave thinks were too close to the clump al ready he wants to take us farther west mark agrees with him yeah ive talked to mark treefodder without him we cant use the silver suit lawri clave wants to move us west what are you thinking the smoke ring we dont know enough yet forget it look what you missed when you were a little girl whatever the disagreements now roiling through cit izens tree there was at least this bone of consensus they all wanted to fly the serjent girls were willing from branchwood sticks and from cloth that was made on the looms below the branch they made wings karilly worked quietly and skillfully and without words mishael and carlot ex plained as they went and corrected the mistakes of the children who emulated them the work went fast citi zens would wear their old tunics and pants for half a year longer for cloth was not made quickly but twentyfour wings were ready within twelve days jeffer took mishael minya gawing and eight of the older children to the midpoint via the lift other children ran with zeal in the treadmill knowing that theirs would be the next flight jeffer had chosen with some care these were the chil dren who had not shied back from crossing to the pond on the day of the firetree yet there had been lines to cling to then today there was only bark and some of them clung to that rather flew and was instantly in love with wings jill looked like she was facing death but when wings were bound to her ankles and rather was already in the sky she flew mishael served as instructor jeffer learned how to kick how to turn when the sky was filled with winged adults and children the rest gulped hard and loosed their hold on the bark and flew they were in the sky for one full circle of the sun the adults had their hands full herding them back to the lift arth made a game of it fleeing across the sky until jeffer and gawing closed in on him and pulled his wings off the sun was rising up the east before they had the children rounded up larry niven then jeffer sent the others down without him he told minya i want to do some maintenance start the lift again after youre down kendy for the state hello scientist hello kendy how are your refugees four of the serjents recovered one of the girls kar illy looks okay but she doesnt talk shock she may recover when may i see them kendy i wanted to give mishael a tour of the carm the chairman vetoed that hes afraid theyll try to steal the carm nonsense what do the rest of your tribe think were split down the middle half of us want to go see whats in the clump theyve got a place the market where we could get anything we want the serjents told us about it and the chairman is scared spitless of the clump he thinks were too close now some of the others feel the same way jayan and jinny of course but mark and minya too even the serjents dont all want to leave marks asked ryllin for permission to marry karilly and she gave it good how do you feel about this jeffer want to see the clump booce told me theyve got something they call the library but it sounds like a carm autopilot i want to scan their cassettes kendy im doing what i can i just took some of them flying they like that maybe theyll start wondering what else theyre missing i remember clave he leads his citizens where they want to go call a council force your citizens to make a decision what good does that do us if you lose the vote youll know where you stand the smoke ring then make clave set a date for moving the tree decide what you need and who you need is there any chance you can talk mark around none the serjents told you how to go about setting up a logging enterprise tell me the children slept on exhausted by their flying gavv ing was making an early breakfast on a slice of smoked dumbo meat he said the admiralty has earthlife plants weve lived without them for fourteen years minya said sleepily we lived without lifts and the carm for longer than that it was because we didnt know the admiralty has never touched us we wouldnt know it exists except that booce tells us so but you want to know more arent these matters more properly dis cussed in council gavving looked closely at his wife you looked like this fourteen years ago when you were trying to kill me the whole tuft is like that there hasnt been fighting like this since the war of london tree i havent forgotten london tree we made a home here any change is for the worse dear are you sorry they came no minya said with some force she was fully awake now there arent enough of us we all feel that lawri the scientist talks about the gene pool being too small we dont need that gibberish we can feel were too few now we have three more women even if ryllin is too old to host a guest and theyre different from us they are indeed well thats good suppose they want to go home they cant minya said flatly larry niven a child stirred qwen gavving lowered his voice suppose we built them another rocket suppose some of us wanted to go with them minya stopped to sort words through her head gavv ing waited patiently presently she said theyd have to be crazy wed have to be crazy to let them go gav have you forgotten london tree no i havent forgotten quinn tuft either or carther states they didnt make citizens into copsiks and neither did your people no but we attacked you the instant we saw you true do you remember being lost in the sky clinging to a sheet of bark and dying of thirst we faced dangers we cant even describe to our children because they were too strange we fought hard for citizens tree and now both scientists want to cross a thousand klomters to the clump shouting here we are why do you want to risk what weve got theyve got things to trade theyve got wings weve got wings we picked jet pods when we could find them all this time and its so simple minya what would you have given for a pair of wings when we were stranded in the sky everything in the smoke ring can fly except men and all it takes is spine branches and cloth theyve got a rocket that moves a tree and it isnt stolen starstuff its made mostly from things they find in the smoke ring what have they got in the clump what havent we seen yet she put bitterness in her laughter a thousand people and a drastic need for copsiks maybe gavving sighed stet you dont want anything changed what should we do theyre here make them welcome said minya teach them the smoke ring how to live in a tree get the girls married make them part of us gavving mark intends to marry karilly karillys sick in the mind she isnt getting over it sure and marks a dwarf hes needed a wife and none of us would touch him never did feel sorry for the copsik runner but but hes willing to take care other and i think you ought to marry one of the other girls bang gavving stared this was a woman afraid of changes i am married clave has two wives anthon did until lisa died im getting too old to make babies dear you dont mean no she hugged him but it wont give me a guest to carry youre serious okay who she hesitated then bravely i would have thought mishael shes the oldest gavving she showed me how to fly i like her have you mentioned any of no you fool a woman doesnt ask a woman to be her wife and when he laughed she smiled weakly gavving saw how difficult this was for her minya must have thought long and hard about this theres room to extend the hut she said wed have another pair of hands adult hands the children are growing up theyre not as much fun any more and if some of us marry serjent women well have their loyalty when the admiralty comes to us logbearer cant be the only ship in the sky gavving wondered if his brain was working in the service of his seeds minya had not referred to mishaels alien beauty and if we do visit the clump his brain ran on well need guides booce or ryllin would have to go with their daughters among us wed have their loyalty chapter fwe the silver suit from the admiralty cassettes year sm we were chosen for this no citizen leaves earth orbit until the state has learned his tol erance for freefall one in ten thousand have the genetic quirks to survive months or years of freefall without softening of the bones with out failure of the digestive system without the terror of falling we served the state by flying to the stars when the drive was off we played at flying while cramped in a seeder ramship with barely room to flap our arms here is real flight of course the smoke ring seems an incredible dream come true to us sharon levoy astrogation kendy for the state hello jeffer its been more than thirty days the smoke ring i was busy we got our council its over how did it go we lost who sided against you clave jayan and jinny minya mark five out of ten if you count the serjents twelve thirteen mishaels old enough and married too but she acts like a junior wife she wont make minya or gavving angry gavving doesnt want to fight with minya the serjents dont think like citizens yet anthon wont get into the arguments im not really sure where he stands the rest of us want to see whats out there but we dont all want it enough debby loves arguing but shes not very good at it we didnt give clave any trouble at all youre disappointed dont be did you think that flying would bring them around people tend to side with authority and authority tends to protect its own power clave is the key clave has everything he wants in citi zens tree kendy do you see us as savages yes dont take that too seriously scientist i would probably see the admiralty as savages too i want to ed ucate you all then educate me kendy i cant just take booce and ryllin and go off into the sky we you must go jeffer the wealth of the l point is almost irrelevant it takes many people to hold a civili zation together there are too few of you here to be more than savages jeffer didnt react to the insult barring an increase in infrared radiation from his cheeks neck and ears wed need things citizens tree cant spare lawris on my side but we cant both go the tree needs a scientist wed have to take the carm too we take it youre not serious daltonquinn tree died because larry niven we couldnt move it i wont see it happen to citizens tree bring the carm back when youre through with it jeffer paused to think kendy never did that it was another reason to distrust kendy he seemed to leap at his answers without forethought we might lose the carm you can build a steam rocket jeffer im drifting out of range weve got one pipe and we need that to be loggers without the pipe citizens tree couldnt build a steam rocket i wouldnt have believed that so much could change in twenty sleeps kendy the signal dissolved in noise kendy returned to his records for twenty state years carm had been taking pic tures not just through the carm cameras but through the fisheye lens on the pressure suit too here the squirrel cage that ran a musclepowered lift and the lines leading up far too much footage of that here fire burned in a great bowl of soft clay the silver suit moved around the edges of the fire poking it or ad justing sheets of bark that had been set as vanes to channel the wind into the burning wood the look of the clay began to change here less fire than smoke what looked like enough spaghetti to feed sol systems entire state government had been spread leeward of smoldering wood the pres sure suit moved around and within the mass turning it and loosening the strands vines with the handle of a harpoon so that the smoke would cure them these were the lines that now served citizens tree ingenious a poor way to treat state property but they were making use of local resources too the platformaround the cookpot was of boards tied with line it had always been flimsy and that didnt matter the smoke ring much in citizens trees low tide but over the years the lines had loosened jayan and jinny complained about the way the platform lurched while they tried to make dinner so rather and carlot had been sent to repair the platform rather enjoyed the work it called for muscle rather than dexterity he lifted one end of a new branchwood plant into place he called hold this and waited until carlot was set then he bounded down to the other end and hoisted that carlot giggled rather began to tie the planks one loop of line to hold it then he could work on a more elaborate mooring he asked whats funny never mind carlot said are you going to tie this for me i thought id just leave you there you make a good mooring and decorative too oh she held the planks in place with one arm while she reached out her right leg was twenty cemeters longer than the left and she usually reached with that her long toes grasped a coil of line and pulled it to her hands she tied a temporary binding in the twentytwo sleeps since their arrival all of the serient family had become dextrous in citizens tree tide rather wrapped a dozen loops of line around the plank ends then began tightening them heave on a loop pull the slack around again from the opening beyond the treemouth the wind blew steadily drying sweat as fast as it formed carlot called from her corner thats as tight as i can get it rather was finished at his end he jogged down to car lots end and began pulling in slack shed left a good deal of course carlot was agile but not strong he asked what got you giggling just the way you scurry larry niven rathers hands paused for less than a second then con tinued you did ask she said defensively you have to go running back and forth because you cant reach as far as i know that did you make this cauldron yourselves i wouldnt have thought you could do that here its big enough to boil two people at once hey carlot you dont really eat people in the em pire do you she laughed at him no theres a happyfeet tribe thats supposed to do that but how did you make it the grownups found a glob of gray mud west of the tree maybe it was the middle of a pond that came apart they brought some back we took all the rocks in citizens tree and piled them in a bowlshape out on the branch where we couldnt do any damage i was just a kid but they let me help with the rocks we plastered the mud over the rocks we got firebark from another tree and piled it in the bowlshape and fired it it took a dozen days to cool off and then it was like that we did it twice youre cute she said solemnly carlot was a year older than rather an exotic beauty was growing in her half her hair had been burned off and she had cut the rest to match now it was like a skull cap of black wire she was two and a half meters tall with long fingers and long agile toes and arms and legs that could reach out forever carlot affected rather in ways he wasnt quite ready to accept he said put it in the treemouth when do i get to be overwhelmingly handsome cute is good if i werent your aunt treefodder are you not my nephew rather studied his work i think were done its an empire thing is it you dont make babies even with the smoke ring relatives of relatives fine but youve got a thousand people in the empire at least thats what your parents say we had ten adults and twenty children when you came i wont get much choice about who i marry who then he shrugged jills a half year older than me all the other girls are younger id have to wait the subject made him uncomfortable he looked up past the treadmill and along the trunk to where a handful of citizens were trying their wings i wish i was up there youve been flying all your life havent you i should be there showing you people how to fly this damn fluff carlot said long sleeves were sewn loosely to her tuftberryscarlet tunic she pulled one away the green fur along her arm had turned brown the patch had shrunk hows yours she touched his cheek the patch felt half numb and raspy it ran from his face down his neck and across part of his chest its drying up ten days itll be cleared up too treefeeding slow we just have to stay in the shade for a while fluff needs sunlight yeah from eastward his first mothers voice called above the windroar rather rather bounded toward minya across the floor of braided livespine branches carlot gave him a good head start then bounded after him her asymmetric legs gave her an odd run a pleasure to watch boundbound boundbound lowflying flight soon shed be faster than jill she reached minya a good six meters ahead of rather turned and flashed a grin at him she lost it im mediately crawled too far toward the treemouth and now he cant minya stopped and began again rather its the children harry and qwen and gorey went crawling larry niven around in the old west rooms gorey went too far and harry and qwen cant reach him and he cant get out you cant get to him i didnt try rather we dont know how long it was before harry came to get us oh harry would have tried to rescue gorey him self then spent more time working up the nerve to tell his mother and gorey was only five ill need some kind of knife he said what im no narrower than you are first mother im just shorter i may have to cut through some spine branches the wind didnt reach marks long hair and beard they held the sweat like two sponges the slab of hard branchwood strapped to his back massed as much as he did he scrambled up the slope of the treadmill panting trying to stay higher than karilly and seven children with a weight on his back mark was the equal of any two adults the treadmill was six meters across and four wide a fragile wheel of branchwood sticks water running down the trunk helped to spin it but runners were still needed it was getting easier the treadmill was spinning faster the cages must be almost passing each other out mark panted runners out seven laughing children jumped from both sides of the treadmill until only mark and karilly were left above was a sudden glare as the sun passed into view karillys dark skin shone with sweat she breathed deeply as she bounded uphill alongside him he knew she could understand him karilly when the up cage is at the top it doesnt weight anything it takes all of us to lift the down cage right now the cages are next to each other i can run by myself in a little while the down cage will be falling ill have to get out use the smoke ring the brake slow it down she watched him as if she were listening so you jump out now then he saw that she was afraid okay he let the cage carry him around inverted he scrambled down the other side im slowing it can you get out now karilly scrambled out twenty klomters over his head lawri and her student flyers must be wondering what had gone wrong mark started the cage spinning again letting his body do its accustomed work while his mind drifted long ago and far away there had been civilization london tree had had stationary bicycles to run the elevators to the tree midpoint and copsiks to run the bi cycles citizens tree was primitive they had london trees carm of course a thing of science dating from the day men came from the stars otherwise they must build everything mark had shown the refugees how to build a lift mark had wanted to make bicycles but the scientists had built the treadmill instead they kept the silver suit next to the treadmill with its helmet open citizens at the carm could call for the lift through the radio in the suit below him he could see the hollow space of the com mons and two children bounding east the tall dark girl was far ahead of the smaller boy who moved in slower shorter steps as if tide were heavier for him his son his size proved it mark would not have wished that on him yet rather would be the next silver man mark wondered if the citizens would appreciate their fortune in the short lifetime of citizens tree there had been no need for an invulnerable fighter and the sil ver suit had become a mere communications device had it not been for one stupid stubborn act mark would still be a citizen of london tree but he would never have seen the stars and he would never have seen his son larry niven the smoke ring the treadmill was spinning by itself mark jumped out he set the branchwood slab down he looked up along the trunk but he couldnt see the down cage yet well let it run for a bit if karilly could talk would she still smile at him like this he took her hand lawri wanted you with them you were afraid to go up werent you he had known a london tree citizen who was afraid of falling it was instinct gone wrong if such a woman were born in a place like carther states would she be afraid all the time until the added terror of a fire pushed her over the edge lawri wanted me up there too i wonder what its like flying but the silver suit caught his eye no his business in london tree had been war were there copsik runners in the clump karilly would know i wish you could talk the scientists cant marry us till you can say the words the key word is yes will you try yes mark he jumped debby she called from below yeah shall we relieve you mark swallowed his irritation the emptys coming down you want to brake when the suns at about eleven well do it debby and jeffer climbed up to join them hello karilly jeffer said you didnt go flying you should try it not me im the silver man i fly with the silver suit come on karilly maybe somebody would need muscle at the cookpot platform the tunnels ran through the tuft like wormholes in an apple unused tunnels tended to close up but passersby ate from the foliage as they passed so the tunnels in nor mal use stayed open one such tunnel ran past rathers home at its west end rather could have circled the hut with his legs this was the oldest section as the spine branches migrated west along the branch eventually to be swallowed by the treemouth enclosures tended to shrink the newest sections were the largest this disappearing section had been small when new it had housed only gavving and minya and the baby rather other children had come and gavving wove new rooms eastward faster than the treemouth could swallow them by now there were seven children and a new wife for gavving and a far bigger common room for the cit izens tree populace was growing too the original rooms had disappeared into the treemouth these that he was passing now wicker cages alongside the tunnel were still less than rathers height the children tended to claim these for their own rather found a deformed door as he crawled inside he heard minya saying keep going carlot go to the common room and get my old matchet off the wall and bring it back hurry harry eight years old and rathers height was crying into mishaels chest rather nodded to mishael second mother which way did he go straight west mishael seven years older than carlot had carlots dark exotic beauty in fully developed form and legs that caused even rather to stare long and slender and per fectly matched shed cut her trousers into loose shorts oddlooking in citizens tree the low roof cost her some dignity she had to crouch she looked uncomfortable and annoyed straight on in and hes stopped talking i think hes mad at us rather said you know this is no big deal dont you it happens all the time i dont know rather i still get the shivers in your crawling huts your parents just dont understand that and poor gorey he is frightened sure carlots coming with mothers matchet send larry niven her after me i need it to cut my way through it didnt feel odd to be speaking thus peremptorily to his second mother mishael wasnt that much older than rather she was new to all this and it showed rather crawled west memories tried to surface around him his parents bedroom hed lived in a basket in a corner too small for a baby now the private dining area and ghosts of won derful smells were they in his nose or in his mind the common room and too many strangers hed cried and had to be taken away the spaces were distorted and tiny a greenblack womb the spine branches were still grow ing he tore them away with his fists tore through an old partition he didnt like this his past was too small to hold him gorey from west by north gorey yelled piercingly he sounded more angry than frightened how had he gotten thereat what had been a kitchen wall had crumpled and grown half a meter thick he must have found some way around rather carlot behind him he reached far back and took what was pushed into his hand thanks he pulled it to the level of his face turned it with some difficulty and pushed the blade further can you get to him one way or another for years the matchet had been no more than a part of the wall hed never really looked at it the handle was long and a bit too wide for his short fingers the blade was sixty cemeters of black metal tinged red by time time and use had serrated the edge it had once belonged to a navy man of london tree in this restricted space he must use it as a saw he didnt try to cut the wall he cut branchlets west of him the smoke ring he turned starboard still sawing through miscellaneous branchlets gorey cautiously doubtfully rath here give me your hand can you reach me i cant move rather saw a thrashing foot he pulled on it experi mentally gorey was pinned between a spine branch and a smooth dark wall the main branch itself he must have tried to crawl between them rather wriggled forward he sawed the spine branch half through reached farther and broke it with his hands gorey wriggled out and wrapped himself around his brother and clung presently he asked are they mad sure theyre mad how did you get here hide and seek yeah harry said he was gonna catch me and feed me to the triunes so i kept going then i was afraid the treemouth would get me and i got really scared harry wouldnt get that close to a triune family you know that yeah but i was mad youd starve to death before you reached the tree mouth here grab my foot and follow me the boys fingers were long enough to overlap rathers ankle he was already taller than rather they crawled out with easier going at every meter in the common room rathers mothers greeted him as a hero while gorey was scolded and petted rather took it with what grace he could he wondered if carlot was laughing at him but in fact she seemed to think he had done something actively dangerous it made him uncomfortable he was vastly relieved when gavving poked his head through the door tread mill runners he called rather and rather was res cued harry and carlot came with them as they neared the larry niven treemouth gavving said harry carlot why dont you see if they need help with the laundry pot they split off harry grumbling rather followed his father up through the tunnels to ward the treadmill his nerves were prickling something odd was going on father do they really need treadmill runners no gavving said without looking down the treadmill was at rest debby and jeffer lay in the foliage nearby eating and talking they sat up when gavving appeared got him gavving said this must have something to do with the serjent fam ily and the conference before the last sleep from which children were barred and the arguments that divided half the families in the tree do my mothers know about this would they approve rather asked instead should we have brought carlot no need rather we have to find out something gavving pointed at a short faceless fat man made of sil very metal try that on the silver suit yeah see if you can get into it rather looked it over this thing had a fearsome quasi scientific reputation it was a flying fighting machine stronger than crossbow bolts stronger than the airless ness beyond all that was known rather had never before seen it with its head closed jeffer instructed him lift this latch take the head and turn it pull up turn it the other way the head came up on a hinge this latch too now pull this down now pull it apart good the suit was open down the front and emptv can you get in wheres mark debby the smoke ring no problem we relieved him and he took karilly to the kitchen father wait listen im the only boy in the tree with two mothers and two fathers rather plunged on despite the sudden hurt in gavvings face weve never talked about this but i always knew sooner or later id does mark know what youre doing with the silver suit no whats it all about four big adults could make him do whatever they wanted and it didnt matter they needed his cooperation and he didnt know enough to give it jeffer the scientist said its about seeing whats out side citizens tree its learning about the smoke ring what we can use what we need to be afraid of or else its about staying savages until someone comes out of the sky to teach us the hard way were going to the clump gavving said well be safer if we can take the silver man uhhuh mark doesnt want to go right they watched as rather tried to get into the suit he had to get his legs in first then duck under the neck ring he closed the sliding catches the headpiece the latches the suit was loose around his belly snug everywhere else it fits jeffer closed the helmet on him he rotated it left until it dropped two mimeters then right rather was locked in a box his own size and shape the suit smelled faintly of former occupants of exertion and fear he moved his arms then his legs against faint resistance he turned and reached and plucked a handful of foliage good he could move he could move like a normal man the air was getting stale but jeffer was already larry niven turning the helmet lifting it the adults were smiling at each other gavving said okay get out of it getting out of the silver suit was as difficult as getting in rather said now tell me some of us are going to visit the clump do you want to come with us whos going how long will it take me said jeffer gavving booce and ryllin an thon and debby the clump is all jungle giants we need people that size how does the chairman hell try to stop us father i dont really like the thought of not ever com ing home gavving shook his head theyll want the carm back theyll want us back too citizens tree isnt so crowded that they can afford to lose anyone who breathes theyll want to know what we learned theyll want what we bring back half the citizens are on our side anyway they just dont want to buck the chairman youre taking the carmt we are gavving clapped him on the shoulder think about it weve got two sleeps to get ready what ever you decide dont mention this to anyone particu larly your mothers father youd better tell it all rather didnt con sider whether he had the right to ask clave wouldnt like this minya wouldnt like it and if he agreed to this it was only just coming to him if rather agreed then he was the silver man jeffer said it isnt just the wealth of the clump ad miralty its tell me what youre going to do they told him chapter six the appearance of mutiny from disciplined log year state sm medical readouts showed that the inhabit ants of carm lied to me they reacted strongly to accusation of mutiny i lost my chance to question them in detail they may have mutinied against legitimate holders of the carm heredity will tell its a bad habit i will break them of it sharls davis kendy checker clave pulled himself out of the elevator first wings were tethered next to the cage and he pulled one free and tied it in place along his left shin this was a good idea gavving wings arent much use in the tuft oh well keep some there too hunters used to carry jet pods wings are better but theres no point porting larry niven them up and down every time someone wants to fly what are you doing fixing this he chopped with his matchet at his other wing when ten cemeters were gone he tied the wing to his right shin he felt distinctly lopsided letter and gavving were also winged now the three flapped out toward the carm spurning the convenient handholds the bark afforded claves flight wavered then steadied hed been right this was easier on the warped muscles in his thigh jeffer was first through the airlock prikazyvat voice the carms deep voice said ready jeffer the sci entist a womans voice broke in jeffer its lawri i think i want to join you come on up bring something to eat well be running the main motor for maybe two days will do lawri out what was that about clave asked lawri doesnt trust me with the carm jeffer laughed now we refuel the beast clave sighed pump right you pump while do a checklist otherwise well lose the pondlet when we go under thrust some pumping had been done but megatons of water still nestled against the trunk clave ran the hose from the carm to the pondlet the pump was a wheel and a tube and piston all carved from hard branchwood clave braced his back and arms against the bark and kicked the wheel around with his feet on the spokes help would be appreciated he grunted gavving joined him the pump leaked the pond didnt dwindle fast but it dwindled they broke to drink thirstily then resumed pumping the sun had dropped from zenith to nadir which at the midyear was not behind voy but north by the smoke ring three full degrees when jeffer poked his head through the airlock stop the tanks full clave tossed his head to shake some of the sweat out of his hair come inside jeffer ushered them forward to the front row of seats strap down he tapped and vertical blue dashes appeared in the panel below the window four clusters of four each at the corners of a square and a larger dash in the center he tapped the central dash the sound within the cabin was like the roaring of wind at the treemouth clave felt a featherweight of tide and knew the tree was in motion jeffer told them were already placed right with the motor aimed west we thrust eastward that puts citizens tree in a wider orbit so we slow down and drift west away from the clump clave wondered if he wanted to watch from outside is it dangerous out there could be you dont want to fall into the flame any way the views better in here jeffers fingers danced and the carm window sprouted five smaller windows the ventral view got ruined when we fell back into the smoke ring jeffer you dont lecture this much unless youre ner vous whats wrong weve moved the tree before gavving laughed it appeared that he had a touch of nerves too remember how twitchy we were then mer ril was sure wed break the tree apart and kill ourselves clave shrugged he went aft and braced himself in the airlock what remained of the pondlet stretched itself out from the trunk then broke into one big drop and a line of little ones the mother pond theyd robbed twentytwo sleeps ago drifted west the sun passed voy and began to climb a fat triplefinned bird dead west by a klomter or three suddenly went into an epileptic seizure split into three larry niven slender birds and scattered clave was late in under standing what hed seen a triune family suddenly washed by the invisible heat of the carms exhaust clave went in and strapped down again he had been anticipating lawns arrival for some time but the carms roar covered her entry he turned to see her halfway up the aisle and debby behind her and ryllin and booce and carlot clave fumbled to release the buckle that bound him to the chair it took too long he was between jeffer and gavving with lawri behind him he sighed whats it all about jeffers fingers danced the board went blank he said we can fight or we can talk or we can talk and then fight but theres only oneof you clave cripple me and lawri flies the carm call for help if he could get past jeffer to use voice the elevator would still take a day to get up forget it voice connected to the silver suit which rather was now pulling headfirst through the airlock it would have felt good to hit somebody clave said ill be good now whats it all about were going to visit the admiralty jeffer said rather and booce were moving things inside two smoked turkeys a huge amount of foliage water pods all of us not you clave lawns staying too citizens tree needs a chairman and a scientist how did you decide there was a bit of an edge in lawris voice we knew one of us would have to stay now ive missed my time of blood im hosting a guest i wondered why the copsik was being so affectionate you should all be staying youre taking the carm the carm the silver suit and the pipe from log bearer they all looked very serious the background roar the smoke ring prompted clave to ask are you planning to set the tree moving first or was that a lie too well give you a days thrust jeffer said no more i wont be here to decelerate you and i want to be able to find you again with what would london tree have let you keep the carm the admiralty wont either patiently gavving said weve talked that over we wont take the carm into the clump theyll never know it exists jeffer will hide the carm somewhere the rest of us will go in as loggers with booce and ryllin to show us how claves mind was racing now listen to me will you listen yes chairman first are you all volunteers rather how did they suck you into this they cant go without the silver suit the boy said oh theyd go wouldnt you jeffer yes im going anyway rather said he didnt look like hed change his mind rather didnt even bother to argue though the boy was good at that clave knew how he would enlist a fourteenyearold boy put him in the silver suit call him the silver man offer him status and adventure carlot im going home the girl said defiantly debby but aglance told clave hed lost that battle debby was fiercely happy he hadnt seen her like this since the war of london tree what about anthon debby said i never told him jeffer i did get him talking he likes citizens tree just fine and he doesnt want any changes have you noticed how fat hes get ting too bad jeffer said clave said stet i accept that youre going to do this ive heard your speeches and youve heard mine and the larry niven treemouth can have them both but dont you see that this will tear citizens tree apart its mutiny hold it i mean its mutiny the way youve planned it if we dont fix that citizens tree will never recover its got to look better than it does the mutineers looked at each other heres how its got to be said clave first im going gawing isnt you said it and youre right the tree needs a chairman and its gawing gawing said thats silly youre im the treefeeding chairman and if go the expe dition is official besides that ive got to see to it that you return the carm and the silver suit the citizens would be crazy to settle for less i hereby appoint you my chairman pro tern until i return coolly gawing asked anything else yes you dont get both booce and ryllin one of them stays there has to be some reason for the serjents to bring us home we cant do that ryllin said booce takes care of logbearer i take care of business i do all the buying and selling anyone who sees one of us in the clump will expect to see us both clave was massaging the lump on his thigh sometimes that helped him think think the citizens you deal with the merchants if they deal with booce what will happen ryllin said my husband is very good with machinery not so good at trading he did much better after he had the good sense to marry me but logbearer understands him he without you theyll get a better trade damn right they will booce said bitterly then yes they will theyll like that they wont be too curious about where their luck comes from the smoke ring it was ryllin who nodded its all right love think of a story theyll want to believe it but were missing three daughters too the house they must have finished building our house by now the girls and i are with logbearer or were at the house wherever youre not maybe im somewhere in the market buying furniture that was the whole point of this last trip we were going to we were she turned away suddenly emotional displays werent needed here clave said were not hiding anything but the silver suit and the carm otherwise we can tell any story we want whats next gawing lawri ryllin you back each other up when you go back to the tuft whoevers asking the chairman had to be talked into this but i did agree and i put the fine details in rather called from aft jeffer the pipes moored to the hull weve got everything else but it all has to be moored go ahead ill check you later gawing are you will ing treefbdder well itll probably keep minyafrom kill ing me clave will this work is it enough only if we come back we come back with the carm and something else too it almost doesnt matter what stet im the chairman pro tern jeffer killed the main motor somebody go out and get our lines untied rather went debby joined booce aft they began mooring what remained of the cargo two big hooks spare clothing sacks of undyed cloth harpoons crossbows lawri said jeffer let me show you something she eased up next to him and tapped at the controls whis pering her shoulder blocked claves view claves mind still raced seeking flaws he was looking for holes in a harebrain net there was no way to make mutiny smell sweet larry niven are we bringing the spitgun no of course not the weapon mark had been carrying when he was captured was now in custody of the chairman gavving its in the older part of my hut what used to be the common room if you dont have the spitgun youre not the chair man get it before anyone notices rather scrambled back through the airlock gavving ryllin and lawri left jeffer let them get well clear before he pulled away on the little jets the tree receded three tiny citizens fluttered toward the elevator dock a cage had nearly reached the dock one of the occupants was shrieking and waving its fists somebody must have found mark debby said relax clave we only tied him up yeah but if id known a rescue party was coming skip it youd have closed the airlock in their faces hope you treefeeders can find something worthwhile in the clump its my reputation on the line now section two the loggers chapter seven the honey hornets from the citizens tree cassettes year day jeffer scientist we have departed citizens tree to explore the fourth la grange point with attention to resources and population the mission as outlined is revised as follows chairman clave now leads this ex pedition has become an approved activity of cit izens tree i now turn the log over to chairman clave clave chairman crew consists of jeffer as scientist and captain citizens debby and rather booce and carlot serjent as guides and myself priority at all times will go to pro tecting the carm and other vital property of cit izens tree no knowledge is worth gaining unless it can be reported to citizens tree i larry niven carlot was watching over their shoulders you use prikazyvat end log said jeffer the same dates we do why not well how do you know carlot demanded years you just watch for the sun to go behind voy but what about days we sleep a couple of days out of five right but maybe you lose count who cares clave said who knows how many days there are in a year it depends on where you are jeffer summoned up numbers on the panel the carm logs a standard day about four and a half per sleep we used to keep marks on sticks in the scientists hut how do you keep time carlot said the admiralty posts the time booce laughed they must get it the same way the library looks a lot like this panel jeffer like somebody ripped out this part of the carm keys like this too i wasnt close enough to see they dont let ordinary crew near it lets see in the crossyear ceremony radyo mattson did the talking but there was a navy officer standing in front of the library and his hands moved and kendy watched them all the carm autopilot heard everything every ten hours and a little it squirted its records at discipline kendy sorted the conversations for what he could use two carm autopilots separated for five hundred and thirtytwo years and eleven months were both keeping smoke ring time with disciplines arrival set at zero interesting the mutineers must have adjusted them after it was certain that they would never return they had severed relations with the past with kendy with earth with the state itself yet they used mutiny as an obscenity puzzling the smoke ring the carm flew east airspeed seventyone kph par tially fueled carrying water that would become fuel solar collector efficiency was running at fiftytwo percent the collectors partially shadowed by the old pipe moored to the hull it was a liquid oxygen pipe ripped from a carm many carms must have been dismantled when they stopped working the admiralty library was certainly the con trol panel from a ruined carm but was it still functional the cabin interior was offensively dirty kendy de tected traces of old meals eaten aboard feathers and bird shit from the turkey roundup ten years back the black clay that had returned the same trip and mud repeatedly expelled from the water tank dirt was not dangerous only aesthetically distressing kendy foresaw no prob lems other than those of microsociology he was on course humankind was scattered no telling how far they had spread through the smoke ring they had settled cotton candy jungles and the tufts of integral trees he knew of four tiny civilizations outside the l point but the ad miralty seemed to be the densest gathering the most nu merous the best organized the political entity most suited to become the heart of an expanding empire it would not resemble the state at first conditions were fantastically different never mind give them com munications gather them into one political group then shape it he must know more hearsay from a family of wan dering loggers wasnt good enough the admiralty li brary that would tell him how to proceed next but he already knew that he must eventually contact the of ficers themselves somehow the carm must be moved into the clump jeffer had seemed to have matters well in hand the effects of mutiny on citizens tree did not concern kendy but clave had ended a mutiny by joining it now he larry niven the smoke ring must persuade jeffer and clave both but kendy couldnt talk to clave exposing jeffers secret would lose jeffers trust it was precisely the kind of problem a checker enjoyed most for now kendy watched six savages in a recording made over the past ten hours they had much to teach him booce speaking we own owned our own ship i suppose that made us richer than most i inherited log bearer from my father and i made my first trips with him ryllin was another loggers daughter and she was used to the life we had four daughters and a few lost ones out of maybe twenty pregnancies all while hauling logs ive become a good maternity doctor the cassette ended men had changed in the smoke ring pregnancy was easy in low gravity women became pregnant many times during their lifetimes infant mortality was high perhaps around sixty percent the natives seemed to take it for granted discipline had carried no diseases yet the growth of bones and organs was altered by altered gravity some children could not digest food some grew strangely until their kidneys or livers or hearts or intes tines would no longer work because of their shape the environment was userfriendly for those who sur vived childhood kendys citizens came in odd shapes kendy caught a reference to merril quinn and learned that she had died six years ago in early middle age merril had had no legs she had fought against london tree and not as a cripple distorted children had wandered through the carm to be photographed ryllin serjent had an awesomely long neck quite lovely and graceful and fragile looking car lots legs kendy wished he could see her walk or run they matured more slowly carlot claimed fourteen and a half years she would be twenty by earths reck oning but she looked no more than fifteen men had not evolved for the smoke ring infant mor tality must have been ghastly among the original crew five hundred years of natural selection was taking care of that as with the cats a few generations back the near future should see an impressive population explosion kendy would guide the civilization that resulted he had been right to move now the carm was coming back into range kendys tel scope array picked it up falling east and out slowing in present time booce and carlot and rather were on watch while the others slept the carm moved through a patch of thin fog fog didnt block the carms senses kendy noticed the anomaly some time before the crew did he saw birds of unfamiliar type they had lungs the carms sonar could see the triple cavity but they had retained part of what must once have been an exoskele ton an oval of hard skyblue shell covered one side four teen of these birds each about the mass of a boar pig were strung in a line across the sky they were folded into themselves fins and wings and heads folded against that oval of shell skyblue blobs cool in infrared com atose or dead booce had noticed now he shook jeffer awake a whole flock of dead birds what killed them nothing that can touch us with the airlock closed jeffers fingers danced outside airs okay nothing poi sonous well treefodder what the temperature its cold out there kendy had already found the source of the cold the presenttime transmission showed jeffer easing the carm alongside one of the big birds the other crew were in and around the airlock debby sent a tethered larry niven crossbow bolt into the bird it twitched she loosed an other while kendy set a blinking light around the image of the pond only jeffer was there to see it he said softly stet they had pulled the bird aboard clave said well its dead now ive got something jeffer said clave theres a pond in that dense cloud do you see anything odd about it no life around it that clouds awfully thick for being so small what does it mean i dont know ice the pond was a core of foamy ice within a shell of meltwater ice was rare within the smoke ring the pond was huge now several hundred thousand tons but kendy guessed that it had been bigger yet a tremendous pond must have been flung out of the smoke ring by a gravityassist from gold in the nearvacuum of the gas torus it would have boiled and frozen at the same time and later fallen back reduced by evaporation reduced further by reentry heat now it cooled the sky around it as it melted kendy could hear the pings as bubbles of nearvacuum crumpled within the ice core i dont like it here booce said its too strange your wish is granted strap the bird down and take your seats jeffer waited while they did that then fired the aft attitude jets the carm surged away cariot pointed into the aft view look the shieldbirds tumbled in the carms hot wake one by one they fluttered then spread a rainbow of wings and tails and fluffy feathers they basked in the heat catching as much of it as they could now their shells were no bigger in proportion than a warriors shield as discipline moved out of range the birds were lining up and flying west putting distance between themselves and the melt ing glacier the smoke ring theres no point picking out a tree till youve got honey booce said you can find a tree a hundred klomters from the clump and still go half a thousand klomters to find your sting jungle their catch was moored by cargo hooks divested of skin and guts and some of the scarlet meat booce was holding raw bird flesh sliced thin and rolled around a stalk of lemon fern he used it to point into the dorsal view and that is a sting jungle the green dot straight out stet jeffer tapped attitude jets to life the carm turned cariot squeaked and grabbed rather startling him awake booce dropped his meal to snatch at a seat back jeffer hid a grin these sophisticated admiralty folk found the carm as unsettling as jeffers own citizens did he aimed the carm east of booces green dot east takes you out half a day and well have honey what else do we need some way to collect it booce answered well put rather in the silver suit no treefeeding insect will sting him through that right better than armor tell us about the admiralty clave said booce closed his eyes to think then youre lonely out here theres too much space everything is dense in the clump think of a seed pod and think of the ad miralty as the shell there are more people in the market alone any time of day or night than youve ever seen we pull the logs back to the clump over the course of a year or two and we arrange an auction in the market twice weve been attacked by happyfeet bandits once we got back just as another log was being docked and we got half what we expected for the wood but over the years we put enough money together to buy my retailers license this was going to be our last trip we were going to settle in the clump and id work the wood myself and larry niven sell finished planks and burl while ryllin set about finding good husbands for our daughters that was the point theyre reaching that age clave asked can we really make the admiralty be lieve were loggers well be loggers booce said rebuilding log bearers no problem we should have more weapons in case happyfeet come by and it all has to look like ad miralty gear and we still wont look like a typical logging family but we dont have to because ive got my retailers license what does that mean it means we dont have to sell the log straight off the navy ships will escort us in and give us a berth i can set up shop in the market and sell wood and hire anyone i like which means that the rest of you can be workers hired off a happyfeet jungle or bought as cop siks some of the happyfeet keep copsiks the admiralty doesnt so youd be free if i bought you free but not citizens right why cant you have hired us off a tree booce thought about it and smiled you have a gift clave tell as much of the truth as possible debby youre from carther states directly you were stranded in the sky you made your way to a tree and now you want to live in a jungle again okay debby debbys lips were moving as she silently repeated the details stet well have to say citizens tree is close to the clump otherwise we got home too fast and wed have to explain about the carm clave nodded so then we sell the log how set up in the market and announce an auction buy your earthlife seeds with the money and go home the admiralty take half in taxes clave exclaimed half the smoke ring jeffer said taxes taxes booce said is the money the admiralty takes to run itself everybody pays but the rich pay more a good log is wealth for the price of the carm you could be very rich indeed the carm is what makes us what we are we wont risk that clave said then dont take it into the clump the navy wont want something that powerful floating around theyll pay well but theyll buy it whether or not youre selling jeffer tapped the forward jets awake they were pull ing near the sting jungle certain mooring loops fit the silver suit too perfectly as if it were their specific purpose four sets for four suits jeffer pulled it loose the silver suit is yours rather im going to teach you everything about it rather had seen the silver suit as a mark of rank he hadnt thought of it as an obligation did mark show you how to work it ive watched him lift this latch take the head and turn it till it stops pull up turn it the other way lift now this latch now pull this down pull it apart good the suit looked like the flayed skin of a dwarf legs first then arms duck under the neck ring rather closed the sliding catches the latches do i have to close the head cover yourself you dont want to be stung booce said those little mutineers can sting a moby to death rather closed the headpiece he said the airs get ting stale they couldnt hear him he couldnt really suffocate this fast could he jeffer lifted the headpiece listen first put your hand here he guided rathers fingers to a row of square but larry niven tons on the outside of the neck ring he pushed one col ored lights lit below rathers chin and another air jetted inward from all around the neck ring he used rathers fingertip to roll a small wheel back and forth the air jets grew weaker then stronger close the helmet rather did as jeffer had shown him air from the neck ring hissed around his head clave was saying something inaudible jeffer guided rathers fingertip to another tiny wheel and suddenly claves voice was a roar use up the air does that thing have to be closed were not going back out of the smoke ring again are we lets hope not rather youre leaking close that flap at your chest the way booce talks about honey hor nets you dont want anything open rather felt it out then used finger pressure to close a snap hed missed now he was being shown little wheels on his chest he moved the left one experimentally his left foot kicked upward and he was wheeling in the air banging his head and elbow snatching for a mooring loop while his other hand rolled the wheel back to zero he banged both knees before he could stop his spin clave and debbie were helpless with laughter jeffer had jumped clear leave those alone while youre in side you fly with those now im going to walk you out the airlock play around with the jets if you get in trouble well come after you rather braced himself in the airlock feeling impris oned the sting jungle was a fat fluffy ring half a klomter across dark green around the outside slowly rotating the inner rim flamed in orange and scarlet rather look ing out through the airlock saw motion there like jittery fog clave and booce eased him into the sky they couldnt have any idea what the boy was going the smoke ring through kendy thought how would they none could fly the ancient pressure suit rather would have to be an agoraphile and an acrophile both kendy had explained the pressure suit with diagrams and pointers but had he shown jeffer how to replenish the suits oxygen and fuel replay that memory no do that soon if it wasnt already too late what kendy was watching was already two hours past but the carm was in range again and in present time the boy was aboard and out of the suit and still alive kendy kept the tape running debby and clave hovered a safe distance away the boy floundered he was all over the sky spinning faster slower tilting himself back and sideways to slow the spin learning to move arms and legs to change his attitude he found the throttle dials and turned both jets to minimum he circled the carm then arced off toward the green doughnut that booce had made his target jeffer spoke through the suit radio not yet rather come back you dont have anything to carry the the booce honey the honey booce what does he need thats what the sacks are for rather oriented toward the carm increased the thrust doubled on himself for two seconds then arched backward as he fell toward the airlock fir sprayed from his ankles arcing forward nice kendy thought of course he wasnt a complete novice hed flown with those giant swimfin fans the boy left his helmet open but didnt turn off the air jets debby began strapping twelve coarse sacks to his back got yelled at and strapped them to his chest instead where he could reach them she used several loops of line the savages were never without line kendy recalled good practice in a freefall environment larry niven in present time rather was leaving the airlock again and the signal was fading kendy waited the great green torus became landscape as rather came near it was darker than integral tree foliage and fluffy finely divided to catch as much sunlight as possible scarlet and orange peeked over the curve becoming clearer orange hom shapes rocketnostril shapes quite pretty thousands of them the jittering mist cleared too not steam roiled by wind but myriads of particles swirling round the blossoms dip ping in and out now the motes abandoned the horn shapes and streamed toward rather they were all around him a humming black cloud of rage scientist im in the center i can hardly see the honey hornets are look for red said booces voice orange and scarlet orange horns the size of drinking gourds and scarlet of another shape rather jetted closer the honey hornets came with him thousands of thumbsized birds tiny harpoon for a nose invisible blur of wing behind he could hear the angry buzz through his helmet ive got a red thing booce its a kind of a sloppy polyhedron half a meter through covered with lots of little triangle holes its growing between these horn shapes those are flowers it didnt grow there its attached did you take a knife no wait a breath theres a matchet on mv leg it must be marks cut the honeypod loose and put the sack around it tie the neck shut rather swung the matchet behind the scarlet polyhed ron the silver suit made all movements stiff presently the honeypod was floating loose rather pulled a sack the smoke ring free opened the mouth and swept it around the honey pod got it tie the bag shut done done theres sticky red stuff all over my gloves stet now keep doing that till you run out of sacks dont lick the honey with my helmet closed dont ever lick honey its suicide chapter eight the honey track from the citizens tree cassettes year state goldblatts world goldblatts world may have begun life as a neptunelike body in the comet cloud around the paired stars in goldblatts scenario the body was captured some millions of years after the supernova event the collapsing core of the supernova spewing its outer envelope asym metrically due to a trapped magnetic field may have picked up a skew velocity that nearly matched the velocity of the protoneptune robbed of its orbital velocity goldblatts world would fall along a drastically eccen tric orbit passing very near levoys star ex treme roche tides would warp the orbit into a circle within a few scores of passes the smoke ring it seems likely that goldblatts worlds orbit and the associated gas torus have been contracting for all of their billion years meanwhile levoys star has been cooling since neutron stars no longer undergo fusion maintaining a relatively stable balance of tem perature in the smoke ring note that the roche limit is never an abso lute it varies as the density of the orbiting body a gasball world may be within its roche limit and this one probably was but the rock andmetal core is dense goldblatts world would have been well outside its roche limit after the gasball lost some of its gas and the eccentric orbit became more circular the planet is now no more than two and a half times the mass of earth sam goldblatt planetologist you see the problem too much of it is gibber ish jeffer told the children rather and carlot were nod ding but their eyes were glassy you can look up some of the words you can guess a little goldblatts world is gold theres a file on earth and neptune and the rest of the solar system but its hard going roche tides roche limit that seems to be a balance point between tide and some other force maybe the same force that changes your orbit if you pass too close to gold fusion is power it makes the sun bum and discipline ran on fusion oort cloud magnetic field supernova lawri and i never figured those out he turned to booce the kids need this but i hate to make you sit through it again at your age booces eyes were glassy too no no no this is all new to me larry niven didnt you have classes theres the library for officers kids only booce said brusquely go on with this whats eccentric thats a round path that isnt a circle it goes out and in booce am i committing a crime if i teach you and carlot these things but i want to learn shush carlot its never come up before booce said youre not showing us the library after all carlot demanded scientist whats the point in stop ping nowt jeffer laughed he tapped and the window was re stored the clump was nearer now and a score of parallel dashes lay across the carms path youre right car lot but the lessons over anyway were getting too close debby answered with a raspberry booce jeffer said any special favorites the smallest id think but lets have a better look booce disengaged his seat tethers and moved aft jeffer would you open those doors will do he did booce dont you trust the win dows i prefer my eyes swing us around will you he braced himself in the airlock others of the crew had fol lowed him jeffer began the maneuver in the forward view now moving into the port view one of the trees had begun blinking a green halo going on off on off nobody was near jeffer whispered why now a point far in along the trunk was doing the blink ing then that stopped an arm stabbed past jeffers ear and he had to repress a shriek there booce said pointing at one of the trees thirty klomters and it seems healthy what about this one booce jeffer tapped the tree that had blinked at him the smoke ring nothing wrong with it its bigger twice the mass take us longer to get it to the market but of course thered be more wood too and theres the carm why that one a hunch youve got no objection now clave was behind him too jeffer are you play ing dominance games t im the chairman you captain the carm booce is the logger booce chooses the tree jeffer repressed a sigh yes chairman booce booce pointed to jeffers selection that one ten klomters above the tuft the wood of the trunk had grown to enclose a node of foreign matter jeffer saw booce catch his daughters eye as carlot was about to speak she held her silence at the tree midpoint jeffer nosed the carm against the trunk he ran the attitude jets while his crew pounded spikes into the bark to mark a rectangle the size of the carms bow the carm drifted while they chopped out a dock with matchets even on this younger tree the bark was a meter thick they made life easier for themselves by chopping along cracks the five of them lifting together could rip great mattresses of bark away from the wood beneath then saw off sections booce and carlot used the saw then let oth ers take over until they got the hang of it booce and carlot rejoined jeffer in the carm booce said they seem to be doing all right but its scarred carlot objected and how much wood will that cost us she shrugged five percent and werent we in a hurry to get home booce was smiling exactly jeffer why this tree youll be painting a line of honey down the trunk stet have a look at that scar larry niven can you tell me what im supposed to find no i cant jeffer the scientist citizens tree gave us shelter and a place among you were grateful i will not quarrel with any decision you make you wont need to test it again jeffer could feel his ears and cheeks burning if that scar isnt more interesting than you expect you can count on it that i wont make a fool of myself twice stet stet i wont raise this subject with the chairman ever you are kind whats next the honey line in the cabin the roar of the main drive was like a great beast heard far away but outside the airlock the roar was deafening a translucent blue flame reached out from the carms main rocket nostril warmth backwashed against the bark carlots eyes were big with fear rather pulled at her arm to set her kicking toward the in tuft and followed with booce following him they stopped where the noise had decreased some what the rough bark itself absorbed sound booce screamed that noise is beyond belief what is that damn carm a ship from the stars jeffer says it rode here on the starship my father never saw discipline what rather said would be true whoever his father was but hes seen the stars theyre real im afraid of it i admit it look the noise is scaring the bugs out of the bark lets get to work booce used a branchwood matchet to open a hole in one of the honeypots the interior was partitioned the cells held red sticky honey booce used the blade to paint it on the bark youll finda few hornets still in there he told rather they try to sting through the sack if you give the smoke ring them a few days to get restless and then they die but dont count on it dont let one get at you now you paint dabs a couple of meters apart closer you waste honey farther apart the bugs lose their way rather had thought he was a climber but this was dif ferent he had problems keeping up he was almost lost among the sacks he was carrying booce and carlot climbed head down they would have left him behind if booce had not been stopping to paint the trunk they took a breather when the sun was at nadir and the shadows had become confusing the sun was passing closer to voy as the year waned a day later they took a longer rest this is the part i like best booce said were usually in too much of a hurry this time your carm is already pushing us home we can take our time do what we like like what ill show you as we go booce began tearing up sheets of bark greater than a man mooring them edgewise against the bare wood when he had them arrayed he set them alight the smoke tended to stay where it formed booce moored a fourkigram slab of shellbird meat in the cloud they broiled smaller steaks on their matchets closer to the fire and ate them still hot the smoked meat will keep till were down booce said but there are other things on the trunk youve never climbed when we were children we did a little climbing but just on the lower trunk we werent supposed to go more than a klomter up if you fell the foliage would catch you any higher we rode the elevator they slept carefully tethered in cracks in the bark sometimes for moments the roar of the carm could be heard above the wind a dark cloud had formed above them and was gradually drifting down the bugs of the tree had found the honey larry niven they breakfasted on smoked bird then carlot did the painting while booce carried the food the sun circled them once and again always they stopped when the shadows were pointing straight out water was beginning to flow sluggishly in alongside their path bugs like it damp booce said the barks wet enough for them around the midpoint but not lower down you have to paint down the east side alongside the waterfall or they wont come also the trunk blocks the wind you dont want the bugs blown away there was fan fungus like so many pallid hands reach ing from the bark carlot showed rather how to tear the red fringe off before eating the white interior it was bland almost tasteless but went well enough with the strongly flavored smoked meat with lunch came entertainment a gust of roses on the wind the stems were four meters long darkred blos soms fragile as tissue paper pointed straight toward voy soaking up blue voylight rather had never seen the like he and carlot watched the roses blowing east until they were out of sight rather took his turn painting booce kept a close watch but it seemed simple enough a dab the size of a babys hand the next dab two meters lower a dark cloud flowed after them down the trunk the wind grew stronger though the trunk blocked most of it the growing tide made climbing easier for rather the water flowed more strongly it was cleaner than pond water cleaner than the water that reached the basin in the commons it tasted wonderful and painting was hard thirsty work in two days rathers arm was one long cramp he was too tired to help with dinner booce managed alone he found shelled things hiding in the bark and pulled them loose roasted their white flesh made a fine meal the smoke ring again they wedged themselves along a wide crack in the bark with carlot between the men there were dan gers on the trunk rathers aches kept him awake he presently noticed carlots feet stirring restlessly carlot he would not have spoken twice but she answered at once cant sleep no my father told me about climbing up a tree when they got to the top the tree came apart thats one reason we dont just chop off the tuft or burn it loose this is easier but it also gets the bugs away from the midpoint when the tree dies theyre not there to eat it apart how do you get rid of the out tuft oh some of the bugs wont follow the honey theyll be breeding while we travel when we get close to the clump well paint another trail out why are you awake tide i have trouble sleeping in tide but her voice trailed off raggedly he stopped talking and presently slept after breakfast booce said theres something i want to see on the west side of the trunk leave the gear here climbing was easy if you didnt have to paint too in less than a day they had half circled the trunk above them by a quarter klomter the bark bulged like a wave surging across a pond they climbed toward that jeffer wanted us to look at this booce told them something must have hit the trunk while it was younger the woodsgrown around it the wood bulged to hide it like some secret treasure rather was almost inside the crater before he could see anything carlot ahead of him had stopped booce was at his shoulder rather heard him gasp carlot said metal i must apologize to jeffer booce said metal in larry niven deed the tree may consider it poisonous see how re luctant the wood is to touch it but the admiralty wont think so rather asked we want this we do secret auction i think booce was deep into the crater running his hands over the reddishblack sur face of the metal six or eight thousand kilos no point in trying to move it well have to show it to the navy anyway unless hmm carlot looked at her father we dont want to attract attention exactly i have to think about this well my merry crew i think weve earned a holiday they climbed back around the trunk taking their time booce knew just where to find the shelled burrowers after lunch they spent a day tethered in the now strongly running waterfall first washing each other and squeezing honey out of their clothing then wrestling they still got some painting in before sleeptime in twenty days they had reached the wild tuft rather had never appreciated foliage before it had sur rounded him all his life he gorged savoring the taste and texture you love it too he observed carlot booce why dont you live in a tree oh theres foliage in the clump too carlot said all kinds rather i cant wait to show you they slept in foliage rather slept like a dead man from exhaustion and the familiar sensation of sleeping under tide in a womb of soft foliage he woke early feeling wonderful carlot lay not far from her father her face was grief stricken she thrashed in slow motion unconsciously trying to hold herself against the tide rather took her hand gently hey nightmare her eyes opened oh rather i was trying to get to wend she was screaming and trying to fly with just her the smoke ring bare feet she shook her head violently and sat up something i have to tell you okay when we were swimming father noticed you were up up oh up youre very pretty rather said a little awkwardly we cant make babies we cant hey the jungle giants and the lon don tree citizens didnt have any trouble im a dwarf but carlot laughed father says we cant he wants me to marry another logger i think he wants it to be raff belmy from woodsman but definitely another logger i thought id better say something before well before you got to thinking thinking well its too late then its all right then sure go back to sleep the truth was that rather was almost relieved carlot with her clothes off made his head swim and his blood boil an uncomfortable feeling and booce didnt want his daughter to love a dwarf savage should he resent that somehow he didnt breakfast was more foliage then booce gave rather the matchet pry the bark off we want a complete ring of bare wood half a meter across well paint along behind you three and a half days later he was halfway around the bark was soft easy to pry loose but the trunk must have been a good two klomters in circumference they returned to the wild tuft to sleep and eat rather was one vast ache but it still felt good to be sleeping in tide in foliage after breakfast rather was still on the matchet the serjents seemed to share citizens trees faith in a dwarfs superior strength he finished the job before they slept again they were ahead of schedule jeffer would not larry niven bring the carm down for them for another six or seven days from the base of the trunk they watched a moby attack the bugs descending along the honey track mobies nor mally skimmed clouds of bugs from the sky for their food this was a tremendous creature mostly mouth and fins riding the wind toward the trunk and the bugswarm at a hundred meters per breath it realized its mistake just in time it thrashed madly gaping irresistibly comical as the wind hurled it toward the tree its flank smashed loose a shower of bark as it passed the bugs descended like a cloud of charcoal dust they reached the ring of painted bare wood and spread to north and south the cloud condensed growing darker swarm inga few cemeters out from the bark carlot do you like it on the tree she nodded watching the bugs booce ive watched you you like it here i love it then how can you kill trees booce shrugged there are plenty of trees chapter nine the rocket from logbearers log captain booce serjent speaking year day ten degrees west of the clump weve found a grove and chosen a short one klomters day refueled in a raincloud every things wet day anchored at midpoint of tree day ryllin and karilly must have laid the honey track by now bugs are following them down to the tuft ill take logbearer in to pick them up were all eager to return to the admiralty but theres no way to hurry the bugs day ryllin and karilly are aboard from the in tuft they spotted a pond klomters west and a little in the women argue that we can fire up the rocket and start our return with out waiting for the bugs the pond will let us larry niven refill the water tank it would gain us twenty to thirty days now its my choice theres a risk but ive never yet held out against the women ill give up early save time day the bugs have reached the honey band around the in tuft ordinarily i would be down there supervising but i cant do that while were under acceleration we maintain staggered watches against hap pyfeet if they find us we can ready logbearer for independent flight in half a day the rocket is hot and running day ill stop feeding the pipefire soon let it burn out before the bugs cut the tuft loose i can guide us into the pond on the last of our steam if the rocket runs dry itll teach the girls caution well still fill the tank before we reach the clump you always bump a pond or two when youre moving day a mature tree is drifting to block our path dammit maybe itll move past no further entries the carm picked them up on the branch and re turned to its dock with the cabin half filled with foliage rather suspected that they would not eat foliage again nor sleep in decent tide for a long time he heard the argument when clave wanted to restart the motor theres no point jeffer told him wed be using fuel to fight wind were doing fine booce added his voice to jeffers well sail even further in after the tuft severs leave us something to breathe the smoke ring had anyone else seen clave glance aft clave had taken less than a breath to read the faces of his crew but rather had caught it not so long ago far away in citizens tree gavving had spoken thus to his eldest son youre a citizen now watch clave during a meeting he leads where well go he always has you dont have to go claves way just because clave says so the motor stayed off the tree moved ponderously west and in its westward motion slowed over several days the days were shorter and voy had come nearer the smallest children learned never to look directly at voy but rather could tell in the corner of his eye the violetwhite pinpoint was more intense closer and smaller with less sky to blur and dis tort it it took six days to make a sleep then seven time whirled around them until they stopped caring the jour ney had become more important than their destination the crew lived on the bark all but jeffer they found the carm too strange even rather left the carm after a few sleeps he had learned that he liked strangeness but he sensed that jeffer saw him as an intruder the sci entist captains the carm debby and booce disappeared down the trunk to mon itor the progress of the bugs they returned with smoked dumbo meat and two cured skins which booce shaped into armor that looked remarkably like the silver suit we wont use it this trip but its standard gear the navy will expect us to have it a grove of integral tree sproutlings passed voyward of the tree the first the citizens had ever seen they were a few scores of meters long tufted only at the out end the seeds drop away out and in booce told them after they sprout they have to sail back to the median theyll grow the other tuft when theres enough to feed them larry niven the smoke ring the day came when carlot called her father and pointed outward isnt that a pod grove backlit by the sun the cluster might almost have been a miniature tree grove hundreds of klomters out small yes too far though why debby asked well itd take too long to id forgotten the carm lets ask jeffer jeffer summoned up his windowswithinwindows sure we can get there clave want to take a trip can we find our way back the tree looks big when youre tied to it but from six hundred klomters away trust me forty plants grew in a loose cluster all much alike from a fibrous cup that faced west a long limp leaf trailed eastward waving sluggishly in the wind a thick vine reached a hundred meters out from the boll ending in a kind of collar each collar held a brown eggshape those are jet pods debby realized suddenly we used to ride them in carther states booce directed rather to one of the largest plants car lot and debby hung back rather the silver man circled the pod cautious in the face of a new thing a fibrous brown egg as big as the common room in his fathers hut there was tide enough to pull the vine taut smaller pods grew in a spiral around the stem end ranging from fist sized to mansized replacements he surmised that would grow after the ripe one dropped away satisfied rather wrapped his legs around the stem for leverage and swung his matchet the sound blasted his whole body the sky spun round him tide was pulling him apart his fingers and toes felt like they were inflating as spin pulled blood into them against the tide that was pulling him rigid rather forced his legs vertical to his torso pulled an arm against his chest and fired the ankle jets the spinning sky slowed he aimed his feet against the spin and brought it to a stop battered and deafened he pulled his helmet open to hear what booce was shouting at him that one was ripe try another plant rather jetted toward the grove booce guided him from a distance no that ones stunted we want a big one arent the big ones likely to be riper thats why we use armor try there the pod exploded blowing him west and away while seeds sponged off the silver suit the spin was less this time the blow had been more direct rather opened his helmet i think i had more fun on the tree its too wet here the pods like to spread their seeds when theres water around try that one close your hel met rather seriously considered telling the alien merchant to go feed himself to the tree but he was already moving toward a third vine there isnt any other silver man he thought he swung viciously at the base of the pod and what am i if im not the silver man the pod dropped out and away carlot and debby flapped after it the next one didnt explode either rather chased the seed pod down with booce chasing him they braced their shoulders against the pod and started back they were near the carm when rathers jets died he fiddled with the throttle wheels nothing booce dont leave me whats wrong the suit wont move booce laughed are we going to have to put wings on that thing can you push me can and will here comes debby ill push you and larry niven the ladies can have the pods booce seemed indecently cheerful and rather was a long time understanding why booce had found a flaw in citizens trees intimidating science you ran out of fuel thats all jeffer told him see that little red light below your chin it was on when i started out i dont know what it means means youre out of hydrogen there must be a way to refuel the suit ill search the cassettes if i cant find anything well have to ask mark after this is all over calm now weve got pods and weve got honey maybe we wont need the silver suit again a fortyklomterlong tree is hard to lose from six hundred klomters away jeffer had no trouble bringing them home booce attacked the first pod gingerly hacking at the stem with the matchet flinching back at each blow at the sixth blow the pod suddenly spewed foggy air under terrific pressure booce threw himself into the sky he flapped back staying well clear he opened the other pod in the same cautious fashion then he and carlot sawed it in half the inside was lined with fistsized puffballs each with a dangling tendril booce scraped these away he sawed the stem off the first pod leaving a small hole he shaved the edges until the hole was just smaller than the metal pipe and quit for dinner they resumed work after breakfast it took four of them to shove the ends of the pipe into the holes in both pods clave asked now how do you get water in there punch a little hole in the other end of the tank put the pipe in apond and suck you need good lungs to be a logger the smoke ring were too far in to find many ponds i know usually we fuel logbearer before we go to work on the tree but dammit weve got the carm and therell be a pond somewhere and logbearer is whole again except for the lines and cabins well need wood to build cabins well go for wood after the next sleep jeffer said the out branch i think the in branch may be about to fall off no another thirty days at least carlot said father dont trust that booce said instantly well use the out branch youre the logger what changed your mind booce sighed i was guessing i dont really know when the in branch will fall off jeffer theres likely to be a shock when the branch tears loose stay aboard the carm stay strapped in when you sleep leave the motor off stet will the rest of you be okay on the trunk as long as we keep our wings handy always have your wings in reach always but you should be in the carm in case we need rescue the steam rocket still required attention booce and carlot festooned the water tank with lines and wove a braid of lines around the bow end well moor the cabins here other than that i still dont know what were going to use for sikenwire there has to be some way to hold the coals in place clave had a suggestion we could arrive crippled get a push from the carm to drift the log into range then signal for help somehow tell the navy we lost our sik enwire got home by luck mmm maybe id look like a fool but maybe i just dont want to be in too much of a hurry he stopped abruptly then he said ryllin and the girls they we larry niven were in a hurry to get back to the admiralty we started the rocket running before the tuft dropped off whats did i tell you youre rich i dont know what it means clave said that wart on the trunk is thousands of kilos of metal with metal you can buy anything thats for sale in the market it also makes us a target someone might try to steal it good news and bad news right well set up shop to sell the wood and take our time selling the metal no hurry food had grown short again debby and clave flew in along the trunk until they found a covey of flashers with the trunk as a backstop they fired their full complement of arrows and shot half a dozen of the small birds it took them six days they built a fire on the trunk to cook the birds log bearers crew was ready for a feast booce was the exception he ate little he was un characteristically silent his eyes on the fire until carlot said dad twenty twentyfive days about that booce said then i guessed last time i should be in the tuft watching the bugs dad you couldnt warn us from down there any way i could start climbing ten or fifteen days early dad im glad we dont have the rocket running we were running the rocket when it happened the silence stretched debby asked what hap pened booce told it booce was fast asleep when the cabins yielding wooden wall slammed into his face and chest his grunt the smoke ring of surprise was lost among feminine shrieks he was reaching for his wings before his eyes were fully open the women were a flurry of action around him snatch ing for their wings moving out ryllin reached the door looked about her then immediately turned toward a vi oletwhite glare that hadnt been there when theyd gone to sleep carlot and karilly followed wend hadnt found her wings she was near tears as she searched booce left her nothing terrible could happen to wend aboard logbearer and this would teach her always to know where her wings were he saw it all at a glance logbearer was moored against a vast wall of bark the east side of the trunk coals in their retaining net burned bright orange along the middle length of the pipe the nozzle cone pointed east toward the clump some meters from the cone live steam condensed into a white stream klomters long the clump was a distant whori of whiteandgray storm with the misty white tube of the smoke ring con verging beyond and below it the eye might follow that white line down the sky and where the tree converged to a point there was voy the glarewhite pinpoint had been masked by the in tuft when booce went to sleep the in tuft was gone it had torn loose days before booce expected it freed from its weight the tree had lurched outward booce had guessed as much now he could see it in toward voy a fluttering black silhouette was haloed in blue light mishael had been outside on watch the lurch had torn her loose she was far in along the trunk flapping out andeast to bring her out just as shed been taught but hed never taught her to lose one of her wings ryllin and the girls flew toward her foreshortened black silhouettes they made slow progress inandwest larry niven would have taken them straight in but the west was a wall of black bark booce followed slowly mishael seemed to have it under control with the in tuft gone the center of mass was higher on the tree tide was pulling booce away from the tree and in a new breeze announced that the tree was under sail accelerated by the wind on the out tuft he kickflapped to adjust ryllin and the girls had nearly reached mishael karilly looked up and flapped to turn she was shouting at him the wind tore her voice away he tried to hear she kicked toward him screaming booce turned toward logbearer too late the lurch and the breeze and booces inattention these had caused the disaster a flurry of coals had been jarred loose from the sikenwire cage irradiated by the pipefire the bark had been drying and warming for tens of days it had been ready to ignite under normal circumstances an integral tree is in equi librium with the wind a steady gale blows at each tuft and no wind blows at its center air must move past a fire to keep it burning but a tree under sail is moving and there is wind coals reached the bark and blazed up booce flapped hard toward a logbearer already embedded in flame he hadnt panicked then there was a hose and pres sure in the water tank for the fire would be heating it he would use the hose to spray water and steam on the fire booce breathed deeply as he flew hyperoxygenat ing hed hold his breath while he worked the danger was that he might breathe flame wend crawled gingerly through the cabin door her feet were wingless her eyes and mouth wide in terror she saw booce gathered herself and leapt toward him into the sky the water tank ruptured booce saw wend blown outward in a wind of live the smoke ring steam laced with boiling water he flapped to catch her hearing his own howl she was flying past him he stretched impossibly and caught her bare ankle and felt the scalded skin slide loose beneath his hand there were comforting hands on booce on his shoul ders and arm and ankle for touching was the way of cit izens tree rather hung back uncertain reluctant to take such liberties booce was a mature adult where was carlot booce was hoarse for he had been shouting howling but he sounded almost calm now everythings blurred after that lawri the scientist was feeding me foliage and i couldnt remember anything it all came back a bit at a time rather eased away from the cookfire and flew toward voy behind him booce was speaking mostly to debby who was rubbing his temples it never happened before not to us sometimes a logging concern just disappears we wonder why we never find out for ryllin for the girls i should give it up but loggings all i know the memories must have been too much for carlot if she wanted to hide a crack in the bark bark walls would muffle the agony in her fathers voice she might have gone in any direction but the cracks ran out and in try in rather coasted above the bark he didnt mind being seen shed have kept going until she couldnt hear the words go away he somersaulted and kicked air to stop himself car lot no answer it had come from his left from the north there scarlet showed in a crack he said i wouldnt have found you if youd kept your mouth shut larry niven she was pulled into herself like the shellbirds around the ice pond her wings were on her back he fluttered into the crack beside her but didnt touch her it must have been bad it was bad he tried again want a hug i want wend back you have to leam to think of her as a lost one she was fifteen she wasnt even two jill had wailed after a sister sickened and died lisa had hugged her daughter fre quently when lisa died at thirtyone it had been no better for jill rather worked his fingers into her hair and began a scalp massage she didnt move he said ive had brothers and sisters die we all have you forget shed removed her sleeves after the fluff died the skin of her arms was smooth and richly dark and she suddenly wriggled about and had him in a deathgrip rotating they drifted in the sky rather still wore his wings his instincts told him to return to the tree he held her she wasnt sobbing presently she pulled her chin off his shoulder and kissed him he asked better yes i dont want to go back will you be all right here shall i stay half a dozen finger cacti drifted east less than a klomter distant a windborne finger cactus could be lethal these were only drifting and drifting away at that but you never stopped looking for danger carlot hadnt answered he said your father might get upset if we stay here too long fathers made mistakes before he tells you who to make babies with though mis hael had to ask and shes older than you the smoke ring do you want to go no i thought hard before i took my clothes off in front of you he remembered swimming in the waterfall and laughed i noticed but booce was there she freed him and all the muscles in his body jumped loose in the sky but he had wings carlot drifted ro tating away from him donning her wings no she pulled her tunic over her head then rolled her pants off and balled them up together he looked now she was tying her wings to her ankles her clothes too nudity was not strange to him but this was different carlot was long one and a half times his own height her breasts were perfect cones an abrupt break in the long smooth stretch of her torso rather re sisted the urge to touch her he spoke hurriedly before he could lose that fight now what would happen if we really did make a baby could you still marry anyone you want to she said its all right we just have to watch what time we do this yeah rather had never heard anything about how not to make a baby when can you do it now ive never done this before he swam toward her ill show you take these off chapter ten secrets from the citizens tree cassettes year sm fisher plant is bollshaped me ters in diameter it can extend a long waterin flated root into a passing pond for fertilizer as well as water fisher jungle may be considered a large fisher plant with a sting may attack big birds as well as ponds prey are brought into the jungle to rot finger cactus the newly budded form looks a little like a green potato with eyes fingers sprout from the eyes and branch and re branch until an adult in flower may bear fingers each finger is tipped with a spine any creature that comes too near may be speared and then roots grow into the victim later in life fingers bud new finger cacti dangerous the smoke ring rather woke because his eyes burned they were filled with tears blinking did no good the tears were under his eyelids filling them the pain had him whimpering he tried lifting his eyelids with his fin gertips to let the water out that hurt mopping his eyes with his tunic brought agony he couldnt see carlot he remembered that she wasnt with him they had not returned to the cookfire until all were asleep except debby on watch she had winked at them they had separated sleep then daggers in the eyes he would not have wanted carlot to see him like this but he was alone and blind clave debby anyone rather could feel bark surrounding him yell again hed yelled when the silver suits jets gave out the mem ory embarrassed him hed had gritty eyes before when he was tired but not like this someone help me i cant see rather debby my eyes are on fire and i dont know why her hands were cool and rough on his cheeks open them i cant he got them open just a slit for just a moment the light was agony theyre bright red iu get clave dont loose your tether no way the pain grew no worse and no better it was a long time before he heard voices rather clave whats wrong with me long fingers held his head still thumbs lifted his eye lids youre not blind youre not dying either its an allergy attack your father used to get this way when dal larry niven tonquinn tree was dying of the drought we were too far in toward voy dry thin air and not enough sleep what do i do gavving mostly suffered in half a day hed be over it dont rub your eyes let me think it seemed to hurt less now that he knew it would go away it hadnt killed gavving and if they both had the same allergy then hes really my father i should tell him mother too and mark but the pain was more urgent clave if this happens when i dont sleep and i cant sleep because it hurts too much clave his line went slack ive thought of something just relax ill tow you kendy for the state kendy treefodder its been a long time thats not my fault jeffer every time our orbits have matched there has been someone else in the carm where are they now i dont find them outside either theyre asleep i was too everyone but me sleeps on the bark kendy how do i refuel the silver suit diagrams appeared carm and silver suit side by side parts of the schematics blinked blue as kendy talked jeffer saw that tanks along the calves of the silver suit were what made the legs so bulky hydrogen here oxygen here theres hose under these little panels the spigots are recessed here and here under these covers on the hull you open them from the control panel bring up the schematic then twist above these dots this way an arrowhead circled good remember oxygen line from here to here hydrogen from here to here getting it wrong may cause an explo sion what keeps the gases cold in a pressure suit no the gases are just under pres sure thats why the tanks go dry so fast kendys face the smoke ring was back in the bow window did you find six metric tons of metal ore yes thanks booce says it makes us rich good i see youve been building a steam rocket is it finished booce still has to build cabins well go to the out branch for the wood he still doesnt know how to hold the pipefire heres the carm a voice said feel the airiock walls treefodderf clave was in the airiock with rather behind him the display went blank a breath too late clave got his mouth closed first things first sci entist rathers having an allergy attack you remember how gavving was during the drought rather you need thick wet air so well close the airiock and turn up the pressure and humi um wetness do it jeffer jeffer let his fingers dance close both doors humidity up pressure up pressure in his ears he worked his jaw he untethered himself and moved aft rathers eyelids were puffy the eyes were scarlet jef fer said it goes away after a while no matter what you do this might help or not work your jaw to pop your ears he turned to clave well how long has the checker been back since the serjents reached the trunk why didnt you tell someone me lets go outside he opened the inner airiock door and gestured clave in from the look of him clave might explode any minute but he came they were nose to nose while the inner door closed and the outer opened keeps the pressure in jeffer said thats why its called airiock he kicked out into the sky clave followed on mismatched wings youre stall ing no kendy cant reach us except when the sun is larry niven dead east but anything that goes on in the carm kendy hears it later he cant hear us now he wouldnt have heard us in the citizens tree com mons yeah clave the truth is that i didnt trust anyone else to talk to kendy i dont trust kendy and hes very persuasive am i too fluffbrained to say no clave all right so i was arrogant and wrong headed now lets go tell the serjents uh hey citizumf it wasnt really a shout but claves long fingers closed over jeffers face after a moment the palm lifted to expose an evil grin clave said you still should have told me rather didnt see anything did you tell lawri no what does kendy want he wants the clump he wants to know everything about the clump this trip was his idea wasnt it i told you hes persuasive clave we have to tell rather about this before he talks to anyone he already knows too much nobody else right right then i want to talk to kendy he comes in range every four days lately four days from now when the sun is dead east jeffer found rather in the scientists seat hands poised above the controls freeze he said now move away rather obeyed i was trying to open the airlock use the little lights on the doors rather any citizen knows better than to fiddle with the controls once i nearly killed us all with one illconsidered tap of one fin ger but i dont have to explain that to you i only have the smoke ring to say jeffer captains the carm keep your treefeeding hands off the controls stet stet sorry jeffer ive seen you open the doors and i was feeling shut in how are your eyes okay he held still while jeffer looked rathers eyes were pink and the lids were puffy but he didnt blink from now on you sleep in the carm with me i should have someone here anyway in case we get shaken up when the tuft tears loose rather had already summoned the blue diagram of the carms cabin jeffer opened his fingers over the lines that represented the airlock the doors opened behind him he said help me get the hose linked up then take it outside booce met them at the door ill take that rather were filling the rocket how are you doing better debby clave and carlot waited at the rocket booce and rather crawled along the bark dragging the hose after them booce spoke quietly did you know that carlot was a crossyear child no whats it mean the crossyear is when voy crosses the sun children born at the crossyear are unpredictable they can go any way at all rather im trying to tell you that you and carlot are not to marry shell marry a log ger rather didnt answer carlots expression was un readable until the moment booces back was turned then she winked rather felt his face glowing to work booce forced the hose into the rocket nozzle jeffer says he can fill it without anyone sucking on the end clave give us a hand here now push jeffer ready r larry niven the three were braced to hold the hose in place clave said theres a signal jeffer uses that tells the carm to push whats in the water tank back out it gets rid of mud the hose writhed water sprayed out around the join rather could feel the power of the water trying to tear the hose out of his hands they held it held it and suddenly the hose bucked loose and thrashed like a live thing rather dodged and was flailing in the sky booce bellowed enough jeffer its full they were soaked before the hose went limp jeffer called cheerily from the airlock when do we see a test booce looked embarrassed i still dont know how to substitute for the sikenwire weve got time yeah well weve used up too much water one way and another i want to refuel the carm clave rather come along we wont be long booce the rest of you can start dinner the three of them returned to the carm clave asked what do we do for a pump jeffer was smiling ive thought of something theres a pond thirty klomters out and a little east the sun wasnt much past zenith a pinpoint diamond blazed next to it out and a bit west sunlight focused through a pond jeffer set the carm moving straight out the out tuft ran at them and past them the pond wasnt far beyond and not much bigger than the carm jeffer set the forward jets firing when they were close they came to a stop just in from the water globule jeffer opened the airlock he told rather get into your wings and follow us bring the silver suit well re fuel the jets jeffer led them outside and around to the carms dor sal surface rather followed tugging the silver suit by its the smoke ring limp wrist there jeffer took the suit from him he watched as jeffer produced narrow hoses from under a hatch clave said forget the suit for a while let jeffer do it rather you missed something during the allergy at tack what do you think happened then all i know is you caught jeffer at something jeffer grunted he had the hoses hooked to holes in the suits legs clave said you missed your chance to see sharls davis kendy youll get it again in what half a day jeffer looked at the sun past two oclock a few de grees out from west a little more than that the thing is this is a secret rather everybodys got secrets kendy the checker tell him jeffer jeffer said kendys back he pointed out the wart for us he talked to me the day we rescued the serjents weve talked since i gather it costs him something maybe shortens his life and he still cant reach us more than once every two days rather said the tales mark and gavving tell kendy would have killed you all if hed known you stole the carm i dont think he could have done that jeffer said but he might have wanted to we stole the carm to get away from london tree we had lawri tied to her seat and mark the silver man too kendy might have called it mutiny you know some of this rather said you were copsiks they owned you i never understood how you could live with lawri and mark after that clave said what were we supposed to do throw them into the sky they earned their citizenship rather when the air was leaking out of the carm lawri found the way to plug the leak when kendy was asking ques larry niven tions mark covered for us we could have told kendy we were escaped copsiks but im not sure how he would have felt about that maybe kendys people kept cop siks kendy yeah he scientist you understand this better than i do jeffer said give me a minute he was moving the hoses need to refuel the legs one at a time stet now sharls davis kendy claims to be the re cording of a man i dont understand that neither does lawri we dont even know how cassettes work really i wondered if he was just some madman who reached the old starship like we almost did and was living aboard but its been fourteen years and he doesnt sound any older he wanted to know all about us whether we were mutineers well treefodder we did steal the carm we were mutineers much as i hate the word thats all in the past clave said yeah now he wants to see the clump clave re member how he talked fourteen years ago i think he still wants everyone in the smoke ring to be one big happy tribe taking orders from sharls davis kendy the dark pond blazed at its eastern edge rather won dered if there would be time for a swim he was not com fortable in this maze of secrets kendy isnt the chairman we dont have to do what he says no well we want to see the clump too and if he cant touch us why not tell the serjents boys got a point clave said you didnt tell them either maybe that was just reflex just talk to kendy chairman and then ill point out something clave merely nodded to rather he said one more the smoke ring thing kendy hears everything anyone says aboard the carm rather laughed jeffer asked anything else to discuss i think im finished here now lets refuel the carm go back in and strap down we still dont have a pump the scientists answering grin was a little mad clave sighed jets grumbled then died rather watched a windrif fled wall of water move toward the bow window clave asked shouldnt you close the doors jeffer grinned and shook his head clave said i wish to point out captain that were going to hit that pond yeah the pondlet struck rather sagged in his straps clave grunted he asked do you honestly know what youre doing i honestly do through the great window the interior of the pondlet was open to view a flock of tiny silver torpedoes sped away through the murk and disappeared through the shiv ering silver surface the carms hundreds of years old and nothings hurt it yet now i reduce the interior pressure jeffers fingers moved the air system hissed water entered the airlock in an expanding silver bubble the doors closed water remained inside flowing over the aft walls the curve of it becoming more and more concave waves curled and sloshed as jeffer turned the carm away from the pond he grinned at them now i set the pressure back to normal and turn down the humidity that tells the carm to make the air dry by taking water out of it the water larry niven goes to the tank see we cant run out of fuel now its something lawri never thought of its treefeeding wet in here scientist but you dont have to pump next on the agenda is kendy checker when you hear this please introduce yourself clave asked what if hes not there hell hear it when he runs the record there was a face in the bow window kendy was a dwarf rather had expected that but he was still taken aback deepset eyes examined him judged him within a face like carved rock a giants gravelly voice said kendy for the state hello chairman clave hello rather the silver man scientist your manner of refueling the carm is likely to destroy it if the impact had torn away the solar cell arrays how would you break up water a carm doesnt fly on water jeffer looked nettled clave said welcome back kendy thank you chairman why did you hide from me i felt that jeffer was better equipped to judge his po litical situation than i clave bridled and im not if jeffer had told you he would surely have had to tell his wife do you trust lawris judgment i give up between you you stet i watched your nonmutiny with some interest youre a natural leader clave you should be ruling many more than your thirteen citizens thank you checker where do you propose i find another thousand citizens all of whom are inclined to trust a treeliving outsider the language was cold and stiff jeffer and clave did not trust kendy and kendy clearly knew it he said you need not turn a compliment into a policy statement clave i cant force you to obey my orders you cant the smoke ring stop me from observing through the carms instru ments you know that i know things you do not cant we work together maybe thanks for showing us the wart youre welcome has booce found a way to confine the pipefire not yet even with sikenwire the pipefire is dangerous you do have a source of metal you can make a firebox from the wart clave grinned what a good idea you probably dont have the facilities to make a smelter what a smelter refines metal it melts metal ore and bums away impurities you shape the metal by pouring the liq uid into forms gravity is needed or tide or spin the admiralty may have such technology but i gather you do not we do not youd set the tree on fire for sure but you do have a saw it was moored in the cargo section use it to cut slices from the wart kendy youd ruin the teeth no that saw was taken from discipline most of the tools aboard discipline were made to last even with triv ial items the major cost was transportation the chicken wire must have been made in the admiralty but your hose is reinforced with hullmetal alloy the pipe is hullmetal so is the saw you wont damage it by sawing slices from a mass of soft iron here kendys angular visage was replaced by a line drawing of the steam rocket then another line drawing a rectangle with tabs at its edges cut three of these use the first as a template how do we hold the parts together tethers would bum set the plates in place and pound on the tabs until larry niven they bend down theyll fold over each other three rectangular plates formed a triangular prism the tabs along the edges blinked green then bent themselves over to interlock logbearer reappeared and the threesided box now enclosed the pipe and pipefire clave said ill ask booce you wont get much air flow to the coals mount the rocket two or three kilometers in or out from the center of mass the wind will keep the coals alight you couldnt make a completely closed box any way it will leak mmm yeah youve been thinking hard about this i can solve simple mechanical problems what will you do with the carm when you reach the clump clave was still studying the diagram well hide it before we get there take the log in with the steam rocket take our time selling it youll want to keep the carm safe but near enough for rescue if something goes wrong now the clump is more crowded than the smoke ring in general but one may still think of it as mostly empty space two thousand people wont crowd a region the volume of the earths moon youll find plenty of hiding space kendy we cant steer the carm into the clump and just look around wed be seen i have a better view of the clump than you do even if its not a good view if you approached from north or south of the clump what well do is take the log in then look around while were selling the wood if we find a safe way in well take it another thing you might consider kendy said the carm is power there may come a time when well want to use that power kendys voice and picture faded well thafs that jeffer left his seat he stretched the smoke ring elaborately lets go out take some spears well get us some waterbirds before we turn back they moved out clave said well wow do you see what i mean he wants the carm inside the clump he wants it bad if he can get some admiralty citizens into the carm he could look them over and question them he didnt say anything unreasonable clave said persuasive isnt he all right think about this there occurred an accident that allowed chairman clave to see the checker talking to the scientist that happened after kendy was sure he couldnt talk me into this clave smiled an interesting coincidence the carm has outside cameras doesnt it yeah and booce would like to be rich so that he can give up logging do you think kendy could persuade booce to trade the carm to the navy for metal the smile slipped well do it your way rather this stops with us all of it now shall we get us some wa terbirds i said that to get us outside jeffer said lets do it anyway the smoke ring chapter eleven happyfeet from the admiralty library year sm day voice has set us the task of integrating the deserters excuse me wanderers into the ad miralty it will certainly take generations exec willoughby admits that it may be impossi ble and ive come to agree half a dozen cottoncandy jungles now trade regularly in the clump meeting at the cross year they obey admiralty law where admi ralty navy is present to enforce it outside the clump there is piracy and slavetaking we be lieve that the seekers and the lupopf family were involved in such incidents though they were the first to trade in the market we cannot bring law to thirty earthvolumes of inhabitable territory the smoke ring is too huge and we are too few and too slow lieutenant rand carster brilliant as it was the neutron star was too small to give much illumination yet the sky was never dark even at crossyear when the sun at nadir had to shine through the full thickness of the smoke rings farther arc one must seek darkness in a cloud or a jungle or a tree tuft or in the unoccupied depths of the clump now the sun was dead east somewhere behind the slowly roiling blotch that was their destination it was gloomy in the shadow of the clump masses near the whitefringed black mass seemed to blaze in contrast were better than halfway home booce said debby ive been looking for more pod plants the last thing i ever wanted was to come home with a pod for my cabin but we dont have time to build real cabins the rockets finished otherwise yes good debby had been working hard her tunic was off and her pale skin glistened with sweat now how do we make it work trade secret debby regarded booce angrily we built the tree feeding thing you wont tell us how to make it go classified debby will you tell us how to make it stop in an emergency if you and carlot arent in reach how do i stop it from just burning up well get an extra pod and fill it with water to pour on the pipefire very good now suppose you and carlot both fall off the tree and lose your wings and weve got to come after you suppose you left the rocket going what do i want to do booce found her persistence disturbing use the carm i suppose thecarmisgone theyre only refueling it it could be gone again larry niven then use your wings dont try to use the rocket thats dangerous debby glared and was silent she was booces height and almost booces age marked by a dangerous and ex otic beauty palebrown skin pale straight hair fiery blue eyes a face all planes and angles with a nose like an axe head she was the type of woman who would remake a man who would run his life for him as ryllin was and ryllin was far away and ifbooce carried that thought further ryllin would know somehow and booce would regret it greatly booce looked at the sky to escape deb bys eyes hed been watching the sky for days now they were closing on the clump matter would be thicker here even this far in more ponds plant life animals predators per haps navy craft or wandering happyfeet west of out almost behind the logs remaining tuft he found paired bright and dark dots the pond and the carm no sign of pod plants would they have to cut wood from the out branch after all branchwood was bet ter but it was hard work and the cabins would be crude debby was still fuming you know arguing isnt the thing i do best but clave is going to have this out of you because its stupid not to tell us how to use the basic loggers tool wont the admiralty expect us to know no youre hired labor right i forgot the days went fast this close to voy nine days be tween waking and waking north and west the reddish fringe of the clumps shadow was sliding rapidly down a tremendous wall of cloud storm and lightning inside and ponds forming the line of sunlight picked out a green dot a drifting jungle emerging from the fringes of the storm the smoke ring carlot suddenly asked debby should we know how to use the carm yes yes we should know how to run the carm treefeeding fools they are lawri and jeffer both booce was jolted debby you cant fly the carm nobody knows but the scientists classified lawri i can understand but jeffer he stole the thing himself and now he acts just like her fifteen years almost dad shes right we should all of us know all of that and we have to start somewhere booce sighed crossyear child playing around with a dwarf tree dweller but the women always won the arguments debby as far as any admiralty citizen is concerned you know nothing about how a rocket works understand yes logger booce now what is it you loggers have been concealing from us laborers go ahead carlot carlot considered before she spoke all right just the way you taught me debby youll have to imagine the sikenwire in a tube around the pipe i stuff firebark inside and light it debby nodded the coals are just along the middle of the pipe not too close to the ends i wait i want the metal to get hot it should glow red hotter than that the nozzle starts to char thats bad so i run water through the pipe the metal stays dark red and steam comes out the nozzle you cant see it where it comes out but it can flay the flesh from your bones so stay clear her father smiled nodding approval hed taught her well now how do i move the water into the pipe debby mulled it no tide how do i keep outsiders from watching me do it debby brightened she kicked herself to the fore end larry niven of the water tank im here right theres a cabin and im in it and heres the plug just so cariot joined her you pull the plug you blow in it when the water spurts back at you you slam the plug in quick i could get a lungful of water that way sure you could weve all done our share of choking father taught us this so he wouldnt have to do it him self why does it blow back i dad booce said the steam pushes both ways out the nozzle and backward too that churns the water so more water comes down the pipe after the rocket settles down its thrust that pulls the water through the backpressure holds it from going in too fast you can let the rocket run till the waters almost gone cariot said youve got to let the pipefire die before the tanks empty otherwise youll char the nozzle and the tank both its a mess if you have to throw water on a pipefire the storm was definitely reaching out to enfold the tree and the jungle was closer too booce pointed car lot cariot looked happyfeet maybe debby what have we got for weapons harpoons the rocket i guess not enough all right ladies maybe its just a loose jungle and even if its happyfeet they may not have no ticed anything but i think we should hide hide debby was outraged booce thats not much of a jungle carther states was twenty times that size the jungle was closer now a fuzzy green ellipsoid with a shadowy slit in it as if foliage had been shorn away to form a window into the interior booce said a jungle that size can hold a family of twenty or thirty debby a the smoke ring tree is big we can vanish into cracks in the bark and never be seen i think weve got time help me take the rocket apart booce it was tough enough putting it together you think i like this but booce and cariot were already tugging at pipe and nozzle and debby perforce joined them the pipe is priceless we cant let happyfeet get it booce gasped in the thin air the nozzle jerked loose and tumbled along the bark with booce wrapped around it his voice drifted back the rest they can have well hide the pipe in some crack and guard it now we really wont have time to make cabins they pulled loose the pipe and water tank the green puffball was closer yet and a line of vapor trailed behind it the vapor trail became a curve debby said its dropped five men winged now its going away nozzle and tank floated slowly rotating now booce was free to look theyre making for the wart we cant let them have it debby cried well the truth is we can booce said he was push ing the pipe ahead of him kicking hard cariot and debby flew to help maybe the carm can take it back for us if not we dont need the wart to reach the clump those five that were dropped are after us the log was far east drifting in the fringe of a storm complex rather found it before jeffer did shadow backlit by the sun jeffer chased it down the carm arced over the top of the out tuft moved in along the east side of the trunk the dock came into view a rectangle of bare wood rag ged around the edges rather felt the pull of the forward jets and heard pondwater slosh toward him water had spread along the carms walls and was creeping for ward larry niven he wasnt actually getting used to this was he wheres the rocket clave sounded merely puzzled where they had built the rocket there was nothing wait there drifting loose a palebrown bell shape the nozzle there some distance away a brown ellipsoid trailing lines where was carlot where was anyone what happened here clave demanded an ex plosion had there been a fire rather found only the small black scar of the cookfire the arrangements around it were undisturbed jeffer said we cant search the whole tree wheres the sun straight east we wont get kendy for another day take us in rather said jeffer looked at him why just a guess carlot had gone in last sleep jeffer swung the carm toward voy and fired the jets they skimmed above the bark the fog was around them now jeffer played with the controls there he said sud denly five men but what showed in the window was an abstraction orange blobs on redandblack were seeing by heat jeffer said for an instant the normal view returned fog sliding along black bark then the redandblack was back didnt booce say some thing about happyfeet find our people said clave mmm there three orange blobs in a line by normal light they became three human shapes lined along a crack and the rocket pipe i think rather rather quickly disengaged his seat belt and moved aft he pulled the silver suit out of the water and slid his legs inside clave said good get the rest of it on and go join the others take some harpoons they wont have weapons jeffer how did they get here good question i dont see anything that could have the smoke ring brought them something could be around the other side of the bark rather waited while clave bound six harpoons against the silver suits chest air on voice on can you hear me his voice blurted from the control panel and jeffer jumped i hear you fine let me out the bark was half a klomter distant rather used his jets he thrilled to the pull of thrust along his body blood leaving his head abdomen settling toward his feet not quite a comfortable sensation but one few others could share behind him the carm accelerated south around the curve of the trunk and was gone carlot and the others had seen the carm they waved two klomters toward the blue blur of voy a hundred meters out from the tree greenclad men emerged from the fog they flew along the bark peering into cracks as they passed at this distance rather could see only that they were five jungle giants and armed they saw him their legs stopped moving though their motion continued closer now one was a woman then they were kicking again turning back toward the storm that was reaching to engulf the tree he could catch them they couldnt know about the silver suit his tanks were full rather fired his boot jets his course became an arc he could catch them then what kill them rathers parents had both killed they didnt like talking about it when they did old anger distorted their faces yet this was the silver mans duty from time to time he killed one of the intruders looked back and then all five were kicking madly doubling their speed his arms were full of harpoons hampered while debby and carlot and booce had no weapons at all rather swung back toward his crew larry niven he thumped into the bark not far from booce carlot was looking at him oddly he opened his helmet and said its me five of them almost found you what hap pened happyfeet booce said a small jungle steam powered lupoff family from the look of them they want the wart rather thumbed his personal voice on silver man calling the scientist jeffer they want the wart go for that nothing they cant hear me booce ill guard you on the surface but i dont think theyll be back they looked like they were running booce grinned they thought you were navy what skip it rather settled himself on the bark above their heads helmet closed the invulnerable warrior and carlot had looked at him as at some alien bird but the happyfeet warriors were gone from sight the storm enclosed the tree the fringe of it was a fine mist just beginning to obscure vision wish i could use those other kinds of light kendy sees by and the ventral cameras almost blind hydrogen low oxygen low water volume low but increasing we should have built a pump by now hey whats that clave looked jungle small just opposite the wart now jeffer spotted green dots around the puckered bark men and one was pointing toward the carm the voice of kendy startled him im scanning in in frared i cant see anything human outside of the wart area take the carm closer give me a view jeffer accelerated in he asked did you just come into range the smoke ring yes im running the record of your approach you should have killed the invaders on the east side they could attack your people as the carm approached the jungle jetted away on a trail of steam north into the storm then around the trunk steam spraying in a wide curve it was hidden be fore the carm arrived jeffer brought the carm to rest a quarter klomter from the wooden crater the happyfeet had been digging around one side of the wart elongated men hovered around the block of black metal ten said kendy rings of red light blinked scien tifically on the bark haloing men jeffer had already spot ted pointing out others three interlocked rings circled bare wood four in the open three between the bark and the wart three more in a crack outside the crater wed better follow the jungle clave said they could find the rest of us while were busy here jeffer turned in his seat but kendy spoke first theres time theyre too many to fight anyway clave said nonsense spray them with rocket exhaust jeffer have you been shown the throttle for the main drive yes jeffer didnt know the word throttle but lawri had shown him how to control the push of the rockets his fingers danced the carm moved toward the wart the happyfeet waited blurred by fog spears ready brace yourself clave the carm swung around still approaching the puckered bark but stem foremost men left the wart swimming hard others appeared from the bark beyond spears flew the dorsal camera watched a bulbousheaded spear strike the hull and ex plode in a puff of smoky flame authoritative thumps could be heard through the hull jeffer tapped the main drive on it felt like suicide hed nearly died the last time he larry niven did that the carm surged forward jeffer felt his chest sag his cheeks pull backward in a dead mans grin but his arm was rigid above his face fingers almost touching the control panel it worked moving his fingertip down along the green bar reduced the main drives thrust to something he could handle throttle a nearly invisible blue washed across ten happyfeet warriors the invaders burst into vivid yellow flame they were comets the flame streaming back from them explosions sent bits of men flying clave cried treefodder jeffer stop jeffer tapped the drive off hydrogen oxygen both quite low the wart receded clave they attacked us theyve got exploding harpoons they couldnt have moved the wart with us on then tails we only had to take it away from them all right chairman jeffer turned to look at clave now tell me what theyre doing to booce and debby and carlot its time to leam that kendy said time to move jeffer ive lost sight of the jungle from disciplines po sition it circled half around the trunk and was approach ing the point where you dropped rather well have to get there fast before im out of range the invaders here are harmless enough now they were some were still writhing some were mo tionless but all were burned black jeffer set the carm moving it was too early to feel guilt they were in the cloud now a thick swirling fog growing thicker jeffer could see the tree only as a wall of shadow kendy said turn starboard you need not steer so wide of the trunk jeffer i have infrared the carm moved around the trunk in a great curve lightning flared suddenly aft the smoke ring i have the jungle in view straight out by five point six kilometers straight out jeffer i cant see ventral two degrees more good accelerate cut rather has the jungle in view silver man come in rathers tinny voice spoke from the control board i see a big shadow but no detail they cant see us either theyve found you somehow jeffer said youre near said kendy swing oneeighty de grees i wont citizen i dont know where the men are what else can we do but attack the jungle itself swing around there was something strange in kendys voice jeffer turned the carm he half hoped clave would countermand the order but clave said nothing main drive kendy should have sounded excited he only sounded loud jeffer tapped the button the carm surged his face tried to crawl around to the back of his head a yellow light bloomed in the mist behind him and he heard rath ers gasp he killed the drive but the yellow light re mained the harsh bass said done im losing range clave said you kill too easily kendy kendys voice was becoming blurry citizens youre missing the point this was a mobile jungle these hap pyfeet may have contacts in the admiralty theyve seen the carm and the silver suit men arent honey hornets kendy there was no answer rain drifted across the carms main window in drops the size of fists carried by eddies in the wind the wood outside was black with water inside the cabin it was soggy enough jeffers segment of pond had spread a film of water across all the walls and the cradles larry niven the smoke ring warm dry air blew from vents fore and aft thrusting the water away from it the citizens clustered around the aft jet next time ill pump the water jeffer thought got to build a pump carlot said we saw that huge shadow come out of the fog it was scary enough then five well they could have been birds for all i could see except that they were flying toward the jungle and thrashing at both ends waving their arms i guess it was the bandits who ran away from rather the jungle stopped to pick them up they were lupoffs booce said i know their clothing ive met them in the market a big family three jungles and theyd colonize if they could buy another firepipe theyre crowded clave said so if the lupoffs find out what happened here youll have two jungles hunting you they wont find out there was no triumph in claves voice jeffer shuddered they were warm enough dry enough if they stayed in the air jet but the storm splashed rain across the bow window and through the rain came the yellow glow of the burning jungle i wouldnt mind killing a bandit or two booce said ive been robbed once or twice its the scale of the thing that bothers me there must have been forty citizens in that jungle not counting children clave jumped toward the fore end of the cabin after a moment jeffer followed the fore air jet was as dry as the aft clave said id had enough of that forty people jeffer said there just isnt any way to make them stop talking about it claves voice wasa hoarse whisper persuasive is he nobody but you can be trusted to talk to kendy right you burned them while they were trying to rescue their citizens they attacked us with spears so what was i supposed to do they were threatening our citizens clave sighed im not blaming you and if i am i shouldnt be but kendy by the flick of his eyes clave had remembered that kendy would hear this he began pronouncing his words with more care tree feeding kendy killed them like a hive of honey hornets because they were in his way because they might talk to the wrong people silence and discomfort debby came to join them wet she said what did you do to get it so wet jeffer didnt answer to clave he said i felt much worse when i killed klance the scientist to steal the carm he wasnt expecting it these citizens were they were making war right debby said enthusiastically when london tree raided us i used to wish we could capture this thing and set their whole tree burning the bandits arent the same but by the state we finally did it dont do it again clave said jeffer nodded section three civilization chapter twelve customs year day by heliograph station two to gyrfalcon swallow reports large incoming log east of admiralty master unidentified you will rendezvous for customs duty if convenient location of log at day was twonineoh degrees flat five degrees north twoeightoh klomters radial acknowl edge rice did this just come in yes sir i was scraping the hull when i saw the light blinking near the market took the message and came straight in but i dont know how long the helio was blink ing petty mart wheeler thought it through gyr falcon car ried six crew swallow two the navy preferred that ci larry niven vilians notice the big armed ships in the act of paying customs they should remember what they were buying so where are we ill find out sir spacer rice turned toward the in strument closet no not you bosun murphy take our position this was not an urgent mission hed use it as a training ex ercise the dwarf nodded cheerfully her flamered hair swirled around her her short but powerful legs shot her across the cabin to the instrument closet she chose what she needed and went out the long hair would have to go when she reached higher rank pity but dwarves were rare and bosun sec try murphy must be trained quickly through the hatch wheeler could see a blue light tiny and intense a navy heliograph reflected voylight blink ing near the east limb of the whorl red hair and a squarish feminine face suddenly blocked the view petty were at twosixtyfive flat six south twoforty klomters and weve got better than half a tank right mur phy nodded get on the heliograph well rendezvous with the log jimson rice get us ready for a bum the thick disordered sky made rather dizzy if he fell into that he would be more than ordinarily lost he climbed with care clave and debby trailed him there had been hard work followed by a long climb they were all tired rathers fingers and toes were start ing to cramp but the rocket was in sight a hundred me ters out if that direction was still out the log was rising through the clumps eastern fringes wind slapped at rather from ambush here there every where as if he were embedded in a flock of terrified tur keys clouds ran in peculiar directions not eastwest not flattened spirals but shallow inout curves a line of small the smoke ring green puff jungles flowed in an arc that was not tidelike at all confronted by such strangeness rathers bewil dered eyes sought the one unchanging reference point voy burned bluewhite and steady twentyfive de grees east of the stump of the in tuft choppy clouds blurred the sun shadows pulsed blurring and sharpen ing overlaid on those voys faint sharp blue shadows lay in skew directions children learned not to see voy shadows voyshadows told nothing for they never moved never changed never distracted the eye the tree had turned the trunk was pointing wrong booce and carlot waited at the rocket debby called booce how can you stand it the tide i grew up in it youll get used to it the happyfeet do the shadows are making me sick to my stomach debby said rathers own stomach was queasy carlot were almost home there was no mistaking her joy she liked it here look weve got the pipefire going ill start the water a smaller pod had been carved into logbearers new cabin booce crawled inside tether yourselves the rocket cone pointed east rather poked his nose into the small hatch booce are you slowing us again booces voice echoed what no tides different in the clump well push west straight toward the dark he pulled a wooden plug from the water tank he inhaled put his lips to the hole and blew rather withdrew his head to watch the completed rocket in action yellowwhite coals glowed within the iron firebox that had given them so much trouble the iron glowed dull red a fourth pod nearby was filled with water in case the plates didnt hold together at the nozzle end of the rocket nothings happen ing larry niven his answer was the sound of booce inflating his lungs then the rocket went chuff and sprayed steam its going booce rather said and looked in booces face dripped with water he was coughing and choking while he pounded the plug in with the heel of his hand his glare was murderous chuff chuff chuff chuffchuffchuff the rocket settled down a row of cloudpuffs became a steady stream jogged by the play of capricious wind rather felt no acceleration it would be gentle with so great a mass to be moved carlot came up behind him her long fingers found his hand and enclosed it father shouldnt we booce sounded like his throat was still full of water yes go play lookout on the west face you two watch for navy and anything we might hit the maelstrom revealed itself to them as they circled the trunk flying was a continuing wonder to rather but carlot did it better she kept darting ahead then circled to urge him on at a vantage point on the west face they doffed their wings and rested the clump was a whorl like a tremendous fingerprint inward matter thickened there were puzzle trees dis torted cottoncandy jungles the much smaller puffballs that carlot had pointed out for him and greenery that was totally unfamiliar ponds took odd shapes in the distorted tide the sky was thick with birds skyhorses triunes and a thousand tiny red and yellow darts converging on a puff jungle everything moved in arcs tighter near the center of the whorl and darker the center itself was almost black but motion could still be seen there the triune families were hard to spot but two had turned to observe the passing log they were fat skyblue cigarshapes with wide triple fins male and female and child linked along their bellies three slender blue shapes the smoke ring flashed violentorange bellies as they converged on the redandyellow birdswarm another triune family sepa rated to hunt a thin stream of cloud cut across other patterns of cloudflow rather spotted it in the moment before carlot pointed there navy how do you know rather saw only a dark point at the end of the line of cloud its coming toward us customs theyll make a bum and intercept us in a day oh treefodder rather laughed shed borrowed his curse what she showed him far in toward the clumps dark center in the thick of moving matter was a broad flat ringshape with a pebbly inner surface angular structures in pastel colors blatantly artificial could it really be as big as it looked he judged its size by an even larger natural object nearby a tree with one tuft missing the log was smaller than their own rather thought at its midpoint he could make out a rocketshape cone and tank and angular cabin carlot said i know that rocket woodsman dad wont like this they could just as easily have been out another damn year she looked into his eyes we wont have much time together the belmy family owns woods man dad wants to marry me to raff belmy will you do it shut up she pulled him against her by the slack of his tunic i dont want to think about it just dont talk she breathed into his ear and he obeyed it crossed his mind that booce should be told of these things but there would be time gyr falcon found the log easily bigger than average with both tufts severed it was making its burn a wavery line of cloud behind it was beginning to arc over the rocket would be behind the trunk larry niven instruments wheeler instructed rice get us a rendezvous track murphy the neudar that dark blemish in the wood i see it sir he waited and watched his crew moved well bosun murphy in particular she hadnt yet used the neudar under field circumstances she moved slowly but without mistakes that would reflect well on wheeler the blemish is dense metal she said kilotons now the rocket i cant see anything behind the midpoint oh i can look through the wood she tried it mmm something metal not much our own iron rocket nozzle would show a mark like that rice we need a bum petty fifty degrees planar zero axial a hundred breaths of bum and well go just past give us the bum then all hands suit up spacer rice youre in the cabin on instruments murphy on the pump gyrfalcon carried a glass alcohol tank and a pair of water tanks its valve system had been rifled from the hulk of an ancient cargo and repair module on long voyages standard practice was to spray water into the alcohol flame as working mass water could be replaced in domains beyond the admiraltys reach alcohol gen erally could not though some of the happyfeet tribes car ried alcohol distilleries for trade with the admiralty wheeler and jimson tethered themselves carefully at the steering platform above the motor murphy began to pedal pedals could be extended but a dwarf on the bi cycle always delivered more power wheeler put his hand in the airflow to test it then started the alcohol flame he checked his crews handholds before he increased the flow thrust pulled at his skin and his bones he ran water the smoke ring into the flame thrust rose again and heat bathed the inner surfaces of his straining legs rice called down from the cabin cut it petty wheeler reached below his feet for the alcohol valve the roar died to a hiss water on a hot surface next the water valve gyrfalcon fell free the log was nearer the plume of acceleration was gone using the binoculars wheeler found a pair of human shapes on the near side theyre not giving us much attention he said murphy took the binoculars presently she said theyll have time she looked until he took them away the navy ship was bigger and more elaborate than logbearer it arrived in a wave of warm steam and paused a hundred meters from the center of the midtrunk four men emerged and flew toward them logbearers crew waited outside the cabin theyre fast debby said booce chucklednever try to outfly the navy navy wings are different and the men are picked for their legs they were closer now rather suddenly gripped booces arm booce theyre wearing silver suits a i rather rather eased his grip sorry well watch that its only navy armor but it looks just armor there are three vac suits in the admi ralty and we arent important enough to see one inci dentally theyd love to make it four closer yet the armor didnt cover them all wore hel mets headandshoulder pieces with an opening for the face some wore additional plates and one was a dwarf their wings they pointed a little forward as the foot did they folded on the forward kick and snapped open on the backkick the scientist should see this rather thought larry niven they left their wings on even after they touched bark the dwarf was a woman red hair showed around the helmet before she lifted it pale skin pointed nose and pointed chin hair like flame streaming from a tree afire her chest plate stood several cemeters out from her chest she was five or six years older than rather quite lovely and rathers height she caught him looking and smiled at him he forgot that he could move her eyes were blue and they danced he was blushing and carlot had caught it and rather looked away in haste and watched a long long man kick ing toward them the globe helmet was much larger than his head with an opening for his face like the silver suits helmet with the faceplate missing separate curved pieces pro tected his thighs back upper arms and hips those were wood painted in silver but the headandshoulder piece was of hammered metal wide nose dark skin black cushion of hair he might have been part of booces fam ily he recognized booce booce serjent you may remember me petty wheeler wel come home good to see you again petty youll remember car lot she smiled brilliantly good day petty wheeler oh yes youve grown carlot booce said these others are clave and rather cit izen from citizens tree a few hundred klomters west of us debby carther we hired before we left meeting strangers was outside rathers experience booce had told him what to do he said a pleasure to meet you sir and held out his hand pleased the navy mans handshake was strong for a jungle giant ill speak to you later rather clave debby a pleasure booce do you have anything to de clare the smoke ring yes one log forty klomters or thereabouts if you want to measure it yourselves no well just take half the manifests as you sell it off and the wart booce said complacently our one bit of luck and a happyfeet tribe almost made off with it that mucking great chunk of metal halfway in heh youve found it already we havent measured that either but its thousands of tons petty wed like the wart classified we wont get so many thieves that way all right but if happyfeet attacked you i dont want to file charges they got away but we hurt them and i dont want them to know who they might want to come after us with friends that attitude makes life difficult for the navy booce wed rather chase them down youre sure all right well want our taxes in metal fine i want to keep that makeshift firebox until i can buy more sikenwire its not pretty but it works barring that ill sell the entire lode to the navy right now if you can tear it out and tow it home take it off my hands booce said rather couldnt help himself he stared but what if he takes you up on it petty wheeler laughed i dont have alcohol to tow it and i cant authorize that kind of expenditure but well inspect it now and ill send a team to cut our share loose after youre moored petty wheelers crew began searching log bearer in side and out rathers momentary impulse was to stop them but booce showed no surprise and of course there was nothing aboard logbearer to be found mean while the navy officer turned to rather and said rather wasnt it you should consider joining the navy why larry niven the man smiled the pay is good particularly for a tree dweller if you can get in well shape you up and teach you things you should know like how to win a fight youll be holding civilization together the personal ad vantage is youre the right shape you noticed bosun sectry murphy short with red hair yes shell be wearing a vac suit within six years guard ian is the highest rank there is unless you were born an officer you could do the same ill have to think about it talk to her yourself ask booce for that matter booce well fly down and inspect your wart would you like to ride with us id be delighted booce looked around at his crew and added wed all be delighted gyifalcons hull sported handholds everywhere the navy men spaced logbearers people high along one flank there were shelves for feet and straps to circle a waist fighting vessel clave whispered to debby they can cover the hull with archers three navy worked aft around the motor they ig nored the civilians something green was trying to grow on the wooden hull fluff maybe the wood had been scraped recently rather noticed that much before the rocket fired if wheeler was trying to impress a barbarian dwarf he succeeded the rocket roared and spat flame rather felt his blood settling into his legs the logs rough bark surged past accelerating aft wheeler and murphy used toothed gears to point the nozzle in a way it was more impressive than the carm you could see how it all worked the roar of the motor would cover his voice and the fear in it rather asked why dont they let us inside classified nobody knows whats in a navy ship the smoke ring cariot said we havent seen the whole crew im sure of that rather i noticed you staring at the um red haired woman rather told a halftruth she looks short i mean its surprising because shes the same size i am mark never looked short cariot seemed to relax well no he was bigger than you when you were growing up wheeler moved the nozzle ten degrees to port the ship slewed around spraying flame he swiveled the noz zle starboard the rotation slowed and stopped and gyr falcon decelerated it eased to a stop less than a hundred meters from the blister in the trunk the bandits almost had it torn loose wheeler ob served booce nodded the same four navy personnel accompanied them to the wart three set to examining the blister that had grown up around the metal and the matchetchewed wood that extended far back behind it the fourth sought out rather petty wheeler said you might have questions to ask me said bosun murphy rather was not really thinking of joining the navy he didnt say so i dont know enough to ask good ques tions she smiled enchantingly ask bad ones i dont mind what are the vac suits why are they important theyre old science as old as the library theyre invulnerable she said the highest fighting rank is guardian and thats the rank that wears the vac suits there are supposed to be nine guardians weve got eight this she rapped her helmet then the plates on her thighs it looks like this but all over youll get as high as petty just because youre the right shape and then you find out if you actually fit into a vac suit do you larry niven i dont know i havent got that far yet she looked down at her protruding chestplate unhappily maybe i wont fit id still keep my rank as petty understand you have to be qualified you have to be trained its just easier if youre the right size training whats it like theyll put you through exercises you may think youre strong youre a tree dweller i can see the mus cles but petty wheeler could tie you in knots after youve been through training you could tie him in knots i could i think and youre stronger your people do they use polar coordinates to find themselves no theyll teach you how to find yourself in the sky youll learn how to count if you dont know i can count youll learn how to work a rocket not a steam rocket but a navy rocket they teach you how to obey too you want to go in braced for that rather a superior officer tells you to fly you fly wings or no it sounded unpleasant where do the navy ships go mmm where do you come from citizens tree a little west of the clump youre not likely to visit your family we dont see many tree dwellers we send ships outside the clump but not often and never more than a few thousand klom ters mostly we cruise the clump itself we collect taxes of course yeah we fight the wildlife dark sharks and other things citizens find a drillbit nest or honey hornets they call us and we burn it out triunes too oh no the triunes got the idea fast they never at tack us some of them like us theres a guy exec mar the smoke ring tin he hunts swordbirds with triunes nobody knows how bright they really are but they can be trained why do you bum honey hornets booce says theyre valuable her expression soured honey is contraband put just a tip of a fingernails worth on your tongue you dream wonderful dreams then you cant stop use a little more and you die in ecstasy some people will pay a lot for that honey is suicide rather hadnt realized that booce meant it literally he thought it over then said but its their choice she shook her head not my decision then theres detective work and riot control and rescue work we dont specialize much you learn to do all of that but first you learn how to fly a ship what happens to cadets who fail murphy what hap pens to dwarves who fail nothing i mean theyre out of the navy of course they hire out or they build a business maybe they go diving in the dark for mushrooms and fan fungus or they go logging hell what does a logger do if he fails at some thing she looked closely at him whats the matter im having trouble with this therere more people here so theres more places for people right if you cant hunt or do earthlife farming you just try something else murphy nodded brightly next question would we see each other if i joined up may i call you sectry thank you bosun any time she said and sprang away she coasted parallel to the bark toward wheeler as he emerged from behind the wart its big wheeler called booce serjent youve made your fortune recouped it anyway the first thing ill do is rebuild logbearer larry niven yes well ive seen enough eight thousand tons or so those scars on the metal we used the saw to get the slabs that make up the firebox it worked better than id hoped its a good sub stitute for sikenwire and the saws not damaged wheeler nodded satisfied can we lift you back to your ship no we need to cover this somehow before we reach the market i think youre worrying over nothing how could any one steal anything this big with saws well you may be right they watched gyrfalcon steam toward the clump in terior something bright twinkled at the bow hes call ing home booce said they use mirrors to bounce voylight where they want it what happens now clave asked wheeler thinks i sawed off more metal than just those plates for the firebox hell watch to see if i sell it on the black market he could have bought the wart on the spot but he thinks ill give him a better price if he waits a few days after we dock ill get an offer itll be too little and ill boost them a bit and then take it so i can stop guarding the metal what do we do now booce jeffer must be going crazy waiting for us to call in were still being watched gyrfalcon was tiny now its steam trail was dissipating clave asked can they still see have they got some thing like the carm windows a box they hold to their eyes clave wed like some way to disguise this mucking great chunk of metal so logbearers five crew swarmed over the wart tak ing their time just looking at it from all angles as if there were some way to hide a conspicuous pucker in the honest wood of a tree the sun crept from zenith to pass north the smoke ring of voy and presently debby said booce youve seen more trees than any of us what kind of a thing causes this kind of scar something hits the tree could be stony it doesnt have to be metal ive seen this kind of gap with nothing in it at all just chewed wood healing over i never did figure it out debby wondered ice booces face went stupid mouth agape eyes drifting he said heh yes a chunk of ice could smash a tree then melt still doesnt do anything for us what else disease is there something that builds nests or the tree bugs could chew just in one place sure a honey pod could hit a tree and the bugs would chew a huge hole give me a breath debby stupid again thinking we can do it twenty days to reach the market okay we need a fisher jungle thats got termites and we need to look like weve been through a disaster but weve got that already i never thought id come home with a pod for logbearers cabin what do you need from us clave asked stay here talk to jefifer the rest of us will fly up the trunk this is nice if wheeler wonders why were still hovering around the wart hell see us hiding it rather swallowed his protest because clave was say ing you dont need rather i want him stet booce had his wings on come children the smoke ring chapter thirteen the termite nest cumulated matter becomes thick enough to block sunlight tidestabilized plants dont thrive here weve found familiar life forms triunes and cottoncandy jungles but also some specialized life forms not seen elsewhere deep radar indicates solid masses within the dark inner region none are large we have wondered why the clumps never con densed into one large body perhaps life itself acts to remove matter from the inner regions the fisher jungles roots disrupt large ponds saprophytes peed in the dense core then fire spore packages away into the smoke ring birds are forced out by famine or population pres sure row the citizens tree cassettes year sm the lagrange points matter tends to collect in the fourth and fifth lagrange points of gold blatts world these regions appear less tur bulent than the storms around goldblatts world itself but we have postponed exploring them in depth we inspected only l the more or less stable region is km across mapping the equipoten tial tide curves gets us nested crescents what shows to the eye is a misshapen whorl dwindling east and west into the arc of the smoke ring proper the whorl is green around the periphery darker and browner near the center where ac it made his head hurt jeffer ate as he read when he reached the end he doggedly scrolled back to the beginning his students had found it bewildering so did jeffer but he had an advan tage over his students he had kendy ifkendy would call today he had hunted the sky hed returned to the dead fisher jungle trailing a sizable shieldbird a small fire near the carm had cooked his catch he was getting good at it sandwiching the meat between two of the shieldbirds bone plates cooked it tender without scorch ing it he almost choked when the carm suddenly spoke jeffer this is clave jeffer can you hear me jeffer swallowed hard and said prikazyvat send to pressure suit and about treefeeding time too are you alive jeffer we couldnt get to the helmet the navy searched logbearer even after they left they were watching us where are you are you hidden larry niven the smoke ring clave i found something good do you remember booces description of a fisher jungle a green puffball a klomter across with a long coiled root it reaches out to put the root in a pond but theres poison on it and it can attack life forms and kill them and draw them in to rot right theyre not supposed to live outside the clump maybe so this ones fifty klomters from the clump fringes and its dead the axis trunk is hollow theres a navy ship coming this way its not likely theyll want to sniff around a fisher jungle but ive got the carm moored inside the hollow anyway when it goes away ill tether it above the root so the carm can get some sun light where are you i cant see anything im in the dark im in that channel we chopped past the wart we havent moved the silver suit yet jeffer remembered extending the work done by the happyfeet his back and shoulders still ached we should have let the happyfeet do more of the carving it was worth it booce was right the navy knows if youre carrying metal this petty wheeler citizen knew about the wart but he didnt look for anything behind it whats the clump like crowded well have the log moored in twenty days booce has a way to hide the wart hes afraid of thieves and we cant use the silver suit to win a fight because no of course not because theyd recognize it jeffer theyve got three silver suits its a mark of high rank dwarves are in good shape if they join the navy and rathers had an offer an offer rather you there jeffer heard claves distant yell presently rather said here you had an offer to join the navy what was said what did you tell them i didnt take the petty seriously the idea is to leam something about the admiralty buy some earthlife seeds and get back to citizens tree we want to know about the navy too i learned a little clave interrupted how serious are we booce what has the navy got that we want to see im not so eager to see the inside of a navy rocket that id feed one of my the library the cassettes whats on the admiralty cassettes all right jeffer what makes you think rather could get to any of that booce might know but he isnt here to ask jeffer finished the shieldbird meat while he thought ask him when you get the chance now im getting terminally bored here are you free to move the silver suit into the rocket no its too easily recognized clave said how about just the helmet well have to ask booce but i think not lets get kendy in on this are you in contact he said he was changing orbit hell be back in an other day clave i wish you could give me some kind of a view ill think of something jeffer rathers waving at me scientist out clave youd better see this rather said what i was talking to jeffer clave crawled out of the cavity behind the wart oh from out of the crowded sky came a shapeless thing colored a dead yellowish brown its outline was fuzzed with a jittering motion that caused the optic nerves to larry niven twitch it was coming straight at them and logbearer was behind it get out of its way rather its going to hit got your wings they fled the thing fell toward the wart with a faint frightening buzzing sound myriads of black flecks swarmed around it insects much smaller than honey hor nets it struck the crater around the wart and deformed like soft mud logbearer bumped the trunk more softly debby emerged from the hatch in the forward pod she stared hard at the intrusionary mass she called its going to stick booce answered from inside stet spread the honey debby waved at booce and rather but that was all the attention she gave them she began spreading red sticky honey around the rim of the crater the swarm of insects followed her when she closed the circle most of the insects had migrated to the honey done good get aboard clave rather ive got to moor this thing want a ride clave bellowed booce you get out here and answer some questions booces head popped out he thought it over then flapped to join them he looked indecently selfsatisfied its a termite nest he said before clave could ask well say we didnt have any choice it was the only tree around and we had to get back to the clump because ill think of something uhhuh the honey encouragement when the termites run out of honey theyll eat wood theyll bond the nest to the wart what about the silver suit were you just going to leave it the smoke ring where would it be safer jeffers all alone in the sky hed go crazy booces grimace told it all clave said hes the cit izens tree scientist and he is not a crazy murderer he was in a fight with our lives at stake booce and he used what he had it was more powerful than he thought it was he used it twice booce if youve ever been a happyfeet bandit your self tell me now booce was astonished then amused oh really no im not protecting my own kind im not defending ban dits that prey on loggers granted theyd generally rather attack some tribe of helpless savages your suspicions are right there clave but it doesnt mean i like bandits i wouldnt have burned a whole damn tribe either uhhuh you would have sent them away without hurting them so much how describe the procedure in detail i cant do that jeffer hasnt told any of us how to fly the carm clave the scientist is not to burn any tribe ever again im telling you not him you are to stop him ill tell him now what oh well leave everything but the helmet where it is jeffers scientific eyes are in the helmet right those little windows in the forehead well moor it in the nest hell have a view well be spending enough time around the wart well talk to him then the carm with its cameras was hidden in a dark place the pressure suit was in another the incoming re cordings were days old and in present time jeffer wasnt present kendy skimmed the recordings he was learning more through disciplined own senses logbearer was easy to follow forty kilometers of tree with tufts missing and a metal mass offcenter now round ing the starward limb of the l whorl maintaining contact larry niven wasnt going to be easy here disciplines new orbit had twice the period ofgoldblatts world with perivoy fall ing north of the l point tilting his orbit out of the smoke ring allowed his instruments to penetrate less of the gar bage in the clump but the log and the carm and all of kendys citizens would be circling that center on long kidneyshaped paths at least he wouldnt have to burn more fuel if he could establish relations with the admiralty his present orbit might suffice for hundreds of years savages in a thriving civilization would find trouble sooner or later patience some emergency would force jeffer to bring the carm into the l point then he must open the airlock to the navy one problem at a time wait leam jeffer entered the cabin before kendy passed out of range there was fresh pink blood on his tunic and more on his hands kendy for the state hello kendy how can we jeffer if rather has an offer from the navy i want him to accept you would rather didnt sound too enthusiastic neither am i how can we get away with not hiding the silver suit an excellent question kendy was using light am plification but it only showed him iron ore and chewed wood clave and rather had departed the hiding place if the navy has pressure suits theyll recognize yours i thought of disassembling it but theyd know the helmet too we would ruin the camera if we tried to dismount it and the electrical source is in the helmet so patience feed your patience to the tree kendy ive got a cryptic entry under lagrange points ive had three hundred and eightyfour years to leam r the smoke ring patience you are almost out of range can you feed your self there sure theres hand fungus and flashers living on the bugs and some other things in a way its like learning to hunt all over again the link was lost a chance to examine the admiraltys military arm from inside but rather wasnt enthusiastic and kendy would have to talk jeffer around before his arguments could even reach the boy patience chapter fourteen docking the smoke ring but will suffice weve painted the honey hor net logo across logbearers cabin now well see what can be done about my crews wings day entered admiralty space gyr falcon has registered log and metal for cus toms assessment to follow day log nearing market metal concealed from all but navy conditions opti mal day docked sent the crew off with carlot would have gone with them if i could i never dealt with tree dwellers before i cant guess how theyll react i miss ryllin i never in my life had to weave so many threads at once from logbearer log captain booce serjent speaking year day this trip we need not fear happyfeet i fear jeffer the scientist i fear the secrets we hide from the admiralty and the secrets the scientist keeps from me but i owe a major debt to citizens tree day weve found a simple way to hide our empty crewmember may i never have the chance to thank the happyfeet for making it pos sible day weve gone for more pods one has become our cabin one stores extra water in case a fire spreads returning with a pod for log bearers cabin grates in my soul but it will surely hide the wealth we carry day making paints gave more trou ble than i expected the colors are still poor a fat babyblue torpedo cruised slowly along the serjent log moving closer to where rather and carlot stood watch suddenly it split along its length and four slender blueandorange triunes dived on some treedwell ing life form rather pointed four sometimes triunes have twins ive never heard of that you never saw one of those either she pointed out a triangular shadow thats a dark shark they dont usually come this far skyward theyre dangerous all teeth no brain skyward dark skyward spin and antispin we use all the normal directions too how do you keep it all straight rather reached to wrap his legs lightly around her waist she did not re spond a ball of green fluff stretched a quarter klomter of curly tail toward a passing sphere of water larry niven booce debby and clave were around the logs ho rizon ready to use the rocket if anything came near car lot and rather kept watch from the east we can still keep our eyes on the sky rather pointed out cariot pounded his kneecaps with her fists briskly whos watching us i dont mind triunes watching maybe i even like it what about the houses houses youd say huts look beyond the market beyond carlots pointing chin six cubes were strung along a spire of wood with a rocket tank and nozzle at one end thats captainguardian wayne mickls household cariot said hes one of the richest officers it isnt close that one is a structure floated against the dark a cube festooned with platforms extrusions for tethers water pods and other things for which he had no name thats the hillards i think and that puff jungle is the kerians the sky was full of puffballs the one cariot pointed out bore a big k with other letters within too small to read cariot said crew live in those if theyre too poor to buy wood usually they clip a logo in the foliage rather laughed okay im convinced another puff jungle was marked with a slender figureeight if youre rich you build with wood yes your family has a house we find our own wood ill show you if it comes around it wasnt finished when we left but i know the design were poor arent we citizens tree is poor you live poor the carm makes you rich except the smoke ring that you cant use it and theres your share of the wart once father sells it rather speaking i think im going to marry raff rather turned to look at her the sudden black emp tiness in his belly was entirely new to him yet he couldnt feel any surprise he got his lips working would you be better off if i went somewhere else she was having trouble meeting his eyes i havent seen raff in three years rather i think hed be happier if he didnt know weve been making babies i wont announce it all right but i wouldnt push you into the navy just to get rid of you dont ever think that i dont know if its a good idea or not i dont think for citizens tree and i dont do your thinking either dont give up the idea just to stay near me i have no intention of joining the navy rather turned back to the sky he was still on watch now that he knew what to look for the sky danced with structures puff jungles were everywhere more of them toward the dark and some were marked there were wooden cubes and clusters of cubes elaborately col ored in bright primaries he could pick out windcurdled lines of steam crossing the dark he said people change in three years cariot said sure maybe we wont like each other well see im telling you rather if we get along ill marry him belmy was the first of the logging concerns and its the most powerful the helmet had been in place in the termite nest for some twenty hours kendy ran the record through his mind classifying deducing making notes when he reached present time he went back to the beginning his mental model of the admiralty was shaping up nicely larry niven there were more new plants than new animals ani mals showed the same modified trilateral symmetry here as they did in the smoke ring proper there was a clear absence of tidestabilized plants hardly surprising the buildings were interesting everything less primi tive than a carvedout cottoncandy plant was built in rec tangular solids it was as if they still built to resist gravity but not quite for addenda sprouted at any angle and openings might appear in any of the six walls they looked like escher had designed them some houses had a big square fin sticking out from one corner the clump was turbulent in infrared kendy could see little whirlwinds dust devils with no dust in them a house would tumble and keep tumbling without that fin unless it was attached to some larger structure why was there only one market it didnt look difficult to construct houses were scattered through the outer clump most would have no neighbors at all most of the time there was no need for such isolation it was inef ficient and lonely the trees attitude changed continually the view through the helmet camera wavered with it kendy was getting only glimpses of the market but he could integrate them many of the structures were moored by concrete to the market frame too bad kendy would have liked to offer them concrete if he ever got their attention hed have to have something to offer some bit of knowledge to make their lives better he knew the pattern that would make them a thriving smoke ringgirdling state in a hundred years but there had to be something quicker electricity the clump never had true night either how did they light their houses he recognized a glass tank from one of disciplines seeding missiles emitting a sharp spike in the light spec trum chlorophyll theyd made it into a hydroponics the smoke ring tank the faceted hemisphere nearby was an old survival tent sheathed with wood with transparent facets left open other structures on the ring were made from smoke ring materials mostly wood but one was a cottoncandy jungle tethered to a mast a building beyond the market sported a broad picture window the windscreen from a carm otherwise no glass anywhere no sand crew drifted among the buildings like leaves in an au tumn wind halfgrown children flew in groups tended by one or two adults ive got to know more can i find a way to move the helmet into the market booce was in position at the rocket with hot coals ready and debby and clave to watch and to steer the sky was thick with debris one might hope that carlot and rather would keep to their watching but at least theyd have their chance to talk a navy ship had them in clear view supervising to make sure that the log came to rest a safe distance from the market a larger rocket pulled free of belmys log and steamed toward logbearer booce and his damaged tree would arrive in a blaze of publicity he was returning like a beggar but of course there was the wart and the silver suit behind it he would have liked to lose that the worst the admiralty could charge him with was concealment of vital resources but that was a heavy charge was it worth the risk to be able to talk to jeffer the scientist not that he had a choice he was almost home the belmy log was ahead of them eclipsing the market the tuftless end looked chewed belmy had sold some of his wood woodsman was prominent in the sky arriving nozzle foremost there was no mistaking that elaborate super larry niven structure four cubes surrounding the water pod each painted a different color each bearing the small black b logo handholds everywhere and a steering platform around the nozzle with a carved rail the nozzle was mounted a little out from the rest so that replacement water pods could be inserted easily hilar belmy was coming to greet him almost time he said and saw clave and debby nod acknowledgment booce pushed his coals into the fire box the fire would need time to catch belmy docked his log behind the market of course were going to have to dock behind him then it gets unpleasant debby asked why not dock just ahead of the mar ket because thats where the admiralty docks its ships booce if youre expecting a fight youd better tell us now also what weapons bloodthirsty woman no weapons no fight its just im coming in behind hilar belmy with a fuel pod for my cabin and a log damaged in two places checker only knows what hilar will think hell change his mind when he finds out about the wart but that log still has one tuft so why on earth would hilar belmy leave one tuft on a log clave asked why didnt we wind you can bring a log to its mooring with one tuft on but its tricky it usually means you ran out of honey or bugs hmm what just a passing thought hello hilar his crew stared they had never heard so cheerful a sound from booce serjent woodsmanvented steam decelerating two men rode the platform above the nozzle they were tall taller than the smoke ring booce their necks were long like ryllins there was a greatgrandmother in common black hair gray hair otherwise nearly identical the blackhaired man waved joyfully booce couldnt tell belmys sons apart but that must be raff and carlot would be waving back gray hair was hilar he looked good sturdy pros perous a few kilos more massive than his son booce i thought id offer you a tug how did you have some trouble that we did booces shout became less effortful as belmys rocket drew closer hilar thanks for the offer but ill bring her in myself stet hilar belmy shouted back woodsman slowed and stopped fifty meters from the trunk join us after i want to talk business stet booce dropped his voice now lets do this right debby stand by the water pod clave ill need you to help me turn the rocket logbearer looked ready the firebox was dull red white light glowed through the cracks the plates had never fit exactly but they didnt seem to be coming apart logbearer was tilted nearly par allel to the bark booce entered the cabin he blew into the flow port and emerged panting clave not quite yet now they heaved against logbearers fuel pod tilting the rocket in its bark nest to keep it pointed straight toward the market condensing live steam drew a line across the sky woodsman stood well clear the log turned as it approached belmys log and the rocket turned in coun terposition and the logs sluggish motion slowed slowed stopped booce dove into the cabin he knocked the plug loose from the flow port and jumped away warm water glob ules followed him out ive spilled the water debby hose down the firebox were in place larry niven the firebox hissed globed in invisible water vapor the coals went out immediately the gap between the two logs remained constant and that was a nominal docking booce said in sat isfaction carlot and rather came around the curve of bark booce called to them well done my crew im crossing to woodsman to see what hilar wants carlot why dont you show these people the market carlot reached him well ahead of rather speak to you in private they flew clear of the others booce asked have you been making decisions she nodded jerkily raff probably expects to see me then you decide whether to take him along will rather behave himself she hesitated its not a good idea ill make your excuses to raff blame everything on me clave and debby followed carlot rather hung back a little flying too close to carlot would be uncomfortable now they passed close to woodsman it was rathers first good look at raff belmy he was darkhaired and tall three meters or close to it with long arms long sym metrical legs stiff black hair and a short beard his neck was like his fathers long and graceful but the lines of muscle showed strongly if you liked tall raff was a good looking man he waved energetically as they flew past then ducked into a cabin there must have been hasty conversation in there when raff belmy emerged he did not follow them id have liked to talk to jeffer first clave said softly the smoke ring let him wonder debby answered well have plenty to tell him when we get the chance they passed the belmy log and the market was huge in their sight the wheel was ten to twelve klomters in diameter and a hundred meters broad the inner surface was partly covered with houses they surely werent proper huts they glowed with color most were cubes and ob longs but there were other stranger shapes a faceted hemisphere a wooden cylinder a larger cylinder as trans parent as the carms bow window carlot shouted back at them as they flew we leam all about the market in school it started out as a beam carved along the entire length of a log three hundred years ago the admiralty ran it through a pond to soak it then they used tethers to bend it in a circle before that the market was only shops tethered together this tremendous made thing this was wealth rather felt the fear and the awe of any savage approaching a civilized city people were flying to meet them the older shops are funny shapes balls and geodes ies that glass cylinder is the vivarium vance limited grows earthlife there carlot noticed that all three of her charges were dropping behind she turned in a half circle and rejoined them are you all right tired rather answered for the others its a little fright ening who are those people friends traders ill introduce you raym crew this is raym wilby he was an older man a jungle giant with pale skin and dark curly hair and beard he shouted at the sight of carlot bounced into her a little too hard and wrapped her in his arms as he examined her companions the wide goofy smile was lost to a look of comical amazement carlot shorts she rebuked him raym these are some of the citi larry niven the smoke ring zens who saved our lives when our tree caught fire hey john hey nurse others were arriving carlot squirmed loose clasped hands or toes chattered introductions john and nurse lockheed were brother and sister and looked it with angular faces and whiteblond hair longheaded grag maglicco was in the navy as a spacer first adjeness swart was small for a jungle giant her hair was black and straight her nose curved and sharp she worked in the vivarium carlot said half a dozen others reached them and rather started to lose track raym would be thirty to forty years old grag would be a little younger the rest were around car lots age jungle giants all and expert flyers carlot told her tale as they flew toward the market other strangers joined them and she had to start over now there were a dozen jungle giants among them and all were strangers to all but carlot she stuck to her fa thers story and made no mention of wart or carm or silver suit the citizens were uncharacteristically quiet there was too much to see and they were surrounded by as many strangers as there were adults in citizens tree debby was finally ready to admit that it had been a mistake she wanted to go home she hadnt been with anthon in hundreds of days booce was afraid of his wife jeffer seemed to be married to the carm and clave the best she could tell clave was vastly enjoying his vacation from his wives she was in a sexual desert she had other reasons for being on edge the market covered a quarter of the sky no bigger than a small tree it was obtrusively a made thing made by the ancestors of this crew they didnt look that powerful they flew a little closer together than debby found comfortable easy to guess why theyd been flying all their lives raym wilby was chattering to rather the bugeyes they get whistling drunk when the fringe blooms you just reach out and pop em in a bag debby tried to follow it but she couldnt the lockheeds stayed together off to one side maybe they were shy adjeness swart flew alongside debby cheerfully she called how do you like the market impressive your first visit to civilization we like to think weve got a civilization too debby said we must be gawking like fools adjeness laughed and waved around her they had passed the rim of the market and were crossing the central gap if youve got anything like this the admiralty would like to know it and as debby was throttling the urge to tell this smug clump dweller about the carm adjeness asked how much can you see of the admi ralty from your tree why havent any of you come here before some didnt want us to come at all we didnt know what wed find maybe things we wouldnt like excuse me debby kicked hard to reach carlot chattering companions surrounded carlot debby tried to ease inconspicuously among them just to listen but she hadnt counted on admiralty manners the locals drifted away from debby and carlot and left them to talk carlot looked at her questioningly debby said im afraid ill say too much adjeness yeah it isnt just the questions its her treefeeding superior attitude carlot i feel so small cant help you there but go fly next to raym he wont let you talk at all carlot held her voice low raym wilby is an old dark diver its gotten to his brain larry niven whats he doing with us hes an old friend of mothers id hate to have her see him now i could get rid of him but its more trouble than its worth either id hurt his feelings or itd take forever stet whats a dark diver ask him or just listen debby dropped back raym was telling rather it isnt the dark that bothers you its the thick your eyes get used to the light in there its kind of gray and the colors bleach out i never heard of a diver getting wrecked unless he was a damn fool because things dont move fast in there but you cant move fast either you drift sometimes you get lost you forget which way is out you come out never knowing how many days you were in rather asked why do you credit on a bad trip you only come out with mud but zakry pays high for mud a good trip you can come out with your hull covered with blackbrain or walnut cushion or fringe raym grinned and debby realized what it was that bothered her about adjenesss toothy smile rather said this makes you no you never hold onto it rich teeth raym was an older man yet he still had half his teeth adjeness must be debbys age but her smile was all teeth with only three or four gaps the rest were youths no teeth missing at all angular huts surrounded her debby fought vertigo down in all directions no tide the admiralty crew were forming a line as carlot led them toward a huge trans parent cylinder they had flown all their lives their grace made debby feel clumsy debby eased into line behind rather the starstuff cyl inder had an opening at one end debby brushed it with her wings as she went through none of the others did chapter fifteen half hands from the citizens tree cassettes year sm weve found a fungus with important medici nal properties woodsmans door had been braced hospitably open a guest need only grip the rounded edge as he flew past set his wings in the racks and swing himself in booce entered an atmosphere rich with blackbrain tea jonveev belmy was a small woman not much more than claves height booce had watched her auburn hair turn gray over the years but it was still long and thick she was busy at a turning cookglobe she stretched a foot to meet booces hand her grip was strong booce im so sorry about wend is ryllin all right shes fine jonveev were doing business with cit larry niven izens tree and thats where she is now he wondered what jonveev was thinking her concern was real of course but she had never dealt with booce himself in business matters ryllin and jonveev did the talking jonveev swung the big globular teapot round her head to settle the water then quickly opened the spigot steam puffed hilar wrapped the teapot in cloth and passed it to booce i never saw a log come home like that do you want to talk about it booce sipped and swallowed he liked his tea hot and this was just off the boil he savored old memories as much as the powerful bitter taste he said not a lot hilar waved it off oh then well i have no wish to drive you crazy at this time tell us a story jonveev said he told it long carelessness and bad luck the fire wend dead karilly mute with shock there was a tuft tribe waiting to rescue us they helped rebuild logbearer we found a tree booce hesitated we were only half a thousand klomters from the clump hilar and we mightve had to go halfway to gold to find a better choice it was big and it was close and we wanted to go home i never saw termites on a tree before a new breed maybe theyre dying now they hav ent done that much damage and its a lot of wood that it is we have a problem jonveev said the tea had come round again booce sipped and passed it on i notice you managed to sell some of your wood some then the whole market saw you coming and the orders dried up i could have sold at a loss but jon veev thought i thought we might reach an agreement she said the merchants cant whiplash us if one of us announces that his wood isnt or sale booce smiled such things had been done wed have the smoke ring to give them time to believe we mean it thirty sleeps or so thatll cost one of us were willing jonveev said well want some thing in return of course speak further he sipped the bitter taste of black brain fungus was the taste of civilization and hospitality and homecoming he wished with all his heart that ryllin were here if hilar was tiptoeing round the edges of a risky venture ryllin would have known at once jonveev said booce well agree not to sell our tree until the next midyear what i want is a loan at reasonable interest or ill offer you the same deal booce was silent the loan would be say tentofourth chits enough to keep one of us going for nearly a year she affected not to notice booces sudden mirthless smile i dont have that much on hand and you i suspect dont need that much wed need it if we dont want to shortchange some of our other concerns but we can float such a loan and recoup it by selling our wood on the other hand what ever youre doing with what was it citizens tree its bound to bring you money but not soon stet but you have a house thats never been lived in the tea caught in his throat booce swallowed care fully managed not to sputter he said ryllin would wring my neck well then you cant do it jonveev said instantly on second thought he could put the house up for sale to buy time if he set the price high buyers would hang back and wait because the serjents were supposed to be broke if the navy bought the wart metal soon enough hed have to take a lower price but hed be able to keep the house but what did the belmys have in mind what would a loan do for them it would be eating interest wb interest larry niven the smoke ring wed pay fifteen percent until the next midyear or take the same that was high but not out of line his first niggling suspicion began to look like the truth ill sleep on it he said wickerwork ran around the inside of the glass bottle and across the center wickerwork everywhere but you had to look twice to see it beneath the plants and mud the mud was at the interstices held in place by nets plants grew from the mud bearing red and yellow spheres and cylinders leafy vines strangled the wickerwork the mud and everything else in sight it was a jungle with curving corridors through it debby felt a sudden terrible homesickness for carther states but the jungle other childhood was drab compared to the vivarium the old man who watched from within one of the open ings was an elderly undersized jungle giant in the humid warmth he wore only a loose pair of short pants his knees and elbows were knobby his skin was yellowbrown and there was something funny about his eyes he watched the growing crowd in some surprise he said late adjeness zakry these are customers adjeness swart said firmly theyve been living without earthlife since checker knows when have they the yellow man brightened well we cant have that carlot serjent how good to see you adjeness why dont you show the crew what theyve been missing carlot and the yellow man disappeared into the green ery adjeness swart said clave told me that no earth life crops is it true almost debby said weve got turkeys raym wilby guffawed adjeness was suppressing a laugh turkeys stet try this she reached into a jun gle of vines and plucked forth a red sphere she sliced it apart with her knife and offered wedges around it was juicy its taste was strong debby chewed and swallowed trying to decide if she liked it rather plucked a slender yellow spike from the muck adjeness intervened not that rather you have to cook that try this dont eat the skin the sphere adje ness sliced up for him was orange outside and in rather bit into a wedge and his eyes got big being back on earth would be like this debby thought alien she recognized almost nothing there were people darting among the plants they glanced incuriously at the intruders then went back to what they were doing some sprayed water at the mud globules or the plants themselves one was pushing a plant ahead of him muddy pale appendages waved naked at one end an older man floated slowly along an aisle turning as he flew to see in all directions debby tried a slice of the orange sphere the sweet ness the wonder of it almost paralyzed her treefod der thats an orange this i can see that debby reached at random whats this a yellow plum not quite ripe it was bitter sour adjeness gave her a darkred sphe roid from another part of the plant cluster this should be better it was you wouldnt want to spend all your funds on fruit adjeness said youll want legumes too but they have to be cooked let carlot take you to half hands steak house before you make any final decisions unless youre really rich then you can buy everything clave said im not sure what we can afford i havent heard any prices larry niven the smoke ring adjeness nodded here eat everything but the cen ter and you can eat that if you want to apple rather asked clave did you eat like this in quinn tuft no hey corn we had corn before the drought here strip off the leaves now the silk too he smiled watching rather bite into it just the outside and its supposed to be cooked its okay this way leave the white stuff stet rayms hand sneaked into a bush as if without rayms knowledge three red objects each the size of his thumb went into his mouth all at once debby was nearly sure adjeness had caught it she only smiled cariot and the slanteyed man emerged from a leafy wall carlots voice was just slightly ragged crew zakry bowles is our host here well go look at the prices after we know some of what we want how are you doing cariot its wonderful rather burst out oranges plums i think we want everything in sight zakry can you eat everything here almost every plant has something you can eat grow ing on it some of the time these potatoes you cant eat what you see the roots down there in the mud you dont eat the inside of an ear of corn clave told me or the pit of a plum oop what did you do swallow it itll come out all right in the end let me show you what else weve got bean vines grew mixed with the corn they seemed to want to take over everything we stopped growing to bacco long ago adjeness said only the officers had fire handy and hey werent buying enough this is let tuce lettuce was leaves it wasnt as sweet as foliage strawberries were as startlingly good as oranges squash looked like jet pods zakry was enjoying himself they went back to the entrance to examine a list of prices clave memorized the numbers he was interested in why so much for strawberries and bananas strawberries keep dying i dont have bananas cant grow them here at all they need tide the navy buys them off some tree dwellers east of here when they get the chance clave you havent established credit yet credit zakry bowles spoke slowly enunciating you hav ent shown that you can pay but you can pick out what you want now then come back later pay me and collect it what we want is stuff we can grow in a tree they discussed that at length rather joined in there were things he would not go home without debby eased over to cariot whats got you upset he wont give me credit we came in with a pod for our cabin and the belmy log already in dock well dave kon owes me money ill go see him excuse me zakry was urging something else on them a greenish yellow fruit with an obscene shape he showed debby how to remove the peel clave laughed when debby bit into it but it was good cariot was talking to the lock heeds and they were nodding she came back i have to talk to dave kon youd be bored youre leaving us stet stay with the lockheeds ill meet you at half hands steak house half hands was across the market they flew through rain droplets flew from the edges of their wings rather breathed through his nose from larry niven time to time he snorted out water debby and clave were doing the same the locals had donned masks of gauzy fabric except for raym who breathed in the rain as if he cared not at all half hands was a faceted dome adjoining a smaller less symmetrical structure you could see through some of the facets on the big dome they were starstuff fabric the rest was gray concrete one sixsided facet had been cut away and a wooden door hinged into the opening grag maglicco the navy man suddenly asked have we all got sticks he assessed the blank looks correctly go on in ill join you couple of breaths he swerved aside headed for an angular hut twenty meters along the wheel the inside was concrete too concrete troweled over a structure of starstuff outside and in the concrete bore paintings of intriguing complexity and a variety of styles but rather caught only glimpses of these through a wall of citizens half hands was full men women and children made a hemispherical shell around the newcomers their toes clinging to twometer poles protruding from the concrete there were no foothold poles in the windows so those stayed clear from an open hexagon on the far side drifted smoke and cooking odors nurse lockheed led them that way she called through the opening half hand a man came out of the crowd behind her hi nurse you got money no put it on the serjents tab i have a party of eight there was nothing wrong with half hands hands he was a jungle giant mostly bald and his arms and legs were corded with muscle he said serjents i heard pull stop sure ill give the serjents credit what do you want lets see the kitchen the smoke ring nobody sees the kitchen half hand was peering past nurse lockheed shorts tree dwellers theyve never seen anything like your kitchen nobody sees the kitchen i did nurse said debby pushed her way forward half hand im debby citizen pleasure he said gravely i wonder if youd be interested in a description of a kitchen in a tuft half hand studied her nodded just you nurse the specials moby how old eight days ago shipful of dark divers took a moby special is moby till we run out sausage cost you three times as much no turkey today we want vegetables lots all kinds couple of ki grams of moby too not too rare mobys ready now vegetables soon you debby you cooked in that tree some half hand beckoned her in rather could feel the eyes with a conscious effort he looked of the forty or so diners only a dozen or so were watching what was happening at the kitchen entrance even those concentrated more on eating their right hands kept pale wooden sticks in constant motion the eyepres sure still made him flinch grag maglicco rejoined them he passed out pairs of sticks of pale wood no bigger than the branchlets a tree dweller was used to a woman brought them a twokigram slab of meat black on one side pink on the other john lockheed took it on his knife he flapped toward the wall pushing the meat ahead of him diners edged aside to give him room or to avoid getting grease on their clothing larry niven the smoke ring nurse had to urge them come on there were too many people but clave followed nurse and rather followed him there was room nurse talked to some of the locals around them john carved chunks from the meat and passed them knife to sticks moby meat was good ten derer than swordbird richer than turkey grags own sticks like every clump citizens were ornately carved some were wood more were bone grag caught rather looking he showed rather his own bone sticks you carve them yourself circle would mean im married spiral means im looking a bird would say who i work for outline around the bird would mean i own the company what ive got is the rocket cause im navy youd want a honey hornet for serjent logging change life style start new sticks john lockheed pointed out a clump of customers to clave tall men and women a dozen or so and a few infants isolated clustered close as if for protection pe culiar footgear thickheeled sandals with toes protruding theyre happyfeet half hand should make them check those shoes at the door john said theyre for fighting for kicking lupoffs yes why no reason clave said gourds of red liquid passed among the diners one came within reach and john took it he drank then passed it to clave fringe tea dont take too much it went from clave to rather its taste was bitter and sweet not unpleasant john stopped rather from passing the gourd to raym too much in his blood already raym grinned and nodded debby and half hand joined them they made room debby said hes got four citizens doing the cooking all women theres a major fire against the back wall held in by sikenwire the kitchens got maybe twenty windows in it and half hand closes some of them to get the breeze he wants keep the fire going and the smoke out hesroasting a slab of moby the size of two men its black on one side and raw on the other and he slices off the charred side theres also she waved a hand and a foot as if trying to describe without words i thought it was a ball of hard stuff like the vivarium inside a froth of water and live steam and cutup plants its a bag half hand said keep it turning the vegetables cook even draining the water is the tricky part i saw them do that they open the bag and throw the whole glob of cookwater at the lee windows and catch the vegetables in a net ho vegetables are ready then in fact three jungle giant women were already flying around the domes cur vature passing out what they carried we use an open pot debby told half hand tide keeps it in whatever youre cooking we cook meat and vegetables together if you dont keep stirring it it all bubbles out mshell half hand waved one longtoed foot in a half circle and the nearest of the kitchen women came toward them she served red and yellow and green veg etables into smallmouthed bowls half hand said we only serve earthlife plants a man wants foliage he gets it at home meats different we take what we get noth ing turns up sanchiss has a turkey farm darkward the vegetables some were good and some were not and some you couldnt decide right away clave was mak ing notes as he ate food that wasnt eaten went into a wooden barrel from time to time one of the woman re placed the barrel grag maglicco was asking debby has booce been wondering where his house is he hasnt done anything about it yet larry niven the smoke ring well we saw serjent house a few days ago it was twenty degrees spinward of the market and maybe fifteen klomters skyward doesnt look like anyones disturbed it can you remember to tell him stet tell me something else sure debby waved around her im surrounded by teeth how can so many of you keep most of your teeth grag fished in his tunic and produced a stick like a third eating stick carved in the same way with a tuft of bristly vegetable matter at the end scrape your teeth after you eat he said and grinned at the tree dwellers dubious looks another gourd of fringe tea came past rather was thirsty but nobody was taking more than a mouthful and he didnt either he passed it to grag who drank deeply and sent it on why do they call you half hand debby asked my greatsquare grandfather was half hand stuff that moved the old carm sprang a leak froze his hand grandfather was half hand too got bit while he was dark hunting now me soon or late i lose it the idea didnt seem to bother him raym sell me some walnut cushion not this trip next time i need it goes good with potatoes green beans too next time for sure raym promised nurse lockheed laughed and said he cant he doesnt have a ship carlot was shocked raym you lost your shipt raym nodded without looking at her half hand quietly moved off toward the kitchen nurse reached out and lifted rayms chin tell them the story raym it was the last thing raym wilby wanted some of the locals were looking embarrassed clave was quick enough to catch it if its story time ill tell you about the breakup of daltonquinn tree rayms ship was forgotten as clave talked rather knew the tale too well what he noticed was the rise in the noise level half hands was turning bois terous claves words were just perceptibly slurred as if he were sleepy yet he was animated frenetic as he re lived what had been the end of the world for him and for rathers parents rather himself was feeling strange half hand was back look out the window or go outside he said see something water rather said clearly what water not fringe tea does something to my head oh get you water stet mshell ill fix it tree dwellers shouldnt drink too much fringe get to a win dow boy thank me later the nearest window was crowded but rather man aged to get his head into the grouping he watched three kitchen women carry garbage barrels outside and fling their contents across the sky nothing happened for a time rather continued to watch he felt as if he were dreaming fringe he dreamed that triunes abruptly converged from all directions splitting into individuals as they came rather shouted not a warning just an incoherent yell the women heard they looked at him in the window and laughed slender blueandorange torpedos dove among them the wind of their passage sent them tum bling in twenty breaths it was over the triunes moved away regathering their families the garbage had van ished the women kicked to stop their spinning and not one had been touched by the predator birds all the strangers around rather were laughing at him the only good thing about it he decided as he returned to his pole was that nobody else had gone to a window grag and debby seemed mostly interested in each other larry niven but the rest were held spellbound by claves storytelling he spoke of the foray into the carther states jungle he was on the verge of describing the london tree carm clave me i didnt notice most of this what with my broken leg yeah drink some water this fringe is strong john lockheed said yes youre not used to it and passed clave the water gourd clave drank and drank again rather was given a gourd and he couldnt under stand how he had become so thirsty then carlot was there and it was all right and rather was free to go to sleep kendy saw them streaming toward the log like a covey of brightly colored birds young men and women stretched like taffy wings patterned in primary colors flapped be hind making them seem even longer each pattern was different birds must find each other in the sky the helmet microphone picked up giggling and snatches of talk some flew with skewed clumsiness drunk on alcohol or other recreational chemicals kendy ran the record again but the noise factor was too great the words wouldnt come clear they passed out of the helmets view and were gone chapter sixteen high finance from the citizens tree cassettes year state checker officer responsible for the attitudes and emotional wellbeing of the citizenry and for their benign relationship to the state booce started tea when he saw them coming he looked them over as they entered nurse lockheed had the giggles her brother was furious booce smiled at them half hands right fringe tea carlot wasnt happy it was strange debby said we ate well we tried everything clave made a list i hope we can afford it all clave said where larry niven the smoke ring we grow it well have to plant the out tuft and make the lift cables twice as long the teapot went among the halfdozen dumpers who had returned with logbearers crew in a dozen breaths it was empty jonveev was kind enough to lend me some stuff booce said the teapot some blackbrain some cook ware carlot he frowned she should have brought supplies from the vivarium and the market shops she handed him a translucent blanketleaf folded lengthwise there was food within vegetables a slab of cold moby meat and a baked sweet potato half hand gave us credit thatll be breakfast jonveev fed me john lockheed sensed what was happening many thanks booce and wed best be going raym showed his astonishment we just got here raym now come on nurse booce were sorry about your trouble but it didnt ruin a good evening its good to see youback safe carlot he stretched his toes to clasp hers then the whole covey of dumpers moved out into the rain shooing raym and nurse ahead of them now why did they do that clave asked they know we have to talk about money you dont do that in front of strangers booce said all right carlot zakry wont give me credit well have to forage the trunk for food i went to dave kon he still owes for a klomter of wood from our last trip he wouldnt pay me he offered full payment if wed sell him a klomter off the new log at two times tensquare i turned him down right that mutineer thinks we cant afford to hire a judgment see clave the admiralty wont convene a civil court unless both sides can prove that they can pay court costs loser pays but the navy knows we have the wart one way or another well get money or credit carlot i think i know what hilar has in mind burl carlot thought it over the tree dwellers watched with no sign of comprehension she said risky nobody knows how hilar can afford to take the chance he brought his tree in with the tuft still on he asked for a loan and of fered decent terms usually the tree dies but some times debby suddenly said i remember the idea is to let a tree grow without tide the woods supposed to twist into knots right but trees arent really built for that i wonder if hilar knows something if he can get money to live on he can grow his burl while we sell our wood hed like to get the money from us if we had it we should be asking jeffer about this booce grimaced then sorry debby youre tree dwellers you should know a lot about them but youve never seen a tree growing outside of tide you wouldnt grow burl yourself stet belmys not a fool or he wouldnt be richer than you stet booce bridled but debby went on he knows something you dont something about burl jeffer the scientist knows a lot we dont lets ask burl jeffer said musingly watching the faces in the bow window debby was hiding anxiety booce had asked his question with some belligerence this had been her idea not his are you any good at all prove yourself scientist blue lines of print scrolled across the faces integral trees grow well in a wide range of tides low atmospheric pressure kills them paster than low or high tide in dense air and very low tide they might survive in freefall larry niven they die otherwise we would find trees growing naturally in the clump booce was talking hilar thinks hes got me by the seeds he offered me a loan if i withdraw my tree from sale but hes not serious itd break me id be paying interest and no way to get it back of course he doesnt know about the wart metal do you really need to know if he can grow burl jeffer said booce youre satisfied that hes trying it you only need a shortterm loan till you can sell your metal the belmys arent your enemies are they no theyre friends who would i talk to if i couldnt talk to other loggers but hilar would love to have me carving the dumbo on my sticks and all the loggers want to be richer than say the architects jonveev wont loan me money unless she thinks i can pay it back or if ive got some kind of collateral hell a tree should continue to grow if there is suf ficient tide to pull water and nutriment into the treemouth and to work the internal veins within the trunk spin the log jeffer tell them about the wart carlot was saying i didnt want to i guess ive got to itd be better if i knew exactly what hilars planning hell spin the log jeffer said what what for spin tide clave its a scientific thing here pick up that pot or whatever and throw it round and round your head anns length like that stet feel the pull like tide isnt it belmyll use his steam rocket to start the log spinning not enough to tear it apart just enough to keep some pull inside the tuft the tree needs tide to move its food around the smoke ring by the state i believe youre right but the uh growth patterns would still be screwed up with voy going round and round and weird clump tides going every which way ive never seen burl but isnt that what you want booce grain that doesnt grow in straight lines hell spin it just enough to keep water and fertilizer in the treemouth yes okay losing contact hilar and jonveev waited wearing polite smiles until booce had finished talking burl hilar said it sounds interesting but risky hardly costeffective jonveev said booce said there are other values it would be in decently lucrative if it worked youd have done some thing nobody else could they did not comment and he went on lets assume just for talking purposes that youve been considering a burl tree who else would you let in on the secret the belmys looked at each other youd need masses of tree food mud say from deep in the dark would you buy it from zakry or haul it yourselves with woodsmant jonveev sighed all right booce what have you got in mind logbearer could haul the mud to feed the tree the whole market knows that my last trip failed they wont be surprised when logbearer becomes a dark diver let them think im looking for fringe and blackbrain while i haul mud for zakry mmm said jonveev one thing more ive got eight kiltons of metal buried under the termites their faces were quite blank after a moment jonveev larry niven the smoke ring said thats not portable money you still cant offer us a loan not until you sell it an excellent point hilar jonveev what i want is this first you do your damndest to turn that half tree into burl second i need a loan hilar was laughing a shortterm loan to let me spend money like an old dark diver while i wait for the navy to buy my metal ill pay twenty percent to the crossyear and i need ten tothird chits ill pay part of it back in mud at the same price zakry pays the rest at the crossyear and ill hand you another five times tentothird thatll save any project you had to shortchange its not a loan though it buys me half the burl half jonveev exclaimed so caught jonveev belmy laughed and said we hadnt thought of spinning the tree but can you really afford to risk that many chits youre moderately rich now why not stay that way i like the odds ive got some crew who think it might work and theyre tree dwellers i think you think itll work and that helps twofifths of any burl and we want five times ten tothird chits well get you your loan but at forty percent to the crossyear mmm ill hand you our cash on hand and give you the rest in ten days booce said ill pay thirty percent to to ten sleeps past the crossyear the navy might just hold me up for that long and classify this if the navy knows i took a loan theyll know im still under pressure i want them to move hilar laughed where else could it have come from ill visit the house before i start throwing money around theyll think i had it in the house and all of this was reported in garbled form through clave and then jeffer who had never dealt with finance to kendy who never had either but kendy had sketchy records of the capitalistic societies that had died with the formation of the state hundreds of years ago it was a hell of a way to run a civilization these people needed him jeffer seated before the carm camera asked do you understand any of this yes but it would be difficult to explain what matters is that your citizens will have their earthlife seeds yeah jeffer stretched unselfconsciously thats good well have to talk fast when we get back to citizens tree the seedsll help and well carry fresh food too something they can eat right then are you getting what you wanted what kendy wanted was still beyond his reach he said ive learned some things tell me the admiralty is selfsufficient theyre a successful culture but the crime rate must be high otherwise they would need fewer navy ships and the houses would have more openings kendy displayed the picture the pres suresuit camera was sending from the clump small green outlines flickered as kendy pointed out ships then the few but massive doors on nearby houses theyve settled the outer shell of the clump but they only venture gingerly into the dark center their infant mortality rate must be as bad as yours when they add up their popu lation they dont count children any more than you do i never noticed that hmm london tree didnt either is it because so many children die yes wait a thousand years and the death rate will have diminished theres nothing else to be done i never thought there was while ive got your at tention kendy i found a listing on the clump lagrange points its called what do these words mean equipo tential saprophyte somethings happening larry niven the smoke ring a steam rocket emerged from the fog and rain it came to a halt fifty meters from the helmet camera navy jeffer said unnecessarily i wonder thats booce and a silver suit i see them an equipotential is the curve on which some force or energy level is everywhere equal it might be gravity or tidal force or magnetic force a saprophyte is a family of plants that dont use light well see some if clave can take the helmet into the dark four men flew toward the camera two in navy armor one standardissue pressure suit and booce serjent the pressure suit was better kept cleaner and shinier than the citizens tree suit there were big navystyle fins at the ankles the design painted on the back was repeated on one shoulder and on the fins a broad green ring with a blue dot at the center kendy tried to make contact with the suit radio he found nothing either it wasnt on or the frequency had wandered over the centuries the helmet was thrown back on its hinge despite the rain the face inside was a rounded anglo face without the soft elfin look of most smoke ring citizens a dwarf face shaved sprouting an earth days worth of dark shadow the dwarf looked around him this was clever booce do you have torches im sorry captainguardian we can make some up no need how do i get through this muck the dwarf had no accent kendy gloated no accent he spoke exactly as a state citizen would have the officers must learn their speech from the admiralty library they were drifting out of view kendy switched to the fisheye lens he and jeffer watched the captainguardian take his wings off and tether them to lines on his chest shinsticks uppermost the two lowerrank navy men pulled up an edge of the termite nest the dwarf squirmed in sudden yellow light flashed through the hole jeffer asked does that light come from the pressure suit ill show you how to work the helmet light later the dwarf popped out of the hole theres a re spectable store of metal here well have to wait for the council to convene before we make an offer per kilton delivered unless youre prepared to accept an immediate offer of say two times tentofifth chits for the whole chunk i can get two or three times that on the market perhaps if we come to an agreement i can give you payment within ten days no thank you captainguardian ill wait maybe i can earn some money dark diving can i offer you tea you wouldnt want to have to sell your new house two and a half no i should point out that youve been seen coming here theres a happyfeet jungle in dock and they might guess what that means also ill be expected to hire an exterminator i cant hide the metal much longer the captainguardian snorted and waved to his escort they departed booce waited until they were well away then he moved faceon to the camera jeffer here that was captainguardian wayne mickl officer by birth but his effective rank is guardian keeping him happy is a good idea he didnt look happy if hes too happy we got robbed jeffer how sure are you that spinning a tree will make burl jeffer laughed i never tried it myself yeah are you all right it isnt too bad something like being young again larry niven just old enough to hunt alone ive got the cassettes when i get bored i miss lawri well im going to move the silver suit we cant leave it here where then my house ill set it up so you can see the commons room we can talk any time and when i have guests youll see them too thats good said jeffer very good losing contact chapter seventeen

make sure she wouldnt get lost in the sky then sent her on her way the rest shared out the meal from half hands for their breakfast then got to work they fueled and fired log bearer and set it steaming along the trunk a half turn brought the rocket to a halt opposite the wart clave carlot and rather swarmed out and attacked the termite nest with matchets when logbearer blocked the market and floating chaff and chips of bark and wood blocked most of the sky clave and rather ducked into the nest clave retrieved the body of the silver suit rather the helmet booce had kept the rocket hot he jetted water into it and away they went secrets rather was starting to get the knack of it half the termite nest had been scraped away not by a hired team but by amateurs what would the market think booce must be hurting for money his crew has exposed damage to the log a gaping ugly hole behind the termite nest theyve quit in disgust unlikely that anyone else would pry into that buginfested darkness the house had drifted about the sky since its comple tion a year and a half since debby had relayed grags message it was fifteen klomters skyward and some de grees to spin from the market the house was closer than it had been when grag spotted it but it was still a three day trip the house was five cubes arrayed around a concrete core a small puff jungle grew on the roof the main door was a huge slab of wood five meters long by four wide half a meter thick booce set massive triangular braces to lock it vertical to the doorway mountings covered the inner surface tethers for wings and cloaks and coils of line and big knobs to serve as moorings for winches and pulleys they tethered logbearer to the door in its shadow they moved the silver suit and helmet inside the smoke ring

booce has retrieved funds from some hiding place he can outwait the navy to sell his metal belmy house booce came as misdirection the market any hiding place in booces house must be empty now where do we put it rather held the helmet like a severed head look around booce said something will occur to you the citizens smiled at each other they began to tour the house doorways led from one section to another through the starshaped concrete core there were only two ways to move rather had to squeeze past clave circling the other way the house was roomy as big as a citizens tree hut though much harder to build the public room was lined with handholds and with hooks for outer garments and weapons and a rack for a teapot the outer wall of the kitchen had long slots in it for ventilation a concrete fireplace with a bellows attached and racks for wood and cookware rather found carlot making tea he asked you already know she nodded brightly the sleeproom tethers and some wiry foliage padding four of the walls what was this next room curtains fixed across both interior doors handholds and tethers mounted next to small windows with hatches over them ah this was the treemouth and the fifth was a stor age room with another oversized door and moorings for tethers but nothing stored yet rather returned to the public room larry niven debby was moving slowly around the perimeter she seemed more cheerful than she had been lately hi rather grag brought me back i gather were looking for some secret hiding place any luck not yet booce how do you get rid of the treefodder after you feed the tree booce stared what oh the wind floats it away and fisher jungles gather it in now you know why every one doesnt just tether his house to the market find any thing i didnt see any hiding places ive never seen a house before you were all somewhere else so i searched here debby said nothing booce are there holes in the con crete booce laughed i could have done that access through the walls well any burglar could tear the core apart and all hed find is concrete and two chunks of spor ing fringe buried along the hub meanwhile what do you think of my door thick like youre afraid someone might kick his way through we tend to make them massive not just for burglars it has to stand up to rough treatment when youre moving heavy stuff clave shook his head in disgust wed know who our thief is wed kick him into the sky booce your trouble is youve got too many people in the clump booce was taken aback i never thought of it that way anyway let me show you what i did when the door was fully open one could slide aside a panel in the edge that faced the hinges the halfmeter thickness of the wood had been hollowed out the silver suit went in easily the helmet was barely small enough now we need a hole booce said kendy for the state jeffer would you rather sleep the smoke ring mpf no hello kendy jeffer stretched if i didnt want you waking me up id sleep outside he looked at the view in the bow window oho it was dark but jeffer could make out claves anxious face his voice sounded faint distant jeffer talk to me jeffer prikazyvat relay to pressure suit scientist here what do you see you and a ragged border what did you do youre looking through a hole in a door booce ripped a hook out from here it looks like he just put too much tension on it good enough i take it we can talk rather you there rather floated into view smiled and waved others joined until five citizens floated in a star with their heads inward booce said ive made a deal with the belmys jeffer would you like to learn something about the dark you mean the clump interior sure thats good because ive agreed to bring back some mud for belmys burl tree youre going all of you logbearert ah no i think id better stay here ive been weaving financial threads into one very complicated net carlot you can handle logbearer alone stet and i gather raym wilby is at liberty he can guide you car lot was nodding eagerly oh and hilar hadnt thought of spinning the burl log but hes going to try it sounds good carlot will you take the helmet so i can see these marvels carlot looked to her father who said why not good rather tell me about the navy take your time rather talked kendy guessed that the boy wasnt hid ing anything but he kept jumping back and forth kendy printed questions across the bow window jeffer solicited larry niven descriptions of petty wheeler bosun murphy navy armor the navy ship murphys description of navy life wheelers offer is this standard booce anyone can join the navy not just anyone they wouldnt have carlot because of her legs otherwise well any savage could join but he might not get beyond spacer first until theyve watched him for years the navy wants loyalty they take more men than women and they wont take you if youre too old to be trained loyalty if youre loyal to your tribe youre not loyal to the navy navy above all even family the question is if rather goes in can he get out booce booce mulled it up to a point it would be con venient if rather let petty wheeler make his pitch rather the navy could put certain kinds of pressure on me until i talk ou into doing that they want the wart but they can slow things down for me and we dont want the navy taking a hard look at us no clave said but when wheeler interviews you he might leam that youre simply not suited to navy life i can help you to help him reach that conclusion carlot said he could get out later than that rather my cousin grag says they treat you like a copsik in basic but after that youre supposed to think youre better than the citizens they do think theyre better than us and they dont take just anyone when youre ready to leave just do something wrong or get sick and stay sick tree dwellers do get sick in the clump theyll bounce you out you think i should do this she shrugged unhappily whatever you want jeffer said id really like to get him into the library booce shook his head no dwarf gets beyond guard the smoke ring ian unless he was born an officer and even then well wayne mickl is officer and dwarf they need him as a guardian so hell never use his higher rank guardian is the lowest rank that can reach the library but they cant use it because they arent taught to read and you wouldnt be a guardian for years rather jeffer jumped on it but he could reach the library and rather can read and i can teach him how to use a carm keyboard rather was feeling trapped he knew how to talk to jeffer the scientist but how could you argue with a door i hate to pass up the chance clave said rather youre reluctant how do the rest of you feel debby it feels like were selling him as a copsik im against it thank you debby clave stared at her then rather does it feel like that i wouldnt do that were just talking now they want his loyalty stet booce theyve been doing this for going on four hundred years debby said maybe they can get his loyalty clave snapped treefodder debby london tree was keeping copsiks for about that long when the chance came to bust loose they did it not all of them clave uhhuh booce booce said were talking about power navy power and it cuts two ways if rather was navy the serjents would see a certain friendliness emerge id love to put a son in the navy carlot she spoke to rather not clave if you can stand it remember what i said about basic they worked grags tail off hey youre stronger than grag you lived in a tree you just might give them a shock larry niven we know you can fit a silver suit booce added even bosun murphy doesnt know that im scared clave just nodded but jeffer snarled like static oh rather were here already back in citizens tree that was the time to be scared pause what are you scared of its all too strange rather was suddenly unbear ably homesick this wooden house all angles itll keep being strange nobody fooled you on that scientist i came here looking for strange i wouldnt be here if it was going to be just like citizens tree then but rather had the words straight in his mind now i followed you here but the idea was to face the admiralty in the company of my friends and my elders and my father are we all going to join the navy now is that what were talking about clave said jeffer the door said im for it of course but the boys got a point its his risk not ours rather wasnt finished youre asking me to swear to something that isnt true i am not loyal to the navy if you thought i was you wouldnt like it nobody wanted to answer you can feed your secrets to the tree i will not join the navy but i can go talk to wheeler if you think itll help ill do that i go with him debby said firmly and booce you tell me how to look unsuitable a black depression was settling over him he felt rejected by all of his companions save debby but carlot wanted him out of the way for raff belmy chapter eighteen headquarters from the citizens tree cassettes year day jeffer the scientist speaking candidates are considered unsuitable for the navy if they are sickly or undefendable or easily lost or dis tracted or loyal to some entity other than the navy they may have unacceptable motives for joining if a family member accompanies candi date may be reluctant or may need supervision acceptable candidates would presumably have opposite traits data are as acquired from booce and carlot serjent headquarters was a pillbox a short wide cyl inder blurred to rathers weeping eyes the rim was dark wood the nearer flat face was concrete covered with a variety of doors platforms winches coils of line and larry niven a broad strip of glittering stuff very like the hull of the carm two rockets were moored near the hub a third larger was being winched in nozzleforemost debby looked back rather was far behind when she stopped flapping a gust of wind caught her wings and turned her on a random axis she sighed and flapped back to rejoin him i wish i could help she said rather made himself laugh i did it to myself debby you fly better than me i watched the crew when we went to market keep up a steady kick dont try too hard if you kick with all your might the wings just bend and dont take you any where what i need is longer legs longer wings might do it try the navy wings too now what door did carlot say i cant tell pick one no i debby pick one at random i dont mind if wheeler thinks i got lost oh the one in the middle with the guards well ask them it was big and round and rimmed in scarlet paint the four guards wore helmets and torso and leg armor and carried harpoons debby backpedaled to stop within a meter of the harpoon points she said looking to join up one smiled and said i hope they take you beauti ful his harpoon pointed that one just next to the rim thanks she rejoined rather half blind hed been afraid to fly close to sharp spears its over there lovely beard on that one like goldenwire plant and clean thecrew keep themselves cleaner than carther states people ever did maybe ill see him again jefferd like that the smoke ring he would wouldnt he he probably likes my seeing grag too i wonder what theyre guarding the door they sought was a rectangle with curved sides marked in print along one edge recruitment the room within was sizable but of the same odd shape a man made marks on thin white sheets fixed to a slab of sanded wood his pants and tunic were blue with navy markings no armor he ignored them for a bit then looked around yes rather pointed to the wooden rectangle there were clips along the edge and stacks of paper leaves in the clips what would you call that the man frowned you never saw a desk before what do you want petty mart wheeler wants to interview me for re cruitment im rather citizen ill see if hes available the man kicked against the table and disappeared down a corridor lack of wings didnt hamper him he touched the wall and disappeared into a doorway in one smooth flow debby smiled at rather easily distracted thats why i did it but look at how the grain of the wood curls around i think it must be burl how did they get it there had to be burl somewhere or booce wouldnt know it was possible when the desk man reappeared rather was mopping at his eyes with his tunic the man said come with me debby said may i come too im afraid not would you be his mother stepmother i really think i ought to be with him thats not permitted the office was small a cube with two curved walls petty wheeler was at a desk lightly gripping the rim while he talked to another man and that one was rathers height larry niven their talk stopped wheeler said rather good to see you this is captainguardian wayne mickl mickl nodded but said nothing he seemed relaxed and disinterested wheeler said we want to ask you a few questions you probably have questions too a hundred urn whereabouts is bosun murphy mpf last i saw of her she was on her way to the pursers office after that shell be on leave why i thought i might see her before i go booce had told him try to talk to bosun murphy your interest in the navy comes straight from your seeds if you see her make a pass whats a pass do you mean propose marriage no yes thats got just the right touch all seeds and no judgment wheeler asked rather is there something wrong with your eyes they get this way sometimes when lack of sleep dry air his eyes were clearing up now but they still hurt to wheeler they must appear pink and weeping he was sniffling too wheeler took writing implement in hand where were you born citizens tree year its a tree sixty klomters long six or seven hundred klomters west of the clump whats your height and mass one point nine meters i dont know my mass well weigh you on the centrifuge how did you know the year the scientist keeps track was i off this is isnt it thats right put your arms straight forward finger tips touching now your legs big toes touching wheeler made a note symmetrical how much do you know about the admiralty not much we tasted some of the food you grow and the smoke ring had a wild dinner at half hands steak house wheeler laughed at that rather went on the serjents told us a lot ive seen houses and the market the ride on the steam rocket was well ive never been through any thing like it scary no not that he knew instantly that he should have said yes why do you want to join the navy i came to find out if that was true petty and you asked if i had questions petty wheeler stiffened a little well ive seen the ships theyre all over the sky i think i ought to ask if i become a navy man will i in fact be riding one of those ships more than one i expect over the years youll fly every style will i be flying them or just riding them youve given this a lot of thought yes sir once i thought id be a hunter for citizens tree no need to mention the silver suit when i joined booce and went logging that was a big jump i didnt know what id find here the market its frightening to think such a thing could be built so many people wheeler was smiling nodding in the corner of rath ers eye wayne mickl was clinging to a wall tether merely observing daunting is it rather nodded the ships the market headquarters we built them all and more we built a civilization wheeler said gently now that youve seen it how can you not be a part of it yes youll fly a ship before youre much older i want to know whether ill be able to visit citizens tree mph the answers yes but i dont know how often well want to contact citizens tree at once set up some larry niven form of trade therell be visits and youll be useful as an intermediate it was the right answer rather thought except for two things the tree was in the wrong place and if the navy did find it the citizens would have to hide the carm every time the navy came visiting so rather only said thats good id hate to be cut off from my family booce had said they want your loyalty they wont like it if youre loyal to your family your tribe me how often do you get these allergy attacks usually just when the airs too thin i had them while we were moving the log we were too far in its like knives in my eyes i havent been getting enough sleep lately it happens then too would you describe yourself as sickly rather told himself that nobody would come to a re cruitment office if he considered himself sickly and said no its just something that happens a day later im fine its almost over now i see all right rather go ask able jacks to put you on the centrifuge well get in touch with you through booce serjent debby and the desk man were ignoring each other debby seemed nervous rather howd it go fine are you able jacks thats right youre to take me to the centrifuge whats a cen trifuge ill show you the wicker structure resembled the treadmill that ran the elevator in citizens tree it was wider twenty meters across rather was instructed to cling to the rim and wait two ratings spun it up timing it with a handheld device the wheel rolled eccentrically with his mass to throw it the smoke ring off a rating measured the divergence of the hub your mass is eightyone kilgrams he said they locked the centrifuge in place and made him run pushing himself round the rim gave him the sensation of tide they had him run as fast as he could it made him dizzy the tide became fiercely strong then they made him slow down and run at a measured rate until his legs burned and his eyes blurred he would have stopped then if he had not noticed bosun murphy watching him he waved the motion almost sent him tumbling she didnt respond but she watched and he ran it came to him that he was rolling around the cen trifuge hed blacked out a rating snatched at his ankle and pulled him out take a rest here he handed rather a towel and rather gasping for air mopped a sheath of water from his body murphy said that was quite a performance i could win bets on you i grew up in a tree i know there was no animation in her voice her face her body language navy thinks theyre superior carlot had said but that wasnt it bosun are you all right im a little down she said call me sectry rather im not on duty does down mean something like miserable yeah guys are you finished with him hes all yours bosun no need to be careful he aint fragile sectry murphy flashed them a fleeting smile to rather she said i cant picture the petty rejecting you after he hears about that performance tree odder booce hadnt thought to tell him to hold back on a stamina test whats got you down not here stet i need someone to talk to not navy larry niven i just came from the pursers and im ready to tie one on want to join me im with debby my stepmother stet lets go get her how does half hands sound rather was coming down the corridor there was a woman with him once upon a time debby had seen rather and mark talking in the citizens tree commons both dwarves but they hadnt looked at all alike marks face nearly square rathers nearly triangular she remembered it now because rather and the dwarf woman looked right to gether though they were clearly from different branches of humankind and both in different fashions looked worn out debby asked what happened to you rather said centrifuge they ran me to death i could have lifted an elevator all the way to discipline debby you remember sectry murphy clasping toes felt odd sectrys reach was so short her toes so stubby and strong hello sectry take it youre off duty right on our way to half hands join us sure sectry led them in the place is nearly empty she said it wasnt there were a good dozen people scattered around half hands but windows were clear and sectry led them to one its nice to have a view she said over her shoulder rather flinched debby grinned shed seen rather watching sectrys kicking legs grab a pole someone will come you hungry when one of the women from the kitchen appeared sec the smoke ring try said fringe tea and sausages for three belind you two should try the sausage stet rather said whats got you down the false gaiety ran out of her and debby saw pain ive been trying on pressure suits i dont fit debby said nothing rather said nothing they dont let you try the suit till you qualify for guardian in all other respects so they got me into the small one and i couldnt breathe murphy wasnt wear ing armor now her breasts stretched her tunic tight debby had never had trouble feeding her children but her own breasts didnt have that vulnerable look i could have faked it but the suits arent all quite the same size so i tried the bigger suit my feet wouldnt reach the toes there are controls in the boots my fingers dont quite reach either that leaves one debby said the large its in use it wont fit if my damn toes were longer im out i cant be a guardian belind was back sausage was a tube seared around the outside deli cious inside ground meat with bits of plants added fringe tea debby knew from last night she still had a trace of the morning headache the situation felt uncomfortable and debby was re hearsing excuses to leave she asked are you going to stay in the navy i think so ill never get further than bosun though youll be flying more exciting than guarding the li brary as a guardian i could spend some time making a home get married carry some guests dont they mind navy people making babies you go to half pay when youre showing but youve got a mate working and even if you dont navy pay is good sectry drank deep she hadnt touched her sau sage larry niven rather asked sectry why would someone like the captainguardian be interested in a recruit wayne thats easy if he can get enough dwarves at guardian rank he can move up to captain hes got the rank but not the duties him hed be better off if he couldnt fit a pressure suit debby took the rest of her tea in two gulps ive got to be going thanks sectry i shouldnt have come in im supposed to be buying stuff at the vivarium now that weve got money well remember youre on fringe the redhead said watch the prices ill be careful outside debby let herself smile how would rather handle it let sectry believe that hed come to the navy only to get close to a lovely dwarf woman it might even be true a sheet of rainwater clung to the window a blurred puff jungle drifted past rather had finished his sausage sectry passed him half others when belind came past she ordered more fringe tea she asked how do you like the clump its mostly strange too wet for one thing i think i could get tired of boxes huts in a tree arent like that sectry why did they build headquarters round it was built to spin spin the early officers they thought wed need tide to stay healthy they gave that up early they couldnt dock a ship while headquarters was spinning and it tended to wobble so they stopped the spin and they built the ex ercise room centrifuge included those early navy men must have been monstrously strong but it turns out we dont get sick we still use the exercise room though the fringe tea was fizzing in his blood sectry murphy the smoke ring seemed to glow his mind was trying to follow a dozen paths at once it suddenly seemed very natural that the early men would move a tree into the clump spin it try to settle the tufts get the benefit of tide and the clustered resources of the clump and produce the burl that later generations hadnt been able to duplicate at the same time there was a strangeness in what sec try had said and then he had it how do you know all that booce told us about the library he said only officers children are taught there wayne told me oh we were together for a while i never thought hed marry me im not an officer but when he what i was saying he told me a lot of history the library used to be part of a starstuff rocket weve never built anything like it what does it look like where she shook her head her hair spread around her like a flaming halo i never saw it myself id like to i wonder if i could talk my way past the guards guards that door voices and vision were turning strange sectry glowed she was the smoke rings most beautiful living thing rather took a firm grip on his equilibrium offering to make babies with a highranking navy officer now seemed presumptuous beyond insanity carlot had warned him she might be badly offended yet hed never seen a woman like her then he married a woman three meters tall and thin as a feathersnake shes got a face that would scare away a drillbit and when she carries a guest she looks like a line with a knot in it but shes an officer money mmm no rank money rather said distinctly is why carlot is larry niven going to marry raff belmy he was losing control of his mouth oh the dark girl serjents daughter a smile flick ered and vanished but rather caught it thats rank too you saw us yeah the smile was back do you have rank im a bosun crew do i have rank no whats this all about if you want rank you join the navy then youre crew would you marry me then his mouth was running away with him fringe she laughed she was trying to stop and ultimately she succeeded we just met how old are you fifteen im twentyeight where do you want to live citizens tree any tree carlot probably wants to live in the admiralty to the treemouth with carlot i do too make babies with me his mouth said she thought it over while rather tried to think himself invisible she said right a score or so of puff jungles were in view some bore logos they chose one that didnt and circled it to be sure quietly now sectry said nobody here but us flashers if we scare flashers out some meat eater might come after them he wiggled through the foliage in her wake nice to have a view the puff jungle was hollow in the middle a thousand flashers edged warily away flashing blue and yellow wings at them the smoke ring they balled their clothes and threw them at the flash ers causing great excitement the birds perched in a shell around the hollow watch ing them she was just his size she knew more than car lot delightful things there were moments in which rather resented that knowledge others in which he was shocked his body knew things his mind hadnt dreamed they rested running hands and toes across the sweatslick contours of strangers flesh learning each other smooth muscle hair red everywhere fingers and toes stubby like his own either of sectrys breasts fit nicely into his two hands we could go back and forth she said live some in the clump some in your tree do you mean that as the fringe died out of his brain he began to wonder what he had committed himself to who knows dont ever make decisions when youre on fringe suddenly sectry wriggled out of his arms she snatched up her wings and eeled through the foliage and out rather followed curious and horny only her head poked into the sky flashers wheeled there and something much larger circled thirty meters away sectry asked want to see something funny a wedge with teeth get back he pulled at her ankle she had donned her wings thats a dark shark carlot showed me we try to keep them out of the market region she thrust herself into the sky naked waved her arms and yelled the dark shark froze a window came open in a nearby cluster of cubes the beast charged rather didnt have his wings he called sectry dark sharks arent funny the long limber torso whipped back and forth too fast to see the narrow triangular wing was a rippling blur sectry turned and kicked hard she dived into the foliage whooping pulling rather after her they were in the hollow center larry niven are you nuts he bellowed and she laughed then the dark shark burst through in a shower of leaves and splintered wood all rather could see was teeth his own wings were out of reach he set his feet against a branch and watched the predator which way to jump flattened head and the forepart of a thrashing torso three big crescent eyes a thousand pointed teeth the eyes beginning to show panic sectry couldnt stop laughing the beast was stuck rather asked you do this a lot sure we dont like dark sharks she wrapped her arms and legs around him and laughed into his face the predator snapped its teeth at them raging and im potent sectry murmured in his ear gives it a kick doesnt it debby was tired she was flying blind pushing bags of about her own mass with no more than the strength of her legs from time to time she stopped to look past her burden the serjent log grew larger logbearer had dropped debby and rather near navy headquarters on its way to the serjent log now debby found the rocket moored near what had been the out tuft two days time had wrought wonderful changes a skeletal cylinder perched atop the fuel pod men were all over it placing planks driving pegs into wood booce floated nearby watching contentedly when he saw debby coming he donned wings and kicked to join her no problems no problems she said zakry wanted money i just went down the list and paid him what i had here theres some left i dont think i got cheated ive only got half the seeds here were supposed to get the rest within five days where do we store all this not in logbearer therell be paint fumes the smoke ring they lined the seed bags along a crack in the bark and ran tethers across them more men approached pushing a cylinder of wooden beams debby watched as they maneuvered the lumber toward logbearer she called ho clave learning a new trade clave joined them he smelled of hard work im learning it but i dont like it too nitpicking every board has to be just the right size just the same thickness i got the seeds good booce isnt this a bit of a luxury dont we have other concerns like selling my wood thisll show off its quality ill paint my logo but ill leave most of the wood bare ill cruise past the market and anyone can see ive got a good tree the hired crew were fixing panels on the long cylinder clave rested resumed work some of the panels were on swivels windows the sun swung behind the dark the day turned gloomy when the sun reappeared passing within a degree of voy one whole flank of logbearer was finished a shadow flapped out of the sun and became carlot with her arms full of gear debby flew to help her carlot was pushing cooking utensils and a slab of smokeblack ened moby meat she asked wheres rather i left him in half hands with sectry murphy mmm they stored the gear near the bags of seeds wed better do our cooking here tonight carlot told her fa ther that paints awful stuff booce agreed carlot asked how did rather do i keep forgetting we want him to fail yeah the way sectry murphy was acting he made some kind of endurance record on a big wheel somebody should have thought of that me booce muttered larry niven might not matter they seem to want him bad the cabin formed with remarkable speed now men were pegging crossbars across the bow for pushing against a log two men produced gourds wind brought a noxious chemical reek booce excused himself and went to supervise while they painted the finished flank oflog bearer cariot asked what was he doing with murphy you remember your father said yes and i said she might be seriously offended he didnt actually make a pass did he not while i was there shes in a rotten mood they put her in a pressure suit and she didnt fit thats bad she wanted to blow her mind out on fringe tea and she wanted company i left them alone treefodder car lot if he does get murphy mad at him whatll she do keep him out of the navy yeah cariot began setting her gear up for cook ing she worked with furious energy debby watched presently she asked cariot are you going to marry raff belmy i dont know i just spent a couple of days with raff aboard woodsman he seems he takes it for granted well be married hes so sure he hardly mentioned it so its what you told rather i know where is he there were beams left over from the making of log bearer clave brought them an armload cariot arrayed them and started a fire booce paid off the hired crew and they departed his own crew went to inspect the altered rocket booce was exuberant clave was proud debby made appropriate noises logbearer had been repaired in just four days the paint was well done she thought she wasnt qual ified to judge woodwork the cabin was as big as the pod roomy for half a dozen booce and clave began the fin the smoke ring ishing touches setting knobs and moorings into the hull outside and in booce wanted particular patterns the fire was going well a dim globe of heat nearly invisible while both voy and the sun bathed this side of the log cariot sliced the moby meat into two slabs she set sliced vegetables between the slabs locked them to gether with wooden pegs and tethered it all within the fringe of the flame a distorted bluefringed black manshape swam across voy rather where have you beent cariot shouted he reached the bark im in deep trouble he said wheres the chairman working on the rocket what kind of trouble cariot maybe you can tell me rather looked be wildered a little frightened im afraid ive gotten my self in deeper than i wanted section four the dark and the light chapter nineteen the dark from the citizens tree cassettes year sm weve had serious arguments about why kendy cut contact maybe something just burned out some circuits mass does constantly rain out of orbit onto voy make that levoys star my apologies to sharon a big infall would cause big magnetic storms maybe big enough to burn out disciplines computer and the thick smoke ring atmosphere would still shield us i hate to think so i liked kendy that sounds crazy a computer program i cant help it kendy had less imagination than the turkeys i tried telling him a joke once and nevermore but i admire dedication and kendy had as much dedication as a man can stand im going to leave this in dennis quinn captain larry niven booce had bought a small pump rather was working it to fill logbearers fuel tank a navy ship was doing much the same on the other side of the pond water had to be shared this close to the market greetings had been exchanged and now the two crews were ignoring each other cariot said rayms been running messages for dave kon and mand curts theyll know where he is youll have to track him down though no problem booce said how did he lose his rocket i didnt want to ask hes far gone on fringe spores dad we want him but i dont want him in charge of anything fine rather stop its full rather began packing up the pump and hose that was quick he said remembering how long it took to fill the carm a pretty good pump for something thats all hard wood lets get going cariot you drop me and clave at the market and then go on to the house clave you get the rest of the seeds i want to buy us some clothes youre all still wearing treedweller pajamas youll bring raym ill send him to the house if hes too fringey to find it i dont want him aboard any ship of mine rather had not found the chance to confide in anyone but debby and cariot maybe that was good booce seemed to take it for granted that he would stay where the navy could find him rathers plans were quite dif ferent would cariot help him he wasnt sure the way she was acting the market swarmed like a hive when the rocket came near a dozen citizens separated from the pattern and flew to look booce delayed his exit for dramatic rea the smoke ring sons when he emerged he was surrounded he stayed to talk and cariot joined him clave grew bored and flapped off toward the vivarium at the far rim booce took an order for a thousand square meters of wooden planks and the sun crossed half the sky and was behind the dark before logbearer moved on serjent house continued to drift it was now radially out from the market the dark eclipsed the sun voy shone from the side half violet half black the cluster of cubes made an eerie sight well have to tell clave debby said first chance we get cariot said im still not sure about this rather said booce was right wasnt he i want to look undependable so theyll think you had dads permission the navy doesnt own me booce doesnt own me even you dont own me cariot and if youre holding me as a copsik i want to know it so i can think about es caping no i dont own you the ship was turning dece lerating cariot was very busy tending the rocket too busy to look him in the face her voice was almost in audible but it was a fool stunt running off to make babies with that navy woman youre going to marry raff belmy i said probably skip it it was a fool stunt so tell me this does clave own you your chairman maybe so ask him whether youre going i want to talk to jeffer too and one other you keep hinting youll see for yourself you too debby i am tree feeding tired of keeping secrets a random comet had impacted levoys star it had reached the surface as a stream of gas moving at thou larry niven sands of miles per second the neutron star had rung like a bell there were two hot spots on the rapidly spinning body at the impact point and the point opposite where the shock waves had converged the violet ion streams that normally rose from the magnetic poles of voy which natives called the blue ghost and ghost child were brighter than kendy had ever seen them radiation was beginning to sleet against disciplines hull but kendy spared instruments for the carm he ran the record as it came in jeffer had been idle not much there the house had been empty most of the time ah here was something the motley collection of metal and plant tissue the sav ages called logbearer bumped the wall nozzlefirst rather debby and carlot emerged they tethered the steam rocket to the door close enough to block the sky rather said jeffer come in jeffer jeffer had been reviewing records from the cassettes he set up the link im here hello debby carlot rather im in trouble rather said tell me petty wheeler interviewed me for the navy how did it go the depth of smoke ring atmosphere was blocking most of the radiation and xrays and kendys instru ments too he could still watch events on the star itself via neudar a plasma cloud hovered over the impact site several centimeters high and spreading at terrific speed along lines of magnetic force rather said scientist i did everything right except only two things i did what booce told me i slept in the silver suit with the humidity turned low and got there sniffling and crying debby came with me and i really did need supervision i could hardly see where i was flying i asked for sectry murphy all seeds and no brain the smoke ring stet but booce didnt tell me not to show off my muscles so i did youre strong but sickly and im a dwarf if enough dwarves get into the navy a certain captainguardian mickl gets to act like an officer im quoting sectry mickl was there to watch the interview two mistakes did you suggest marriage to bosun murphy laughter chopped off we got high on fringe tea then we dived into a puff jungle and quick sidewise glance at carlot whose face was like stone jeffer none of us ever thought she might take me up on it now she thinks im joining the navy and making plans to marry her maybe she can hold me to it this is not to your taste sectry i dont know i dont want to join the treefeeding navy and i dont know how to tell her that okay im thinking rather they already know youre allergic let them train you carlot said they dont give you much sleep in training stay awake even when you dont have to get sick a lot theyll give up i thought of something better listen no you listen i went running to carlot and debby help i said im in trouble i said the navy wants me what do i do and we talked it over and what i want to do now is talk to kendy jeffers medical readings showed his shock kendy stopped paying attention to the impact on levoys star paydirt rather you told them im letting you tell them you and kendy kendy isnt in range yet when he gets the record carlot said kendy the checker larry niven the same jeffer said kendy made contact with us fourteen years ago fifteen now i made a mistake with the carm kendy told us how to get home we didnt hear from him again till well it was just before you showed up carlot he wanted this expedition debby was seething jeffer you treefeeding muti neer what game did you think you were playing hiding a thing like this carlot exclaimed you cant deal with the checker we know all about the record was finished hed reached present time kendy printed ill handle it across the bow window in front of jeffer he sent we told clave rather was there so we told him too hello again debby carlot its a pleasure to meet you at last rather you did the right thing and i suppose youll try to talk me into joining the treefeeding navy but i wont do that kendy i want out of this rather wasnt aboard the carm kendy couldnt get medical readings but he sensed truth here never give an order that wont be obeyed try something else while discipline moves steadily out of range wrap it up fast but wrap it tight kendy asked rather what are you planning remember booce telling me to look undependable the navy expects me to stay in touch im going dark diving carlot and debby and clave are taking logbearer to get mud for belmys burl tree im going with them just to look undependable its not a crime sectryll hate me and i dont like that but itll get me off the harpoon kendy finished putting details on his own plans the speed of his thoughts was one powerful advantage to being a computer it helped win arguments too he said thats good but its not enough not if this wayne mickl wants you so badly we need to get you out of the the smoke ring clump entirely mmm rather i think i may have something booce was planning to take the helmet with him so that jeffer and i can see the dark still true carlot stet dad wants it out of the house good take the whole suit take rather too go into the dark rather the suits fully fueled when youre out of sight of the market they heard him out looking at each other the silence that followed lasted only five or six seconds but kendy found it excruciating then jeffer asked how long have you been planning this about thirty seconds twelve to fifteen breaths i think faster than you do jeffer carlots voice held doubt not anger its mutiny we steal nothing kendy said we wont harm the admiralty at all the information doesnt disap pear but i can read it and then it becomes available to jeffer the scientist rather debby dont you see we came to learn clave and jeffer wont leave until they know what to tell citizens tree about the admir alty this way well learn everything we want in half a day rather said slowly you say you can tell me how to do this ive taken neudar readings i can see the gross struc ture of headquarters its most of a carm surrounded by a concrete shell the neudar shadow of the carm was splayed around its aft end and the back third was missing the explosion must have pulped any pas sengers it had ripped away the outer door of the airlock too the library must be the control room ill guide you well time it so im in contact the whole time even if someone sees something funny itll be too funny he wont believe it afterward you take log bearer home carlot looked at rather i dont owe you this larry niven losing contact kendy said there might have been time for three words more but what would they have been hed simply have to wait the redhead found booce as he was returning from market she looked funny flying her legs chugged faster than a normal womans and made shorter strokes she wouldnt have caught up if booce hadnt been pushing baggage she wasnt breathing hard though she had a charming smile booce serjent do you remember me bosun sectry murphy we met when gyrfalcon came to collect customs how do you do bosun i do okay rathers been accepted for training id like to tell him rather wouldnt like that hell be at the house ill come shall i help with those they kicked slowly along behind them the dark moved in uneasy turgid patterns out and east the sun crept toward voy western rain clouds crawled in long curves to fill the silence booce said weve finished repairing logbearer after breakfast we cruised past the market moving slow i saw it clave went for the rest of his seeds and i picked up some clothing and toothbrushes cant have my crew looking like savages my superiors may be wondering where you found the money its not easy the navys taking its own sweet time to bid a decent price for our metal but ive got some orders for wood and my crew is going dark diving did rather say anything about yesterday not to me he didnt seem to want to talk it must have been a strange experience she laughed then grew pensive presently she said isnt that serjent house the smoke ring yes but logbearer wasnt there booce invited her in the navy woman waited while he made the circuit of the rooms he found nobody there were no seeds clave hadnt arrived yet they must have left already he told her i stayed to bargain for wood clave should have come back well ahead of me it was puzzling was rather going with them no he should be back soon wherever he is she accompanied him to the kitchen and watched while he made tea they returned to the common room and passed the pot between them all in nearsilence booce wondered if jeffer had noticed the navy woman what they really needed right now was a metallic voice bellow ing out of the door youd think hed leave a message she said booce nodded but theyd have left it with jeffer murphy was frowning is it normal for rather to do something like this booce was quick on the uptake hes never done this before well hes been worried about whether the navy take him maybe he got terminally antsy a trip to the dark and booce knew he was right if they think youre undependable rather had gone into the dark could be just what he needs he finished its not what we need murphy rejected the offered teapot how long do you expect them to be gone they werent seriously hunting treasures such as fringe or blackbrain all they wanted this trip was mud so thirty forty days but they wouldnt have left without clave so they must have taken the seeds he was carrying too why tell rather were unhappy booce ive got to be leaving booce hovered at the door to watch murphy depart he whispered jeffer larry niven the smoke ring nothing of course they took the helmet too he waited until sectry was no more than a speck before he opened the compartment in the door the whole damn illegal pressure suit was gone for one magical moment he was nothing but relieved but something was going on here and booce didnt like it at all carlot made her burn with the bow pointed straight into the dark east takes you out out takes you west that a rocket might go where it was pointed was contrary to rathers experience but he didnt want to argue with carlot the market passed them at impressive speed a few citizens turned to watch and were gone raym wilby had never kept silence in his life this first part of a trip is fun but you can still get hurt carlot the tanks near dry stet turn us cut the water flow go in facing sideways carlot looked at him see if something comes at us you run the last of the water in doesnt matter what way youre facing long as it isnt forward somethings ready to hit us you change course if its gonna miss you dont oh she and clave tilted the nozzle log bearer started its turn as she cut off the water flow the slow turn continued as the sky began to darken birds are the worst a pond a glob of mud a jungle they dont follow you if you dodge everybody got har poons stet hey smell that first whiff of the dark state its good to be back logbearer fell straight in it was like entering a huge storm cloud a granularlooking storm cloud the air smelled of wet and rot and mustiness they strungline using beams on the nose as mooring points raym watched and frowned and told them to put the lines closer together its got to hold the mud while you make the burn when they finished logbearers nose was the center of a great web i always string my extra clothes across the middle of the web that way you know the mud wont go through and all over the cabin you bring any extra clothes carlot she spoke through gritted teeth you didnt tell me to but yes i brought extra clothes and i dont much like getting them covered with mud so wash them after you do it when youre ready to leave then you use whats dirty look there aft of cen ter kerchiefs kerchiefs looked like a score of scraps of pink and green cloth afloat on the wind thosere flowers raym said not fungus theyll could you spread those to hold the mud carlot theyre not strong enough touch them and they shred hey you dont mind dirty clothes when youre dark diving they took turns sleeping the sky thickened and dark ened over five or six days then voy and the sun were hidden and it was impossible to know day rathers eyes adjusted he saw colors emerging from the dark blue tinges green orange behind them the murky sky was a blaze of light suddenly bluer as voy passed too bright to look at raym was forward inspecting the web again or maybe he only liked the view clave said it isnt the risk that bothers me its the fact that im not taking it feels like this should be my job rather didnt answer but carlot did oh youre tak ing a risk if rather gets caught the navy want us all clave its not too late to change our minds yeah i know how persuasive kendy is and i think i should have been consulted rather started to speak larry niven the smoke ring clave snapped yes rather it couldnt be done be sides kendys right it gets us everything we came for rather if you dont come back in a decent time were leaving ive got the seeds well just bum straight out and let jeffer find us in the sky stet said rather and what about dad carlot demanded why should the navy believe him when he tells them he didnt know i wont get caught one big risk and we go home i dont owe you this carlot said as she had said before this time nobody answered but jeffer had said you owe citizens tree for your life and it was true i think weve gone far enough clave said no bodys going to see us from the market rather nodded but theres still raym hes easily distracted the rocket had slowed considerably they were drift ing not flying the murky sky was busy with soft shad owy shapes once there was a jagged rock the size of logbearer half covered by rather stared that had to be a fungus but it was convoluted like the mobys brain half hand had tried to serve them raym pointed through the net of lines you can eat that clave said treefodder i mean literally thats a tuft off an integral tree it could have been rather thought there was the curved blade of the branch but where foliage should have been now there was a great misshapen lump of soft gray curves i pushed one of those home once raym said had to my nets were torn up it was all the food i had left and i barely made a dent in it getting home half hand served slices of it for the next twenty days but he didnt pay much rather tuned him out the orange tinge ahead grew gradually stronger orange light shining through shadows rather had grown used to the wet musty smell but something else was in it now raym whats that ive been living with exec ever since the accident my son exec wilby he only went into the dark but once what that thats the fire carlot we have to turn carlot jerked around fire now rather knew that smell fire burning in some thing wet and rotten its been burning down here since i dont know when all my life anyway never gets much bigger never gets much smaller now dont hurry look around and find a pond and steer for that we need more water any way they looked there was no mistaking the shape of a pond of course even in darkness rather found no sphe roids in evidence carlot said i dont see anything there but thats oh raym was pointing to a fungus jungle a maze of thick white threads and the orange light glinted off something reflective inside the mass in fact was mostly pond but it was laced with fungus clave used the bellows the pipefire that had been es tivating in the windless murk now blazed up carlot blew the last of their water into the pipe while rather and clave tilted the rocket the fungus jungle drifted across the orange light log bearer impacted softly against resilient fungus fingers and recoiled what kind of pump you got good boy rather you want to pump you pump raym carlot said debby you go with him keep your harpoon handy stet thats good thinking carlot no guessing whats larry niven the smoke ring lurking in there the imaginary horrors didnt diminish rayms enthusiasm as he flapped away with the pump the hose slowed him debby kissed rathers cheek be fore she picked up a loop of hose and flew after him raym disappeared among interlocked white strands that broke where he touched them clave said now rather they entered the cabin together the bags of seeds nearly filled one compartment rather pulled them out reached further and had the silver suit debby saw only kicking wings among fingerthick white pillars of fungus nothing dangerous yet raym called cheerfully watch for stinkbirds great state girl get me a bag a big one debby dropped the hose and worked her way in what fringe oh here shed taken to carrying the big bags theyd used to collect honey while logging she passed one in she couldnt see what raym was doing in there but the air had turned dusty she sneezed raym wriggled out in a cloud of dust motes there was something shapeless in the bag sixty seventy chits worth he said ill just take this back ive linked up the hose what have you got carlot had come at his shout raym showed her the bag dammit raym thats sporing fringe debby get away from it yeah debby kicked out into the air she was feeling dreamy lightheaded happy but if shed breathed spores raym must have breathed more keep him away from the ship debby pulled on the hose until she had the pump raym take this around to someplace else and start pumping ill take this back carlot said raym you shouldnt get near sporing fringe sure its worth money she gave up raym was laughing clave had stuck the helmet to a wall with a dab of glue it watched him in stoic calm try to do the circle in one sweep it said is that how the original was done first painting was probably a template but templates wear out the suits must be painted over and over every so often the junior guardian has to paint it im guessing of course but the original looks a little sloppy in kendys pictures clave pointed the brush like a pencil and moved in a single graceful sweep the resulting greenishwhite circle wasnt half bad bring it close said the helmet too narrow and also a little small go around again and add some bulk to the outer rim rather when you leave drape a cloth over yourself we dont want to get it dirty while its wet stet clave now the dot in the middle stet leave it tiny give me another look at the shoulder raym found you something silver man clave jumped what carlot dont do that rather take it its sporing fringe bring it back if you can its worth money rather took the bag whats it for if youre in trouble throw it everyone around you will have a wonderful time while you get away make sure you dont breathe it oh thanks sure im ready to go there was something more that he ought to say some thing she expected but he couldnt for the life of him think what it was you get tired ill take over debby said no no the tank must be nearly full by now sweat larry niven slicked raym wherever his skin showed he was grinning and panting and pumping his legs with the vigor of a much younger man the tank must be full already debby thought they wouldnt let raym stop until raym stopped what was thatt debby turned to where he was looking i dont see anything tiny twin flames burned in the dark receding huh raym resumed pedaling hope that isnt the fire getting closer you never know where its gonna be it doesnt just drift like everything else it spreads in spots and goes out in spots carlot called from the rocket raym enough lets go find our mudball chapter twenty the library

colonization must be investigated and re ported immediately ling carther for the state matter was too thick in here to use boot jets rather used them to get clear of rayms sight then donned his wings he wanted to fly straight north along the axis of clump and smoke ring both matter should thin out rapidly in that direction there were no ponds but sometimes you could catch a glint of light from one of the fuzzyedged fungus jungles there were white pillow shapes and flat white lenses streaked with yellow and crimson and networks of in terwoven pale stalks he took care to avoid touching any thing he flew around clouds of dust or spores the paint on him would still be wet rather began to understand the beauty raym found in the dark straight lines rare in a tree were unheard of here save for long beams of bluewhite or yellowwhite sun light breaking through the murk where he saw these he corrected his course to cross them this close to cross year north would be at right angles to voy and the sun after what felt like a couple of days he was seeing many more the dark had grown rarified now there was room for jets he fired a burst of five breaths duration mist flowed past him as he coasted out of the dark the day brightened too bright his eyes were slow to adjust jeffer the scientist calling rather can you hear me yet jeffers voice was scratchy rather turned up the vol the smoke ring ume reception isnt good but im hearing you im nearly out moving north coasting the rest of us are in good shape how long till we get kendy a quarter day to spare rather did you bring wings yes good you cant approach headquarters on jets i didnt think of it i did i have you located make your burn now youre well north of the smoke ring the airs thin it wont slow you much but in less than a half day youll be back in the plane i know north and south bring you back so how long a bum what direction im well and truly lost ill time you three minutes about sixty breaths can you see voy the market is ten degrees west of out from you and you have to cross four hundred klomters you didnt actually get very far into the dark by now hed fallen into clear air with the dark spread out below rather wriggled to point his feet ten degrees east of voy he would move nearly at a tangent to the flow patterns in the dark he lit the jets his body tried to sag into his boots the dark skimmed below him a storm with granulations in it and sudden red and golden and purple glows where the sun shifted just right jeffer counted aloud and told him when to fall free flying the dark was thinning out but coming closer too he skimmed through the fringes of a raineloud kendy for the state said the familiar deep voice rather are you on schedule no problems expeditions in good shape raym will probably swear i was there the whole time repeat after me theres a respectable store of metal here theres a respectable larry niven try to say it like i did listen a few times theres a respectable store of metal here rather deepened his voice and tried to spit the sylla bles theres a respectable store of metal here they rehearsed you wouldnt want to have to sell your new house and i need to consult the library and i relieve you rather was lethally sick of it when kendy quit itll have to do try to be in a cloud when you sight headquarters dont make your approach with out me right ive displayed a neudar map of headquarters for jef fer he can guide you if im out of range back in two days kendy out jeffer here rather you should try to sleep sleep nothing natural can hurt you in the silver suit sure sleep youll be less hungry youve got no food ill give it a try he slept not a wink the turning of the clump spiral caught him up and he had to make a correcting burn houses and decorated puff jungles passed none close enough to see more than a passing pressure suit citizens would wonder what the navy was doing out here within a layer of haze he found the unmistakable shape of the market headquarters to spinward jeffer i have it how close forty klomters get a lot closer approach from the market side if you can rather it just struck me there are two ways into the library and they have to guard both so i dont think it was ever meant to be guarded the library was supposed to be free to all just a guess whats the word from kendy the smoke ring any breath now ill come in through that cloud bank you see it i think theres a pond in there ill come around that kendy for the state rather are you in place the boy sounded edgy ready you missed some in teresting stuff headquarters was four hundred meters distant theyd lose a few minutes crossing that kendy sent something i should know no just interesting i watched two triune families arrange a marriage if your helmet faced it i didnt miss it time to move just wings kendy watched the guards as rather approached would they expect him to have an escort they spread arms and legs as he came near with a hand and foot to hold the harpoon that position had been attention for any military man in freefall since long before kendys birth the door behind them was large and massive and closed just go in unless they do something kendy said ive watched them every orbit you wont need a pass word because your helmets closed dont hurry let them open the door for you checklist communications systems nominal drive warming course correction ready kendy didnt intend to bum fuel until everything else had gone right the guards waited until they could read rathers in signia one rapped the door with his spear butt it slid open in time to let rather pass left theres a hall then another door kendy no ticed pads of cottonylooking vegetation on the far wall pause wings off then clean your suit youll be ex pected to pat dont rub remember the paint rather patted muddy rainwater off his suit kendy larry niven wished he could see the result there were paint smears on the pad the boy moved down the corridor the inner door had one guard he starfished the way the others had captainguardian youre early sir i want to consult the library but thats yessir the man didnt move kendy sent youre still carrying your wings tether them to your chest plate the guard must expect that and it would give kendy time to think no hurry aris tocrats dont hurry shin sticks toward your chin to door no hinges visible it would swing in what was protocol here have to guess open it yourself rather how paired handles on door and wall grip both push the door inward no pause as rather finished tethering his wings the guard fin ished pushing the door open and moved aside in said kendy rather entered he turned at the sound of the door closing there was no handle on the inside though a sear showed that one had been removed the light source was electric would that bother rather no he was used to electric lights in the carm a man in a pressure suit waited he held a crossbow the bow and quarrel were both hullmetal lengths of stiff carm wiring with superconducting cores so this was how they used their heritage the guardians voice had to echo through helmet and faceplate he sounded tinny as rather would kendy had counted on that and surprised captainguardian i know im early i relieve you i need to use the library rather was slow i know im early thats all right captainguardian i need to use the library i relieve you yes sir for what purpose sir im required to ask the smoke ring while kendy mulled possible answers rather had started to speak kendy listened rather said we want to locate an integral tree west of here i want its probable orbit no way to read the silver mans face the guardian said yes sir and rapped on the door it opened for him and closed after him alone at last rather said the room was much bigger than the machinery it housed the carm control system had been remounted in a wooden cradle there were wooden handles on its four sides hadnt booce serjent said that it was some times displayed to the citizens cradled against an adjacent wall was a small portable fusion generator the librarys light source was a panel running around its rim the power cable was coiled against its side rather do you see a coil of line thick as your wrist black got it rather moved toward the generator the free end has to go into a hole in the carm con trols at the near end near the wall there are a lot of holes ill guide you they played cold and warm with the end of the plug it was taking too long the power plant might be dead the computer might be dead the programs might be scrambled there would be no second chance rather citizen was probably trapped behind locked doors with wayne mickl already on his way once kendy had es tablished contact with the admiralty he might be able to buy rather loose the boy was doing his best after all fumbling but doing his best just push it in hard and turn it counterclockwise stet face the controls tap the white key a white cursor appeared say prikazyvat voice prikazyvat voice larry niven the smoke ring state your authority said a voice so like kendys that rather squeaked in surprise say rather citizen for discipline open contact watch your accent with another part of his attention he began beaming his signal to the old carm computer voice was activated the computer would hear kendyfor the state discipline to all carms kendyfor the state the computer must be trying to answer it wouldnt be able to find discipline with its navigational instruments severed he sent beam to pressure suit something just started humming in my head everythings fine rather the signal was being re layed he sent status carm sent its tale of woe massive malfunctions internal sensors out external sensors out motors not re sponding life support systems not responding naviga tional systems not responding power low records intact presiding officer admiral robar henling kendy sent copy all y the admiralty library accepted the copy program hummed thoughtfully and began beaming its records that would take twentysix minutes kendy activated the course change hed worked out hours ago discipline was about to use a good deal of fuel it would hold him over the lagrange point for long enough the records arrived in reverse order common prac tice recent records were likely to be more urgent kendy dipped into the flow the control board had seen little while housed in the library room there were glimpses of the sky during ceremonies records of births deaths marriages it had been dismounted in year sm the carm hadnt crashed it had deteriorated over the years helped by deteriorating maintenance he couldnt spare attention with so much else going on the drive ran smoothly tank less than a fifth full discipline accelerated drive swinging out to point at the stars to hold the ship close above the l point against its own spin rather was exploring the room his pulse and breath rate were rapid he was bored and anxious jeffer crouched above carm s control board was in similar shape the neudar view of admiralty head quarters showed fogspots clumping then moving in two streams toward the library something was happening little lights brightened and dimmed on the carm control panel his helmet hummed it wasnt particularly entertaining rather said kendy its working rather dont bother me jeffer here kendys busy and happy youve got more than two hours about half a day before mickls on duty nobody should bother you im hungry enough to eat a swordbird and may the best entity win did everything go all right im scared jeffer i may never get over being scared why on earth are we doing the door opened rather saw a silver suit pointing a crossbow a few de grees wide of his navel the insignia was familiar he and booce had spent half a day painting it on the silver suit from pictures taken by the silver suits camera the door rathers radio spoke in his helmet i know who you are said the voice hed been trying to imitate what i want to know is why lets rather leapt straight at wayne mickl and fired a burst from his jets for extra force he couldnt let the door close the silver man swung his crossbow aside and braced larry niven the smoke ring to kick too slowly hed expected the jump but not the jets rather slammed into him mickl bounced away rather struck the jamb and spinning was through the door and out into a horde of navy crew i know who you are wayne mickls voice pres sure suit radio frequency badly distorted by time and kendy locked on it he beamed instructions to the li brary record the view through pressure suit cameras one snap per ten minutes henceforth it was a nice bonus he welcomed it because he was about to lose rather citizen a dozen navy crew in the fisheye view unknown numbers out of camera range jeffer bellowed rather whats going on wayne mickl came back cant talk kendy sent get outside if you can rather mickls jets arent fueled ive got the whole treefeeding navy here they were hesitating but they wouldnt for long theyll swarm all over me like honey hornets hey rathers hands came in view holding a bag ripped it open and flung it the corridor became vague and golden wayne mickl could pull the cable was he still in the library carm had a hundred years of records to go a solid block of data was running now data that must have been beamed long ago by discipline itself kendy knew he wouldnt want to read that in full not if it was records of the mutiny hed spotcheck the other pressure suit emerged from the library and jumped to join the fight good rathers camera view shot down the corridor through dust and bodies navy crew grabbed at him clung and let go it began to look as if he might make it what was running through disciplines receivers was a message from the state from earth nothing in bis own memory matched kendy pulled it and ran it it was brief rather jumped down the corridor arms raised to block the men who blocked his path impacts slowed him a burst from the jets compensated somebody was riding him legs around his hips a man impacted heavily against his helmet slid across his chest and was gone the silver man jumped him the man who clung to rather took the force of impact they tumbled rather reached the door kicked swung himself around the jamb and was out in the sky a burst of jets took him clear he paused then the silver man emerged and twenty meters away and receding stopped to put on his wings navy crew emerged behind him two flailed they had no wings at all the third couldnt get his on fringe spores must have reached their brains that left only the silver man rather grinned he put on his own wings and kicked away strongly kendy jeffer are you watching jeffer here i cant get kendy he may be out of range well watch this is going to be good mickl was catching up rathers radio sounded calm and a bit supercilious rather citizen you cant escape your wings are the right color but theyre not navy wings you know i dont want to hurt you i had the chance to kill you and i didnt but the crossbow is all i have and it will penetrate make holes in a navy pressure suit theres a hole in one of our suits because one of our guardians turned mutineer once dont answer jeffer saidhes guessing dont give him a chance to test it mickl was meters behind him but the drugged navy crew were nearly out of sight rather pulled his wings loose pointed his feet at the silver man and fired his jets he was headdown to the dark mickl was kicking larry niven hard falling rapidly behind a scream of shock or frus tration burst in rathers ears he found the volume control and turned it down fast the dark was around him he couldnt see the other silver man he couldnt see the market jeffer spoke in his helmet a tiny squeak until rather turned the volume back up due to rendezvous ive got a ship moving north out of the dark stand by theres a dark blob bigger than the cabin thats logbearer theyve got their mud turn seventy degrees clockwise from where you were pointed and oh ten degrees north make your bum rather obeyed jeffer counted off twenty seconds seven breaths the dark thinned weve got to get rid of the silver suit jeffer said no im the silver man i dont mean feed it to the tree i mean dont have it when logbearer gets home how i dont know and kendy isnt answering i dont even know what course hes on now what if i dont go back you can pick me up with the carm sure and what does wayne mickl say to the ser jents youve got to face him and lie rather could see the market far behind him was he in view of navy instruments but theyd have to find him and hed changed direction the deep voice of wayne mickl was small and full of the chattering sound of distance rather citizen i will wait for you at serjent house i heard that jeffer said ive spotted you can you see voy sixtyfive degrees east bum for five seconds zero north theres no point in getting higher youll both be back in the dark before you meet the smoke ring jeffer why dont you come get the silver suit stet here i come rather himself had spotted logbearer now above the plane of the dark foreshortened and trailing steam jeffer said im on my way but itll take me nearly a day if you just ditch the suit itll fall back into the dark its doing that now youll have to find it somehow ive got an idea rather flew through the dark he was using wings there couldnt be much left of his fuel he glimpsed a manshape through the murk carlot when he opened his helmet she kissed him breathlessly i thought id never see you again did you do it yeah all of it but the captainguardian knows or thinks he does she talked while she helped him out of the suit raym got too much of the fringe hes in the cabin getting through the hangover debbys with him shell keep him quiet weve got our mud and four tons of walnutcush ion two dark sharks tried to open us up debby took them rather id hate to have her mad at me weve got the meat and ill show you tooth scars on the wood i hope they were big im hungry he was out he closed up the suit leaving the helmet open jeffer here im above your position im doing it he closed the helmet he turned the pressure dial high and the temperature low the suit grew rigid now i want to start a fire in the dark that wont be easy help me that fisher jungle i guess it was he indicated a mass of dry brush with white things taking root in it help me push the legs in they pushed the suit into the decaying fisher jungle the branches still had some strength rather got a good larry niven grip then closed a jet key with his toe flame blasted through the rotting fisher jungle the suit tried to escape he let the jet run for several breaths before he turned it off jeffer should find that okay he said he was guess ing and he knew it then tell me what happened he told her some of it while they searched out log bearer the rest would wait clave and debby would have to wait to hear the tale since raym could not be allowed to and rather would have his chance to eat and sleep he was exhausted chapter twentyone the silver suit from the library cassettes year sm citizens may never enter the library room citizens will be given access to the library only through

will cer tainly be unanswerable they stopped twice once at the market to let raym off with half his pay in hand and once at a pond to refuel belmys log was very slowly turning endforend a thread of steam poured from above the tuft as cariot larry niven made her final bum to bring logbearer to rest near the midpoint woodsman cast loose and moved toward them serjent house was just visible to antispinward west rather tried not to think about the dot visible alongside it he welcomed the delay debby said id like to get this over with clave shook her by the ankle wrong we went into the dark for mud and were back to get rid of it we dont know of anything urgent were in no hurry at all carlot shouted from where she and rather worked the rocket stet treefodder they always make us wait they had it all figured out but copter plants were launching their seeds in rathers belly woodsman eased alongside hilar and raffbelmy flew toward logbearer youll like raff carlot whispered ac like you like raff its all right id make babies with him if itd make you happy or get me away from the navy hilar introduced his son treefodder but they were big raff smiled much and said little he was shy for an adult rather thought he stared at the tree dwellers but his eyes seemed to slide aside from rathers the teapot passed carlot asked how are you doing with the log hilar shrugged no burl yet the others laughed give it time we have some spin i dont think we want to overdo it weve splashed a pond against the trunk that gives us a water flow how are you planning to de liver the mud i hadnt thought past just bringing it here raff and i talked it over raff spoke dad always says keep it simple well just impact it against the tree lee side two three klomters above the tuft theres already water running down to the treemouth let it carry the mud too easy steady delivery system the smoke ring he can talk when its about something real rather thought have you done a lot of logging raffs head bobbed i spend more than half my life in the outer sky sometimes i wondered what living in a tree would be like they were getting used to that question clave said i miss it myself well you grow up shorter and stronger cookings easier huntings different the wind throws the prey at you rather tuned it out the dot next to serjent house must be a navy ship he felt their longsight devices on him what the navy saw must look puzzling let them wonder he had an explanation both interesting and innocent his attention snapped back when hilar said booce has been making deals i expect hell pay back the loan well before crossyear carlot asked has the navy bought the metal yet no in fact somethings upsetting the navy i hav ent heard a rumor i can believe but stay alert car lot you know youve got visitors we can see them hilar raff its time to deliver our cargo it took a day and a fraction and was entirely straight forward logbearer burned toward the turning tree her crew dismounted the spokes that braced the web that sup ported the mud mud and lines and wooden spokes smacked the trunk hard enough to stick water flow was already carving a runnel in the mud as logbearer accel erated away theyd be back to collect the beams and lines after they were washed clean gyrfalcon was not moored it floated free a hundred meters from serjent house two men working on the hull did not return claves cheerful wave rather recognized one as petty wheeler they watched fixedly while log larry niven the smoke ring bearers crew swarmed out and set about the business of mooring their ship rather looked around the common room while they tethered their wings one fast look and then hed have to react no teapot not a social occasion booce serjent looked angry and unhappy bosun sectry murphy started to jump toward rather then pulled herself back three long limbed navy men were stationed around the walls and a fourth silver suit helmet thrown back bearded dwarf face within wayne mickl rather let himself break into a delighted grin it was surprisingly easy he wanted to reassure sectry he was glad to see her he let his eyes flick from sectry to wayne mickl to sectry again he blurted am i in sectry flashed from unhappy to angry wayne mickl broke into delighted laughter very good but rather there just arent enough dwarves to make it work take him two of the navy crew were on him they pulled him loose from his handhold set him spinning in the air he caught glimpses of them rebounding from walls then one had wrapped his arms and legs around rathers lower ribs from behind and the other had a foot in rathers crotch and rathers two ankles in his hands stretching his legs straight there was a wrestling trick jill had shown him in the brief period when she was stronger than he was you wrapped your arms or legs around your opponents short ribs and tightened them your opponent couldnt inhale presently he would faint rather had used it on others afterward and been pun ished for it most of the children were smaller than he was jilly wasnt but she didnt have the strength of a dwarf after they beth got older rather had been taught not to fight he still got angry sometimes but he learned to control it sometimes he wrestled with adults he gen erally lost the man behind him was letting him breathe but shallowly the other wasnt kicking rathers seeds into his belly but he could rather held the red rage in check booce booce answered the implied question you tell me where have you beent the dark weve delivered hilars mud weve got some walnutcushion and the navy went through this house like a whirl wind i told them about the sporing fringe in the con crete i was about to show them a hiding place i made in the door i think theyd rather chop my house apart and i get the distinct impression that its all your fault shut it booce mickl said rather what did you think you were coming home to anger made his thoughts murky but hed rehearsed this part in his mind i thought i saw sectry and i saw you i thought the captainguardian had come per sonally to tell me i was in the navy you know but you must know that an officer wouldnt care that much about a new inductee well youre here and someone told me youre very eager to put another dwarf in the guardian slot what me you doing here captainguardian its a mistake sectry burst out mickl didnt shout he projected his voice over hers the walls shivered to it let me tell you something about mistakes theres no allow me rather reached for the foot in his crotch with both hands he had it before the leg could snap straight and he twisted his rib cage closed he stopped breathing and kept twisting the leg buckled navy was pulled close he loosed rathers ankle and larry niven rather kicked him twice under the jaw now his hands were free to pull the constricting arms apart and over his head and down torsion pulled the legs free too and he could breathe navy kicked at rather with his good leg rather caught it on his foot reaction separated them navy was headed toward a wall there was blood on his mouth rather pulled the others arms around behind him they came not easily and rather kept pulling until he had pulled navy ls shoulder from its socket clave had a rib lock on the third man rather pushed navy away the man turned in the air moaning his arm at a crooked angle navy had reached the wall he jumped they traded blows rather put his heel in the others midsec tion but a fist smacked solidly into the side of rathers neck short arms and legs had cost rather more than one match again the blows had thrown them apart rathers ears buzzed lights flared in his eyes he was too far from the walls he waited but navy was curled in a tight ball when a wall touched him he stayed there winded resting wayne mickl was pointing a crossbow at rather cut it ill shoot you someplace nonlethal you too jonthan stay there you the tree man let go ofdoheen clave released navy doheen was unconscious panting elated rather said stet but mistakes are something somebody pays for and thats what the word is for or am i going too fast for you yes pause a minute j what is it now the men in the doorway both looked surprised one was a navy crewman he had raym wilby in a rib lock captainguardian this one flew up like he was coming to the house then he saw the ship and turned around and flew away the petty and me chased him down who are you mickl demanded the smoke ring raym only gaped cariot said its raym wilby he guided us into the dark wilby what were you flying from i i just dont like nnavy stet jonthan wipe your face then take wilby into the storage room ask him about the trip be polite doheen blinked his eyes opened the man from the ship took charge of navy the man with the dislocated arm rather heard him yell as his shoulder popped into place jonthan wiped blood from his mouth with a cloth then took raym wilby by the elbow and towed him away rather noticed for the first time that sectry had a crossbow too it was pointed at clave mickl ignored it all now rather tell me about a pressure suit that looks like mine dont forget the cross bow rather was still panting a little he took a moment more than he needed pressure suit booce told me youve got three nine crew to use them but youre short of dwarves which ought to be a pun he thought but hed irritated micklenough without that a fourth pressure suit invaded headquarters fifteen days ago you were in it rather stared no i wasnt fifteen days i was in the dark getting mud is that what this is about rather its your bad luck that im interested in dwarves i know where every dwarf in the admiralty is right now there are twelve ten are in the navy one is eighteen years old hell be a petty soon sectry already is the rest are guardians theres a dark divers boy but his brain was thick with spores before he could grow a beard and theres you and another pressure suit yes i want it rather wiped sweat from his face he was thinking as carefully as if he were innocent the trick was not to know anything he shouldnt this seemed safe captain larry niven guardian if a pressure suit got into the admiralty without you knowing it maybe there was a dwarf in it mickl didnt answer rather said s the bosun and i are about the same size but i think youre bigger how big was that fourth suit would i even fit he was stut tering a little he had to think every word through first how clearly had mickl seen the silver suit it always looked bigger than the occupant maybe its smaller yet maybe its so small that itll fit in places you wouldnt look a closet in a happyfeet ship why that happyfeet tried to rob us before we got here they dont care much about laws isnt there a lupoff ship in dock true enough but a closet is silly hed suffocate somewhere else then theres air in the silver suit am i supposed to know that what else am i not supposed to know what really happened what is it you think i did you entered headquarters in an unregistered pres sure suit painted like mine you got into the library you got rid of the guardian we havent been able to find out what you did there or whether you got what you wanted but voice was running when you left when i came in you scattered sporing fringe throughout headquarters and got away mickls throat worked and rather saw how close he was to uncontrolled rage i went after you i couldnt catch you um that doesnt make sense booce told me never to try to outfly navy the wings are different mickl slashed the air with his arm the suit outflow me this isnt just another pressure suit youd be in enough trouble if it was only that weve got to have this suit its special how classified you little fungus wayne mickl closed the smoke ring his eyes he pulled air in through his nose until his lungs were full then let it all out calmly he said booce show me this hiding place booce showed him we wouldnt have been told this either rather thought secrets mickl closed his helmet when he peered into the com partment light blazed from the forehead he studied the interior at length ingenious maybe not it weakened the door booce pointed out the hole mickl nodded jonthan was back a long bruise was forming on his jaw his glance at rather seemed disinterested he and the dwarf officer conferred in low voices they disap peared toward the storage room that left only navy doheen he and clave were holding a staring contest clave smiling the other poker faced booce said carefully rather theres something you should know youre trying to tell the captainguardian that youre probably innocent its not enough rather had thought things were going well raym was with us hed have to believe raym was lying too raym doesnt have the brains no of course not mickl believes you now a quick glance at doheen who reacted with something like a shrug but just in case hes wrong hell stop logbearer from ever leaving the admiralty because we might be smuggling that fourth suit hell ruin me financially in case i might say something to save myself hell hound you itll never be over then whatll i do there cant be a way to convince mickl im innocent im guilty admiralty pressure suits dont have working jets no fuel theres a suit with jets somewhere and mickl wants it hell never settle for less give him the silver suit hed know were guilty then if i could ah he had something larry niven cant ask booce doheens listening and booce doesnt know what happened anyway the others fate and air currents had put rather near sectry he moved closer she moved the crossbow aside for him her face was hard to read i shouldnt have left he said why didnt you wait they tell me the navy takes forever to do anything i couldnt just hang around twitching and we needed the mud their voices had dropped she said i was here i turned down a flight but i cant do that twice running you left me for mudt it was a miserable thing to have to admit but it was better than the truth he nodded rather nobody makes decisions when hes on fringe so tell me am i too strange am i too old my mothers older than my father i like strange im in the clump because i like strange sectry i dont regret anything i said or did which was not quite the truth secrets hilar belmy is trying to grow a burl tree she said that never works well hes trying something new booce bought a piece of the tree and he owes us so its not just mud its money all right rather i can understand money thats more than i do its power but it doesnt make you an officer are there unrich officers her lips twitched they marry rich citizens their children are officers the number of officers goes up one day well all be officers why does wayne mickl want that suit so much id think it would be the other way around its bad for the admiralty if happyfeet hold old sci ence i think waynes almost given up on taking his cap tains seat the pressure suit is as much power as hell ever have and he takes his responsibilities the smoke ring they were back wayne mickl and raym wilby and jonthan raym was unwontedly quiet mickl said and what were you discussing with the bosun sectry was flustered rather answered first i was suggesting that if you did have a fourth pressure suit youd need twelve dwarves to man them sectry tried to cover her laugh with her hands booce laughed outright doheens mouth was rigidly straight mickl was about to explode and rather had learned little from sectry but it might be enough go for gold before mickl could speak he asked does it fly better than your suits mickls face didnt change yes how did you know that you said it outflew you besides i heard something once youll tell me privately if you dont mind captainguardian they took the kitchen mickl said that fringeaddled dark diver makes you a poor witness i dont know anything about your chairmans court youll see a court soon enough talk to me boy i dont know anything about your mutineer pressure suit either then i once heard that theres a way to make little holes on a pressure suit spray fire then it can fly without wings go on maybe i can find a man who can do it he doesnt have a pressure suit so hes never tried it take me to him they dont deal with navy they dont even come into the admiralty rather visualized a mysterious hap larry niven pyfeet tribe isolated and distrustful they sent copsiks once the scientists dont come themselves give me a name he picked one he could remember seekers theres no such tribe rather shrugged well what are we doing here rather what happens is you give me your pressure suit mickl laughed i take it somewhere payment not money the seekers might not use money i take fringe too maybe twenty kilos i take tools i bring the suit back they keep the fringe and the tools maybe the jets work and maybe they dont let me tell you why i cantgive you my pressure suit mickl said gently first it belongs to the ad miralty second it alternates among three guardians my triad would notice third turning a pressure suit over to savages would certainly be judged as mutiny especially since fourth you might not bring it back stet not stet let me think while youre thinking this mysterious tribe did they ever have a pressure suit to practice on they say they did could they have got it working again this was taking rather into empty sky treefodder maybe it was lost or stolen or talk to me i was trying to remember they threw it away what it killed three citizens how the silver was only for one who was worthy one day the old dwarf died while he was using it three dwarves wrestled for it that sounds like too many dwarves rather the smoke ring it did i saw two myself and i never got inside the jungle i guess seekers get more dwarves goon the winner put the suit on and died the one who lost to him put it on and died the last one was a woman she started to get into it but while the rather patted his skull this part was still open she said she heard the voice of kendy the checker nobody else could hear it they got scared and dumped it and moved to another part of the sky sounds like the air feed went bad what then thats when they found the admiralty they say one of your ships tried to rob them nonsense we say treefodder they say you did it might have happened in the past navy robbing savages wayne mickl was looking disgusted he said its possible a ship low on provisions this isnt helping wait you three who trade your suit off are you always on duty at headquarters no of course not why rather took a deep breath your fourth point of course well bring the suit back not all of us will go youll keep friends of mine to answer for it if the suit doesnt come back your third point maybe its mutiny if you lose your chance at a pressure suit that can fly without wings es pecially if it belongs to the admiralty which was my first point and especially if you could get three so lets work on your second point can you get the admiraltys per mission admiral robar henling would rather give up his seeds at his age it wouldnt no just no he was getting somewhere he had mickls attention think will your uh triad try to track down that flying pressure suit we will we are larry niven you can go anywhere if you think its the right di rection stet youre guardians one of you is an officer nobody ask am i completely off the track not yet so off you go tracking rumors of a fourth pressure suit maybe you find it you close in but theres a dwarf in it and he sees you coming and flies away laughing what he doesnt know is that your triad was working with out a pressure suit for a while then it came back now off goes the bandit dwarf but hes doomed because your suit flies too and he doesnt know it mickls grin was not quite a pleasant sight were you a teller where you came from rather knew exactly what he meant our teller was merril till she died these days everyone does some tell ing captainguardian im trying to help ill bring the suit back whether it works or not but would your seekers give it back mickl sighed i dont blame you for attacking my men and i wont charge you well leave it at that for the moment this isnt finished rather the civilians watched the navy people fly toward their rocket sectry was trailing and when he saw her look back rather snatched his wings from the door and jumped after her she stayed in the air while he strapped his wings on a voice spoke from the navy ships cabin she answered then she kicked away to avoid the rockets exhaust she did not fly back toward serjent house the navy rocket departed rather reached her he didnt have breath to speak she said youre involved in something he shrugged helplessly i dont know whats going on but i dont want any part of it ive decided i dont want to live in a tree either the smoke ring rather had his breath back he said were the right size she shook her head violently teardrops flew didnt wayne tell you how many dwarves there are in the ad miralty rather it was a good offer nobody makes real decisions when shes on fringe im sorry so am i his tongue was in knots and his thoughts were scrambled the scientist and the checker they caused this they sent me into headquarters would it be different if they hadnt did i mean it that offer how will carlotfeel about this or jill i do want to see you again after this is over if its ever over youll be going back to the tree wont you you wont like it here not with the captainguardian on your tail she didnt wait for his answer well sooner or later therell be a mission to citizens tree and ill be on it i hope this is all cleared up by then she flapped spinward toward headquarters or the market he called after her we have a rocket no thanks ill go on foot she kept kicking rather turned back to serjent house he was going to have to do some fast talking again the smoke ring chapter twentytwo loop where had it all gone wrong a message may become garbled across fiftytwo lightyears of distance and inter stellar dust but this was simple unambiguous and re peated from the carm cassettes recorded year sm day to discipline year state retrieve your crew and continue your mission fank shibano for the state as if he were a wayward computer in need of re programming arrival date feb state recorded by carm sixtyone earth days later hed accomplished his mission why this he had attempted to follow his new orders of eight carms he had sent into the smoke ring he located three the rest must have been destroyed or worn out or their sending systems turned off from carm he had learned of the death of claire dalton claire had died at one hundred and thirtyeight less than two months before the message arrived no other survivors were known to the carms many death dates had been recorded amazing that claire had lived so long there had been a mutiny kendy had stored it in carm s computer before he erased it from his own memory sharis davis kendy had mutinied against his crew fool not to have seen that their descendants used mutineer as an insult hed made an irretrievable mistake but how his rea soning was straight his orders were unambiguous werent they you will visit each of these stars in turn other targets may be added the state expects to settle these worlds spreading hu manity among variable environments against dangers that might affect only sol system the human species is not invulnera ble there is finite risk that the crew of any in terstellar spacecraft may find on its return that it has become the entire human race your crew and their genes are your primary cargo classified your tertiary mission is to explore ling carther for the state how could it be clearer kendy knew how the dinosaurs had died the state had explored the ringed black giant planet that periodi cally hurled flurries of comets into the solar system the state could stop comets now the solar system was larry niven tamed ten planets were better than one cities and in dustrial sites on thirty moons and hundreds of asteroids were better than none but the lesson of the dinosaurs remained planets are fragile earthlike worlds had been found in the habitable zones of nearby stars green life had emerged on two at dis ciplines departure they were in the process of final terraforming on twentysix worlds poisonous air resem bling earths primordial reducing atmosphere had been seeded with tailored algae in a thousand years some would be ready for further attention the seeder ramship program had been running since seven hundred years be fore kendys birth and discipline had found a habitable nonplanet humanity was to be spread as widely as possible the dangers here were not a planets dangers the smoke ring and its enveloping gas torus were dense enough to protect earthly life from radiation from the old neutron star and from other radiation too radiation sources were normal throughout the universe a super nova explosion near sol a passage of sol and its com panion stars through a region of starcreation a catastrophe in the galactic core events known and unknown could cause havoc through sol system and all nearby systems but none could harm the smoke ring his own message to earth sent in year state was long and detailed carm had the record sharls davis kendy had abandoned his crew as they explored the smoke ring three who remained aboard had been invited to take what they needed from discipline and join the others he had never given reasons his sec ondary mission was classified he had shut down systems aboard discipline in a pattern that forced them to the carms ah that explained something those three had not loved cats pure coincidence the smoke ring then the message from earth put it back the way it was how his crew was dead faced with conflicting orders he could not function at all he would be locked in a loop of reinforcing guilt kendy had sequestered all data relating to the mutiny and beamed it to carms and then erased it all from memory how had he gone wrong could the message itself have been garbled through repetitions to discipline year state retrieve your crew and continue your mission pank shibano for the state no explanations no elaborations hed been repro grammed like a wayward computer why hed accom plished his mission was the message genuine check the dates kendys own mission report sent state message from the state dated fiftytwo point two earth years later he was fiftytwo point one lightyears from earth this shibano had not lingered over his decision but it checked arrived fiftytwo point one years after that check odd why would the state expect any crew to remain alive that claire had survived was partly due to low gravity good conservative health habits her mind was that of an elderly corpsicle youth via the body of some bright healthy criminal and luck the rest must have been dead decades earlier and their descendants called him murderer and mutineer and damaged machine shibano for the state kendy found it difficult to con sider shibano as separate from the state but what could shibano have been thinking rescue after one hundred and four years it was insane larry niven perhaps the states medical resources had improved times change every generation of mankind has sought longer lives thousandyear lifespans might have become common speculative but times change goals change kendys route here had been circuitous the state that had given kendy his orders was four hundred and fiftyfive years old when he reached the smoke ring five hundred and seven when shibano spoke five hundred and fiftynine when his mes sage arrived kendy did not normally question orders conflicting orders could throw him into a loop but he had been round and round this loop while some voiceless subsystem sought desperately for a way out somewhere in a pattern of magnetic fields there was a change of state and kendy the man would have laughed a change of state yes sharls davis kendys state was a thousand years in the past dead somehow he must serve anyway his own goals had been spelled out in detail he would serve those humankind was to settle varied environments so be it what was his present situation the receding smoke ring covered forty degrees of sky his mind had been following a loop for just under two months hed missed the final stages of the explosion of levoys star the foray into the admiralty might have disintegrated by now to work disciplines drive had shut down without his attention good he still had fuel he started the drive warming his orbit was a comets highly eccentric equations ran through his mind fire a short burst at aphelion shed some velocity by aero braking by dipping into the gas torus around the smoke ring twice use goldblatts world as a gravity sling save a few cupfuls of deuterium that way glowing in direct sunlight the clump was greenand the smoke ring white chaos in logbearers steam trail clave felt good loose and free cruising through an uncluttered sky rather crawled out of the angular cabin his head was metal and glass the suits too big but i can wear the helmet clave smiled at the sight getting anything getting no jeffer hasnt called maybe he cant call this suit i tried kendy too too bad clave had been watching a distant brown ish smudge of vegetation now he shouted aft cariot could that be a fisher jungle be with you in twelve breaths cariot finished what she was doing to the motor and crawled to them over the cabin where claves toes jabbed east and out i dont see the root right thats what it is id better turn off the motor or well go past rather rather followed her aft clave stayed at the bow while they worked the motor presently the tide behind him went away closer now the fisher jungle looked dead enough brown foliage and bare branchlets tufts and patches of vivid green parasitical growths the fisher root was half extended like a dead mans hand with three scarlet fin gernails he looked for the carm and found a man flapping toward him jeffer pulled himself aboard panting moor to the root treefodder im glad to see you but what are you doing here is everyone here he looked over the edge of cabin and shouted hello cariot rather what is that a pressure suit helmet yes the rest of its inside they told it in tandem while they moored logbearer i never did quite know if the captainguardian be lieved me rather said but he left serjent house with out taking any copsiks the navy watched us for the next forty fifty days larry niven clave said we werent doing anything peculiar booce sold wood and hired people to cut it we bought more seeds and some tools and stuff were carrying all that mickl kept coming around interrupting us trying to get rather to tell him more about seekers i tried not to talk too much i built up a picture of these seekers in my mind and maybe i got it across secretive not very many of em too many scientists maybe half a dozen theyve got a cassette and reader but they dont show it to outsiders they threw away their silver suit but theyve got records on how to maintain it and they swear to kill anyone who tells their secrets the citizen who told me disappeared he was high on fringe and i was just a kid but i had a better memory than most kids that parts true anyway rather said i hav ent told mickl all of this dangerous jeffer said youll have mickl des perate to meet them not if i read him right scientist you know the story now and you can back me up give him details i didnt clave asked jeffer did kendy get the records he wanted i havent heard from him if were lucky the treefeeder never will call back anyway we must have looked innocent enough we never did anything odd because we didnt know anything so twenty days ago three dwarves pulled up to log bearer in a navy rocket mickl and another man and a woman all the same size weird they gave us the pres sure suit and went away were supposed to get the jets going and pay off the seekers would you like ten years supply of fringe no youd better leave it here if youre supposed to they carried the suit and helmet into the dead foliage rather and carlot set to moving their cargo while they looked about entropy and parasites had eaten a deep cavity into the the smoke ring fisher jungles dead trunk the carm was there and jeffers camp rocks for a fireplace a rack of poles for smoking meat a midden a decent distance away jeffer had made a third wing for himself a prudent move for a man alone from the blackened look of it hed been using it to fan his fire jeffer had the pressure suit splayed like a birds flayed skin rather did you try it its too big for me and the air feed doesnt work i got the panel open a little wheel isnt connecting to anything and theres a spoke with nothing on it jeffer grinned i see rather laughed mickl doesnt want the seekers stealing his silver suit if they try it theyll find out no bodys worthy ill refuel it no guarantee the jets still work well if they do work i get the impression that booce will get a decent offer for the wart mickl never actually said so three pressure suits clave said stet we may have to do this twice more and theyre searching dark and sky for a fourth pressure suit they must be looking hard at where logbearer went you may want to move the carm carlot arrived pushing the last of the cargo not seeds but tools youre going to love this scientist she sep arated something out jeffer took it with glad cries a pump wonderful the carms low on water and i hate the way i filled it last time can i keep it stet were supposed to bribe the seekers with it here this is a bellows from the market you anchor one end its easier nice can you stay for a couple of sleeps ive got food and lonely it showed in his face you know it larry niven weve got food you never tasted dark fungus and earthlife youll love it their exotic dinner was nothing unusual for rather not any longer what made it fun was watching jeffer react jeffer talked while he ate i had some trouble getting the silver suit i found it okay but it was right in the fire i had to get the bow up against it and push it out along with a kilton of burning goo i just wonder how many admiralty citizens saw me the stories wont match clave said in sixty days it wont matter at all ive been thinking well bum the fringe here if a navy ship comes theyll find that the seekers had a hell of a party and then went away good ill have to take the carm someplace you can find it no you find us logbearer will be returning to cit izens tree in due course maybe another thirty days keep watch pick us up well outside the clump another fifty days of this treefodder and i never even saw the treefeeding clump well leave you most of our food clave said carlot carefully wasnt looking at rather ill be bringing a guest raff belmy and ill be married as soon as we get back to the admiralty i want to bring him back to the tree what he tells his father is up to him but hell have at least a quarter year to think about it so you decided rather said he felt he had almost gotten used to the loss im like you im tired of secrets theres a plant here that grows good foliage jeffer offered dessert carlot tossed an orange sphere at him jeffers acting like a happy eightyearold rather the smoke ring thought as he tethered himself into a foliage patch for sleep being alone out here must be rough on him maybe all adults stay children someplace in their heads rather yuh carlot she wriggled under the lines and was alongside him rather opened his mouth and closed it again then he said i dont like lying to you what now i was going to not say what would raff think she didnt move away presently she said you dont understand us nope we like to spread the genes around nobody talks about it in public but you hear a man and a woman get engaged they make babies together sixty seventy days later they get married maybe the first kid looks like the rest and maybe he doesnt but why its the last chance see im going to marry raff but there are men i turned down theyre not going to just vanish i wasnt with raff off those sleeps i was away raffs been seeing friends too i dont know who rather its just different the officers say its good they talk about gene drift okay what raff thinks about it is hed rather not know i never did wonder what jill would think jill we never made promises sure but who else is there theres nobody any where near her age in the tuft just you i suppose i wish i could have told her i was leaving she said nothing rather couldnt drop it i wish i could tell her it was worth it you never wanted that raid on the library you were right if kendys really gone then why did it happen the navy never stop being suspicious ofusand we didnt learn anything and i cant larry niven even tell jill about the raid because i cant tell her about kendy she stirred you dont want me sure i want you every sleep were here i want you i wanted you for keeps you cant have that when we marry thats the end of that understand stet kendy had run the records from carms and over and over hed built up a sublibrary of sorts under resources local usage here citizens tree was firing mud to make a cookpot here firing the laundry vat both had been recorded by the silver suit as it moved unharmed through the fire one clip every ten minutes here curing the lines from the spaghetti jungle mark the silver man unharmed in the smoke here the elevator in citizens tree here recorded years earlier by klance the scientist the london tree elevator run with stationary bicycles here carm changing the integral trees orbit here logbearer moving another tree here rather collecting honey booces voice explain ing that it was usually done with handmade armor here a set of hornet armor made to show the navy customs collectors lest they seek for such and find the silver suit instead the natives used materials from discipline when they had it when they didnt they made do they were doing very well without kendy discipline was making its second aerobraking pass assbackward through the gas torus the cone of the fu sion drive approached fusion temperatures that was hardly a danger but the plasma streaming back along the hull had to be watched velocity smoke ring median kps velocity at the smoke ring kendys distance kps disciplines relative velocity kps and falling discipline reached perihelion and began to rise embedded in hot plasma the animals were fran tic kendy couldnt spare attention for them nothing had melted on his first pass but the gas ahead of him thickened as he rose because goldblatts world was ahead visual a raging endless storm the size of neptune neudar a core the size of two and a half earths spun once every seven hours carrying the storm around with it until the atmospheric envelope trailed off into the smoke ring instruments impacting plasma increased in temperature and density velocity decreased the ship was surviving thered been the risk that he would have to blow hydrogen ahead of him for cooling goldblatts world passed below warping the ships path into something nearer a circle now the plasma den sity dropped fast fifteen minutes of that was enough excitement for any computer program in an hour hed be over the admiralty and out of the gas torus hed make his last short bum then it would hold him near the admiralty for a good half hour discipline would be glowing bright enough to see if anyone looked in just the right direction that might or might not be good kendy had taken his time returning his longrange plans were in tatters and he didnt know what to do about it chapter twentythree beginnings from the citizens tree cassettes year day booce recorded our holdings before we left hes appalled that we never asked bad businespersons he calls us we dont usually bother to spell out who owns what in citizens tree it drives booce crazy we spent a lot on seeds and pood and wid gets but we still have credit imaginary money in some vague amount that depends on what booce actually gets for the wood and the metal welllearnthatwhen and if wereturn to the admiralty jeffer the scientist the lift cage dropped it was crowded with eight people and several bags from the carm lawri and the smoke ring gavving scientist and chairman pro tern seemed dis tinctly uncomfortable it wasnt hard to guess why raff belmy was uncomfortable too carlot clung tight to his arm possessively protectively i had some trouble finding the tree jeffer said your problem gawing answered after all you took the silver suit how were we supposed to tell you where we were yeah but you moved the tree didnt you that thing next to the lift is that what i think it is yes lawns doing mostly hah scientist i thought youd be twiddling your toes waiting for me to come home we found ways to occupy ourselves scientist la wns pregnancy was growing conspicuous the formality between her and her husband did not seem unfriendly gavving said i hope you brought something to make us look good the rest of them laughed but clave said trouble treefodder yes trouble id have flown to a new tree if id been sure theyd let me have wings one thing the children are on our side theyve been crazy with waiting to see what you bring back and minya stuck with me she did good said clave she did in public clave reached into a bag he sliced an apple in half and passed it to gavving and lawri they bit distrust fully and continued eating thatll do it gavving said fine here dont eat the hull hed cut an orange into quarters they gnawed the insides out of the oranges lawri chewed and swallowed a bit from the peel but did not take another gavving said yeah weve got seeds clave said this and a lot of other earthlife well plant them in the out tuft faces like afield of flowers below the falling cage two larry niven meteortrails of golden blond hair jill next to anthon she a meter shorter than her father both scanning the faces in the lift cage rather knew when tills eyes met his but her face didnt change the cage thumped into its housing children piled out of the treadmill and mark with them everyone in citi zens tree was here they looked short a field of dwarves in which anthon and the serjent women stood out as normal rather had become used to giants children and some adults crowded around the cage jill and anthon hung back not quite hostile but suspending judgment mark had that look too for all these hundreds of days rather had wondered what the tribe would think of his mutiny hed almost managed to forget that he had never told jill could not have told her that he was going to leave the tree his mothers were crowding close around the lift and karilly and ryllin with them the serjent women hugged carlot then carlots new husband karilly hung back a little she was conspicuously carrying a guest raff beamed like sunlight at seeing someone he knew they fell into rapid conversation moving away taking karilly with them damn but i missed oranges booce had to stay im not surprised but karilly was silent clave folded his wives into his arms and forced apples on them anthon slapped an orange from debbys hand rather heard you took this admiralty man aboard the carmt before his first mother picked him up to hug him you treefeeding fool minya whispered you fool mutineer you drillbits in your brains both of you you and your father he never stopped wishing hed gone too are you all right im in good shape mostly she pulled back to look into his face he tried to look earnest first mother im the smoke ring allergic to dry thin air not enough sleep does it too its like knives in the eyes i go blind it lasts for hours she started laughing she said im sorry im sorry and hugged him hard still laughing there were tears in her eyes she put him down and saw him smiling slyly she said itll never happen again well keep the tree where the airs thick youd better go talk to jill why whats wrong talk to her first then i think jeffer shouted for attention i here present raff belmy raff and carlot are married by admiralty law the record is in the cassettes over the heads of his brothers and sisters rather saw thejudginglook fade from jills face she moved forward at last rather said harry can you give me some pri vacy take them along harry said oh sure somehow he got his siblings moving away before jill reached him thejudginglook was back she said rather how are you fine nobody made me a copsik i didnt get killed jill i wanted to tell you were you afraid id run tell my father if i wasnt the rest of us would have been i couldnt jill he saw her reject that she asked what was it like ill be a lot of days telling you that and suddenly it was a pain in him that he couldnt tell her about the raid ever whats wrong now nothing he lied i was remembering how close i came to joining the admiralty navy i got out of it though jill dinner has to be something special is there time to cook some of this earthlife couple of days yet ill show you what to do take the kids too hed thought he wanted to be alone with jill but now he knew larry niven he didnt harry gorey bring those bags to the cook pot the admiralty slid west below him kendy began his bum then turned to his instruments neudar and the telescope array caught admiralty headquarters as it emerged from behind the dark the library didnt respond it must be turned off carm was nowhere in evidence no pressure suit responded to his query sharls davis kendy had made more than one mistake for half a thousand years he had been frantic to begin guiding his citizens in the smoke ring now he could begin and now he almost knew how opportunities would come a part of his attention scanned his growing file on re sources local usage debby described half hands kitchen for jeffers ben efit clave carried the helmet on a slow trip through serjent house the camera viewpoint spun erratically through a cloud of children children had knocked the helmet off its usual perch at the lift then played with it like a basketball kendy viewed the commons as a series of stills corridor openings the water trap the communal cooking area children laughing as they bounded in slow arcs a series of angular clump houses wildly various marks hut in various stages of construction the silver suit had been housed there for a time abruptly the carm control board came to life kendy sent his signal records came back stills of var ious bored guardians in their shared pressure suits cul minating in six junglegiant men in a half circle around the control board wearing anxious faces and spotless new uniforms these must be officers and now kendy had their insignia the smoke ring the signal disintegrated with distance he rounded forty degrees of smoke ring before he made contact with carm the vehicle was in its wooden dock at the midpoint of citizens tree it was empty of citizens and cargo that was logbearer next to the left cage and some smaller structure next to that kendy stared he enlarged the image and examined it in detail theyd built a steam rocket they didnt have a metal pipe or sikenwire so theyd used ceramics fired mud the laundry vat was part of it records the carm on its way home logbearer was strapped along the hull booce was missing rather was present the junglegiant stranger matched the still of hilar belmys son raff belmys medical readings originally ominous settled down over passing days carlot must have helped to calm him down rather was being abnormally polite to both and keeping his distance the two spent consider able time out of sight aboard logbearer records moving toward the citizens tree midpoint the ceramic rocket returned ahead of the carm it puffed toward the in tuft pushing a huge glob of black mud and passed out of range records year day jeffer speaking as sci entist carm and logbearer are both docked at citizens tree this will be my last log entry until kendy calls kendy for your information rather got out of head quarters safely we refueled the jets on an admiralty pres sure suit and returned it captainguardian mickl could have had the other suits refueled too but he never brought them now hes got a pressure suit with jets we gave him some time to play and then we told him what to do when they run out of fuel larry niven the smoke ring weve had no further trouble booce got a good offer on the metal the navy was carving it up when we left rather suggests that mickl wants the flying suit for himself its something even the admiral doesnt have hes got a secret now and we know it and hell need us to keep it flying that gives us a certain edge with the captainguardian if we ever want to exploit it we have some wealth and some influence in the ad miralty we got it without your help we do not appreciate your abandoning rather in the middle of the raid ive spent as much time waiting for your call as i care to ill be back from time to time if you havent called by the crossyear which is three hundred and ninetyone days from now i will turn voice off nobody was near the carm the lift wasnt running the carm drifted out of range kendy scanned the far arc of the smoke ring out of habit he had never seen signs of industrial activity there the admiralty flowed below him the library had been turned off again their ancestors hadnt listened to him either theyd turned off the voice subsystems theyd cut the fibers that allowed kendy to fly a carm by remote hed been com pletely cut off for half a thousand years as he was now rather was scrubbing his teeth and thinking about breakfast when the silver man came into the bach hut he spit and said mark who else mark threw back his helmet the silver suit was filthy and stank of smoke i tried that i felt silly sure silly mark i saw their teeth the older ad miralty citizens still have half their teeth i bet ryllin and mishael have been scrubbing their teeth all along rather remembered that this man wasnt his father and didnt know it and had a legitimate grievance all in a rush he said i stole it we thought we needed it and we did it was right to go treefodder mark youre from a bigger tree dont you feel cramped here fifteen years ive felt cramped relax you brought back some wonderful things you brought back the carm and the suit and you didnt ruin the suit you looked mad enough to kill when we came down that was three good dinners ago i never thought id taste potatoes again i know a better way to cook them you forgive me mark im really glad what are my choices sure i forgive you were firing the new laundry pot is it that late i slept like a rock needed it too these first few sleeps i just lay there wondering why one of the walls was pushing against me ive spent some sleepless nights here myself mark said its lonely in the bach hut we built it too big big enough for the next crop of men maybe thats it have you talked to jill minya asked me that weve talked why yeah well mark sometimes had trouble finding words citizens tree is strange none of us grew up the way you did there are adults and children and a big gap in between so you couldnt tell much from just watching older children grow up maybe there are things we should have said i know about sex if thats what you mean maybe i need to know more two women have told me to feed the tree it hurts what could you have told me about that mark whistled you started young well someone could have said theres only one suitable mate for you and theres only one for jill in this whole tuft and she thinks she owns you and maybe shes right rather let that percolate through his head jill wants larry niven to make babies with me did she tell you that or are you guessing im guessing all i know is when instant chairman gavving told us youd gone off with all the wealth of cit izens tree jill was madder than i was and that took some doing she wanted you thrown into the sky with no wings a hundred sleeps later she was sure youd all be killed and she couldnt see for crying ill go see her where is she go easy stet you know you can find other mates jill doesnt i dont either sectry wants no part of me he couldnt say why secrets and carlot married someone else you cant imagine how bad that was all the way home carlot and raff they spent most of their time in logbearer it wasnt any better when i couldnt see them mark said when nobody wants you in the first place thats worse trust me mark ive gotten very good at lying im trying to stop good go talk to jill where is she everybodys watching us fire the laundry vat except jill ive got to go back and see if anything needs doing try the miz hut then the commons the deep voice hailed him as he entered hello jeffer the scientist this is kendy shouldnt that have been kendy for the statel jeffe said uhhuh you missed all the excitement not all a large navy ship is moving toward your position theyll reach you in eighty standard days jeffer took a moment to absorb the shock he should have known it wasnt over it never would be there was no going back from the clump expedition no going back from knowing about the admiralty the smoke ring he pulled himself forward to the control board that gives us some time to talk the square hard face in the bow window had always lacked expression it said a bad thing happened to me jeffer i learned too much about myself there was no way i could communicate until now lie to me kendy say there was something wrong with voice kendy said the glitch was in myself i think i have it fixed machines go bad jeffer i left you a file under history its selected records from the settling of the smoke ring it explains some of what went wrong play it after im out of range can you tell me about it no your timing was lousy we thought youd left rather for treefodder if you ever i cant talk about it it hurts my mind damage might be permanent do you seek vengeance against me the trouble was that kendy looked and sounded as calm as death kendy never showed anger nor relief love pain it was hard to believe he was hurting yet he was not a man maybe maybe jeffer said well we got home i assume you got most of it from the log the earthlife food stopped most of the arguments now all the reunited couples are busy making babies the arguments havent gone away though theyre just simmering it wont help if theres a navy ship coming its coming i couldnt resolve details of design theres alcohol in the exhaust and its coming from the clump definitely navy what have you done with the seeds seeds well plant them in the out tuft marks talk ing about building an extension to the lift before anything gets ripe enough to pick cut some foliage so the sunlight can reach the plants larry niven the smoke ring i can show you how to use water flow to move the lifts with less effort you havent mentioned the fired mud rocket thats nice isnt it we dont need the admiraltys treefeeding pipes you dont need me kendy said he knew the risk he was taking it was acceptable ive been looking at records most of what can be done with materials from discipline can also be done with smoke ring resources lifts housing clothing food domestic animals now rockets the admiralty even has a heliograph no we dont need you jeffer said but i never thought youd know it a bad thing happened to me i dont trust my judg ment any more my intention has always been to make a civilization in the smoke ring modeled on the state that shaped your ancestors the smoke ring will never be that how can i make a state in a place where i cant even make maps would we even like your state skip it what do we do about that ship i hope sectry murphys aboard well get some notion of what they want if rather talks to her hide the carm in another tree tear out the dock too or put the ceramic rocket there show them that its not advanced but it doesnt need starstuff resources it may impress them keep the carm manned there are two ways you might need it i wont bum them one way then you cant ignore the admiralty youd really like to join as officers you may have to show them the carm before theyll listen to that demand of ficer status but they may settle for giving it to just the chairman and scientist jeffer laughed for a man who doesnt trust his own judgment you certainly i think fast i plan fast i make mistakes anything else mark might want to join the navy sound him out see if the navy personnel might want him i gather they dont like older recruits but mark was trained in london tree karilly may benefit from going back is she still mute yes but shes also pregnant and happy im not sure i want to fiddle im almost out of range back in two days the code is history tell nobody of what you are about to leam k unless in your judgment it would be beneficial kendy had never talked like this stet the face faded jeffer didnt move for some time fi nally he tapped the white button prikazyvat voice hello jeffer the scientist link to the pressure suit done this is jeffer calling anyone anyone home hello scientist it was jills voice i want to talk to my wife ill get her shes on the branch that would take most of a day jeffer started the his tory file and listened to it all the way through then he started it again lawri climbed in through the airlock i didnt have anyone but rather and jill for a treadmill team every body else is on the branch now whats all the excite ment scientist prikazyvat voice run history dead voices spoke disciplines crew reported the dis covery of a weird cosmological anomaly some of what followed was familiar from the cassettes some was en tirely cryptic larry niven how long have you had this lawri demanded kendy only just filed it i ive been in contact with him since before we left for the clump lawri was coldly angry that was mutiny how could you not trust met im trusting you now listen they heard a highly formalized quarrel some of the participants argued for settling the smoke ring some were for moving on to an unnamed destination kendy spoke in favor of staying then tried to terminate the ar gument it continued there were parts of a broadcast from discipline to earth it had been decided that they would settle the smoke ring environment there was a message from earth retrieve your crew and thats it kendy got conflicting orders jeffer said it tangles his mind he cant go for new orders because earth is too far away and he cant make up his own mind because hes a machine and he cant talk about it because it drives him nuts if thats all true he must be close to crazy all the time the question is what do we do now lawri said we can play it through the silver suit play it for the whole tribe tell everyone itll start some fights feed the he rode her down theres a navy ship coming the fightsu have to be over when it gets here a hundred days stet play it at dinner stet the situation was ideal in its way they were together but they couldnt talk there were only the two of them to run the lift it took all their breath jill scrambled over the smoke ring the rungs keeping up with him her tuftberryred tunic was dark with sweat at chest and armpits her hair was a golden halo as interesting and as beautiful as sectrys scarlet after the cages passed each other they let the treadmill carry them round and round then it was time to throw their weight on the brake the lower cage settled rather and jill dropped into soft foliage and panted rather found his breath and found jill watching him solemnly he said briskly mark says you own me this is a thought that never crossed my mind he says that yes he says i own you too what do you think i think mark doesnt have the right to say it he was an arms length away he couldnt read her expression he said its not just mark my parents all four or all three and a half and everyone else too including you jill you all seem to know just where i fit and what im supposed to do for the rest of my life well you dont take orders worth treefodder he was not sure that was a smile whats bothering you rather you came home on purpose youre on the cook pot because you volunteered to cook the earthlife youre the teller because youve got stories and you like telling them it gets you offtreemouth duty i like all of that but im told where to sleep and im told who to marry and everyone looked at me funny till i changed back into tuftberry red and the whole damn tribe sent me to talk to you okay talk rather doesnt take orders worth treefodder you talk are you unsatisfied with me you went into the sky and left me behind i did is that over now are you back for keeps larry niven the smoke ring no why not rather sighed i like coming home i like seeing new things too some of us will have to go back to the ad miralty anyway jill ryllin wants to join booce then theres a whole sky out there lawri says our gene pool is too little fine well go find some other trees and get mates there should i do that running endlessly up the treadmill hed had some time to think maybe or you could marry me but ill take trips and youd have to put up with that she flared youd be making babies with every woman who talks funny that was manifestly unfair rather let it pass or you could come with me stet that quick are you sure sure this was working out better than hed hoped did you work on that new rocket no why he hadnt thought it all the way through after all weve got time in a couple of years a dozen kids will be ready to find mates thats when well start visiting other trees i see it id have to know the rocket inside out how to steer it how to fix anything that goes wrong because im the oldest you and the rest of the crew too can you fly sure oh all right i dont do much flying rather here you seem to have a very good idea of where i fit and what im supposed to do it was a smile sorry maybe this is what being married is like anyway ill go on the next trip thatll tell us everything we need to know whether i can stand it whether citizens can stand my company aboard a rocket whether im any good whether i want a mate from somewhere else whether you do next trip will be the admiralty stet said jill she stood up lets go flying theres nobody to run the lift for us off the branch said jill fly to the midpoint sur prise lawri it would do that rather began to understand that jill would go where he would and try to beat him there too well have to fly more than thirty klomters out can you handle it sure well go off the branch and put wings on af terward otherwise someone stop us come on kendy had assembled the history file with some care it was unaltered records but it gave the distinct impres sion that disciplines crew had themselves decided to set tle the smoke ring the population of the smoke ring was between two and three thousand by his original orders kendy must consider that they might now be the entire human race the temptation to meddle was very strong he would not shape them they were shaping them selves and they were doing it well for agonizing mo ments he had even considered severing communications entirely but he had things to teach them the library was off when he passed the admiralty it wouldnt stay that way though day was the mid point of the crossyear three hundred and fiftyodd days away if kendy knew his citizens they would celebrate larry niven and the library would be involved perhaps he c reach wayne mickl kendy had a handle of sorts on captainguardian meanwhile a navy ship was moving on citizens t hed see what terms he could arrange plenty of time kendy waited
