concern on your dejection let me beseech you my charming excellence let me beseech you not to give way to it comfort yourself on the contrary in the triumphs of a virtue unsullied a will wholly faultless who could have withstood the trials you have surmounted your cousin morden will soon come he will see justice done you i make no doubt as well with regard to what concerns your person as your estate and many happy days may you yet see and much good may you still do if you will not heighten unavoidable accidents into guilty despondency but why why my dear this pining solicitude continued after a reconciliation with relations as unworthy as implacable whose wills are governed by an allgrasping brother who finds his account in keeping the breach open on this oversolicitude it is now plain to me that the vilest of men built all his schemes he saw that you thirsted after it beyond all reason for hope the view the hope i own extremely desirable had your family been christians or even had they been pagans who had had bowels i shall send this short letter i am obliged to make it a short one by young rogers as we call him the fellow i sent to you to hampstead an innocent though pragmatical rustic admit him i pray you into you presence that he may report to me how you look and how you are mr hickman should attend you but i apprehend that all his motions and mine own too are watched by the execrable wretch and indeed his are by an agent of mine for i own that i am so apprehensive of his plots and revenge now i know that he has intercepted my vehement letters against him that he is the subject of my dreams as well as of my waking fears my mother at my earnest importunity has just given me leave to write and to receive your letters but fastened this condition upon the concession that yours must be under cover to mr hickman this is a view i suppose to give him consideration with me and upon this further consideration that she is to see all we write when girls are set upon a point she told one who told me again it is better for a mother if possible to make herself of their party than to oppose them since there will be then hopes that she will still hold the reins in her own hands pray let me know what the people are with whom you lodge shall i send mrs townsend to direct you to lodgings either more safe or more convenient for you be pleased to write to me by rogers who will wait on you for your answer at your own time adieu my dearest creature comfort yourself as you would in the like unhappy circumstances comfort your own anna howe letter ii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe thursday july i am extremely concerned my dear miss howe for being primarily the occasion of the apprehensions you have of this wicked mans vindictive attempts what a widespreading error is mine if i find that he has set foot on any machination against you or against mr hickman i do assure you i will consent to prosecute him although i were sure i could not survive my first appearance at the bar he should be arraigned at i own the justice of your mothers arguments on that subject but must say that i think there are circumstances in my particular case which will excuse me although on a slighter occasion than that you are apprehensive of i should decline to appear against him i have said that i may one day enter more particularly into this argument your messenger has now indeed seen me i talked with him on the cheat put upon him at hampstead and am sorry to have reason to say that had not the poor young man been very simple and very selfsufficient he had not been so grossly deluded mrs bevis has the same plea to make for herself a goodnatured thoughtless woman not used to converse with so vile and so specious a deceiver as him who made his advantage of both these shallow creatures i think i cannot be more private than where i am i hope i am safe all the risque i run is in going out and returning from morningprayers which i have two or three times ventured to do once at lincolnsinn chapel at eleven once at st dunstans fleetstreet at seven in the morning in a chair both times and twice at six in the morning at the neighbouring church in coventgarden the wicked wretches i have escaped from will not i hope come to church to look for me especially at so early prayers and i have fixed upon the privatest pew in the latter church to hide myself in and perhaps i may lay out a little matter in an ordinary gown by way of disguise my face half hid by my mob i am very careless my dear of my appearance now neat and clean takes up the whole of my attention the sevenoclock prayers at st dunstans have been since discontinued the mans name at whose house i belong is smith a glove maker as well as seller his wife is the shopkeeper a dealer also in stockings ribbands snuff and perfumes a matronlike woman plainhearted and prudent the husband an honest industrious man and they live in good understanding with each other a proof with me that their hearts are right for where a married couple live together upon ill terms it is a sign i think that each knows something amiss of the other either with regard to temper or morals which if the world knew as well as themselves it would perhaps as little like them as such people like each other happy the marriage where neither man nor wife has any wilful or premeditated evil in their general conduct to reproach the other with for even persons who have bad hearts will have a veneration for those who have good ones two neat rooms with plain but clean furniture on the first floor are mine one they call the diningroom there is up another pair of stairs a very worthy widowlodger mrs lovick by name who although of low fortunes is much respected as mrs smith assures me by people of condition of her acquaintance for her piety prudence and understanding with her i propose to be well acquainted i thank you my dear for your kind your seasonable advice and consolation i hope i shall have more grace given me than to despond in the religious sense of the word especially as i can apply to myself the comfort you give me that neither my will nor my inconsiderateness has contributed to my calamity but nevertheless the irreconcilableness of my relations whom i love with an unabated reverence my apprehensions of fresh violences this wicked man i doubt will not let me rest my being destitute of protection my youth my sex my unacquaintedness with the world subjecting me to insults my reflections on the scandal i have given added to the sense of the indignities i have received from a man of whom i deserved not ill all together will undoubtedly bring on the effect that cannot be undesirable to me the situation and as i presume to imagine from principles which i hope will in due time and by due reflection set me above the sense of all worldly disappointments at present my head is much disordered i have not indeed enjoyed it with any degree of clearness since the violence done to that and to my heart too by the wicked arts of the abandoned creatures i was cast among i must have more conflicts at times i find myself not subdued enough to my condition i will welcome those conflicts as they come as probationary ones but yet my fathers malediction the temporary part so strangely and so literally completed i cannot however think when my mind is strongest but what is the story of isaac and jacob and esau and of rebekahs cheating the latter of the blessing designed for him in favour of jacob given us for in the th chapter of genesis my father used i remember to enforce the doctrine deducible from it on his children by many arguments at least therefore he must believe there is great weight in the curse he has announced and shall i not be solicitous to get it revoked that he may not hereafter be grieved for my sake that he did not revoke it all i will at present add are my thanks to your mother for her indulgence to us due compliments to mr hickman and my request that you will believe me to be to my last hour and beyond it if possible my beloved friend and my dearer self for what is now myself your obliged and affectionate clarissa harlowe letter iii mr lovelace to john belford esq friday july i have three of thy letters at once before me to answer in each of which thou complainest of my silence and in one of them tallest me that thou canst not live without i scribble to thee every day or every other day at least why then die jack if thou wilt what heart thinkest thou can i have to write when i have lost the only subject worth writing upon help me again to my angel to my clarissa and thou shalt have a letter from me or writing at least part of a letter every hour all that the charmer of my heart shall say that will i put down every motion every air of her beloved person every look will i try to describe and when she is silent i will endeavour to tell thee her thoughts either what they are or what i would have them to be so that having her i shall never want a subject having lost her my whole soul is a blank the whole creation round me the elements above beneath and every thing i behold for nothing can i enjoy are a blank without her oh return return thou only charmer of my soul return to thy adoring lovelace what is the light what the air what the town what the country whats any thing without thee light air joy harmony in my notion are but parts of thee and could they be all expressed in one word that word would be clarissa o my beloved clarissa return thou then once more return to bless thy lovelace who now by the loss of thee knows the value of the jewel he has slighted and rises every morning but to curse the sun that shines upon every body but him well but jack tis a surprising thing to me that the dear fugitive cannot be met with cannot be heard of she is so poor a plotter for plotting is not her talent that i am confident had i been at liberty i should have found her out before now although the different emissaries i have employed about town round the adjacent villages and in miss howes vicinage have hitherto failed of success but my lord continues so weak and lowspirited that there is no getting from him i would not disoblige a man whom i think in danger still for would his gout now it has got him down but give him like a fair boxer the risingblow all would be over with him and here pox of his fondness for me it happens at a very bad time he makes me sit hours together entertaining him with my rogueries a pretty amusement for a sick man and yet whenever he has the gout he prays night and morning with his chaplain but what must his notions of religion be who after he has nosed and mumbled over his responses can give a sigh or groan of satisfaction as if he thought he had made up with heaven and return with a new appetite to my stories encouraging them by shaking his sides with laughing at them and calling me a sad fellow in such an accent as shows he takes no small delight in his kinsman the old peer has been a sinner in his day and suffers for it now a sneaking sinner sliding rather than rushing into vices for fear of his reputation paying for what he never had and never daring to rise to the joy of an enterprise at first hand which could bring him within view of a tilting or of the honour of being considered as a principal man in a court of justice to see such an old trojan as this just dropping into the grave which i hoped ere this would have been dug and filled up with him crying out with pain and grunting with weakness yet in the same moment crack his leathern face into an horrible laugh and call a young sinner charming varlet encoreing him as formerly he used to do to the italian eunuchs what a preposterous what an unnatural adherence to old habits my two cousins are generally present when i entertain as the old peer calls it those stories must drag horribly that have not more hearers and applauders than relaters applauders ay belford applauders repeat i for although these girls pretend to blame me sometimes for the facts they praise my manner my invention my intrepidity besides what other people call blame that call i praise i ever did and so i very early discharged shame that coldwater damper to an enterprising spirit these are smart girls they have life and wit and yesterday upon charlottes raving against me upon a related enterprise i told her that i had had in debate several times whether she were or were not too near of kin to me and that it was once a moot point with me whether i could not love her dearly for a month or so and perhaps it was well for her that another pretty little puss started up and diverted me just as i was entering upon the course they all three held up their hands and eyes at once but i observed that though the girls exclaimed against me they were not so angry at this plain speaking as i have found my beloved upon hints so dark that i have wondered at her quick apprehension i told charlotte that grave as she pretended to be in her smiling resentments on this declaration i was sure i should not have been put to the expense of above two or three stratagems for nobody admired a good invention more than she could i but have disentangled her conscience from the embarrasses of consanguinity she pretended to be highly displeased so did her sister for her i told her she seemed as much in earnest as if she had thought me so and dared the trial plain words i said in these cases were more shocking to their sex than gradatim actions and i bid patty not be displeased at my distinguishing her sister since i had a great respect for her likewise an italian air in my usual careless way a halfstruggledfor kiss from me and a shrug of the shoulder by way of admiration from each pretty cousin and sad sad fellow from the old peer attended with a sideshaking laugh made us all friends there jack wilt thou or wilt thou not take this for a letter theres quantity i am sure how have i filled a sheet not a shorthand one indeed without a subject my fellow shall take this for he is going to town and if thou canst think tolerably of such execrable stuff i will send thee another letter iv mr lovelace to john belford esq six saturday morning july have i nothing new nothing diverting in my whimsical way thou askest in one of thy three letters before me to entertain thee with and thou tallest me that when i have least to narrate to speak in the scottish phrase i am most diverting a pretty compliment either to thyself or to me to both indeed a sign that thou hast as frothy a heart as i a head but canst thou suppose that this admirable woman is not all is not every thing with me yet i dread to think of her too for detection of all my contrivances i doubt must come next the old peer is also full of miss harlowe and so are my cousins he hopes i will not be such a dog theres a specimen of his peerlike dialect as to think of doing dishonourably by a woman of so much merit beauty and fortune and he says of so good a family but i tell him that this is a string he must not touch that it is a very tender point in short is my sore place and that i am afraid he would handle it too roughly were i to put myself in the power of so ungentle an operator he shakes his crazy head he thinks all is not as it should be between us longs to have me present her to him as my wife and often tells me what great things he will do additional to his former proposals and what presents he will make on the birth of the first child but i hope the whole of his estate will be in my hands before such an event takes place no harm in hoping jack lord m says were it not for hope the heart would break eight oclock at midsummer and these lazy varletesses in full health not come down yet to breakfast what a confounded indecency in young ladies to let a rake know that they love their beds so dearly and at the same time where to have them but ill punish them they shall breakfast with their old uncle and yawn at one another as if for a wager while i drive my phaton to colonel ambrosess who yesterday gave me an invitation both to breakfast and dine on account of two yorkshire nieces celebrated toasts who have been with him this fortnight past and who he says want to see me so jack all women do not run away from me thank heaven i wish i could have leave of my heart since the dear fugitive is so ungrateful to drive her out of it with another beauty but who can supplant her who can be admitted to a place in it after miss clarissa harlowe at my return if i can find a subject i will scribble on to oblige thee my phatons ready my cousins send me word they are just coming down so in spite ill be gone saturday afternoon i did stay to dine with the colonel and his lady and nieces but i could not pass the afternoon with them for the heart of me there was enough in the persons and faces of the two young ladies to set me upon comparisons particular features held my attention for a few moments but these served but to whet my impatience to find the charmer of my soul who for person for air for mind never had any equal my heart recoiled and sickened upon comparing minds and conversation pert wit a toostudied desire to please each in high good humour with herself an openmouth affectation in both to show white teeth as if the principal excellence and to invite amorous familiarity by the promise of a sweet breath at the same time reflecting tacitly upon breaths arrogantly implied to be less pure once i could have borne them they seemed to be disappointed that i was so soon able to leave them yet have i not at present so much vanity my clarissa has cured me of my vanity as to attribute their disappointment so much to particular liking of me as to their own selfadmiration they looked upon me as a connoisseur in beauty they would have been proud of engaging my attention as such but so affected so flimsywitted mere skindeep beauties they had looked no farther into themselves than what their glasses were flatteringglasses too for i thought them passivefaced and spiritless with eyes however upon the hunt for conquests and bespeaking the attention of others in order to countenance their own i believe i could with a little pains have given them life and soul and to every feature of their faces sparkling information but my clarissa o belford my clarissa has made me eyeless and senseless to every other beauty do thou find her for me as a subject worthy of my pen or this shall be the last from thy lovelace letter v mr lovelace to john belford esq sunday night july now jack have i a subject with a vengeance i am in the very height of my trial for all my sins to my beloved fugitive for here today at about five oclock arrived lady sarah sadleir and lady betty lawrance each in her chariotandsix dowagers love equipage and these cannot travel ten miles without a sett and half a dozen horsemen my time had hung heavy upon my hands and so i went to church after dinner why may not handsome fellows thought i like to be looked at as well as handsome wenches i fell in when service was over with major warneton and so came not home till after six and was surprised at entering the courtyard here to find it littered with equipages and servants i was sure the owners of them came for no good to me lady sarah i soon found was raised to this visit by lady betty who has health enough to allow her to look out to herself and out of her own affairs for business yet congratulation to lord m on his amendment spiteful devils on both accounts was the avowed errand but coming in my absence i was their principal subject and they had opportunity to set each others heart against me simon parsons hinted this to me as i passed by the stewards office for it seems they talked loud and he was making up some accounts with old pritchard however i hastened to pay my duty to them other people not performing theirs is no excuse for the neglect of our own you know and now i enter upon my trial with horrible grave faces was i received the two antiquities only bowed their tabby heads making longer faces than ordinary and all the old lines appearing strong in their furrowed foreheads and fallen cheeks how do you cousin and how do you mr lovelace looking all round at one another as who should say do you speak first and do you for they seemed resolved to lose no time i had nothing for it but an air as manly as theirs was womanly your servant madam to lady betty and your servant madam i am glad to see you abroad to lady sarah i took my seat lord m looked horribly glum his fingers claspt and turning round and round under and over his but just disgouted thumb his sallow face and goggling eyes on his two kinswomen by turns but not once deigning to look upon me then i began to think of the laudanum and wet cloth i told thee of long ago and to call myself in question for a tenderness of heart that will never do me good at last mr lovelacecousin lovelacehem hem i am sorry very sorry hesitated lady sarah that there is no hope of your ever taking up whats the matter now madam the matter nowwhy lady betty has two letters from miss harlowe which have told us whats the matterare all women alike with you yes i could have answered bating the difference which pride makes then they all chorusd upon me such a character as miss harlowes cried onea lady of so much generosity and good sense another how charmingly she writes the two maiden monkeys looking at her find handwriting her perfections my crimes what can you expect will be the end of these things cried lady sarah dd dd doings vociferated the peer shaking his loosefleshed wabbling chaps which hung on his shoulders like an old cows dewlap for my part i hardly knew whether to sing or say what i had to reply to these allatonce attacks upon mefair and softly ladies one at a time i beseech you i am not to be hunted down without being heard i hope pray let me see these letters i beg you will let me see them there they are thats the first read it out if you can i opened a letter from my charmer dated thursday june our weddingday that was to be and written to lady betty lawrance by the contents to my great joy i find the dear creature is alive and well and in charming spirits but the direction where to send an answer to was so scratched out that i could not read it which afflicted me much she puts three questions in it to lady betty st about a letter of hers dated june congratulating me on my nuptials and which i was so good as to save lady betty the trouble of writinga very civil thing of me i think again whether she and one of her nieces montague were to go to town on an old chancery suit and whether they actually did go to town accordingly and to hampstead afterwards and whether they brought to town from thence the young creature whom they visited was the subject of the second and third questions a little inquisitive dear rogue and what did she expect to be the better for these questionsbut curiosity dd curiosity is the itch of the sex yet when didst thou know it turned to their benefit for they seldom inquire but what they fear and the proverb as my lord has it says it comes with a fear that is i suppose what they fear generally happens because there is generally occasion for the fear curiosity indeed she avows to be her only motive for these interrogatories for though she says her ladyship may suppose the questions are not asked for good to me yet the answer can do me no harm nor her good only to give her to understand whether i have told her a parcel of dd lyes thats the plain english of her inquiry well madam said i with as much philosophy as i could assume and may i ask pray what was your ladyships answer theres a copy of it tossing it to me very disrespectfully this answer was dated july a very kind and complaisant one to the lady but very soso to her poor kinsman that people can give up their own flesh and blood with so much ease she tells her how proud all our family would be of an alliance with such an excellence she does me justice in saying how much i adore her as an angel of a woman and begs of her for i know not how many sakes besides my souls sake that she will be so good as to have me for a husband and answers thou wilt guess how to the ladys questions well madam and pray may i be favoured with the ladys other letter i presume it is in reply to yours it is said the peer but sir let me ask you a few questions before you read it give me the letter lady betty there it is my lord then on went the spectacles and his head moved to the lines a charming pretty hand i have often heard that this lady is a genius and so jack repeating my lords wise comments and questions will let thee into the contents of this merciless letter monday july reads my lord let me see that was last monday no longer ago monday july the third madam i cannot excuse myself um um um um um um humming inarticulately and skipping i must own to you madam that the honour of being related off went the spectacles now tell me sirr has not this lady lost all the friends she had in the world for your sake she has very implacable friends my lord we all know that but has she not lost them all for your sake tell me that i believe so my lord well then i am glad thou art not so graceless as to deny that on went the spectacles again i must own to you madam that the honour of being related to ladies as eminent for their virtue as for their descent very pretty truly saith my lord repeating as eminent for their virtue as for their descent was at first no small inducement with me to lend an ear to mr lovelaces address there is dignity borndignity in this lady cried my lord lady sarah she would have been a grace to our family lady betty indeed she would lovel to a royal family i will venture to say lord m then what a devil lovel please to read on my lord it cannot be her letter if it does not make you admire her more and more as you read cousin charlotte cousin patty pray attendread on my lord miss charlotte amazing fortitude miss patty only lifted up her doves eyes lord m reading and the rather as i was determined had it come to effect to do every thing in my power to deserve your favourable opinion then again they chorusd upon me a blessed time of it poor i i had nothing for it but impudence lovel pray read on my lord i told you how you would all admire her or shall i read lord m dd assurance then reading i had another motive which i knew would of itself give me merit with your whole family they were all ear a presumptuous one a punishablypresumptuous one as it has proved in the hope that i might be an humble mean in the hand of providence to reclaim a man who had as i thought good sense enough at bottom to be reclaimed or at least gratitude enough to acknowledge the intended obligation whether the generous hope were to succeed or not excellent young creature excellent young creature echoed the ladies with their handkerchiefs at their eyes attended with music lovel by my soul miss patty you weep in the wrong place you shall never go with me to a tragedy lady betty hardened wretch his lordship had pulled off his spectacles to wipe them his eyes were misty and he thought the fault in his spectacles i saw they were all cocked and primed to be sure that is a very pretty sentence said ithat is the excellency of this lady that in every line as she writes on she improves upon herself pray my lord proceed i know her style the next sentence will still rise upon us lord m dd fellow again saddling and reading but i have been most egregiously mistaken in mr lovelace then they all clamoured again the only man i persuade myself lovel ladies may persuade themselves to any thing but how can she answer for what other men would or would not have done in the same circumstances i was forced to say any thing to stifle their outcries pox take ye altogether thought i as if i had not vexation enough in losing her lord m reading the only man i persuade myself pretending to be a gentleman in whom i could have been so much mistaken they were all beginning again pray my lord proceed hear hear pray ladies hear now my lord be pleased to proceed the ladies are silent so they were lost in admiration of me hands and eyes uplifted lord m i will to thy confusion for he had looked over the next sentence what wretches belford what spiteful wretches are poor mortals so rejoiced to sting one another to see each other stung lord m reading for while i was endeavouring to save a drowning wretch i have been not accidentally but premeditatedly and of set purpose drawn in after him what say you to that sirr lady s ay sir what say you to this lady b lovel say why i say it is a very pretty metaphor if it would but hold but if you please my lord read on let me hear what is further said and i will speak to it all together lord m i will and he has had the glory to add to the list of those he has ruined a name that i will be bold to say would not have disparaged his own they all looked at me as expecting me to speak lovel be pleased to proceed my lord i will speak to this byandby how came she to know i kept a list i will speak to this byandby lord m reading on and this madam by means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with then again in a hurry off went the spectacles this was a plaguy stroke upon me i thought myself an oak in impudence but by my troth this almost felled me lord m what say you to this sirr remember jack to read all their sirs in this dialogue with a double rr sirr denoting indignation rather than respect they all looked at me as if to see if i could blush lovel eyes off my lordeyes off ladies looking bashfully i believe what say i to this my lord why i say that this lady has a strong manner of expressing herself thats all there are many things that pass among lovers which a man cannot explain himself upon before grave people lady betty among lovers sirr but mr lovelace can you say that this lady behaved either like a weak or a credulous person can you say lovel i am ready to do the lady all manner of justice but pray now ladies if i am to be thus interrogated let me know the contents of the rest of the letter that i may be prepared for my defence as you are all for my arraignment for to be required to answer piecemeal thus without knowing what is to follow is a cursed ensnaring way of proceeding they gave me the letter i read it through to myself and by the repetition of what i said thou wilt guess at the remaining contents you shall find ladies you shall find my lord that i will not spare myself then holding the letter in my hand and looking upon it as a lawyer upon his brief miss harlowe says that when your ladyship turning to lady betty shall know that in the progress to her ruin wilful falsehoods repeated forgeries and numberless perjuries were not the least of my crimes you will judge that she can have no principles that will make her worthy of an alliance with ladies of yours and your noble sisters character if she could not from her soul declare that such an alliance can never now take place surely ladies this is passion this is not reason if our family would not think themselves dishonoured by my marrying a person whom i had so treated but on the contrary would rejoice that i did her this justice and if she has come out pure gold from the assay and has nothing to reproach herself with why should it be an impeachment of her principles to consent that such an alliance take place she cannot think herself the worse justly she cannot for what was done against her will their countenances menaced a general uproar but i proceeded your lordship read to us that she had an hope a presumptuous one nay a punishablypresumptuous one she calls it that she might be a mean in the hand of providence to reclaim me and that this she knew if effected would give her a merit with you all but from what would she reclaim me she had heard youll say but she had only heard at the time she entertained that hope that to express myself in the womens dialect i was a very wicked fellow well and what then why truly the very moment she was convinced by her own experience that the charge against me was more than hearsay and that of consequence i was a fit subject for her generous endeavours to work upon she would needs give me up accordingly she flies out and declares that the ceremony which would repair all shall never take place can this be from any other motive than female resentment this brought them all upon me as i intended it should it was as a tub to a whale and after i had let them play with it a while i claimed their attention and knowing that they always loved to hear me prate went on the lady it is plain thought that the reclaiming of a man from bad habits was a much easier task than in the nature of things it can be she writes as your lordship has read that in endeavouring to save a drowning wretch she had been not accidentally but premeditatedly and of set purpose drawn in after him but how is this ladies you see by her own words that i am still far from being out of danger myself had she found me in a quagmire suppose and i had got out of it by her means and left her to perish in it that would have been a crime indeed but is not the fact quite otherwise has she not if her allegory prove what she would have it prove got out herself and left me floundering still deeper and deeper in what she should have done had she been in earnest to save me was to join her hand with mine that so we might by our united strength help one another out i held out my hand to her and besought her to give me hers but no truly she was determined to get out herself as fast as she could let me sink or swim refusing her assistance against her own principles because she saw i wanted it you see ladies you see my lord how pretty tinkling words run away with ears inclined to be musical they were all ready to exclaim again but i went on proleptically as a rhetorician would say before their voices would break out into words but my fair accuser says that i have added to the list of those i have ruined a name that would not have disparaged my own it is true i have been gay and enterprising it is in my constitution to be so i know not how i came by such a constitution but i was never accustomed to check or controul that you all know when a man finds himself hurried by passion into a slight offence which however slight will not be forgiven he may be made desperate as a thief who only intends a robbery is often by resistance and for selfpreservation drawn in to commit murder i was a strange a horrid wretch with every one but he must be a silly fellow who has not something to say for himself when every cause has its black and its white side westminsterhall jack affords every day as confident defences as mine but what right proceeded i has this lady to complain of me when she as good as says here lovelace you have acted the part of a villain by me you would repair your fault but i wont let you that i may have the satisfaction of exposing you and the pride of refusing you but was that the case was that the case would i pretend to say i would now marry the lady if she would have me lovel you find she renounces lady bettys mediation lord m interrupting me words are wind but deeds are mind what signifies your cursed quibbling bob say plainly if she will have you will you have her answer me yes or no and lead us not a wildgoose chace after your meaning lovel she knows i would but here my lord if she thus goes on to expose herself and me she will make it a dishonour to us both to marry charl but how must she have been treated lovel interrupting her why now cousin charlotte chucking her under the chin would you have me tell you all that has passed between the lady and me would you care had you a bold and enterprizing lover that proclamation should be made of every little piece of amorous roguery that he offered to you charlotte reddened they all began to exclaim but i proceeded the lady says she has been dishonoured devil take me if i spare myself by means that would shock humanity to be made acquainted with them she is a very innocent lady and may not be a judge of the means she hints at overniceness may be underniceness have you not such a proverb my lord tantamount to one extreme produces anothersuch a lady as this may possibly think her case more extraordinary than it is this i will take upon me to say that if she has met with the only man in the world who would have treated her as she says i have treated her i have met in her with the only woman in the world who would have made such a rout about a case that is uncommon only from the circumstances that attend it this brought them all upon me hands eyes voices all lifted at once but my lord m who has in his head the last seat of retreating lewdness as much wickedness as i have in my heart was forced upon the air i spoke this with and charlottes and all the rest reddening to make a mouth that was big enough to swallow up the other half of his face crying out to avoid laughing oh oh as if under the power of a gouty twinge hadst thou seen how the two tabbies and the young grimalkins looked at one another at my lord and at me by turns thou would have been ready to split thy ugly face just in the middle thy mouth hath already done half the work and after all i found not seldom in this conversation that my humourous undaunted airs forced a smile into my service from the prim mouths of the young ladies they perhaps had they met with such another intrepid fellow as myself who had first gained upon their affections would not have made such a rout as my beloved has done about such an affair as that we were assembled upon young ladies as i have observed on an hundred occasions fear not half so much for themselves as their mothers do for them but here the girls were forced to put on grave airs and to seem angry because the antiques made the matter of such high importance yet so lightly sat anger and fellowfeeling at their hearts that they were forced to purse in their mouths to suppress the smiles i nowandthen laid out for while the elders having had roses that is to say daughters of their own and knowing how fond men are of a trifle would have been very loth to have had them nipt in the bud without saying to the mother of them by your leave mrs rosebush the next article of my indictment was for forgery and for personating of lady betty and my cousin charlotte two shocking charges thoult say and so they were the peer was outrageous upon the forgery charge the ladies vowed never to forgive the personating part not a peacemaker among them so we all turned women and scolded my lord told me that he believed in his conscience there was not a viler fellow upon gods earth than me what signifies mincing the matter said he and that it was not the first time i had forged his hand to this i answered that i supposed when the statute of scandalum magnatum was framed there were a good many in the peerage who knew they deserved hard names and that that law therefore was rather made to privilege their qualities than to whiten their characters he called upon me to explain myself with a sirr so pronounced as to show that one of the most ignominious words in our language was in his head people i said that were fenced in by their quality and by their years should not take freedoms that a man of spirit could not put up with unless he were able heartily to despise the insulter this set him in a violent passion he would send for pritchard instantly let pritchard be called he would alter his will and all he could leave from me he would do do my lord said i i always valued my own pleasure above your estate but ill let pritchard know that if he draws he shall sign and seal why what would i do to pritchard shaking his crazy head at me only what he or any man else writes with his pen to despoil me of what i think my right he shall seal with his ears thats all my lord then the two ladies interposed lady sarah told me that i carried things a great way and that neither lord m nor any of them deserved the treatment i gave them i said i could not bear to be used ill by my lord for two reasons first because i respected his lordship above any man living and next because it looked as if i were induced by selfish considerations to take that from him which nobody else would offer to me and what returned he shall be my inducement to take what i do at your hands hay sir indeed cousin lovelace said lady betty with great gravity we do not any of us as lady sarah says deserve at your hands the treatment you give us and let me tell you that i dont think my character and your cousin charlottes ought to be prostituted in order to ruin an innocent lady she must have known early the good opinion we all have of her and how much we wished her to be your wife this good opinion of ours has been an inducement to her you see she says so to listen to your address and this with her friends folly has helped to throw her into your power how you have requited her is too apparent it becomes the character we all bear to disclaim your actions by her and let me tell you that to have her abused by wicked people raised up to personate us or any of us makes a double call upon us to disclaim them lovel why this is talking somewhat like i would have you all disclaim my actions i own i have done very vilely by this lady one step led to another i am curst with an enterprizing spirit i hate to be foiled foiled interrupted lady sarah what a shame to talk at this rate did the lady set up a contention with you all nobly sincere and plainhearted have i heard miss clarissa harlowe is above art above disguise neither the coquette nor the prude poor lady she deserved a better fare from the man for whom she took the step which she so freely blames this above half affected me had this dispute been so handled by every one i had been ashamed to look up i began to be bashful charlotte asked if i did not still seem inclinable to do the lady justice if she would accept of me it would be she dared to say the greatest felicity the family could know she would answer for one that this fine lady were of it they all declared to the same effect and lady sarah put the matter home to me but my lord marplot would have it that i could not be serious for six minutes together i told his lordship that he was mistaken light as he thought i made of his subject i never knew any that went so near my heart miss patty said she was glad to hear that and her soft eyes glistened with pleasure lord m called her sweet soul and was ready to cry not from humanity neither jack this peer has no bowels as thou mayest observe by this treatment of me but when peoples minds are weakened by a sense of their own infirmities and when they are drawing on to their latter ends they will be moved on the slightest occasions whether those offer from within or without them and this frequently the unpenetrating world calls humanity when all the time in compassionating the miseries of human nature they are but pitying themselves and were they in strong health and spirits would care as little for any body else as thou or i do here broke they off my trial for this sitting lady sarah was much fatigued it was agreed to pursue the subject in the morning they all however retired together and went into private conference letter vi mr lovelace in continuation the ladies instead of taking up the subject where we had laid it down must needs touch upon passage in my fair accusers letter which i was in hopes they would have let rest as we were in a tolerable way but truly they must hear all they could hear of our story and what i had to say to those passages that they might be better enabled to mediate between us if i were really and indeed inclined to do her the hopedfor justice these passages were st that after i had compulsorily tricked her into the act of going off with me i carried her to one of the worst houses in london nd that i had made a wicked attempt upon her in resentment of which she fled to hampstead privately dly came the forgery and personating charges again and we were upon the point of renewing out quarrel before we could get to the next charge which was still worse for that thly was that having betrayed her back to the vile house i first robbed her of her senses and then her honour detaining her afterwards a prisoner there were i to tell thee the glosses i put upon these heavy charges what would it be but repeat many of the extenuating arguments i have used in my letters to thee suffice it therefore to say that i insisted much by way of palliation on the ladys extreme niceness on her diffidence in my honour on miss howes contriving spirit plots on their parts begetting plots on mine on the high passions of the sex i asserted that my whole view in gently restraining her was to oblige her to forgive me and to marry me and this for the honour of both families i boasted of my own good qualities some of which none that knew me deny and to which few libertines can lay claim they then fell into warm admirations and praises of the lady all of them preparatory as i knew to the grand question and thus it was introduced by lady sarah we have said as much as i think we can say upon these letters of the poor lady to dwell upon the mischiefs that may ensue from the abuse of a person of her rank if all the reparation be not made that now can be made would perhaps be to little purpose but you seem sir still to have a just opinion of her as well as affection for her her virtue is not in the least questionable she could not resent as she does had she any thing to reproach herself with she is by every bodys account a fine woman has a good estate in her own right is of no contemptible family though i think with regard to her they have acted as imprudently as unworthily for the excellency of her mind for good economy the common speech of her as the worthy dr lewen once told me is that her prudence would enrich a poor man and her piety reclaim a licentious one i who have not been abroad twice this twelvemonth came hither purposely so did lady betty to see if justice may not be done her and also whether we and my lord m your nearest relations sir have or have not any influence over you and for my own part as your determination shall be in this article such shall be mine with regard to the disposition of all that is within my power lady betty and mine and mine said my lord and valiantly he swore to it lovel far be it from me to think slightly of favours you may any of you be glad i would deserve but as far be it from me to enter into conditions against my own liking with sordid views as to future mischiefs let them come i have not done with the harlowes yet they were the aggressors and i should be glad they would let me hear from them in the way they should hear from me in the like case perhaps i should not be sorry to be found rather than be obliged to seek on this occasion miss charlotte reddening spoke like a man of violence rather than a man of reason i hope youll allow that cousin lady sarah well but since what is done and cannot be undone let us think of the next best have you any objection against marrying miss harlowe if she will have you lovel there can possibly be but one that she is to every body no doubt as well as to lady betty pursuing that maxim peculiar to herself and let me tell you so it ought to be that what she cannot conceal from herself she will publish to the world miss patty the lady to be sure writes this in the bitterness of her grief and in despair lovel and so when her grief is allayed when her despairing fit is over and this from you cousin patty sweet girl and would you my dear in the like case whispering her have yielded to entreaty would you have meant no more by the like exclamations i had a rap with her fan and blush and from lord m a reflection that i turnd into jest every thing they said i asked if they thought the harlowes deserved any consideration from me and whether that family would not exult over me were i to marry their daughter as if i dared not to do otherwise lady sarah once i was angry with that family as we all were but now i pity them and think that you have but too well justified the worse treatment they gave you lord m their family is of standing all gentlemen of it and rich and reputable let me tell you that many of our coronets would be glad they could derive their descents from no worse a stem than theirs lovel the harlowes are a narrowsouled and implacable family i hate them and though i revere the lady scorn all relation to them lady betty i wish no worse could be said of him who is such a scorner of common failings in others lord m how would my sister lovelace have reproached herself for all her indulgent folly to this favourite boy of hers had she lived till now and been present on this occasion lady sarah well but begging your lordships pardon let us see if any thing can be done for this poor lady miss ch if mr lovelace has nothing to object against the ladys character and i presume to think he is not ashamed to do her justice though it may make against himself i cannot but see her honour and generosity will compel from him all that we expect if there be any levities any weaknesses to be charged upon the lady i should not open my lips in her favour though in private i would pity her and deplore her hard hap and yet even then there might not want arguments from honour to gratitude in so particular a case to engage you sir to make good the vows it is plain you have broken lady betty my niece charlotte has called upon you so justly and has put the question to you so properly that i cannot but wish you would speak to it directly and without evasion all in a breath then bespoke my seriousness and my justice and in this manner i delivered myself assuming an air sincerely solemn i am very sensible that the performance of the task you have put me upon will leave me without excuse but i will not have recourse either to evasion or palliation as my cousin charlotte has severely observed i am not ashamed to do justice to miss harlowes merit i own to you all and what is more with high regret if not with shame cousin charlotte that i have a great deal to answer for in my usage of this lady the sex has not a nobler mind nor a lovelier person of it and for virtue i could not have believed excuse me ladies that there ever was a woman who gave or could have given such illustrious such uniform proofs of it for in her whole conduct she has shown herself to be equally above temptation and art and i had almost said human frailty the step she so freely blames herself for taking was truly what she calls compulsatory for though she was provoked to think of going off with me she intended it not nor was provided to do so neither would she ever have had the thought of it had her relations left her free upon her offered composition to renounce the man she did not hate in order to avoid the man she did it piqued my pride i own that i could so little depend upon the force of those impressions which i had the vanity to hope i had made in a heart so delicate and in my worst devices against her i encouraged myself that i abused no confidence for none had she in my honour the evils she has suffered it would have been more than a miracle had she avoided her watchfulness rendered more plots abortive than those which contributed to her fall and they were many and various and all her greater trials and hardships were owing to her noble resistance and just resentment i know proceeded i how much i condemn myself in the justice i am doing to this excellent creature but yet i will do her justice and cannot help it if i would and i hope this shows that i am not so totally abandoned as i have been thought to be indeed with me she has done more honour to her sex in her fall if it be to be called a fall in truth it ought not than ever any other could do in her standing when at length i had given her watchful virtue cause of suspicion i was then indeed obliged to make use of power and art to prevent her escaping from me she then formed contrivances to elude mine but all hers were such as strict truth and punctilious honour would justify she could not stoop to deceit and falsehood no not to save herself more than once justly did she tell me fired by conscious worthiness that her soul was my souls superior forgive me ladies for saying that till i knew her i questioned a soul in a sex created as i was willing to suppose only for temporary purposes it is not to be imagined into what absurdities men of free principle run in order to justify to themselves their free practices and to make a religion to their minds and yet in this respect i have not been so faulty as some others no wonder that such a noble creature as this looked upon every studied artifice as a degree of baseness not to be forgiven no wonder that she could so easily become averse to the man though once she beheld him with an eye not wholly indifferent whom she thought capable of premeditated guilt nor give me leave on the other hand to say is it to be wondered at that the man who found it so difficult to be forgiven for the slighter offences and who had not the grace to recede or repent made desperate should be hurried on to the commission of the greater in short ladies in a word my lord miss clarissa harlowe is an angel if ever there was or could be one in human nature and is and ever was as pure as an angel in her will and this justice i must do her although the question i see by every glistening eye is ready to be asked what then lovelace art thou lord m a devil a dd devil i must answer and may the curse of god follow you in all you undertake if you do not make her the best amends now in your power to make her lovel from you my lord i could expect no other but from the ladies i hope for less violence from the ingenuousness of my confession the ladies elder and younger had their handkerchiefs to their eyes at the just testimony which i bore to the merits of this exalted creature and which i would make no scruple to bear at the bar of a court of justice were i to be called to it lady betty well sir this is a noble character if you think as you speak surely you cannot refuse to do the lady all the justice now in your power to do her they all joined in this demand i pleaded that i was sure she would not have me that when she had taken a resolution she was not to be moved unpersuadableness was an harlowe sin that and her name i told them were all she had of theirs all were of opinion that she might in her present desolate circumstances be brought to forgive me lady sarah said that lady betty and she would endeavour to find out the noble sufferer as they justly called her and would take her into their protection and be guarantees of the justice that i would do her as well after marriage as before it was some pleasure to me to observe the placability of these ladies of my own family had they any or either of them met with a lovelace but twould be hard upon us honest fellows jack if all women were clarissas here i am obliged to break off letter vii mr lovelace in continuation it is much better jack to tell your own story when it must be known than to have an adversary tell it for you conscious of this i gave them a particular account how urgent i had been with her to fix upon the thursday after i left her it being her uncle harlowes anniversary birthday and named to oblige her for the private celebration having some days before actually procured a license which still remained with her that not being able to prevail upon her to promise any thing while under a supposed restraint i offered to leave her at full liberty if she would give me the least hope for that day but neither did this offer avail me that this inflexibleness making me desperate i resolved to add to my former fault by giving directions that she should not either go or correspond out of the house till i returned from m hall well knowing that if she were at full liberty i must for ever lose her that this constraint had so much incensed her that although i wrote no less than four different letters i could not procure a single word in answer though i pressed her but for four words to signify the day and the church i referred to my two cousins to vouch for me the extraordinary methods i took to send messengers to town though they knew not the occasion which now i told them was this i acquainted them that i even had wrote to you jack and to another gentleman of whom i thought she had a good opinion to attend her in order to press for her compliance holding myself in readiness the last day at salthill to meet the messenger they should send and proceed to london if his message were favourable but that before they could attend her she had found means to fly away once more and is now said i perched perhaps somewhere under lady bettys window at glenhamhall and there like the sweet philomela a thorn in her breast warbles forth her melancholy complaints against her barbarous tereus lady betty declared that she was not with her nor did she know where she was she should be she added the most welcome guest to her that she ever received in truth i had a suspicion that she was already in their knowledge and taken into their protection for lady sarah i imagined incapable of being roused to this spirit by a letter only from miss harlowe and that not directed to herself she being a very indolent and melancholy woman but her sister i find had wrought her up to it for lady betty is as officious and managing a woman as mrs howe but of a much more generous and noble disposition she is my aunt jack i supposed i said that her ladyship might have a private direction where to send to her i spoke as i wished i would have given the world to have heard that she was inclined to cultivate the interest of any of my family lady betty answered that she had no direction but what was in the letter which she had scratched out and which it was probable was only a temporary one in order to avoid me otherwise she would hardly have directed an answer to be left at an inn and she was of opinion that to apply to miss howe would be the only certain way to succeed in any application for forgiveness would i enable that young lady to interest herself in procuring it miss charlotte permit me to make a proposalsince we are all of one mind in relation to the justice due to miss harlowe if mr lovelace will oblige himself to marry her i will make miss howe a visit little as i am acquainted with her and endeavour to engage her interest to forward the desired reconciliation and if this can be done i make no question but all may be happily accommodated for every body knows the love there is between miss harlowe and miss howe marriage with these women thou seest jack is an atonement for all we can do to them a true dramatic recompense this motion was highly approved of and i gave my honour as desired in the fullest manner they could wish lady sarah well then cousin charlotte begin your treaty with miss howe out of hand lady betty pray do and let miss harlowe be told that i am ready to receive her as the most welcome of guests and i will not have her out of my sight till the knot is tied lady sarah tell her from me that she shall be my daughter instead of my poor betseyand shed a tear in remembrance of her lost daughter lord m what say you sir to this lovel content my lord i speak in the language of your house lord m we are not to be fooled nephew no quibbling we will have no slur put upon us lovel you shall not and yet i did not intend to marry if she exceeded the appointed thursday but i think according to her own notions that i have injured her beyond reparation although i were to make her the best of husbands as i am resolved to be if she will condescend as i will call it to have me and be this cousin charlotte my part of your commission to say this pleased them all lord m give me thy hand bob thou talkest like a man of honour at last i hope we may depend upon what thou sayest the ladies eyes put the same question to me lovel you may my lord you may ladies absolutely you may then was the personal character of the lady as well as her more extraordinary talents and endowments again expatiated upon and miss patty who had once seen her launched out more than all the rest in her praise these were followed by such inquiries as are never forgotten to be made in marriagetreaties and which generally are the principal motives with the sages of a family though the least to be mentioned by the parties themselves and yet even by them perhaps the first thought of that is to say inquisition into the ladys fortune into the particulars of the grandfathers estate and what her father and her singlesouled uncles will probably do for her if a reconciliation be effected as by their means they make no doubt but it will be between both families if it be not my fault the two venerables no longer tabbies with me now hinted at rich presents on their own parts and my lord declared that he would make such overtures in my behalf as should render my marriage with miss harlowe the best days work i ever made and what he doubted not would be as agreeable to that family as to myself thus at present by a single hair hangs over my head the matrimonial sword and thus ended my trial and thus are we all friends and cousin and cousin and nephew and nephew at every word did ever comedy end more happily than this long trial letter viii mr lovelace to john belford esq wedn july so jack they think they have gained a mighty point but were i to change my mind were i to repent i fancy i am safe and yet this very moment it rises to my mind that tis hard trusting too for surely there must be some embers where there was fire so lately that may be stirred up to give a blaze to combustibles strewed lightly upon them love like some selfpropagating plants or roots which have taken strong hold in the earth when once got deep into the heart is hardly ever totally extirpated except by matrimony indeed which is the grave of love because it allows of the end of love then these ladies all advocates for herself with herself miss howe at their head perhaps not in favour to me i dont expect that from miss howe but perhaps in favour to herself for miss howe has reason to apprehend vengeance from me i ween her hickman will be safe too as she may think if i marry her beloved friend for he has been a busy fellow and i have long wished to have a slap at him the ladys case desperate with her friends too and likely to be so while single and her character exposed to censure a husband is a charming cloke a figleaved apron for a wife and for a lady to be protected in liberties in diversions which her heart pants after and all her faults even the most criminal were she to be detected to be thrown upon the husband and the ridicule too a charming privilege for a wife but i shall have one comfort if i marry which pleases me not a little if a mans wife has a dear friend of her sex a hundred liberties may be taken with that friend which could not be taken if the single lady knowing what a title to freedoms marriage had given him with her friend was not less scrupulous with him than she ought to be as to herself then there are broad freedoms shall i call them that may be taken by the husband with his wife that may not be quite shocking which if the wife bears before her friends will serve for a lesson to that friend and if that friend bears to be present at them without check or bashfulness will show a sagacious fellow that she can bear as much herself at proper time and place chastity jack like piety is an uniform thing if in look if in speech a girl give way to undue levity depend upon it the devil has got one of his cloven feet in her heart already so hickman take care of thyself i advise thee whether i marry or not thus jack have i at once reconciled myself to all my relations and if the lady refuses me thrown the fault upon her this i knew would be in my power to do at any time and i was the more arrogant to them in order to heighten the merit of my compliance but after all it would be very whimsical would it not if all my plots and contrivances should end in wedlock what a punishment should this come out to be upon myself too that all this while i have been plundering my own treasury and then can there be so much harm done if it can be so easily repaired by a few magical words as i robert take thee clarissa and i clarissa take thee robert with the rest of the forbetter and forworse legerdemain which will hocus pocus all the wrongs the crying wrongs that i have done to miss harlowe into acts of kindness and benevolence to mrs lovelace but jack two things i must insist upon with thee if this is to be the case having put secrets of so high a nature between me and my spouse into thy power i must for my own honour and for the honour of my wife and illustrious progeny first oblige thee to give up the letters i have so profusely scribbled to thee and in the next place do by thee as i have head whispered in france was done by the true father of a certain monarque that is to say cut thy throat to prevent thy telling of tales i have found means to heighten the kind opinion my friends here have begun to have of me by communicating to them the contents of the four last letters which i wrote to press my elected spouse to solemnize my lord repeated one of his phrases in my favour that he hopes it will come out that the devil is not quite so black as he is painted now prythee dear jack since so many good consequences are to flow from these our nuptials one of which to thyself since the sooner thou diest the less thou wilt have to answer for and that i nowandthen am apt to believe there may be something in the old fellows notion who once told us that he who kills a man has all that mans sins to answer for as well as his own because he gave him not the time to repent of them that heaven designed to allow him a fine thing for thee if thou consentest to be knocked of the head but a cursed one for the manslayer and since there may be room to fear that miss howe will not give us her help i prythee now exert thyself to find out my clarissa harlowe that i may make a lovelace of her set all the city bellmen and the country criers for ten miles round the metropolis at work with their oyes and if any man woman or child can give tale or tidings advertise her in all the newspapers and let her know that if she will repair to lady betty lawrance or to miss charlotte montague she may hear of something greatly to her advantage my two cousins montague are actually to set out tomorrow to mrs howes to engage her vixen daughters interest with her friend they will flaunt it away in a chariotandsix for the greater state and significance confounded mortification to be reduced this low my pride hardly knows how to brook it lord m has engaged the two venerables to stay here to attend the issue and i standing very high at present in their good graces am to gallant them to oxford to blenheim and to several other places letter ix miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe thursday night july collins sets not out tomorrow some domestic occasion hinders him rogers is but now returned from you and cannot be well spared mr hickman is gone upon an affair of my mothers and has taken both his servants with him to do credit to his employer so i am forced to venture this by post directed by your assumed name i am to acquaint you that i have been favoured with a visit from miss montague and her sister in lord ms chariotandsix my lords gentleman rode here yesterday with a request that i would receive a visit from the two young ladies on a very particular occasion the greater favour if it might be the next day as i had so little personal knowledge of either i doubted not but it must be in relation to the interests of my dear friend and so consulting with my mother i sent them an invitation to favour me because of the distance with their company at dinner which they kindly accepted i hope my dear since things have been so very bad that their errand to me will be as agreeable to you as any thing that can now happen they came in the name of lord m and lady sarah and lady betty his two sisters to desire my interest to engage you to put yourself into the protection of lady betty who will not part with you till she sees all the justice done you that now can be done lady sarah had not stirred out for a twelvemonth before never since she lost her agreeable daughter whom you and i saw at mrs bensons but was induced to take this journey by lady betty purely to procure you reparation if possible and their joint strength united with lord ms has so far succeeded that the wretch has bound himself to them and to these young ladies in the solemnest manner to wed you in their presence if they can prevail upon you to give him your hand this consolation you may take to yourself that all this honourable family have a due that is the highest sense of your merit and greatly admire you the horrid creature has not spared himself in doing justice to your virtue and the young ladies gave us such an account of his confessions and selfcondemnation that my mother was quite charmed with you and we all four shed tears of joy that there is one of our sex i that that one is my dearest friend who has done so much honour to it as to deserve the exalted praises given you by a wretch so selfconceited though pity for the excellent creature mixed with our joy he promises by them to make the best of husbands and my lord and lady sarah and lady betty are all three to be guarantees that he will be so noble settlements noble presents they talked of they say they left lord m and his two sisters talking of nothing else but of those presents and settlements how most to do you honour the greater in proportion for the indignities you have suffered and of changing of names by act of parliament preparative to the interest they will all join to make to get the titles to go where the bulk of the estate must go at my lords death which they apprehend to be nearer than they wish nor doubt they of a thorough reformation in his morals from your example and influence over him i made a great many objections for you all i believe that you could have made yourself had you been present but i have no doubt to advise you my dear and so does my mother instantly to put yourself into lady bettys protection with a resolution to take the wretch for your husband all his future grandeur he wants not pride depends upon his sincerity to you and the young ladies vouch for the depth of his concern for the wrongs he has done you all his apprehension is in your readiness to communicate to every one as he fears the evils you have suffered which he thinks will expose you both but had you not revealed them to lady betty you had not had so warm a friend since it is owing to two letters you wrote to her that all this good as i hope it will prove was brought about but i advise you to be more sparing in exposing what is past whether you have thoughts of accepting him or not for what my dear can that avail now but to give a handle to vile wretches to triumph over your friends since every one will not know how much to your honour your very sufferings have been your melancholy letter brought by rogers with his account of your indifferent health confirmed to him by the woman of the house as well as by your looks and by your faintness while you talked with him would have given me inexpressible affliction had i not bee cheered by this agreeable visit from the young ladies i hope you will be equally so on my imparting the subject of it to you see letter ii of this volume indeed my dear you must not hesitate you must oblige them the alliance is splendid and honourable very few will know any thing of his brutal baseness to you all must end in a little while in a general reconciliation and you will be able to resume your course of doing the good to every deserving object which procured you blessings wherever you set your foot i am concerned to find that your fathers inhuman curse affects you so much as it does yet you are a noble creature to put it as you put it i hope you are indeed more solicitous to get it revoked for their sakes than for your own it is for them to be penitent who hurried you into evils you could not well avoid you are apt to judge by the unhappy event rather than upon the true merits of your case upon my honour i think you faultless almost in every step you have taken what has not that vilelyinsolent and ambitious yet stupid brother of yours to answer for that spiteful thing your sister too but come since what is past cannot be helped let us look forward you have now happy prospects opening to you a family already noble prepared to receive you with open arms and joyful heart and who by their love to you will teach another family who know not what an excellence they have confederated to persecute how to value you your prudence your piety will crown all you will reclaim a wretch that for an hundred sakes more than for his own one would wish to be reclaimed like a traveller who has been put out of his way by the overflowing of some rapid stream you have only had the foreright path you were in overwhelmed a few miles about a day or two only lost as i may say and you are in a way to recover it and by quickening your speed will get up the lost time the hurry upon your spirits mean time will be all your inconvenience for it was not your fault you were stopped in your progress think of this my dear and improve upon the allegory as you know how if you can without impeding your progress be the means of assuaging the inundation of bounding the waters within their natural channel and thereby of recovering the overwhelmed path for the sake of future passengers who travel the same way what a merit will yours be i shall impatiently expect your next letter the young ladies proposed that you should put yourself if in town or near it into the reading stagecoach which inns somewhere in fleetstreet and if you give notice of the day you will be met on the road and that pretty early in your journey by some of both sexes one of whom you wont be sorry to see mr hickman shall attend you at slough and lady betty herself and one of the miss montagues with proper equipages will be at reading to receive you and carry you directly to the seat of the former for i have expressly stipulated that the wretch himself shall not come into your presence till your nuptials are to be solemnized unless you give leave adieu my dearest friend be happy and hundreds will then be happy of consequence inexpressibly so i am sure will then be your ever affectionate anna howe letter x miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe sunday night july my dearest friend why should you permit a mind so much devoted to your service to labour under such an impatience as you must know it would labour under for want of an answer to a letter of such consequence to you and therefore to me as was mine of thursday night rogers told me on thursday you were so ill your letter sent by him was so melancholy yet you must be ill indeed if you could not write something to such a letter were it but a line to say you would write as soon as you could sure you have received it the master of your nearest postoffice will pawn his reputation that it went safe i gave him particular charge of it god send me good news of your health of your ability to write and then i will chide you indeed i will as i never yet did chide you i suppose your excuse will be that the subject required consideration lord my dear so it might but you have so right a mind and the matter in question is so obvious that you could not want half an hour to determine then you intended probably to wait collinss call for your letter as on tomorrow suppose something were to happen as it did on friday that he should not be able to go to town tomorrow how child could you serve me so i know not how to leave off scolding you dear honest collins make haste he will he will he sets out and travels all night for i have told him that the dearest friend i have in the world has it in her own choice to be happy and to make me so and that the letter he will bring from her will assure it to me i have ordered him to go directly without stopping at the saracensheadinn to you at your lodgings matters are now in so good a way that he safely may your expected letter is ready written i hope if it can be not he will call for it at your hour you cant be so happy as you deserve to be but i doubt not that you will be as happy as you can that is that you will choose to put yourself instantly into lady bettys protection if you would not have the wretch for your own sake have him you must for mine for your familys for your honours sake dear honest collins make haste make haste and relieve the impatient heart of my beloveds ever faithful ever affectionate anna howe letter xi miss howe to miss charlotte montague tuesday morn july madam i take the liberty to write to you

what he has done with her if i have patience i will give you the occasion of this distracted vehemence i wrote to her the very moment you and your sister left me but being unable to procure a special messenger as i intended was forced to send by the post i urged her you know i promised that i would i urged her with earnestness to comply with the desires of all your family having no answer i wrote again on sunday night and sent it by a particular hand who travelled all night chiding her for keeping a heart so impatient as mine in such cruel suspense upon a matter of so much importance to her and therefore to me and very angry i was with her in my mind but judge my astonishment my distraction when last night the messenger returning posthaste brought me word that she had not been heard of

returning to her lodgings who villains put her into a chair they had in readiness and carried her to one of the cursed fellows houses she has arrested her for pretendedly due for board and lodging a

bag them up in order to put them together again in their allotted place in the element of fire with cements of molten lead a line a line a kingdom for a line with tolerable news the first moment thou canst write this fellow waits to bring it letter xiii miss charlotte montague to miss howe m hall tuesday afternoon dear miss howe your letter has infinitely disturbed us all this wretched man has been half distracted ever since saturday night we knew not what ailed him till your letter was brought vile wretch as he is he is however innocent of this new evil indeed he is he must be as i shall more at large acquaint you but will not now detain your messenger only to satisfy your just impatience by telling you that the dear young lady is safe and we hope well a horrid mistake of his general orders has subjected her to the terror and disgrace of an arrest poor dear miss harlowe her sufferings have endeared her to us almost as much as her excellencies can have endeared her to you but she must now be quite at liberty he has been a distracted man ever since the news was brought him and we knew not what ailed him but that i said before my lord m my lady sarah sadleir and my lady betty lawrance will all write to you this very afternoon and so will the wretch himself and send it by a servant of their own not to detain yours i know not what i write but you shall have all the particulars just and true and fair from dear madam your most faithful and obedient servant ch montague letter xiv miss montague to miss howe m hall july dear madam in pursuance of my promise i will minutely inform you of every thing we know relating to this shocking transaction when we returned from you on thursday night and made our report of the kind reception both we and our message met with in that you had been so good as to promise to use your interest with your dear friend it put us all into such good humour with one another and with my cousin lovelace that we resolved upon a little tour of two days the friday and saturday in order to give an airing to my lord and lady sarah both having been long confined one by illness the other by melancholy my lord lady sarah lady betty and myself were in the coach and all our talk was of dear miss harlowe and of our future happiness with her mr lovelace and my sister who is his favourite as he is hers were in his phaton and whenever we joined company that was still the subject as to him never man praised woman as he did her never man gave greater hopes and made better resolutions he is none of those that are governed by interest he is too proud for that but most sincerely delighted was he in talking of her and of his hopes of her returning favour he said however more than once that he feared she would not forgive him for from his heart he must say he deserved not her forgiveness and often and often that there was not such a woman in the world this i mention to show you madam that he could not at this time be privy to such a barbarous and disgraceful treatment of her we returned not till saturday night all in as good humour with one another as we went out we never had such pleasure in his company before if he would be good and as he ought to be no man would be better beloved by relations than he but never was there a greater alteration in man when he came home and received a letter from a messenger who it seems had been flattering himself in hopes of a reward and had been waiting for his return from the night before in such a fury the man fared but badly he instantly shut himself up to write and ordered man and horse to be ready to set out before daylight the next morning to carry the letter to a friend in london he would not see us all that night neither breakfast nor dine with us next day he ought he said never to see the light and bid my sister whom he called an innocent and who was very desirous to know the occasion of all this shun him saying he was a wretch and made so by his own inventions and the consequences of them none of us could get out of him what so disturbed him we should too soon hear he said to the utter dissipation of all his hopes and of all ours we could easily suppose that all was not right with regard to the worthy young lady and him he went out each day and said he wanted to run away from himself late on monday night he received a letter from mr belford his most favoured friend by his own messenger who came back in a foam man and horse whatever were the contents he was not easier but like a madman rather but still would not let us know the occasion but to my sister he said nobody my dear patsey who can think but of half the plagues that pursue an intriguing spirit would ever quit the foreright path he was out when your messenger came but soon came in and bad enough was his reception from us all and he said that his own torments were greater than ours than miss harlowes or yours madam all put together he would see your letter he always carries every thing before him and said when he had read it that he thanked god he was not such a villain as you with too great an appearance of reason thought him thus then he owned the matter to be he had left general instructions to the people of the lodgings the dear lady went from to find out where she was gone to if possible that he might have an opportunity to importune her to be his before their difference was public the wicked people officious at least if not wicked discovered where she was on wednesday and for fear she should remove before they could have his orders they put her under a gentle restraint as they call it and dispatched away a messenger to acquaint him with it and to take his orders this messenger arrived friday afternoon and staid here till we returned on saturday night and when he read the letter he brought i have told you madam what a fury he was in the letter he retired to write and which he dispatched away so early on sunday morning was to conjure his friend mr belford on receipt of it to fly to the lady and set her free and to order all her things to be sent to her and to clear him of so black and villanous a fact as he justly called it and by this time he doubts not that all is happily over and the beloved of his soul as he calls her at ever word in an easier and happier way than she was before the horrid fact and now he owns that the reason why mr belfords letter set him into stronger ravings was because of his keeping him wilfully and on purpose to torment him in suspense and reflecting very heavily upon him for mr belford he says was ever the ladys friend and advocate and only mentioning that he had waited upon her referring to his next for further particulars which mr belford could have told him at the time he declares and we can vouch for him that he has been ever since last saturday night the most miserable of men he forbore going up himself that it might not be imagined he was guilty of so black a contrivance and that he went up to complete any base views in consequence of it believe us all dear miss howe under the deepest concern at this unhappy accident which will we fear exasperate the charming sufferer not too much for the occasion but too much for our hopes o what wretches are these freeliving men who love to tread in intricate paths and when once they err know not how far out of the way their headstrong course may lead them my sister joins her thanks with mine to your good mother and self for the favours you heaped upon us last thursday we beseech your continued interest as to the subject of our visit it shall be all our studies to oblige and recompense the dear lady to the utmost of our power and for what she has suffered from the unhappy man we are dear madam your obliged and faithful servants charlotte montague martha dear miss howe we join in the above request of miss charlotte and miss patty montague for your favour and interest being convinced that the accident was an accident and no plot or contrivance of a wretch too full of them we are madam your most obedient humble servants m sarah sadleir eliz lawrance dear miss howe after what is written above by names and characters of unquestionable honour i might have been excused signing a name almost as hateful to myself as i know it is to you but the above will have it so since therefore i must write it shall be the truth which is that if i may be once more admitted to pay my duty to the most deserving and most injured of her sex i will be content to do it with a halter about my neck and attended by a parson on my right hand and the hangman on my left be doomed at her will either to the church or the gallows your most humble servant robert lovelace tuesday july letter xv mr belford to robert lovelace esq sunday night july what a cursed piece of work hast thou made of it with the most excellent of women thou mayest be in earnest or in jest as thou wilt but the poor lady will not be long either thy sport or the sport of fortune i will give thee an account of a scene that wants but her affecting pen to represent it justly and it would wring all the black blood out of thy callous heart thou only who art the author of her calamities shouldst have attended her in her prison i am unequal to such a task nor know i any other man but would this last act however unintended by thee yet a consequence of thy general orders and too likely to be thought agreeable to thee by those who know thy other villanies by her has finished thy barbarous work and i advise thee to trumpet forth every where how much in earnest thou art to marry her whether true or not thou mayest safely do it she will not live to put thee to the trial and it will a little palliate for thy enormous usage of her and be a mean to make mankind who know not what i know of the matter herd a little longer with thee and forbear to hunt thee to thy fellowsavages in the lybian wilds and desarts your messenger found me at edgware expecting to dinner with me several friends whom i had invited three days before i sent apologies to them as in a case of life and death and speeded to town to the womans for how knew i but shocking attempts might be made upon her by the cursed wretches perhaps by your connivance in order to mortify her into your measures little knows the public what villanies are committed by vile wretches in these abominable houses upon innocent creatures drawn into their snares finding the lady not there i posted away to the officers although sally told me that she had but just come from thence and that she had refused to see her or as she sent down word any body else being resolved to have the remainder of that sunday to herself as it might perhaps be the last she should ever see i had the same thing told me when i got thither i sent up to let her know that i came with a commission to set her at liberty i was afraid of sending up the name of a man known to be your friend she absolutely refused to see any man however for that day or to answer further to any thing said from me having therefore informed myself of all that the officer and his wife and servant could acquaint me with as well in relation to the horrid arrest as to her behaviour and the womens to her and her ill state of health i went back to sinclairs as i will still call her and heard the three womens story from all which i am enabled to give you the following shocking particulars which may serve till i can see the unhappy lady herself tomorrow if then i gain admittance to her you will find that i have been very minute in my inquiries your villain it was that set the poor lady and had the impudence to appear and abet the sheriffs officers in the cursed transaction he thought no doubt that he was doing the most acceptable service to his blessed master they had got a chair the head ready up as soon as service was over and as she came out of the church at the door fronting bedfordstreet the officers stepping up to her whispered that they had an action against her she was terrified trembled and turned pale action said she what is thati have committed no bad action lord bless me men what mean you that you are our prisoner madam

fellows authority they showed it is your name clarissa harlowe madam said he yes yes indeed ready to sink my name was clarissa harlowe but it is now wretchednesslord be merciful to me what is to come next you must go with these men madam said the gentleman they have authority for what they do he pitied her and retired indeed you must said one chairman indeed you must said the other can nobody joined in another gentleman be applied to who will see that so fine a creature is not ill used thy villain answered orders were given particularly for that she had rich relations she need but ask and have she would only be carried to the officers house till matters could be made up the people she had lodged with loved her but she had left her lodgings privately oh had she those tricks already cried one or two she heard not this but said well if i must go i must i cannot resist but i will not be carried to the womans i will rather die at your feet than be carried to the womans you wont be carried there madam cried thy fellow only to my house madam said one of the officers where is that in highholborn madam i know not where highholborn is but any where except to the womans but am i to go with men only looking about her and seeing the three passages to wit that leading to henriettastreet that to kingstreet and the foreright one to bedfordstreet crowded she started any where any where said she but to the womans and stepping into the chair threw herself on the seat in the utmost distress and confusion carry me carry me out of sight cover me cover me up for ever were her words thy villain drew the curtain she had not power and they went away with her through a vast crowd of people here i must rest i can write no more at present only lovelace remember all this was to a clarissa the unhappy lady fainted away when she was taken out of the chair at the officers house several people followed the chair to the very house which is in a wretched court sally was there and satisfied some of the inquirers that the young gentlewoman would be exceedingly well used and they soon dispersed dorcas was also there but came not in her sight sally as a favour offered to carry her to her former lodgings but she declared they should carry her thither a corpse if they did very gentle usage the women boast of so would a vulture could it speak with the entrails of its prey upon its rapacious talons of this youll judge from what i have to recite she asked what was meant by this usage of her people told me said she that i must go with the men that they had authority to take me so i submitted but now what is to be the end of this disgraceful violence the end said the vile sally martin is for honest people to come at their own bless me have i taken away any thing that belongs to those who have obtained the power over me i have left very valuable things behind me but have taken away that is not my own and who do you think miss harlowe for i understand said the cursed creature you are not married who do you think is to pay for your board and your lodgings such handsome lodgings for so long a time as you were at mrs sinclairs lord have mercy upon me miss martin i think you are miss martin and is this the cause of such a disgraceful insult upon me in the open streets and cause enough miss harlowe fond of gratifying her jealous revenge by calling her miss one hundred and fifty guineas or pounds is no small sum to lose and by a young creature who would have bilked her lodgings you amaze me miss martin what language do you talk in bilk my lodgings what is that she stood astonished and silent for a few moments but recovering herself and turning from her to the window she wrung her hands the cursed sally showed me how and lifting them up now lovelace now indeed do i think i ought to forgive thee but who shall forgive clarissa harloweo my sister o my brother tender mercies were your cruelties to this after a pause her handkerchief drying up her falling tears she turned to sally now have i noting to do but acquiesce only let me say that if this aunt of yours this mrs sinclair or this man this mr lovelace come near me or if i am carried to the horrid house for that i suppose is the design of this new outrage god be merciful to the poor clarissa harlowelook to the consequencelook i charge you to the consequence the vile wretch told her it was not designed to carry her any where against her will but if it were they should take care not to be frighted again by a penknife she cast up her eyes to heaven and was silent and went to the farthest corner of the room and sitting down threw her handkerchief over her face sally asked her several questions but not answering her she told her she would wait upon her byandby when she had found her speech she ordered the people to press her to eat and drink she must be fasting nothing but her prayers and tears poor thing were the merciless devils words as she owned to me dost think i did not curse her she went away and after her own dinner returned the unhappy lady by this devils account of her then seemed either mortified into meekness or to have made a resolution not to be provoked by the insults of this cursed creature sally inquired in her presence whether she had eat or drank any thing and being told by the woman that she could not prevail upon her to taste a morsel or drink a drop she said this is wrong miss harlowe very wrong your religion i think should teach you that starving yourself is selfmurder she answered not the wretch owned she was resolved to make her speak she asked if mabell should attend her till it were seen what her friends would do for her in discharge of the debt mabell said she had not yet earned the clothes you were so good as to give her am i not worthy an answer miss harlowe i would answer you said the sweet sufferer without any emotion if i knew how i have ordered pen ink and paper to be brought you miss harlowe there they are i know you love writing you may write to whom you please your friend miss howe will expect to hear from you i have no friend said she i deserve none rowland for thats the officers name told her she had friends enow to pay the debt if she would write she would trouble nobody she had no friends was all they could get from her while sally staid but yet spoken with a patience of spirit as if she enjoyed her griefs the insolent creature went away ordering them in the ladys hearing to be very civil to her and to let her want for nothing now had she she owned the triumph of her heart over this haughty beauty who kept them all at such a distance in their own house what thinkest thou lovelace of this this wretchs triumph was over a clarissa about six in the evening rowlands wife pressed her to drink tea she said she had rather have a glass of water for her tongue was ready to cleave to the roof of her mouth the woman brought her a glass and some bread and butter she tried to taste the latter but could not swallow it but eagerly drank the water lifting up her eyes in thankfulness for that the divine clarissa lovelace reduced to rejoice for a cup of cold water by whom reduced about nine oclock she asked if any body were to be her bedfellow their maid if she pleased or as she was so weak and ill the girl should sit up with her if she chose she should she chose to be alone both night and day she said but might she not be trusted with the key of the room where she was to lie down for she should not put off her clothes that they told her could not be she was afraid not she said but indeed she would not get away if she could they told me that they had but one bed besides that they lay in themselves which they would fain have had her accept of and besides that their maid lay in in a garret which they called a hole of a garret and that that one bed was the prisoners bed which they made several apologies to me about i suppose it is shocking enough but the lady would not lie in theirs was she not a prisoner she said let her have the prisoners room yet they owned that she started when she was conducted thither but recovering herself very well said she why should not all be of a piece why should not my wretchedness be complete she found fault that all the fastenings were on the outside and none within and said she could not trust herself in a room where others could come in at their pleasure and she not go out she had not been used to it dear dear soul my tears flow as i writeindeed lovelace she had not been used to such treatment they assured her that it was as much their duty to protect her from other persons insults as from escaping herself then they were people of more honour she said than she had been of late used to she asked if they knew mr lovelace no was their answer have you heard of him no well then you may be good sort of folks in your way pause here for a moment lovelace and reflect i must again they asked her if they should send any word to her lodgings these are my lodgings now are they not was all her answer she sat up in a chair all night the back against the door having it seems thrust a piece of a poker through the staples where a bolt had been on the inside next morning sally and polly both went to visit her she had begged of sally the day before that she might not see mrs sinclair nor dorcas nor the brokentoothed servant called william polly would have ingratiated herself with her and pretended to be concerned for her misfortunes but she took no more notice of her than of the other they asked if she had any commands if she had she only need to mention what they were and she should be obeyed none at all she said how did she like the people of the house were they civil to her pretty well considering she had no money to give them would she accept of any money they could put it to her account she would contract no debts had she any money about her she meekly put her hand in her pocket and pulled out half a guinea and a little silver yes i have a littlebut here should be fees paid i believe should there not i have heard of entrancemoney to compound for not being stript but these people are very civil people i fancy for they have not offered to take away my clothes they have orders to be civil to you it is very kind but we two will bail you miss if you will go back with us to mrs sinclairs not for the world hers are very handsome apartments the fitter for those who own them these are very sad ones the fitter for me you may be happy yet miss if you will i hope i shall if you refuse to eat or drink we will give bail and take you with us then i will try to eat and drink any thing but go with you will you not send to your new lodgings the people will be frighted so they will if i send so they will if they know where i am but have you no things to send for from thence there is what will pay for their lodgings and trouble i shall not lessen their security but perhaps letters or messages may be left for you there i have very few friends and to those i have i will spare the mortification of knowing what has befallen me we are surprised at your indifference miss harlowe will you not write to any of your friends no why you dont think of tarrying here always i shall not live always do you think you are to stay here as long as you live thats as it shall please god and those who have brought me hither should you like to be at liberty i am miserable what is liberty to the miserable but to be more miserable how miserable miss you may make yourself as happy as you please i hope you are both happy we are may you be more and more happy but we wish you to be so too i shall never be of your opinion i believe as to what happiness is what do you take our opinion of happiness to be to live at mrs sinclairs perhaps said sally we were once as squeamish and narrowminded as you how came it over with you because we saw the ridiculousness of prudery do you come hither to persuade me to hate prudery as you call it as much as you do we came to offer our service to you it is out of your power to serve me perhaps not it is not in my inclination to trouble you you may be worse offered perhaps i may you are mighty short miss as i wish your visit to be ladies they owned to me that they cracked their fans and laughed adieu perverse beauty your servant ladies adieu haughty airs you see me humbled as you deserve miss harlowe pride will have a fall better fall with what you call pride than stand with meanness who does i had once a better opinion of you miss horton indeed you should not insult the miserable neither should the miserable said sally insult people for their civility i should be sorry if i did mrs sinclair shall attend you byandby to know if you have any commands for her i have no wish for any liberty but that of refusing to see her and one more person what we came for was to know if you had any proposals to make for your enlargement then it seems the officer put in you have very good friends madam i understand is it not better that you make it up charges will run high a hundred and fifty guineas are easier paid than two hundred let these ladies bail you and go along with them or write to your friends to make it up sally said there is a gentleman who saw you taken and was so much moved for you miss harlowe that he would gladly advance the money for you and leave you to pay it when you can see lovelace what cursed devils these are this is the way we know that many an innocent heart is thrown upon keeping and then upon the town but for these wretches thus to go to work with such an angel as this how glad would have been the devilish sally to have had the least handle to report to thee a listening ear or patient spirit upon this hint sir said she with high indignation to the officer did not you say last night that it was as much your business to protect me from the insults of others as from escaping cannot i be permitted to see whom i please and to refuse admittance to those i like not your creditors madam will expect to see you not if i declare i will not treat with them then madam you will be sent to prison prison friend what dost thou call thy house not a prison madam why these ironbarred windows then why these double locks and bolts all on the outside none on the in and down she dropt into her chair and they could not get another word from her she threw her handkerchief over her face as one before which was soon wet with tears and grievously they own she sobbed gentle treatment lovelace perhaps thou as well as these wretches will think it so sally then ordered a dinner and said they would soon be back a gain and see that she eat and drank as a good christian should comporting herself to her condition and making the best of it what has not this charming creature suffered what has she not gone through in these last three months that i know of who would think such a delicatelyframed person could have sustained what she has sustained we sometimes talk of bravery of courage of fortitude here they are in perfection such bravoes as thou and i should never have been able to support ourselves under half the persecutions the disappointments and contumelies that she has met with but like cowards should have slid out of the world basely by some backdoor that is to say by a sword by a pistol by a halter or knife but here is a fineprincipled woman who by dint of this noble consideration as i imagine what else can support her that she has not deserved the evils she contends with and that this world is designed but as a transitory state of the probation and that she is travelling to another and better puts up with all the hardships of the journey and is not to be diverted from her course by the attacks of thieves and robbers or any other terrors and difficulties being assured of an ample reward at the end of it if thou thinkest this reflection uncharacteristic from a companion and friend of thine imaginest thou that i profited nothing by my long attendance on my uncle in his dying state and from the pious reflections of the good clergyman who day by day at the poor mans own request visited and prayed by him and could i have another such instance as this to bring all these reflections home to me then who can write of good persons and of good subjects and be capable of admiring them and not be made serious for the time and hence may we gather what a benefit to the morals of men the keeping of good company must be while those who keep only bad must necessarily more and more harden and be hardened tis twelve of the clock sunday night i can think of nothing but this excellent creature her distresses fill my head and my heart i was drowsy for a quarter of an hour but the fit is gone off and i will continue the melancholy subject from the information of these wretches enough i dare say will arise in the visit i shall make if admitted tomorrow to send by thy servant as to the way i am likely to find her in after the women had left her she complained of her head and her heart and seemed terrified with apprehensions of being carried once more to sinclairs refusing any thing for breakfast mrs rowland came up to her and told her as these wretches owned they had ordered her for fear she should starve herself that she must and should have tea and bread and butter and that as she had friends who could support her if she wrote to them it was a wrong thing both for herself and them to starve herself thus if it be for your own sakes said she that is another thing let coffee or tea or chocolate or what you will be got and put down a chicken to my account every day if you please and eat it yourselves i will taste it if i can i would do nothing to hinder you i have friends will pay you liberally when they know i am gone they wondered they told her at her strange composure in such distresses they were nothing she said to what she had suffered already from the vilest of all men the disgrace of seizing her in the street multitudes of people about her shocking imputations wounding her ears had indeed been very affecting to her but that was over every thing soon would and she should be still more composed were it not for the apprehensions of seeing one man and one woman and being tricked or forced back to the vilest house in the world then were it not better to give way to the two gentlewomans offer to bail her they could tell her it was a very kind proffer and what was not to be met every day she believed so the ladies might possibly dispense with her going back to the house to which she had such an antipathy then the compassionate gentleman who was inclined to make it up with her creditors on her own bond it was very strange to them she hearkened not to so generous a proposal did the two ladies tell you who the gentleman was or did they say any more on the subject yes they did and hinted to me said the woman that you had nothing to do but to receive a visit from the gentleman and the money they believed would be laid down on your own bond or note she was startled i charge you said she as you will answer it one day to my friends i charge you dont if you do you know not what may be the consequence they apprehended no bad consequence they said in doing their duty and if she knew not her own good her friends would thank them for taking any innocent steps to serve her though against her will dont push me upon extremities man dont make me desperate woman i have no small difficulty notwithstanding the seeming composure you just now took notice of to bear as i ought to bear the evils i suffer but if you bring a man or men to me be the pretence what it will she stopt there and looked so earnestly and so wildly they said that they did not know but she would do some harm to herself if they disobeyed her and that would be a sad thing in their house and might be their ruin they therefore promised that no man should be brought to her but by her own consent mrs rowland prevailed on her to drink a dish of tea and taste some bread and butter about eleven on saturday morning which she probably did to have an excuse not to dine with the women when they returned but she would not quit her prisonroom as she called it to go into their parlour unbarred windows and a lightsomer apartment she said had too cheerful an appearance for her mind a shower falling as she spoke what said she looking up do the elements weep for me at another time the light of the sun was irksome to her the sun seemed to shine in to mock her woes methought added she the sun darting in and gilding these iron bars plays upon me like the two women who came to insult my haggard looks by the word beauty and my dejected heart by the word haughty airs sally came again at dinnertime to see how she fared as she told her and that she did not starve herself and as she wanted to have some talk with her if she gave her leave she would dine with her i cannot eat you must try miss harlowe and dinner being ready just then she offered her hand and desired her to walk down no she would not stir out of her prisonroom these sullen airs wont do miss harlowe indeed they wont she was silent you will have harder usage than any you have ever yet known i can tell you if you come not into some humour to make matters up she was still silent come miss walk down to dinner let me entreat you do miss horton is below she was once your favourite she waited for an answer but received none we came to make some proposals to you for your good though you affronted us so lately and we would not let mrs sinclair come in person because we thought to oblige you this is indeed obliging come give me your hand miss harlowe you are obliged to me i can tell you that and let us go down to miss horton excuse me i will not stir out of this room would you have me and miss horton dine in this filthy bedroom it is not a bedroom to me i have not been in bed nor will while i am here and yet you care not as i see to leave the house and so you wont go down miss harlowe i wont except i am forced to it well well let it alone i shant ask miss horton to dine in this room i assure you i will send up a plate and away the little saucy toad fluttered down when they had dined up they came together well miss you would not eat any thing it seems very pretty sullen airs these no wonder the honest gentleman had such a hand with you she only held up her hands and eyes the tears trickling down her cheeks insolent devils how much more cruel and insulting are bad women even than bad men methinks miss said sally you are a little soily to what we have seen you pity such a nice lady should not have changes of apparel why wont you send to your lodgings for linen at least i am not nice now miss looks well and clean in any thing said polly but dear madam why wont you send to your lodgings were it but in kindness to the people they must have a concern about you and your miss howe will wonder whats become of you for no doubt you correspond she turned from them and to herself said too much too much she tossed her handkerchief wet before with her tears from her and held her apron to her eyes dont weep miss said the vile polly yet do cried the viler sally it will be a relief nothing as mr lovelace once told me dries sooner than tears for once i too wept mightily i could not bear the recital of this with patience yet i cursed them not so much as i should have done had i not had a mind to get from them all the particulars of their gentle treatment and this for two reasons the one that i might stab thee to the heart with the repetition and the other that i might know upon what terms i am likely to see the unhappy lady tomorrow well but miss harlowe cried sally do you think these forlorn airs pretty you are a good christian child mrs rowland tells me she has got you a biblebook o there it lies i make no doubt but you have doubled down the useful places as honest matt prior says then rising and taking it up ay so you have the book of job one opens naturally here i see my mamma made me a fine biblescholar you see miss horton i know something of the book they proposed once more to bail her and to go home with them a motion which she received with the same indignation as before sally told her that she had written in a very favourable manner in her behalf to you and that she every hour expected an answer and made no doubt that you would come up with a messenger and generously pay the whole debt and ask her pardon for neglecting it this disturbed her so much that they feared she would have fallen into fits she could not bear your name she said she hoped she should never see you more and were you to intrude yourself dreadful consequences might follow surely they said she would be glad to be released from her confinement indeed she should now they had begun to alarm her with his name who was the author of all her woes and who she now saw plainly gave way to this new outrage in order to bring her to his own infamous terms why then they asked would she not write to her friends to pay mrs sinclairs demand because she hoped she should not trouble any body and because she knew that the payment of the money if she should be able to pay it was not what was aimed at sally owned that she told her that truly she had thought herself as well descended and as well educated as herself though not entitled to such considerable fortunes and had the impudence to insist upon it to me to be truth she had the insolence to add to the lady that she had as much reason as she to expect mr lovelace would marry her he having contracted to do so before he knew miss clarissa harlowe and that she had it under his hand and seal too or else he had not obtained his end therefore it was not likely she should be so officious as to do his work against herself if she thought mr lovelace had designs upon her like what she presumed to hint at that for her part her only view was to procure liberty to a young gentlewoman who made those things grievous to her which would not be made such a rout about by any body else and to procure the payment of a just debt to her friend mrs sinclair she besought them to leave her she wanted not these instances she said to convince her of the company she was in and told them that to get rid of such visiters and of the still worse she was apprehensive of she would write to one friend to raise the money for her though it would be death for her to do so because that friend could not do it without her mother in whose eye it would give a selfish appearance to a friendship that was above all sordid alloys they advised her to write out of hand but how much must i write for what is the sum should i not have had a bill delivered me god knows i took not your lodgings but he that could treat me as he has done could do this dont speak against mr lovelace miss harlowe he is a man i greatly esteem cursed toad and bating that he will take his advantage where he can of us silly credulous women he is a man of honour she lifted up her hands and eyes instead of speaking and well she might for any words she could have used could not have expressed the anguish she must feel on being comprehended in the us she must write for one hundred and fifty guineas at least two hundred if she were short of more money might well be written for mrs sinclair she said had all her clothes let them be sold fairly sold and the money go as far as it would go she had also a few other valuables but no money none at all but the poor half guinea and the little silver they had seen she would give bond to pay all that her apparel and the other maters she had would fall short of she had great effects belonging to her of right her bond would and must be paid were it for a thousand pounds but her clothes she should never want she believed if not too much undervalued those and her few valuables would answer every thing she wished for no surplus but to discharge the last expenses and forty shillings would do as well for those as forty pounds let my ruin said she lifting up her eyes be large let it be complete in this life for a composition let it be complete and there she stopped the wretches could not help wishing to me for the opportunity of making such a purchase for their own wear how i cursed them and in my heart thee but too probable thought i that this vile sally martin may hope though thou art incapable of it that her lovelace as she has the assurance behind thy back to call thee may present her with some of the poor ladys spoils will not mrs sinclair proceeded she think my clothes a security till they can be sold they are very good clothes a suit or two but just put on as it were never worn they cost much more than it demanded of me my father loved to see me fine all shall go but let me have the particulars of her demand i suppose i must pay for my destroyer that was her welladapted word and his servants as well as for myself i am content to do so i am above wishing that any body who could thus act should be so much as expostulated with as to the justice and equity of this payment if i have but enough to pay the demand i shall be satisfied and will leave the baseness of such an action as this as ana aggravation of a guilt which i thought could not be aggravated i own lovelace i have malice in this particularity in order to sting thee on the heart and let me ask thee what now thou canst think of thy barbarity thy unprecedented barbarity in having reduced a person of her rank fortune talents and virtue so low the wretched women it must be owned act but in their profession a profession thou hast been the principal means of reducing these two to act in and they know what thy designs have been and how far prosecuted it is in their opinions using her gently that they have forborne to bring her to the woman so justly odious to her and that they have not threatened her with the introducing to her strange men nor yet brought into her company their spiritbreakers and humblingdrones fellows not allowed to carry stings to trace and force her back to their detested house and when there into all their measures till i came they thought thou wouldst not be displeased at any thing she suffered that could help to mortify her into a state of shame and disgrace and bring her to comply with thy views when thou shouldst come to release her from these wretches as from a greater evil than cohabiting with thee when thou considerest these things thou wilt make no difficulty of believing that this their own account of their behaviour to this admirable woman has been far short of their insults and the less when i tell thee that all together their usage had such effect upon her that they left her in violent hysterics ordering an apothecary to be sent for if she should continue in them and be worse and particularly as they had done from the first that they kept out of her way any edged or pointed instrument especially a penknife which pretending to mend a pen they said she might ask for at twelve saturday night rowland sent to tell them that she was so ill that he knew not what might be the issue and wished her out of his house and this made them as heartily wish to hear from you for their messenger to their great surprise was not then returned from m hall and they were sure he must have reached that place by friday night early on sunday morning both devils went to see how she did they had such an account of her weakness lowness and anguish that they forebore out of compassion they said finding their visits so disagreeable to her to see her but their apprehension of what might be the issue was no doubt their principal consideration nothing else could have softened such flinty bosoms they sent for the apothecary rowland had had to her and gave him and rowland and his wife and maid strict orders many times repeated for the utmost care to be taken of her no doubt with an oldbailey forecast and they sent up to let her know what orders they had given but that understanding she had taken something to compose herself they would not disturb her she had scrupled it seems to admit the apothecarys visit over night because he was a man nor could she be prevailed upon to see him till they pleaded their own safety to her they went again from church lord bob these creatures go to church but she sent them down word that she must have all the remainder of the day to herself when i first came and told them of thy execrations for what they had done and joined my own to them they were astonished the mother said she had thought she had known mr lovelace better and expected thanks and not curses while i was with them came back halting and cursing most horribly their messenger by reason of the illusage he had received from you instead of the reward he had been taught to expect for the supposed good news that he carried down a pretty fellow art thou not to abuse people for the consequences of thy own faults dorcas whose acquaintance this fellow is and who recommended him for the journey had conditioned with him it seems for a share in the expected bounty from you had she been to have had her share made good i wish thou hadst broken every bone in his skin under what shocking disadvantages and with this addition to them that i am thy friend and intimate am i to make a visit to this unhappy lady tomorrow morning in thy name too enough to be refused that i am of a sex to which for thy sake she has so justifiable an aversion nor having such a tyrant of a father and such an implacable brother has she the reason to make an exception in favour of any of it on their accounts it is three oclock i will close here and take a little rest what i have written will be a proper preparative for what shall offer byandby thy servant is not to return without a letter he tells me and that thou expectest him back in the morning thou hast fellows enough where thou art at thy command if i find any difficulty in seeing the lady thy messenger shall post away with this let him look to broken bones and other consequences if what he carries answer not thy expectation but if i am admitted thou shalt have this and the result of my audience both together in the former case thou mayest send another servant to wait the next advices from j belford letter xvi mr belford to robert lovelace esq monday july about six this morning i went to rowlands mrs sinclair was to follow me in order to dismiss the action but not to come in sight rowland upon inquiry told me that the lady was extremely ill and that she had desired that no one but his wife or maid should come near her i said i must see her i had told him my business overnight and i must see her his wife went up but returned presently saying she could not get her to speak to her yet that her eyelids moved though she either would not or could not open them to look up at her oons woman said i the lady may be in a fit the lady may be dying let me go up show me the way a horrid hole of a house in an alley they call a court stairs wretchedly narrow even to the firstfloor rooms and into a den they led me with broken walls which had been papered as i saw by a multitude of tacks and some torn bits held on by the rusty heads the floor indeed was clean but the ceiling was smoked with variety of figures and initials of names that had been the woeful employment of wretches who had no other way to amuse themselves a bed at one corner with coarse curtains tacked up at the feet to the ceiling because the curtainrings were broken off but a coverlid upon it with a cleanish look though plaguily in tatters and the corners tied up in tassels that the rents in it might go no farther the windows dark and doublebarred the tops boarded up to save mending and only a little fourpaned eyelethole of a casement to let in air more however coming in at broken panes than could come in at that four old turkeyworked chairs burstenbottomed the stuffing staring out an old tottering wormeaten table that had more nails bestowed in mending it to make it stand than the table cost fifty years ago when new on the mantlepiece was an iron shoveup candlestick with a lighted candle in it twinkle twinkle twinkle four of them i suppose for a penny near that on the same shelf was an old lookingglass cracked through the middle breaking out into a thousand points the crack given it perhaps in a rage by some poor creature to whom it gave the representation of his hearts woes in his face the chimney had two halftiles in it on one side and one whole one on the other which showed it had been in better plight but now the very mortar had followed the rest of the tiles in every other place and left the bricks bare an old halfbarred stove grate was in the chimney and in that a large stonebottle without a neck filled with baleful yew as an evergreen withered southernwood dead sweetbriar and sprigs of rue in flower to finish the shocking description in a dark nook stood an old brokenbottomed cane couch without a squab or coverlid sunk at one corner and unmortised by the failing of one of its wormeater legs which lay in two pieces under the wretched piece of furniture it could no longer support and this thou horrid lovelace was the bedchamber of the divine clarissa i had leisure to cast my eye on these things for going up softly the poor lady turned not about at our entrance nor till i spoke moved her head she was kneeling in a corner of the room near the dismal window against the table on an old bolster as it seemed to be of the cane couch halfcovered with her handkerchief her back to the door which was only shut to no need of fastenings her arms crossed upon the table the forefinger of her righthand in her bible she had perhaps been reading in it and could read no longer paper pens ink lay by her book on the table her dress was white damask exceeding neat but her stays seemed not tightlaced i was told afterwards that her laces had been cut when she fainted away at her entrance into this cursed place and she had not been solicitous enough about her dress to send for others her headdress was a little discomposed her charming hair in natural ringlets as you have heretofore described it but a little tangled as if not lately combed irregularly shading one side of the loveliest neck in the world as her disordered rumpled handkerchief did the other her face o how altered from what i had seen it yet lovely in spite of all her griefs and sufferings was reclined when we entered upon her crossed arms but so as not more than one side of it could be hid when i surveyed the room around and the kneeling lady sunk with majesty too in her white flowing robes for she had not on a hoop spreading the dark though not dirty floor and illuminating that horrid corner her linen beyond imagination white considering that she had not been undressed every since she had been here i thought my concern would have choked me something rose in my throat i know not what which made me for a moment guggle as it were for speech which at last forcing its way con con confound you both said i to the man and woman is this an apartment for such a lady and could the cursed devils of her own sex who visited this suffering angel see her and leave her in so dd a nook sir we would have had the lady to accept of our own bedchamber but she refused it we are poor people and we expect nobody will stay with us longer than they can help it you are people chosen purposely i doubt not by the dd woman who has employed you and if your usage of this lady has been but half as bad as your house you had better never to have seen the light up then raised the charming sufferer her lovely face but with such a significance of woe overspreading it that i could not for the soul of me help being visibly affected she waved her hand two or three times towards the door as if commanding me to withdraw and displeased at my intrusion but did not speak permit me madam i will not approach one step farther without your leave permit me for one moment the favour of your ear no no go go man with an emphasis and would have said more but as if struggling in vain for words she seemed to give up speech for lost and dropped her head down once more with a deep sigh upon her left arm her right as if she had not the use of it numbed i suppose selfmoved dropping on her side o that thou hadst been there and in my place but by what i then felt in myself i am convinced that a capacity of being moved by the distresses of our fellow creatures is far from being disgraceful to a manly heart with what pleasure at that moment could i have given up my own life could i but first have avenged this charming creature and cut the throat of her destroyer as she emphatically calls thee though the friend that i best love and yet at the same time my heart and my eyes gave way to a softness of which though not so hardened a wretch as thou they were never before so susceptible i dare not approach you dearest lady without your leave but on my knees i beseech you to permit me to release you from this dd house and out of the power of the cursed woman who was the occasion of your being here she lifted up her sweet face once more and beheld me on my knees never knew i before what it was to pray so heartily are you not are you not mr belford sir i think your name is belford it is madam and i ever was a worshipper of your virtues and an advocate for you and i come to release you from the hands you are in and in whose to place me o leave me leave me let me never rise from this spot let me never never more believe in man this moment dearest lady this very moment if you please you may depart whithersoever you think fit you are absolutely free and your own mistress i had now as lieve die here in this place as any where i will owe no obligation to any friend of him in whose company you have seen me so pray sir withdraw then turning to the officer mr rowland i think your name is i am better reconciled to your house than i was at first if you can but engage that i shall have nobody come near me but your wife no man and neither of those women who have sported with my calamities i will die with you and in this very corner and you shall be well satisfied for the trouble you have had with me i have value enough for that for see i have a diamond ring taking it out of her bosom and i have friends will redeem it at a high price when i am gone but for you sir looking at me i beg you to withdraw if you mean well by me god i hope will reward you for your good meaning but to the friend of my destroyer will i not owe an obligation you will owe no obligation to me nor to any body you have been detained for a debt you do not owe the action is dismissed and you will only be so good as to give me your hand into the coach which stands as near to this house as it could draw up and i will either leave you at the coachdoor or attend you whithersoever you please till i see you safe where you would wish to be will you then sir compel me to be beholden to you you will inexpressibly oblige me madam to command me to do you either service or pleasure why then sir looking at me but why do you mock me in that humble posture rise sir i cannot speak to you else i rose only sir take this ring i have a sister who will be glad to have it at the price it shall be valued at for the former owners sake out of the money she gives let this man be paid handsomely paid and i have a few valuables more at my lodging dorcas or the man william can tell where that is let them and my clothes at the wicked womans where you have seen me be sold for the payment of my lodging first and next of your friends debts that i have been arrested for as far as they will go only reserving enough to put me into the ground any where or any how no mattertell your friend i wish it may be enough to satisfy the whole demand but if it be not he must make it up himself or if he think fit to draw for it on miss howe she will repay it and with interest if he insist upon itand this sir if you promise to perform you will do me as you offer both pleasure and service and say you will and take the ring and withdraw if i want to say any thing more to you you seem to be an humane man i will let you knowand so sir god bless you i approached her and was going to speak dont speak sir heres the ring i stood off and wont you take it wont you do this last office for me i have no other person to ask it of else believe me i would not request it of you but take it or not laying it upon the tableyou must withdraw sir i am very ill i would fain get a little rest if i could i find i am going to be bad again and offering to rise she sunk down through excess of weakness and grief in a fainting fit why lovelace was thou not present thyselfwhy dost thou commit such villanies as even thou art afraid to appear in and yet puttest a weaker heart and head upon encountering with them the maid coming in just then the woman and she lifted her up on a decrepit couch and i withdrew with this rowland who wept like a child and said he never in his life was so moved yet so hardened a wretch art thou that i question whether thou wilt shed a tear at my relation they recovered her by hartshorn and water i went down mean while for the detestable woman had been below some time o how i did curse her i never before was so fluent in curses she tried to wheedle me but i renounced her and after she had dismissed the action sent her away crying or pretending to cry because of my behaviour to her you will observe that i did not mention one word to the lady about you i was afraid to do it for twas plain that she could not bear your name your friend and the company you have seen me in were the words nearest to naming you she could speak and yet i wanted to clear your intention of this brutal this sordidlooking villany i sent up again by rowlands wife when i heard that the lady was recovered beseeching her to quit that devilish place and the woman assured her that she was at liberty to do so for that the action was dismissed but she cared not to answer her and was so weak and low that it was almost as much out of her power as inclination the woman told me to speak i would have hastened away for my friend doctor h but the house is such a den and the room she was in such a hole that i was ashamed to be seen in it by a man of his reputation especially with a woman of such an appearance and in such uncommon distress and i found there was no prevailing upon her to quit it for the peoples bedroom which was neat and lightsome the strong room she was in the wretches told me should have been in better order but that it was but the very morning that she was brought in that an unhappy man had quitted it for a more eligible prison no doubt since there could hardly be a worse being told that she desired not to be disturbed and seemed inclined to doze i took this opportunity to go to her lodgings in coventgarden to which dorcas who first discovered her there as will was the setter from church had before given me a direction the mans name is smith a dealer in gloves snuff and such petty merchandize his wife the shopkeeper he a maker of the gloves they sell honest people it seems i thought to have got the woman with me to the lady but she was not within i talked with the man and told him what had befallen the lady owing as i said to a mistake of orders and gave her the character she deserved and desired him to send his wife the moment she came in to the lady directing him whither not doubting that her attendance would be very welcome to her which he promised he told me that a letter was left for her there on saturday and about half an hour before i came another superscribed by the same hand the first by the post the other by a countryman who having been informed of her absence and of all the circumstances they could tell him of it posted away full of concern saying that the lady he was sent from would be ready to break her heart at the tidings i thought it right to take the two letters back with me and dismissing my coach took a chair as a more proper vehicle for the lady if i the friend of her destroyer could prevail upon her to leave rowlands and here being obliged to give way to an indispensable avocation i will make thee taste a little in thy turn of the plague of suspense and break off without giving thee the least hint of the issue of my further proceedings i know that those least bear disappointment who love most to give it in twenty instances hast thou afforded me proof of the truth of this observation and i matter not thy raving another letter however shall be ready send for it a soon as thou wilt but were it not have i not written enough to convince thee that i am thy ready and obliging friend j belford letter xvii mr lovelace to john belford esq monday july eleven at night curse upon thy hard heart thou vile caitiff how hast thou tortured me by thy designed abruption tis impossible that miss harlowe should have ever suffered as thou hast made me suffer and as i now suffer that sex is made to bear pain it is a curse that the first of it entailed upon all her daughters when she brought the curse upon us all and they love those best whether man or child who give them most but to stretch upon thy dd tenterhooks such a spirit as mine no rack no torture can equal my torture and must i still wait the return of another messenger confound thee for a malicious devil i wish thou wert a posthorse and i upon the back of thee how would i whip and spur and harrow up thy clumsy sides till i make thee a readyroasted readyflayed mess of dogs meat all the hounds in the country howling after thee as i drove thee to wait my dismounting in order to devour thee piecemeal life still throbbing in each churned mouthful give this fellow the sequel of thy tormenting scribble dispatch him away with it thou hast promised it shall be ready every cushion or chair i shall sit upon the bed i shall lie down upon if i go to bed till he return will be stuffed with boltupright awls bodkins corkingpins and packing needles already i can fancy that to pink my body like my mind i need only to be put into a hogshead stuck full of steelpointed spikes and rolled down a hill three times as high as the monument but i lose time yet know not how to employ it till this fellow returns with the sequel of thy soulharrowing intelligence letter xviii mr belford to robert lovelace esq monday night july on my return to rowlands i found that the apothecary was just gone up mrs rowland being above with him i made the less scruple to go up too as it was probable that to ask for leave would be to ask to be denied hoping also that the letters had with me would be a good excuse she was sitting on the side of the broken couch extremely weak and low and i observed cared not to speak to the man and no wonder for i never saw a more shocking fellow of a profession tolerably genteel nor heard a more illiterate one prate physician in ordinary to this house and others like it i suppose he put me in mind of otways apothecary in his caius marius as borrowed from the immortal shakspeare meagre and very rueful were his looks sharp misery had worn him to the bones famine in his cheeks need and oppression staring in his eyes contempt and beggary hanging on his back the world no friend of his nor the worlds law as i am in black he took me at my entrance i believe to be a doctor and slunk behind me with his hat upon his two thumbs and looked as if he expected the oracle to open and give him orders the lady looked displeased as well at me as at rowland who followed me and at the apothecary it was not she said the least of her present misfortunes that she could not be left to her own sex and to her option to see whom she pleased i besought her excuse and winking for the apothecary to withdraw which he did told her that i had been at her new lodgings to order every thing to be got ready for reception presuming she would choose to go thither that i had a chair at the door that mr smith and his wife i named their names that she should not have room for the least fear of sinclairs had been full of apprehensions for her safety that i had brought two letters which were left there fore her the one by the post the other that very morning this took her attention she held out her charming hand for them took them and pressing them to her lips from the only friend i have in the world said she kissing them again and looking at the seals as if to see whether they had been opened i cant read them said she my eyes are too dim and put them into her bosom i besought her to think of quitting that wretched hole whither could she go she asked to be safe and uninterrupted for the short remainder of her life and to avoid being again visited by the creatures who had insulted her before i gave her the solemnest assurances that she should not be invaded in her new lodgings by any body and said that i would particularly engage my honour that the person who had most offended her should not come near her without her own consent your honour sir are you not that mans friend i am not a friend madam to his vile actions to the most excellent of women do you flatter me sir then you are a man but oh sir your friend holding her face forward with great earnestness your barbarous friend what has he not to answer for there she stopt her heart full and putting her hand over her eyes and forehead the tears tricked through her fingers resenting thy barbarity it seemed as caesar did the stab from his distinguished brutus though she was so very much disordered i thought i would not lose this opportunity to assert your innocence of this villanous arrest there is no defending the unhappy man in any of his vile actions by you madam but of this last outrage by all thats good and sacred he is innocent o wretches what a sex is yours have you all one dialect good and sacred if sir you can find an oath or a vow or an adjuration that my ears have not been twenty times a day wounded with then speak it and i may again believe a man i was excessively touched at these words knowing thy baseness and the reason she had for them but say you sir for i would not methinks have the wretch capable of this sordid baseness say you that he is innocent of this last wickedness can you truly say that he is by the great god of heaven nay sir if you swear i must doubt you if you yourself think your word insufficient what reliance can i have on your oath o that this my experience had not cost me so dear but were i to love a thousand years i would always suspect the veracity of a swearer excuse me sir but is it likely that he who makes so free with his god will scruple any thing that may serve his turn with his fellow creature this was a most affecting reprimand madam said i i have a regard a regard a gentleman ought to have to my word and whenever i forfeit it to you nay sir dont be angry with me it is grievous to me to question a gentlemans veracity but your friend calls himself a gentleman you know not what i have suffered by a gentlemanand then again she wept i would give you madam demonstration if your grief and your weakness would permit it that he has no hand in this barbarous baseness and that he resents it as it ought to be resented well well sir with quickness he will have his account to make up somewhere else not to me i should not be sorry to find him able to acquit his intention on this occasion let him know sir only one thing that when you heard me in the bitterness of my spirit most vehemently exclaim against the undeserved usage i have met with from him that even then in that passionate moment i was able to say and never did i see such an earnest and affecting exultation of hands and eyes give him good god repentance and amendment that i may be the last poor creature who shall be ruined by him and in thine own good time receive to thy mercy the poor wretch who had none on me by my soul i could not speak she had not her bible before her for nothing i was forced to turn my head away and to take out my handkerchief what an angel is this even the gaoler and his wife and maid wept again i wish thou hadst been there that thou mightest have sunk down at her feet and begun that moment to reap the effect of her generous wishes for thee undeserving as thou art of any thing but perdition i represented to her that she would be less free where she was from visits she liked not than at her own lodgings i told her that it would probably bring her in particular one visiter who otherwise i would engage but i durst not swear again after the severe reprimand she had just given me should not come near her without her consent and i expressed my surprize that she should be unwilling to quit such a place as this when it was more than probable that some of her friends when it was known how bad she was would visit her she said the place when she was first brought into it was indeed very shocking to her but that she had found herself so weak and ill and her griefs had so sunk her that she did not expect to have lived till now that therefore all places had been alike to her for to die in a prison was to die and equally eligible as to die in a palace palaces she said could have no attractions for a dying person but that since she feared she was not so soon to be released as she had hoped since she was suffered to be so little mistress of herself here and since she might by removal be in the way of her dear friends letters she would hope that she might depend upon the assurances i gave her of being at liberty to return to her last lodgings otherwise she would provide herself with new ones out of my knowledge as well as yours and that i was too much of a gentleman to be concerned in carrying her back to the house she had so much reason to abhor and to which she had been once before most vilely betrayed to her ruin i assured her in the strongest terms but swore not that you were resolved not to molest her and as a proof of the sincerity of my professions besought her to give me directions in pursuance of my friends express desire about sending all her apparel and whatever belonged to her to her new lodgings she seemed pleased and gave me instantly out of her pocket her keys asking me if mrs smith whom i had named might not attend me and she would give her further directions to which i cheerfully assented and then she told me that she would accept of the chair i had offered her i withdrew and took the opportunity to be civil to rowland and his maid for she found no fault with their behaviour for what they were and the fellow seems to be miserably poor i sent also for the apothecary who is as poor as the officer and still poorer i dare say as to the skill required in his business and satisfied him beyond his hopes the lady after i had withdrawn attempted to read the letters i had brought her but she could read but a little way in one of them and had great emotions upon it she told the woman she would take a speedy opportunity to acknowledge her civilities and her husbands and to satisfy the apothecary who might send her his bill to her lodgings she gave the maid something probably the only halfguinea she had and then with difficulty her limbs trembling under her and supported by mrs rowland got down stairs i offered my arm she was pleased to lean upon it i doubt sir said she as she moved i have behaved rudely to you but if you knew all you would forgive me i know enough madam to convince me that there is not such purity and honour in any woman upon earth nor any one that has been so barbarously treated she looked at me very earnestly what she thought i cannot say but in general i never saw so much soul in a womans eyes as in hers i ordered my servant whose mourning made him less observable as such and who had not been in the ladys eye to keep the chair in view and to bring me word how she did when set down the fellow had the thought to step into the shop just before the chair entered it under pretence of buying snuff and so enabled himself to give me an account that she was received with great joy by the good woman of the house who told her she was but just come in and was preparing to attend her in high holborn o mrs smith said she as soon as she saw her did you not think i was run away you dont know what i have suffered since i saw you i have been in a prisonarrested for debts i owe not but thank god i am here will your maid i have forgot her name already catharine madam will you let catharine assist me to bed i have not had my clothes off since thursday night what she further said the fellow heard not she leaning upon the maid and going up stairs but dost thou not observe what a strange what an uncommon openness of heart reigns in this lady she had been in a prison she said before a stranger in the shop and before the maidservant and so probably she would have said had there been twenty people in the shop the disgrace she cannot hide from herself as she says in her letter to lady betty she is not solicitous to conceal from the world but this makes it evident to me that she is resolved to keep no terms with thee and yet to be able to put up such a prayer for thee as she did in her prison i will often mention the prisonroom to tease thee does this not show that revenge has very little sway in her mind though she can retain so much proper resentment and this is another excellence in this admirable womans character for whom before her have we met with in the whole sex or in ours either that knew how in practice to distinguish between revenge and resentment for base and ungrateful treatment tis a cursed thing after all that such a woman as this should be treated as she has been treated hadst thou been a king and done as thou hast done by such a meritorious innocent i believe in my heart it would have been adjudged to be a national sin and the sword the pestilence or famine must have atoned for it but as thou art a private man thou wilt certainly meet with thy punishment besides what thou mayest expect from the justice of the country and the vengeance of her friends as she will her reward hereafter it must be so if there be really such a thing as future remuneration as now i am more and more convinced there must else what a hard fate is hers whose punishment to all appearance has so much exceeded her fault and as to thine how can temporary burnings wert thou by some accident to be consumed in thy bed expiate for thy abominable vileness to her in breach of all obligations moral and divine i was resolved to lose no time in having every thing which belonged to the lady at the cursed womans sent her accordingly i took coach to smiths and procured the lady to whom i sent up my compliments and inquiries how she bore her removal ill as she sent down word she was to give proper direction to mrs smith whom i took with me to sinclairs and who saw every thing looked out and put into the trunks and boxes they were first brought in and carried away in two coaches had i not been there sally and polly would each of them have taken to herself something of the poor ladys spoils this they declared and i had some difficulty to get from sally a fine brusselslace head which she had the confidence to say she would wear for miss harlowes sake nor should either i or mrs smith have known she had got it had she not been in search of the ruffles belonging to it my resentment on this occasion and the conversation which mrs smith and i had in which i not only expatiated on the merits of the lady but expressed my concern for her sufferings though i left her room to suppose her married yet without averring it gave me high credit with the good woman so that we are perfectly well acquainted already by which means i shall be enabled to give you accounts from time to time of all that passes and which i will be very industrious to do provided i may depend upon the solemn promises i have given the lady in your name as well as in my own that she shall be free from all personal molestation from you and thus shall i have it in my power to return in kind your writing favours and preserve my shorthand besides which till this correspondence was opened i had pretty much neglected i ordered the abandoned women to make out your account they answered that they would do it with a vengeance indeed they breathe nothing but vengeance for now they say you will assuredly marry and your example will be followed by all your friends and companions as the old one says to the utter ruin of her poor house letter xix mr belford to robert lovelace esq tuesday morn july six oclock having sat up so late to finish and seal in readiness my letter to the above period i am disturbed before i wished to have risen by the arrival of thy second fellow man and horse in a foam while he baits i will write a few lines most heartily to congratulate thee on thy expected rage and impatience and on thy recovery of mental feeling how much does the idea thou givest me of thy deserved torments by thy upright awls bodkins pins and packingneedles by thy rolling hogshead with iron spikes and by thy macerated sides delight me i will upon every occasion that offers drive more spikes into thy hogshead and roll thee down hill and up as thou recoverest to sense or rather returnest back to senselessness thou knowest therefore the terms on which thou art to enjoy my correspondence am not i who have all along and in time protested against thy barbarous and ungrateful perfidies to a woman so noble entitled to drive remorse if possible into thy hithertocallous heart only let me repeat one thing which perhaps i mentioned too slightly before that the lady was determined to remove to new lodgings where neither you nor i should be able to find her had i not solemnly assured her that she might depend upon being free from your visits these assurances i thought i might give her not only because of your promise but because it is necessary for you to know where she is in order to address yourself to her by your friends enable me therefore to make good to her this my solemn engagement or adieu to all friendship at least to all correspondence with thee for ever j belford letter xx mr belford to robert lovelace esq tuesday july afternoon i renewed my inquiries after the ladys health in the morning by my servant and as soon as i had dined i went myself i had but a poor account of it yet sent up my compliments she returned me thanks for all my good offices and her excuses that they could not be personal just then being very low and faint but if i gave myself the trouble of coming about six this evening she should be able she hoped to drink a dish of tea with me and would then thank me herself i am very proud of this condescension and think it looks not amiss for you as i am your avowed friend methinks i want fully to remove from her mind all doubts of you in this last villanous action and who knows then what your noble relations may be able to do for you with her if you hold your mind for your servant acquainted me with their having actually engaged miss howe in their and your favour before this cursed affair happened and i desire the particulars of all from yourself that i may the better know how to serve you she has two handsome apartments a bedchamber and diningroom with light closets in each she has already a nurse the people of the house having but one maid a woman whose care diligence and honesty mrs smith highly commends she has likewise the benefit of a widow gentlewoman mrs lovick her name who lodges over her apartment and of whom she seems very fond having found something in her she thinks resembling the qualities of her worthy mrs norton about seven oclock this morning it seems the lady was so ill that she yielded to their desires to have an apothecary sent for not the fellow thou mayest believe she had had before at rowlands but one mr goddard a man of skill and eminence and of conscience too demonstrated as well by general character as by his prescriptions to this lady for pronouncing her case to be grief he ordered for the present only innocent juleps by way of cordial and as soon as her stomach should be able to bear it light kitchendiet telling mrs lovick that that with air moderate exercise and cheerful company would do her more good than all the medicines in his shop this has given me as it seems it has the lady who also praises his modest behaviour paternal looks and genteel address a very good opinion of the man and i design to make myself acquainted with him and if he advises to call in a doctor to wish him for the fair patients sake more than the physicians who wants not practice my worthy friend dr h whose character is above all exception as his humanity i am sure will distinguish him to the lady mrs lovick gratified me with an account of a letter she had written from the ladys mouth to miss howe she being unable to write herself with steadiness it was to this effect in answer it seems to her two letters whatever were the contents of them that she had been involved in a dreadful calamity which she was sure when known would exempt her from the effects of her friendly displeasure for not answering her first having been put under an arrest could she have believed it that she was released but the day before and was now so weak and so low that she was obliged to account thus for her silence to her miss howes two letters of the th and th that she would as soon as able answer them begged of her mean time not to be uneasy for her since only that this was a calamity which came upon her when she was far from being well a load laid upon the shoulders of a poor wretch ready before to sink under too heavy a burden it was nothing to the evil she had before suffered and one felicity seemed likely to issue from it which was that she would be at rest in an honest house with considerate and kindhearted people having assurance given her that she should not be molested by the wretch whom it would be death for her to see so that now she miss howe needed not to send to her by private and expensive conveyances nor need collins to take precautions for fear of being dogged to her lodgings nor need she write by a fictitious name to her but by her own you can see i am in a way to oblige you you see how much she depends upon my engaging for your forbearing to intrude yourself into her company let not your flaming impatience destroy all and make me look like a villain to a lady who has reason to suspect every man she sees to be so upon this condition you may expect all the services that can flow from your sincere wellwisher j belford letter xxi mr belford to robert lovelace esq tuesday night july i am just come from the lady i was admitted into the diningroom where she was sitting in an elbowchair in a very weak and low way she made an effort to stand up when i entered but was forced to keep her seat youll excuse me mr belford i ought to rise to thank you for all your kindness to me i was to blame to be so loth to leave that sad place for i am in heaven here to what i was there and good people about me too i have not had good people about me for a long long time before so that with a halfsmile i had begun to wonder whither they were all gone her nurse and mrs smith who were present took occasion to retire and when we were alone you seem to be a person of humanity sir said she you hinted as i was leaving my prison that you were not a stranger to my sad story if you know it truly you must know that i have been most barbarously treated and have not deserved it at the mans hands by whom i have suffered i told her i knew enough to be convinced that she had the merit of a saint and the purity of an angel and was proceeding when she said no flighty compliments no undue attributes sir i offered to plead for my sincerity and mentioned the word politeness and would have distinguished between that and flattery nothing can be polite said she that is not just whatever i may have had i have now no vanity to gratify i disclaimed all intentions of compliment all i had said and what i should say was and should be the effect of sincere veneration my unhappy friends account of her had entitled her to that i then mentioned your grief your penitence your resolutions of making her all the amends that were possible now to be made her and in the most earnest manner i asserted your innocence as to the last villanous outrage her answer was to this effect it is painful to me to think of him the amends you talk of cannot be made this last violence you speak of is nothing to what preceded it that cannot be atoned for nor palliated this may and i shall not be sorry to be convinced that he cannot be guilty of so very low a wickednessyet after his vile forgeries of hands after his baseness in imposing upon me the most infamous persons as ladies of honour of his own family what are the iniquities he is not capable of i would then have given her an account of the trial you stood with your friends your own previous resolutions of marriage had she honoured you with the requested four words all your familys earnestness to have the honour of her alliance and the application of your two cousins to miss howe by general consent for that young ladys interest with her but having just touched upon these topics she cut me short saying that was a cause before another tribunal miss howes letters to her were upon the subject and as she would write her thoughts to her as soon as she was able i then attempted more particularly to clear you of having any hand in the vile sinclairs officious arrest a point she had the generosity to wish you cleared of and having mentioned the outrageous letter you had written to me on this occasion she asked if i had that letter about me i owned i had she wished to see it this puzzled me horribly for you must needs think that most of the free things which among us rakes pass for wit and spirit must be shocking stuff to the ears or eyes of persons of delicacy of that sex and then such an air of levity runs through thy most serious letters such a false bravery endeavouring to carry off ludicrously the subjects that most affect thee that those letters are generally the least fit to be seen which ought to be most to thy credit something like this i observed to her and would fain have excused myself from showing it but she was so earnest that i undertook to read some parts of it resolving to omit the most exceptionable i know thoult curse me for that but i thought it better to oblige her than to be suspected myself and so not have it in my power to serve thee with her when so good a foundation was laid for it and when she knows as bad of thee as i can tell her thou rememberest the contents i suppose of thy furious letter her remarks upon the different parts of it which i read to her were to the following effect see letter xii of this volume upon the last two lines all undone undone by jupiter zounds jack what shall i do now a curse upon all my plots and contrivances thus she expressed herself o how light how unaffected with the sense of its own crimes is the heart that could dictate to the pen this libertine froth the paragraph which mentions the vile arrest affected her a good deal in the next i omitted thy curse upon thy relations whom thou wert gallanting and read on the seven subsequent paragraphs down to thy execrable wish which was too shocking to read to her what i read produced the following reflections from her the plots and contrivances which he curses and the exultings of the wicked wretches on finding me out show me that all his guilt was premeditated nor doubt i that his dreadful perjuries and inhuman arts as he went along were to pass for fine stratagems for witty sport and to demonstrate a superiority of inventive talents o my cruel cruel brother had it not been for thee i had not been thrown upon so pernicious and so despicable a plotter but proceed sir pray proceed at that part canst thou o fatal prognosticator tell me where my punishment will end she sighed and when i came to that sentence praying for my reformation perhaps is that there said she sighing again wretched man and shed a tear for thee by my faith lovelace i believe she hates thee not she has at least a concern a generous concern for thy future happiness what a noble creature hast thou injured she made a very severe reflection upon me on reading the words on your knees for me beg her pardon you had all your lessons sir said she when you came to redeem me you was so condescending as to kneel i thought it was the effect of your own humanity and goodnatured earnestness to serve me excuse me sir i knew not that it was in consequence of a prescribed lesson this concerned me not a little i could not bear to be thought such a wretched puppet such a joseph leman such a tomlinson i endeavoured therefore with some warmth to clear myself of this reflection and she again asked my excuse i was avowedly she said the friend of a man whose friendship she had reason to be sorry to say was no credit to any body and desired me to proceed i did but fared not much better afterwards for on that passage where you say i had always been her friend and advocate this was her unanswerable remark i find sir by this expression that he had always designs against me and that you all along knew that he had would to heaven you had had the goodness to have contrived some way that might not have endangered your own safety to give me notice of his baseness since you approved not of it but you gentlemen i suppose had rather see an innocent fellowcreature ruined than be thought capable of an action which however generous might be likely to loosen the bands of a wicked friendship after this severe but just reflection i would have avoided reading the following although i had unawares begun the sentence but she held me to it what would i now give had i permitted you to have been a successful advocate and this was her remark upon it so sir you see if you had been the happy means of preventing the evils designed me you would have had your friends thanks for it when he came to his consideration this satisfaction i am persuaded every one in the long run will enjoy who has the virtue to withstand or prevent a wicked purpose i was obliged i see to your kind wishes but it was a point of honour with you to keep his secret the more indispensable with you perhaps the viler the secret yet permit me to wish mr belford that you were capable of relishing the pleasures that arise to a benevolent mind from virtuous friendship none other is worthy of the sacred name you seem an humane man i hope for your own sake you will one day experience the difference and when you do think of miss howe and clarissa harlowe i find you know much of my sad story who were the happiest creatures on earth in each others friendship till this friend of yours and there she stopt and turned from me where thou callest thyself a villanous plotter to take a crime to himself said she without shame o what a hardened wretch is this man on that passage where thou sayest let me know how she has been treated if roughly woe be to the guilty this was her remark with an air of indignation what a man is your friend sir is such a one as he to set himself up to punish the guilty all the rough usage i could receive from them was infinitely less and there she stopt a moment or two then proceeding and who shall punish him what an assuming wretch nobody but himself is entitled to injure the innocent he is i suppose on the earth to act the part which the malignant fiend is supposed to act below dealing out punishments at his pleasure to every inferior instrument of mischief what thought i have i been doing i shall have this savage fellow think i have been playing him booty in reading part of his letter to this sagacious lady yet if thou art angry it can only in reason be at thyself for who would think i might not communicate to her some of thy sincerity in exculpating thyself from a criminal charge which thou wrotest to thy friend to convince him of thy innocence but a bad heart and a bad cause are confounded things and so let us put it to its proper account i passed over thy charge to me to curse them by the hour and thy names of dragon and serpents though so applicable since had i read them thou must have been supposed to know from the first what creatures they were vile fellow as thou wert for bringing so much purity among them and i closed with thy own concluding paragraph a line a line a kingdom for a line c however telling her since she saw that i omitted some sentences that there were farther vehemences in it but as they were better fitted to show to me the sincerity of the writer than for so delicate an ear as hers to hear i chose to pass them over you have read enough said she he is a wicked wicked man i see he intended to have me in his power at any rate and i have no doubt of what his purposes were by what his actions have been you know his vile tomlinson i suppose you know but what signifies talking never was there such a premeditated false heart in man nothing can be truer thought i what has he not vowed what has he not invented and all for what only to ruin a poor young creature whom he ought to have protected and whom he had first deceived of all other protection she arose and turned from me her handkerchief at her eyes and after a pause came towards me again i hope said she i talk to a man who has a better heart and i thank you sir for all your kind though ineffectual pleas in my favour formerly whether the motives for them were compassion or principle or both that they were ineffectual might very probably be owing to your want of earnestness and that as you might think to my want of merit i might not in your eye deserve to be saved i might appear to you a giddy creature who had run away from her true and natural friends and who therefore ought to take the consequence of the lot she had drawn i was afraid for thy sake to let her know how very earnest i had been but assured her that i had been her zealous friend and that my motives were founded upon a merit that i believed was never equaled that however indefensible mr lovelace was he had always done justice to her virtue that to a full conviction of her untainted honour it was owing that he so earnestly desired to call so inestimable a jewel his and was proceeding when she again cut me short enough and too much of this subject sir if he will never more let me behold his face that is all i have now to ask of him indeed indeed clasping her hands i never will if i can by any means not criminally desperate avoid it what could i say for thee there was no room however at that time to touch this string again for fear of bringing upon myself a prohibition not only of the subject but of ever attending her again i gave some distant intimations of moneymatters i should have told thee when i read to her that passage where thou biddest me force what sums upon her i can get her to take she repeated no no no no several times with great quickness and i durst no more than just intimate it again and that so darkly as left her room to seem not to understand me indeed i know not the person man or woman i should be so much afraid of disobliging or incurring a censure from as from her she has so much true dignity in her manner without pride or arrogance which in those who have either one is tempted to mortify such a piercing eye yet softened so sweetly with rays of benignity that she commands all ones reverence methinks i have a kind of holy love for this angel of a woman and it is matter of astonishment to me that thou couldst converse with her a quarter of an hour together and hold thy devilish purposes guarded as she was by piety prudence virtue dignity family fortune and a purity of heart that never woman before her boasted what a real devil must he be yet i doubt i shall make thee proud who could resolve to break through so many fences for my own part i am more and more sensible that i ought not to have contented myself with representing against and expostulating with thee upon thy base intentions and indeed i had it in my head more than once to try to do something for her but wretch that i was i was withheld by notions of false honour as she justly reproached me because of thy own voluntary communications to me of thy purposes and then as she was brought into such a cursed house and was so watched by thyself as well as by thy infernal agents i thought knowing my man that i should only accelerate the intended mischiefs moreover finding thee so much overawed by her virtue that thou hadst not at thy first carrying her thither the courage to attempt her and that she had more than once without knowing thy base views obliged thee to abandon them and to resolve to do her justice and thyself honour i hardly doubted that her merit would be triumphant at last it is my opinion if thou holdest thy purposes to marry that thou canst not do better than to procure thy real aunts and thy real cousins to pay her a visit and to be thy advocates but if they decline personal visits letters from them and from my lord m supported by miss howes interest may perhaps effect something in thy favour but these are only my hopes founded on what i wish for thy sake the lady i really think would choose death rather than thee and the two women are of opinion though they knew not half of what she has suffered that her heart is actually broken at taking my leave i tendered my best services to her and besought her to permit me frequently to inquire after her health she made me no answer but by bowing her head letter xxii mr belford to robert lovelace esq wednesday july this morning i took a chair to smiths and being told that the lady had a very bad night but was up i sent for her worthy apothecary who on his coming to me approving of my proposal of calling in dr h i bid the woman acquaint her with the designed visit it seems she was at first displeased yet withdrew her objection but after a pause asked them what she should do she had effects of value some of which she intended as soon as she could to turn into money but till then had not a single guinea to give the doctor for his fee mrs lovick said she had five guineas by her they were at her service she would accept of three she said if she would take that pulling a diamond ring from her finger till she repaid her but on no other terms having been told i was below with mr goddard she desired to speak one word with me before she saw the doctor she was sitting in an elbowchair leaning her head on a pillow mrs smith and the widow on each side her chair her nurse with a phial of hartshorn behind her in her own hand her salts raising her head at my entrance she inquired if the doctor knew mr lovelace i told her no and that i believed you never saw him in your life was the doctor my friend he was and a very worthy and skilful man i named him for his eminence in his profession and mr goddard said he knew not a better physician i have but one condition to make before i see the gentleman that he refuse not his fees from me if i am poor sir i am proud i will not be under obligation you may believe sir i will not i suffer this visit because i would not appear ungrateful to the few friends i have left nor obstinate to such of my relations as may some time hence for their private satisfaction inquire after my behaviour in my sick hours so sir you know the condition and dont let me be vexed i am very ill and cannot debate the matter seeing her so determined i told her if it must be so it should then sir the gentleman may come but i shall not be able to answer many questions nurse you can tell him at the window there what a night i have had and how i have been for two days past and mr goddard if he be here can let him know what i have taken pray let me be as little questioned as possible the doctor paid his respects to her with the gentlemanly address for which he is noted and she cast up her sweet eyes to him with that benignity which accompanies her every graceful look i would have retired but she forbid it he took her hand the lily not of so beautiful a white indeed madam you are very low said he but give me leave to say that you can do more for yourself than all the faculty can do for you he then withdrew to the window and after a short conference with the women he turned to me and to mr goddard at the other window we can do nothing here speaking low but by cordials and nourishment what friends has the lady she seems to be a person of condition and ill as she is a very fine womana single lady i presume i whisperingly told him she was that there were extraordinary circumstances in her case as i would have apprized him had i met with him yesterday that her friends were very cruel to her but that she could not hear them named without reproaching herself though they were much more to blame than she i knew i was right said the doctor a lovecase mr goddard a lovecase mr belford there is one person in the world who can do her more service than all the faculty mr goddard said he had apprehended her disorder was in her mind and had treated her accordingly and then told the doctor what he had done which he approving of again taking her charming hand said my good young lady you will require very little of our assistance you must in a great measure be your own assistance you must in a great measure be your own doctress come dear madam forgive me the familiar tenderness your aspect commands love as well as reverence and a father of children some of them older than yourself may be excused for his familiar address cheer up your spirits resolve to do all in your power to be well and youll soon grow better you are very kind sir said she i will take whatever you direct my spirits have been hurried i shall be better i believe before i am worse the care of my good friends here looking at the women shall not meet with an ungrateful return the doctor wrote he would fain have declined his fee as her malady he said was rather to be relieved by the soothings of a friend than by the prescriptions of a physician he should think himself greatly honoured to be admitted rather to advise her in the one character than to prescribe to her in the other she answered that she should be always glad to see so humane a man that his visits would keep her in charity with his sex but that where sic she able to forget that he was her physician she might be apt to abate of the confidence in his skill which might be necessary to effect the amendment that was the end of his visits and when he urged her still further which he did in a very polite manner and as passing by the door two or three times a day she said she should always have pleasure in considering him in the kind light he offered himself to her that that might be very generous in one person to offer which would be as ungenerous in another to accept that indeed she was not at present high in circumstance and he saw by the tender which he must accept of that she had greater respect to her own convenience than to his merit or than to the pleasure she should take in his visits we all withdrew together and the doctor and mr goddard having a great curiosity to know something more of her story at the motion of the latter we went into a neighbouring coffeehouse and i gave them in confidence a brief relation of it making all as light for you as i could and yet youll suppose that in order to do but common justice to the ladys character heavy must be that light three oclock afternoon i just now called again at smiths and am told she is somewhat better which she attributed to the soothings of her doctor she expressed herself highly pleased with both gentlemen and said that their behaviour to her was perfectly paternal paternal poor ladynever having been till very lately from under her parents wings and now abandoned by all her friends she is for finding out something paternal and maternal in every one the latter qualities in mrs lovick and mrs smith to supply to herself the father and mother her dutiful heart pants after mrs smith told me that after we were gone she gave the keys of her trunk and drawers to her and the widow lovick and desired them to take an inventory of them which they did in her presence they also informed me that she had requested them to find her a purchaser for two rich dressed suits one never worn the other not above once or twice this shocked me exceedingly perhaps it may thee a little her reason for so doing she told them was that she should never live to wear them that her sister and other relations were above wearing them that her mother would not endure in her sight any thing that was hers that she wanted the money that she would not be obliged to any body when she had effects by her for which she had no occasion and yet said she i expect not that they will fetch a price answerable to their value they were both very much concerned as they owned and asked my advice upon it and the richness of her apparel having given them a still higher notion of her rank than they had before they supposed she must be of quality and again wanted to know her story i told them that she was indeed a woman of family and fortune i still gave them room to suppose her married but left it to her to tell them all in her own time and manner all i would say was that she had been very vilely treated deserved it not and was all innocence and purity you may suppose that they both expressed their astonishment that there could be a man in the world who could ill treat so fine a creature as to the disposing of the two suits of apparel i told mrs smith that she should pretend that upon inquiry she had found a friend who would purchase the richest of them but that she might not mistrust would stand upon a good bargain and having twenty guineas about me i left them with her in part of payment and bid her pretend to get her to part with it for as little more as she could induce her to take i am setting out for edgeware with poor belton more of whom in my next i shall return tomorrow and leave this in readiness for your messenger if he call in my absence adieu letter xxiii mr lovelace to john belford esq in answer to letter xxi of this volume m hall wed night july you might well apprehend that i should think you were playing me booty in communicating my letter to the lady you ask who would think you might not read to her the least exceptionable parts of a letter written in my own defence ill tell you who the man who in the same letter that he asks this question tells the friend whom he exposes to her resentment that there is such an air of levity runs through his most serious letters that those of this are least fit to be seen which ought to be most to his credit and now what thinkest thou of thyselfcondemned folly be however i charge thee more circumspect for the future that so this clumsy error may stand singly by itself it is painful to her to think of me libertine froth so pernicious and so despicable a plotter a man whose friendship is no credit to any body hardened wretch the devils counterpart a wicked wicked man but did she could she dared she to say or imply all this and say it to a man whom she praises for humanity and prefers to myself for that virtue when all the humanity he shows and she knows it too is by my direction so robs me of the credit of my own works admirably entitled all this shows her to thy refinement upon the words resentment and revenge but thou wert always aiming and blundering at some thing thou never couldst make out the praise thou givest to her ingenuousness is another of thy peculiars i think not as thou dost of her telltale recapitulations and exclamations what end can they answer only that thou hast a holy love for her the devil fetch thee for thy oddity or it is extremely provoking to suppose one sees such a charming creature stand upright before a libertine and talk of the sin against her that cannot be forgiven i wish at my heart that these chaste ladies would have a little modesty in their anger it would sound very strange if i robert lovelace should pretend to have more true delicacy in a point that requires the utmost than miss clarissa harlowe i think i will put it into the head of her nurse norton and her miss howe by some one of my agents to chide the dear novice for her proclamations but to be serious let me tell thee that severe as she is and saucy in asking so contemptuously what a man is your friend sir to set himself to punish guilty people i will never forgive the cursed woman who could commit this last horrid violence on so excellent a creature the barbarous insults of the two nymphs in their visits to her the choice of the most execrable den that could be found out in order no doubt to induce her to go back to theirs and the still more execrable attempt to propose to her a man who would pay the debt a snare i make no question laid for her despairing and resenting heart by that devilish sally thinking her no doubt a woman in order to ruin her with me and to provoke me in a fury to give her up to their remorseless cruelty are outrages that to express myself in her style i never can never will forgive but as to thy opinion and the two womens at smiths that her heart is broken that is the true womens language i wonder how thou camest into it thou who hast seen and heard of so many female deaths and revivals ill tell thee what makes against this notion of theirs her time of life and charming constitution the good she ever delighted to do and fancified she was born to do and which she may still continue to do to as high a degree as ever nay higher since i am no sordid varlet thou knowest her religious turn a turn that will always teach her to bear inevitable evils with patience the contemplation upon her last noble triumph over me and over the whole crew and upon her succeeding escape from us all her will unviolated and the inward pride of having not deserved the treatment she has met with how is it possible to imagine that a woman who has all these consolations to reflect upon will die of a broken heart on the contrary i make no doubt but that as she recovers from the dejection into which this last scurvy villany which none but wretches of her own sex could have been guilty of has thrown her returning love will reenter her timepacified mind her thoughts will then turn once more on the conjugal pivot of course she will have livelier notions in her head and these will make her perform all her circumvolutions with ease and pleasure though not with so high a degree of either as if the dear proud rogue could have exalted herself above the rest of her sex as she turned round thou askest on reciting the bitter invectives that the lady made against thy poor friend standing before her i suppose with thy fingers in thy mouth what couldst thou say for me have i not in my former letters suggested an hundred things which a friend in earnest to vindicate or excuse a friend might say on such an occasion but now to current topics and the present state of matters here it is true as my servant told thee that miss howe had engaged before this cursed womans officiousness to use her interest with her friend in my behalf and yet she told my cousins in the visit they made her that it was her opinion that she would never forgive me i send to thee enclosed copies of all that passed on this occasion between my cousins montague miss howe myself lady betty lady sarah and lord m i long to know what miss howe wrote to her friend in order to induce her to marry the despicable plotter the man whose friendship is no credit to any body the wicked wicked man thou hadst the two letters in thy hand had they been in mine the seal would have yielded to the touch of my warm finger perhaps without the help of the postoffice bullet and the folds as other placations have done opened of themselves to oblige my curiosity a wicked omission jack not to contrive to send them down to me by man and horse it might have passed that the messenger who brought the second letter took them both back i could have returned them by another when copied as from miss howe and nobody but myself and thee the wiser thats a charming girl her spirit her delightful spirit not to be married to it how i wish to get that lively bird into my cage how would i make her flutter and fly about till she left a feather upon every wire had i begun there i am confident as i have heretofore said that i should not have had half the difficulty with her as i have had with her charming friend for these passionate girls have high pulses and a clever fellow may make what sport he pleases with their unevenness now too high now too low you need only to provoke and appease them by turns to bear with them and to forbear to tease and ask pardon and sometimes to give yourself the merit of a sufferer from them then catching them in the moment of concession conscious of their ill usage of you they are all your own see vol vi letter vii but these sedate contemplative girls never out of temper but with reason when that reason is given them hardly ever pardon or afford you another opportunity to offend it was in part the apprehension that this would be so with my dear miss harlowe that made me carry her to a place where i believed she would be unable to escape me although i were not to succeed in my first attempts else widow sorlingss would have been as well for me as widow sinclairs for early i saw that there was no credulity in her to graft upon no pretending to whine myself into her confidence she was proof against amorous persuasion she had reason in her love her penetration and good sense made her hate all compliments that had not truth and nature in them what could i have done with her in any other place and yet how long even there was i kept in awe in spite of natural incitement and unnatural instigations as i now think them by the mere force of that native dignity and obvious purity of mind and manners which fill every one with reverence if not with holy love as thou callest it the moment he sees her else thinkest thou not it was easy for me to be a fine gentleman and a delicate lover or at least a specious and flattering one see letter xxi of this volume lady sarah and lady betty finding the treaty upon the success of which they have set their foolish hearts likely to run into length are about departing to their own seats having taken from me the best security the nature of the case will admit of that is to say my word to marry the lady if she will have me and after all methinks thou asked art thou still resolved to repair if reparation be put into thy power why jack i must needs own that my heart has nowandthen some retrograde motions upon thinking seriously of the irrevocable ceremony we do not easily give up the desire of our hearts and what we imagine essential to our happiness let the expectation or hope of compassing it be ever so unreasonable or absurd in the opinion of others recurrings there will be hankerings that will on every butremotelyfavourable incident however before discouraged and beaten back by ill success pop up and abate the satisfaction we should otherwise take in contrariant overtures tis ungentlemanly jack man to man to liebut matrimony i do not heartily love although with a clarissa yet i am in earnest to marry her but i am often thinking that if now this dear creature suffering time and my penitence my relations prayers and miss howes mediation to soften her resentments her revenge thou hast prettily distinguished away and to recall repulsed inclination should consent to meet me at the altar how vain will she then make all thy eloquent periods of execration how many charming interjections of her own will she spoil and what a couple of old patriarchs shall we become going in the millhorse round getting sons and daughters providing nurses for them first governors and governesses next teaching them lessons their fathers never practised nor which their mother as her parents will say was much the better for and at last perhaps when life shall be turned into the dully sober stillness and i become desirous to forget all my past rogueries what comfortable reflections will it afford to find them all revived with equal or probably greater trouble and expense in the persons and manners of so many young lovelaces of the boys and to have the girls run away with varlets perhaps not half so ingenious as myself clumsy fellows as it might happen who could not afford the baggages one excuse for their weakness besides those disgraceful ones of sex and nature o belford who can bear to think of these thingswho at my time of life especially and with such a bias for mischief see letter xviii of this volume of this i am absolutely convinced that if a man ever intends to marry and to enjoy in peace his own reflections and not be afraid retribution or of the consequences of his own example he should never be a rake this looks like conscience dont it belford but being in earnest still as i have said all i have to do in my present uncertainty is to brighten up my faculties by filing off the rust they have contracted by the town smoke a long imprisonment in my close attendance to so little purpose on my fair perverse and to brace up if i can the relaxed fibres of my mind which have been twitched and convulsed like the nerves of some tottering paralytic by means of the tumults she has excited in it that so i may be able to present to her a husband as worthy as i can be of her acceptance or if she reject me be in a capacity to resume my usual gaiety of heart and show others of the misleading sex that i am not discouraged by the difficulties i have met with from this sweet individual of it from endeavouring to make myself as acceptable to them as before in this latter case one tour to france and italy i dare say will do the business miss harlowe will by that time have forgotten all she has suffered from her ungrateful lovelace though it will be impossible that her lovelace should ever forget a woman whose equal he despairs to meet with were he to travel from one end of the world to the other if thou continuest paying off the heavy debts my long letters for so many weeks together have made thee groan under i will endeavour to restrain myself in the desires i have importunate as they are of going to town to throw myself at the feet of my souls beloved policy and honesty both join to strengthen the restraint my own promise and thy engagement have laid me under on this head i would not afresh provoke on the contrary would give time for her resentments to subside that so all that follows may be her own act and deed hickman i have a mortal aversion to that fellow has by a line which i have just now received requested an interview with me on friday at mr dormers as at a common friends does the business he wants to meet me upon require that it should be at a common friends a challenge implied is it not belford i shall not be civil to him i doubt he has been an intermeddler then i envy him on miss howes account for if i have a right notion of this hickman it is impossible that that virago can ever love him every one knows that the mother saucy as the daughter sometimes is crams him down her throat her mother is one of the most violentspirited women in england her late husband could not stand in the matrimonial contention of who should but tipt off the perch in it neither knowing how to yield nor knowing how to conquer a charming encouragement for a man of intrigue when he has reason to believe that the woman he has a view upon has no love for her husband what good principles must that wife have who is kept in against temptation by a sense of her duty and plighted faith where affection has no hold of her prythee lets know very particularly how it fares with poor belton tis an honest fellow something more than his thomasine seems to stick with him thou hast not been preaching to him conscience and reformation hast thou thou shouldest not take liberties with him of this sort unless thou thoughtest him absolutely irrecoverable a man in ill health and cropsick cannot play with these solemn things as thou canst and be neither better nor worse for them repentance jack i have a notion should be set about while a man is in health and spirits whats a man fit for not to begin a new work surely when he is not himself nor master of his faculties hence as i apprehend it is that a deathbed repentance is supposed to be such a precarious and ineffectual thing as to myself i hope i have a great deal of time before me since i intend one day to be a reformed man i have very serious reflections nowandthen yet am i half afraid of the truth of what my charmer once told me that a man cannot repent when he will not to hold it i suppose she meant by fits and starts i have repented a thousand times casting my eye over the two preceding paragraphs i fancy there is something like contradiction in them but i will not reconsider them the subject is a very serious one i dont at present quite understand it but now for one more airy tourville mowbray and myself pass away our time as pleasantly as possibly we can without thee i wish we dont add to lord ms gouty days by the joy we give him this is one advantage as i believe i have elsewhere observed that we maledelinquents in lovematters have of the other sex for while they poor things sit sighing in holes and corners or run to woods and groves to bemoan themselves on their baffled hopes we can rant and roar hunt and hawk and by new loves banish from our hearts all remembrance of the old ones merrily however as we pass our time my reflections upon the injuries done to this noble creature bring a qualm upon my heart very often but i know she will permit me to make her amends after she has plagued me heartily and thats my consolation an honest fellow still clap thy wings and crow jack letter xxiv miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe thursday morn june text error should be july what my dearest creature have been your sufferings what must have been your anguish on so disgraceful an insult committed in the open streets and in the broad day no end i think of the undeserved calamities of a dear soul who had been so unhappily driven and betrayed into the hands of a vile libertine how was i shocked at the receiving of your letter written by another hand and only dictated by you you must be very ill nor is it to be wondered at but i hope it is rather from hurry and surprise and lowness which may be overcome than from a grief given way to which may be attended with effects i cannot bear to think of but whatever you do my dear you must not despond indeed you must not despond hitherto you have been in no fault but despair would be all your own and the worst fault you can be guilty of i cannot bear to look upon another hand instead of yours my dear creature send me a few lines though ever so few in your own hand if possible for they will revive my heart especially if they can acquaint me of your amended health i expect your answer to my letter of the th we all expect it with impatience his relations are persons of so much honour they are so very earnest to rank you among them the wretch is so very penitent every one of his family says he is your own are so implacable your last distress though the consequence of his former

expressed in my letter and those of all his friends you would have complied had it not been for this horrid arrest i will enclose the copy of the letter i wrote to miss montague last tuesday on hearing that nobody knew what was become of you and the answer to it underwritten and signed by lord m lady sarah sadleir and lady betty lawrance as well as by the young ladies and also by the wretch himself i own that i like not the turn of what he has written to me and before i will further interest myself in his favour i have determined to inform myself by a friend from his own mouth of his sincerity and whether his whole inclination be in his request to me exclusive of the wishes of his relations yet my heart rises against him on the supposition that there is the shadow of a reason for such a question the woman miss clarissa harlowe but i think with my mother that marriage is now the only means left to make your future life tolerably easy happy there is no saying his disgraces in that case in the eye of the world itself will be more than yours and to those who know you glorious will be your triumph i am obliged to accompany my mother soon to the isle of wight my aunt harman is

am not what i was when we were inseparable lovers as i may say our views must now be different resolve my dear to make a worthy man happy because a worthy man make you so and so my dearest love for the present adieu adieu my dearest love but i shall soon write again i hope letter xxvi mr belford to robert lovelace esq in answer to letter xxiii of this volume thurday july i read that part of your conclusion to poor belton where you inquire after him and mention how merrily you and the reset pass your time at m hall he fetched a deep sigh you are all very happy were his words i am sorry they were his words for poor fellow he is going very fast change of air he hopes will mend him joined to the cheerful company i have left him in but nothing i dare say will a consuming malady and a consuming mistress to an indulgent keeper are dreadful things to struggle with both together violence must be used to get rid of the latter and yet he has not spirit enough left him to exert himself his house is thomasines house not his he has not been within his doors for a fortnight past vagabonding about from inn to inn entering each for a bait only and staying two or three days without power to remove and hardly knowing which to go to next his malady is within him and he cannot run away from it her boys once he thought them his are sturdy enough to shoulder him in his own house as they pass by him siding with the mother they in a manner expel him and in his absence riot away on the remnant of his broken fortunes as to their mother who was once so tender so submissive so studious to oblige that we all pronounced him happy and his course of life the eligible she is now so termagant so insolent that he cannot contend with her without doing infinite prejudice to his health a brokenspirited defensive hardly a defensive therefore reduced to and this to a heart for so many years waging offensive war not valuing whom the opponent what a reduction now comparing himself to the superannuated lion in the fable kicked in the jaws and laid sprawling by the spurning heel of an ignoble ass i have undertaken his cause he has given me leave yet not without reluctance to put him into possession of his own house and to place in it for him his unhappy sister whom he has hitherto slighted because unhappy it is hard he told me and wept poor fellow when he said it that he cannot be permitted to die quietly in his own house the fruits of blessed keeping these though but lately apprized of her infidelity it now comes out to have been of so long continuance that he has no room to believe the boys to be his yet how fond did he use to be of them to what lovelace shall we attribute the tenderness which a reputed father frequently shows to the children of another man what is that i pray thee which we call nature and natural affection and what has man to boast of as to sagacity and penetration when he is as easily brought to cover and rear and even to love and often to prefer the product of anothers guilt with his wife or mistress as a hen or a goose the eggs and even young of others of their kind nay let me ask if instinct as it is called in the animal creation does not enable them to distinguish their own much more easily than we with our boasted reason and sagacity in this nice particular can do if some men who have wives but of doubtful virtue considered this matter duly i believe their inordinate ardour after gain would be a good deal cooled when they could not be certain though their mates could for whose children they were elbowing bustling griping and perhaps cheating those with whom they have concerns whether friends neighbours or more certain nextofkin by the mothers side however but i will not push this notion so far as it might be carried because if propagated it might be of unsocial or unnatural consequence since women of virtue would perhaps be more liable to suffer by the mistrusts and caprices or badhearted and foolishheaded husbands than those who can screen themselves from detection by arts and hypocrisy to which a woman of virtue cannot have recourse and yet were this notion duly and generally considered it might be attended with no bad effects as good education good inclinations and established virtue would be the principallysoughtafter qualities and not money when a man not biased by mere personal attractions was looking round him for a partner in his fortunes and for a mother of his future children which are to be the heirs of his possessions and to enjoy the fruits of his industry but to return to poor belton if i have occasion for your assistance and that of our compeers in reinstating the poor fellow i will give you notice mean time i have just now been told that thomasine declares she will not stir for it seems she suspects that measures will be fallen upon to make her quit she is mrs belton she says and will prove her marriage if she would give herself these airs in his lifetime what would she attempt to do after his death her boy threatens any body who shall presume to insult their mother their father as they call poor belton they speak of as an unnatural one and their probably true father is for ever there hostilely there passing for her cousin as usual now her protecting cousin hardly ever i dare say was there a keeper that did not make keeperess who lavished away on her keptfellow what she obtained from the extravagant folly of him who kept her i will do without you if i can the case will be only as i conceive that like of the ancient sarmatians their wives then in possession of their slaves so that they had to contend not only with those wives conscious of their infidelity and with their slaves but with the children of those slaves grown up to manhood resolute to defend their mothers and their longmanumitted fathers but the noble sarmatians scorning to attack their slaves with equal weapons only provided themselves with the same sort of whips with which they used formerly to chastise them and attacking them with them the miscreants fled before them in memory of which to this day the device on the coin in novogrod in russia a city of the antient sarmatia is a man on horseback with a whip in his hand the poor fellow takes it ill that you did not press him more than you did to be of your party at m hall it is owing to mowbray he is sure that he had so very slight an invitation from one whose invitations used to be so warm mowbrays speech to him he says he never will forgive why tom said the brutal fellow with a curse thou droopest like a pip or roupcloaking chicken thou shouldst grow perter or submit to a solitary quarantine if thou wouldst not infect the whole brood for my own part only that this poor fellow is in distress as well in his affairs as in his mind or i should be sick of you all such is the relish i have of the conversation and such my admiration of the deportment and sentiments of this divine lady that i would forego a month even of thy company to be admitted into hers but for one hour and i am highly in conceit with myself greatly as i used to value thine for being able spontaneously as i may say to make this preference it is after all a devilish life we have lived and to consider how it all ends in a very few years to see to what a state of ill health this poor fellow is so soon reduced and then to observe how every one of ye run away from the unhappy being as rats from a falling house is fine comfort to help a man to look back upon companions illchosen and a life misspent it will be your turns byandby every man of ye if the justice of your country interpose not thou art the only rake we have herded with if thou wilt not except thyself who hast preserved entire thy health and thy fortunes mowbray indeed is indebted to a robust constitution that he has not yet suffered in his health but his estate is dwindled away year by year threefourths of tourvilles very considerable fortunes are already dissipated and the remaining fourth will probably soon go after the other three poor belton we see how it is with him his own felicity is that he will hardly live to want thou art too proud and too prudent ever to be destitute and to do thee justice hath a spirit to assist such of thy friends as may be reduced and wilt if thou shouldest then be living but i think thou must much sooner than thou imaginest be called to thy account knocked on the head perhaps by the friends of those whom thou hast injured for if thou escapest this fate from the harlowe family thou wilt go on tempting danger and vengeance till thou meetest with vengeance and this whether thou marriest or not for the nuptial life will not i doubt till age join with it cure thee of that spirit for intrigue which is continually running away with thee in spite of thy better sense and transitory resolutions well then i will suppose thee laid down quietly among thy worthier ancestors and now let me look forward to the ends of tourville and mowbray belton will be crumbled into dust before thee perhaps supposing thy early exit has saved thee from gallows intervention reduced probably by riotous waste to consequential want behold them refuged in some obscene hole or garret obliged to the careless care of some dirty old woman whom nothing but her poverty prevails upon to attend to perform the last offices for men who have made such shocking ravage among the young ones then how miserably will they whine through squeaking organs their big voices turned into puling pitybegging lamentations their nowoffensive paws how helpless then their nowerect necks then denying support to their aching heads those globes of mischief dropping upon their quaking shoulders then what wry faces will they make their hearts and their heads reproaching each other distended their parched mouths sunk their unmuscled cheeks dropt their under jaws each grunting like the swine he had resembled in his life oh what a vile wretch have i been oh that i had my life to come over again confessing to the poor old woman who cannot shrive them imaginary ghosts of deflowered virgins and polluted matrons flitting before their glassy eyes and old satan to their apprehensions grinning behind a lookingglass held up before them to frighten them with the horror visible in their own countenances for my own part if i can get some good family to credit me with a sister or daughter as i have now an increased fortune which will enable me to propose handsome settlements i will desert ye all marry and live a life of reason rather than a life of a brute for the time to come letter xxvii mr belford to robert lovelace esq thursday night i was forced to take back my twenty guineas how the women managed it i cant tell i suppose they too readily found a purchaser for the rich suit but she mistrusted that i was the advancer of the money and would not let the clothes go but mrs lovick has actually sold for fifteen guineas some rich lace worth three times the sum out of which she repaid her the money she borrowed for fees to the doctor in an illness occasioned by the barbarity of the most savage of men thou knowest his name the doctor called on her in the morning it seems and had a short debate with her about fees she insisted that he should take one every time he came write or not write mistrusting that he only gave verbal directions to mrs lovick or the nurse to avoid taking any he said that it would be impossible for him had he not been a physician to forbear inquiries after the health and welfare of so excellent a person he had not the thought of paying her a compliment in declining the offered fee but he knew her case could not so suddenly vary as to demand his daily visits she must permit him therefore to inquire of the women below after her health and he must not think of coming up if he were to be pecuniarily rewarded for the satisfaction he was so desirous to give himself it ended in a compromise for a fee each other time which she unwillingly submitted to telling him that though she was at present desolate and in disgrace yet her circumstances were of right high and no expenses could rise so as to be scrupled whether she lived or died but she submitted she added to the compromise in hopes to see him as often as he had opportunity for she really looked upon him and mr goddard from their kind and tender treatment of her with a regard next to filial i hope thou wilt make thyself acquainted with this worthy doctor when thou comest to town and give him thy thanks for putting her into conceit with the sex that thou hast given her so much reason to execrate farewell letter xxviii mr lovelace to john belford esq m hall friday july just returned from an interview with this hickman a precise fop of a fellow as starched as his ruffles thou knowest i love him not jack and whom we love not we cannot allow a merit to perhaps not the merit they should be granted however i am in earnest when i say that he seems to me to be so set so prim so affected so mincing yet so clouterly in his person that i dare engage for thy opinion if thou dost justice to him and to thyself that thou never beheldest such another except in a pierglass ill tell thee how i playd him off he came in his own chariot to dormers and we took a turn in the garden at his request he was devilish ceremonious and made a bushel of apologies for the freedom he was going to take and after half a hundred hums and haws told me that he came that he came to wait on me at the request of dear miss howe on the account on the account of miss harlowe well sir speak on said i but give me leave to say that if your book be as long as your preface it will take up a week to read it this was pretty rough thoult say but theres nothing like balking these formalities at first when they are put out of their road they are filled with doubts of themselves and can never get into it again so that an honest fellow impertinently attacked as i was has all the game in his own hand quite through the conference he stroked his chin and hardly knew what to say at last after parenthesis within parenthesis apologizing for apologies in imitation i suppose of swifts digression in praise of digressions i presume i presume sir you were privy to the visit made to miss howe by the young ladies your cousins in the name of lord m and lady sarah sadleir and lady betty lawrance i was sir and miss howe had a letter afterwards signed by his lordship and by those ladies and underwritten by myself have you seen it sir i cant say but i have it is the principal cause of this visit for miss howe thinks your part of it is written with such an air of levity pardon me sir that she knows not whether you are in earnest or not in your address to her for her interest to her friend see mr lovelaces billet to miss howe letter xiv of this volume will miss howe permit me to explain myself in person to her mr hickman o sir by no means miss howe i am sure would not give you that trouble i should not think it a trouble i will most readily attend you sir to miss howe and satisfy her in all her scruples come sir i will wait upon you now you have a chariot are alone we can talk as we ride he hesitated wriggled winced stroked his ruffles set his wig and pulled his neckcloth which was long enough for a bib i am not going directly back to miss howe sir it will be as well if you will be so good as to satisfy miss howe by me what is it she scruples mr hickman why sir miss howe observes that in your part of the letter you say but let me see sir i have a copy of what you wrote pulling it out will you give me leave sir thus you begin dear miss howe no offence i hope mr hickman none in the least sir none at all sir taking aim as it were to read do you use spectacles mr hickman spectacles sir his whole broad face lifted up at me spectacles what makes you ask me such a question such a young man as i use spectacles sir they do in spain mr hickman young as well as old to save their eyes have you ever read priors alma mr hickman i have sir custom is every thing in nations as well as with individuals i know the meaning of your question but tis not the english custom was you ever in spain mr hickman no sir i have been in holland in holland sir never to france or italy i was resolved to travel with him into the land of puzzledom no sir i cannot say i have as yet thats a wonder sir when on the continent i went on a particular affair i was obliged to return soon well sir you was going to read pray be pleased to proceed again he took aim as if his eyes were older than the rest of him and read after what is written above and signed by names and characters of such unquestionable honour to be sure taking off his eye nobody questions the honour of lord m nor that of the good ladies who signed the letter i hope mr hickman nobody questions mine neither if you please sir i will read on i might have been excused signing a name almost as hateful to myself you are pleased to say as i know it is to you well mr hickman i must interrupt you at this place in what i wrote to miss howe i distinguished the word know i had a reason for it miss howe has been very free with my character i have never done her any harm i take it very ill of her and i hope sir you come in her name to make excuses for it miss howe sir is a very polite young lady she is not accustomed to treat any mans character unbecomingly then i have the more reason to take it amiss mr hickman why sir you know the friendship no friendship should warrant such freedoms as miss howe has taken with my character i believed he began to wish he had not come near me he seemed quite disconcerted have you not heard miss howe treat my name with great sir i come not to offend or affront you but you know what a love there is between miss howe and miss harlowe i doubt sir you have not treated miss harlowe as so fine a young lady deserved to be treated and if love for her friend has made miss howe take freedoms as you call them a mind not ungenerous on such an occasion will rather be sorry for having given the cause than i know your consequence sir but id rather have this reproof from a lady than from a gentleman i have a great desire to wait upon miss howe i am persuaded we should soon come to a good understanding generous minds are always of kin i know we should agree in every thing pray mr hickman be so kind as to introduce me to miss howe sir i can signify your desire if you please to miss howe do so be pleased to read on mr hickman he did very formally as if i remembered not what i had written and when he came to the passage about the halter the parson and the hangman reading it why sir says he does not this look like a jest miss howe thinks it does it is not in the ladys power you know sir to doom you to the gallows then if it were mr hickman you think she would you say here to miss howe proceeded he that miss harlowe is the most injured of her sex i know from miss howe that she highly resents the injuries you own insomuch that miss howe doubts that she shall never prevail upon her to overlook them and as your family are all desirous you should repair her wrongs and likewise desire miss howes interposition with her friend miss howe fears from this part of your letter that you are too much in jest and that your offer to do her justice is rather in compliment to your friends entreaties than proceeding form your own inclinations and she desires to know your true sentiments on this occasion before she interposes further do you think mr hickman that if i am capable of deceiving my own relations i have so much obligation to miss howe who has always treated me with great freedom as to acknowledge to her what i dont to them sir i beg pardon but miss howe thinks that as you have written to her she may ask you by me for an explanation of what you have written you see mr hickman something of me do you think i am in jest or in earnest i see sir you are a gay gentleman of fine spirits and all that all i beg in miss howes name is to know if you really and bon fide join with your friends in desiring her to use her interest to reconcile you to miss harlowe i should be extremely glad to be reconciled to miss harlowe and should owe great obligations to miss howe if she could bring about so happy an event well sir and you have no objections to marriage i presume as the condition of that reconciliation i never liked matrimony in my life i must be plain with you mr hickman i am sorry for it i think it a very happy state i hope you will find it so mr hickman i doubt not but i shall sir and i dare say so would you if you were to have miss harlowe if i could be happy in it with any body it would be with miss harlowe i am surprised sirthen after all you dont think of marrying miss harloweafter the hard usage what hard usage mr hickman i dont doubt but a lady of her niceness has represented what would appear trifles to any other in a very strong light if what i have had hinted to me sir excuse me had been offered to the lady she has more than trifles to complain of let me know what you have heard mr hickman i will very truly answer to the accusations sir you know best what you have done you own the lady is the most injured as well as the most deserving of her sex i do sir and yet i would be glad to know what you have heard for on that perhaps depends my answer to the questions miss howe puts to me by you why then sir since you ask it you cannot be displeased if i answer you in the first place sir you will acknowledge i suppose that you promised miss harlowe marriage and all that well sir and i suppose what you have to charge me with is that i was desirous to have all that without marriage cotso sir i know you are deemed to be a man of wit but may i not ask if these things sit not too light upon you when a thing is done and cannot be helped tis right to make the best of it i wish the lady would think so too i think sir ladies should not be deceived i think a promise to a lady should be as binding as to any other person at the least i believe you think so mr hickman and i believe you are a very honest good sort of a man i would always keep my word sir whether to man or woman you say well and far be it from me to persuade you to do otherwise but what have you farther heard thou wilt think jack i must be very desirous to know in what light my elected spouse had represented things to miss howe and how far miss howe had communicated them to mr hickman sir this is no part of my present business but mr hickman tis part of mine i hope you would not expect that i should answer your questions at the same time that you refused to answer mine what pray have you farther heard why then sir if i must say i am told that miss harlowe was carried to a very bad house why indeed the people did not prove so good as they should be what farther have you heard i have heard sir that the lady had strange advantages taken of her very unfair ones but what i cannot say and cannot you say cannot you guess then ill tell you sir perhaps some liberty was taken with her when she was asleep do you think no lady ever was taken at such an advantage you know mr hickman that ladies are very shy of trusting themselves with the modestest of our sex when they are disposed to sleep and why so if they did not expect that advantages would be taken of them at such times but sir had not the lady something given her to make her sleep ay mr hickman thats the question i want to know if the lady says she had i have not seen all she has written but by what i have heard it is a very black affair excuse me sir i do excuse you mr hickman but supposing it were so do you think a lady was never imposed upon by wine or so do you not think the most cautious woman in the world might not be cheated by a stronger liquor for a smaller when she was thirsty after a fatigue in this very warm weather and do you think if she was thus thrown into a profound sleep that she is the only lady that was ever taken at such an advantage even as you make it mr lovelace this matter is not a light one but i fear it is a great deal heavier than as you put it what reasons have you to fear this sir what has the lady said pray let me know i have reason to be so earnest why sir miss howe herself knows not the whole the lady promises to give her all the particulars at a proper time if she lives but has said enough to make it out to be a very bad affair i am glad miss harlowe has not yet given all the particulars and since she has not you may tell miss howe from me that neither she nor any woman in the world can be more virtuous than miss harlowe is to this hour as to her own mind tell her that i hope she never will know the particulars but that she has been unworthily used tell her that though i know not what she has said yet i have such an opinion of her veracity that i would blindly subscribe to the truth of every tittle of it though it make me ever so black tell her that i have but three things to blame her for one that she wont give me an opportunity of repairing her wrongs the second that she is so ready to acquaint every body with what she has suffered that it will put it out of my power to redress those wrongs with any tolerable reputation to either of us will this mr hickman answer any part of the intention of this visit why sir this is talking like a man of honour i own but you say there is a third thing you blame the lady for may i ask what that is i dont know sir whether i ought to tell it you or not perhaps you wont believe it if i do but though the lady will tell the truth and nothing but the truth yet perhaps she will not tell the whole truth pray sir but it maynt be proper yet you give me great curiosity sure there is no misconduct in the lady i hope there is not i am sure if miss howe did not believe her to be faultless in every particular she would not interest herself so much in her favour as she does dearly as she loves her i love miss harlowe too well mr hickman to wish to lessen her in miss howes opinion especially as she is abandoned of every other friend but perhaps it would hardly be credited if i should tell you i should be very sorry sir and so would miss howe if this poor ladys conduct had laid her under obligation to you for this reserve you have so much the appearance of a gentleman as well as are so much distinguished in your family and fortunes that i hope you are incapable of loading such a young lady as this in order to lighten yourself excuse me sir i do i do mr hickman you say you came not with any intention to affront me i take freedom and i give it i should be very loth i repeat to say any thing that may weaken miss harlowe in the good opinion of the only friend she thinks she has left it may not be proper said he for me to know your third article against this unhappy lady but i never heard of any body out of her own implacable family that had the least doubt of her honour mrs howe indeed once said after a conference with one of her uncles that she feared all was not right on her side but else i never heard oons sir in a fierce tone and with an erect mien stopping short upon him which made him start back tis next to blasphemy to question this ladys honour she is more pure than a vestal for vestals have often been warmed by their own fires no age from the first to the present ever produced nor will the future to the end of the world i dare aver ever produce a young blooming lady tried as she has been tried who has stood all trials as she has done let me tell you sir that you never saw never knew never heard of such another woman as miss harlowe sir sir i beg your pardon far be it from me to question the lady you have not heard me say a word that could be so construed i have the utmost honour for her miss howe loves her as she loves her own soul and that she would not do if she were not sure she were as virtuous as herself as herself sir i have a high opinion of miss howe sir but i dare say what sir dare you say of miss howe i hope sir you will not presume to say any thing to the disparagement of miss howe presume mr hickman that is presuming language let me tell you mr hickman the occasion for it mr lovelace if designed is presuming if you please i am not a man ready to take offence sir especially where i am employed as a mediator but no man breathing shall say disparaging things of miss howe in my hearing without observation well said mr hickman i dislike not your spirit on such a supposed occasion but what i was going to say is this that there is not in my opinion a woman in the world who ought to compare herself with miss clarissa harlowe till she has stood her trials and has behaved under them and after them as she has done you see sir i speak against myself you see i do for libertine as i am thought to be i never will attempt to bring down the measures of right and wrong to the standard of my actions why sir this is very right it is very noble i will say but tis pity that the man who can pronounce so fine a sentence will not square his actions accordingly that mr hickman is another point we all err in some things i wish not that miss howe should have miss harlowes trials and i rejoice that she is in no danger of any such from so good a man poor hickman he looked as if he knew not whether i meant a compliment or a reflection but proceeded i since i find that i have excited your curiosity that you may not go away with a doubt that may be injurious to the most admirable of women i am enclined to hint to you what i have in the third place to blame her for sir as you please it may not be proper it cannot be very improper mr hickman so let me ask you what would miss howe think if her friend is the more determined against me because she thinks to revenge to me i verily believe that of encouraging another lover how sir sure this cannot be the case i can tell you sir if miss howe thought this she would not approve of it at all for little as you think miss howe likes you sir and little as she approves of your actions by her friend i know she is of opinion that she ought to have nobody living but you and should continue single all her life if she be not yours revenge and obstinacy mr hickman will make women the best of them do very unaccountable things rather than not put out both eyes of a man they are offended with they will give up one of their own i dont know what to say to this sir but sure she cannot encourage any other persons address so soon too why sir she is as we are told so ill and so weak not in resentment weak ill assure you i am well acquainted with all her movements and i tell you believe it or not that she refuses me in view of another lover can it be tis true by my soul has she not hinted this to miss howe do you think no indeed sir if she had i should not have troubled you at this time from miss howe well then you see i am right that though she cannot be guilty of a falsehood yet she has not told her friend the whole truth what shall a man say to these things looking most stupidly perplexed say say mr hickman who can account for the workings and ways of a passionate and offended woman endless would be the histories i could give you within my own knowledge of the dreadful effects of womans passionate resentments and what that sex will do when disappointed there was miss dorrington perhaps you know her not who run away with her fathers groom because he would not let her have a halfpay officer with whom her passions all up she fell in love at first sight as he accidentally passed under her window there was miss savage she married her mothers coachman because her mother refused her a journey to wales in apprehension that miss intended to league herself with a remote cousin of unequal fortunes of whom she was not a little fond when he was a visitingguest at their house for a week there was the young widow sanderson who believing herself slighted by a younger brother of a noble family sarah stout like took it into her head to drown herself miss sally anderson you have heard of her no doubt being checked by her uncle for encouraging an address beneath her in spite threw herself into the arms of an ugly dog a shoemakers apprentice running away with him in a pair of shoes he had just fitted to her feet though she never saw the fellow before and hated him ever after and at last took laudanum to make her forget for ever her own folly but can there be a stronger instance in point than what the unaccountable resentments of such a lady as miss clarissa harlowe afford us who at this instant ill as she is not only encourages but in a manner makes court to one of the most odious dogs that ever was seen i think miss howe should not be told this and yet she ought too in order to dissuade her from such a preposterous rashness o fie o strange miss howe knows nothing of this to be sure she wont look upon her if this be true tis true very true mr hickman true as i am here to tell you so and he is an ugly fellow too uglier to look at than me than you sir why to be sure you are one of the handsomest men in england well but the wretch she so spitefully prefers to me is a misshapen meagre varlet more like a skeleton than a man then he dresses you never saw a devil so bedizened hardly a coat to his back nor a shoe to his foot a baldpated villain yet grudges to buy a peruke to his baldness for he is as covetous as hell never satisfied yet plaguy rich why sir there is some joke in this surely a man of common parts knows not how to take such gentleman as you but sir if there be any truth in the story what is he some jew or miserly citizen i suppose that may have presumed on the ladys distressful circumstances and your lively wit points him out as it pleases why the rascal has estates in every county in england and out of england too some east india governor i suppose if there be any thing in it the lady once had thoughts of going abroad but i fancy all this time you are in jest sir if not we must surely have heard of him heard of him aye sir we have all heard of him but none of us care to be intimate with him except this lady and that as i told you in spite of me his name in short is death death sir stamping and speaking loud and full in his ears which made him jump half a yard high thou never beheldest any man so disconcerted he looked as if the frightful skeleton was before him and he had not his accounts ready when a little recovered he fribbled with his waistcoat buttons as if he had been telling his beads this sir proceeded i is her wooer nay she is so forward a girl that she wooes him but i hope it never will be a match he had before behaved and now looked with more spirit than i expected from him i came sir said he as a mediator of differences it behoves me to keep my temper but sir and turned short upon me as much as i love peace and to promote it i will not be illused as i had played so much upon him it would have been wrong to take him at his more than halfmenace yet i think i owe him a grudge for his presuming to address miss howe you mean no defiance i presume mr hickman any more than i do offence on that presumption i ask your excuse but this is my way i mean no harm i cannot let sorrow touch my heart i cannot be grave six minutes together for the blood of me i am a descendant of old chancellor moore i believe and should not forbear to cut a joke were i upon the scaffold but you may gather from what i have said that i prefer miss harlowe and that upon the justest grounds to all the women in the world and i wonder that there should be any difficulty to believe from what i have signed and from what i have promised to my relations and enabled them to promise for me that i should be glad to marry that excellent creature upon her own terms i acknowledge to you mr hickman that i have basely injured her if she will honour me with her hand i declare that is my intention to make her the best of husbands but nevertheless i must say that if she goes on appealing her case and exposing us both as she does it is impossible to think the knot can be knit with reputation to either and although mr hickman i have delivered my apprehensions under so ludicrous a figure i am afraid that she will ruin her constitution and by seeking death when she may shun him will not be able to avoid him when she would be glad to do so this cool and honest speech let down his stiffened muscles into complacence he was my very obedient and faithful humble servant several times over as i waited on him to his chariot and i was his almost as often and so exit hickman letter xxix mr lovelace to john belford esq in answer to letters xxii xxvi xxvii of this volume friday night july i will throw away a few paragraphs upon the contents of thy last shocking letters just brought me and send what i shall write by the fellow who carries mine on the interview with hickman reformation i see is coming fast upon thee thy uncles slow death and thy attendance upon him through every stage towards it prepared thee for it but go thou on in thine own way as i will in mine happiness consists in being pleased with what we do and if thou canst find delight in being sad it will be as well for thee as if thou wert merry though no other person should join to keep thee in countenance i am nevertheless exceedingly disturbed at the ladys ill health it is entirely owing to the cursed arrest she was absolutely triumphant over me and the whole crew before thou believest me guiltless of that so i hope does she the rest as i have often said is a common case only a little uncommonly circumstanced thats all why then all these severe things from her and from thee as to selling her clothes and her laces and so forth it has i own a shocking sound to it what an implacable as well as unjust set of wretches are those of her unkindredly kin who have money of hers in their hands as well as large arrears of her own estate yet withhold both avowedly to distress her but may she not have money of that proud and saucy friend of hers miss howe more than she wants and should not i be overjoyed thinkest thou to serve herwhat then is there in the parting with her apparel but female perverseness and i am not sure whether i ought not to be glad if she does this out of spite to me some disappointed fairones would have hanged some drowned themselves my beloved only revenges herself upon her clothes different ways of working has passion in different bosoms as humours or complexion induce besides dost think i shall grudge to replace to three times the value what she disposes of so jack there is no great matter in this thou seest how sensible she is of the soothings of the polite doctor this will enable thee to judge how dreadfully the horrid arrest and her gloomy fathers curse must have hurt her i have great hope if she will but see me that my behaviour my contrition my soothings may have some happy effect upon her but thou art too ready to give up let me seriously tell thee that all excellence as she is i think the earnest interposition of my relations the implored mediation of that little fury miss howe and the commissions thou actest under from myself are such instances of condescension and high value in them and such contrition in me that nothing farther can be done so here let the matter rest for the present till she considers better of it but now a few words upon poor beltons case i own i was at first a little startled at the disloyalty of his thomasine her hypocrisy to be for so many years undetected i have very lately had some intimations given me of her vileness and had intended to mention them to thee when i saw thee to say the truth i always suspected her eye the eye thou knowest is the casement at which the heart generally looks out many a woman who will not show herself at the door has tipt the sly the intelligible wink from the windows but tom had no management at all a very careless fellow would never look into his own affairs the estate his uncle left him was his ruin wife or mistress whoever was must have had his fortune to sport with i have often hinted his weakness of this sort to him and the danger he was in of becoming the property of designing people but he hated to take pains he would ever run away from his accounts as now poor fellow he would be glad to do from himself had he not had a woman to fleece him his coachman or valet would have been his primeminister and done it as effectually but yet for many years i thought she was true to his bed at least i thought the boys were his own for though they are muscular and bigboned yet i supposed the healthy mother might have furnished them with legs and shoulders for she is not of a delicate frame and then tom some years ago looked up and spoke more like a man than he has done of late squeaking inwardly poor fellow for some time past from contracted quailpipes and wheezing from lungs half spit away he complains thou sayest that we all run away from him why after all belford it is no pleasant thing to see a poor fellow one loves dying by inches yet unable to do him good there are friendships which are only bottledeep i should be loth to have it thought that mine for any of my vassals is such a one yet with gay hearts which become intimate because they were gay the reason for their first intimacy ceasing the friendship will fade but may not this sort of friendship be more properly distinguished by the word companionship but mine as i said is deeper than this i would still be as ready as ever i was in my life to the utmost of my power to do him service as once instance of this my readiness to extricate him from all his difficulties as to thomasine dost thou care to propose to him an expedient that is just come into my head it is this i would engage thomasine and her cubs if belton be convinced they are neither of them his in a party of pleasure she was always complaisant to me it should be in a boat hired for the purpose to sail to tilbury to the isle shepey or pleasuring up the medway and tis but contriving to turn the boat bottom upward i can swim like a fish another boat shall be ready to take up whom i should direct for fear of the worst and then if tom has a mind to be decent one suit of mourning will serve for all three nay the hostlercousin may take his plunge from the steerage and who knows but they may be thrown up on the beach thomasine and he hand in hand this thoult say is no common instance of friendship mean time do thou prevail on him to come down to us he never was more welcome in his life than he shall be now if he will not let him find me some other service and i will clap a pair of wings to my shoulders and he shall see me come flying in at his windows at the word of command mowbray and tourville each intend to give thee a letter and i leave to those rough varlets to handle thee as thou deservest for the shocking picture thou hast drawn of their last ends thy own past guilt has stared thee full in the face one may see by it and made thee in consciousness of thy demerits sketch out these cursed outlines i am glad thou hast got the old fiend to hold the glass before thy own face so soon thou must be in earnest surely when thou wrotest it and have severe conviction upon thee for what a hardened varlet must he be who could draw such a picture as this in sport see letter xxvi of this volume as for thy resolution of repenting and marrying i would have thee consider which thou wilt set about first if thou wilt follow my advice thou shalt make short work of it let matrimony take place of the other for then thou wilt very possibly have repentance come tumbling in fast upon thee as a consequence and so have both in one letter xxx mr belford to mr robert lovelace esq friday noon july this morning i was admitted as soon as i sent up my name into the presence of the divine lady such i may call her as what i have to relate will fully prove she had had a tolerable night and was much better in spirits though weak in person and visibly declining in looks mrs lovick and mrs smith were with her and accused her in a gentle manner of having applied herself too assiduously to her pen for her strength having been up ever since five she said she had rested better than she had done for many nights she had found her spirits free and her mind tolerably easy and having as she had reason to think but a short time and much to do in it she must be a good housewife of her hours she had been writing she said a letter to her sister but had not pleased herself in it though she had made two or three essays but that the last must go by hints i had dropt from time to time she had reason she said to think that i knew every thing that concerned her and her family and if so must be acquainted with the heavy curse her father had laid upon her which had been dreadfully fulfilled in one part as to her prospects in this life and that in a very short time which gave her great apprehensions of the other part she had been applying herself to her sister to obtain a revocation of it i hope my father will revoke it said she or i shall be very miserable yet and she gasped as she spoke with apprehension i am ready to tremble at what the answer may be for my sister is hardhearted i said something reflecting upon her friends as to what they would deserve to be thought of if the unmerited imprecation were not withdrawn upon which she took me up and talked in such a dutiful manner of her parents as must doubly condemn them if they remain implacable for their inhuman treatment of such a daughter she said i must not blame her parents it was her dear miss howes fault to do so but what an enormity was there in her crime which could set the best of parents they had been to her till she disobliged them in a bad light for resenting the rashness of a child from whose education they had reason to expect better fruits there were some hard circumstances in her case it was true but my friend could tell me that no one person throughout the whole fatal transaction had acted out of character but herself she submitted therefore to the penalty she had incurred if they had any fault it was only that they would not inform themselves of such circumstances which would alleviate a little her misdeed and that supposing her a more guilty creature than she was they punished her without a hearing lord i was going to curse thee lovelace how every instance of excellence in this all excelling creature condemns thee thou wilt have reason to think thyself of all men the most accursed if she die i then besought her while she was capable of such glorious instances of generosity and forgiveness to extend her goodness to a man whose heart bled in every vein of it for the injuries he had done her and who would make it the study of his whole life to repair them the women would have withdrawn when the subject became so particular but she would not permit them to go she told me that if after this time i was for entering with so much earnestness into a subject so very disagreeable to her my visits must not be repeated nor was there occasion she said for my friendly offices in your favour since she had begun to write her whole mind upon that subject to miss howe in answer to letters from her in which miss howe urged the same arguments in compliment to the wishes of your noble and worthy relations mean time you may let him know said she that i reject him with my whole heart yet that although i say this with such a determination as shall leave no room for doubt i say it not however with passion on the contrary tell him that i am trying to bring my mind into such a frame as to be able to pity him poor perjured wretch what has he not to answer for and that i shall not think myself qualified for the state i am aspiring to if after a few struggles more i cannot forgive him too and i hope clasping her hands together uplifted as were her eyes my dear earthly father will set me the example my heavenly one has already set us all and by forgiving his fallen daughter teach her to forgive the man who then i hope will not have destroyed my eternal prospects as he has my temporal stop here thou wretch but i need not bid theefor i can go no farther letter xxxi mr belford in continuation you will imagine how affecting her noble speech and behaviour were to me at the time when the bare recollecting and transcribing them obliged me to drop my pen the women had tears in their eyes i was silent for a few moments at last matchless excellence inimitable goodness i called her with a voice so accented that i was halfashamed of myself as it was before the women but who could stand such sublime generosity of soul in so young a creature her loveliness giving grace to all she said methinks said i and i really in a manner involuntarily bent my knee i have before me an angel indeed i can hardly forbear prostration and to beg your influence to draw me after you to the world you are aspiring to yet but what shall i say only dearest excellence make me in some small instances serviceable to you that i may if i survive you have the glory to think i was able to contribute to your satisfaction while among us here i stopt she was silent i proceeded have you no commission to employ me in deserted as you are by all your friends among strangers though i doubt not worthy people cannot i be serviceable by message by letterwriting by attending personally with either message or letter your father your uncles your brother your sister miss howe lord m or the ladies his sisters any office to be employed to serve you absolutely independent of my friends wishes or of my own wishes to oblige him think madam if i cannot i thank you sir very heartily i thank you but in nothing that i can at present think of or at least resolve upon can you do me service i will see what return the letter i have written will bring me till then my life and my fortune interrupted i are devoted to your service permit me to observe that here you are without one natural friend and so much do i know of your unhappy case that you must be in a manner destitute of the means to make friends she was going to interrupt me with a prohibitory kind of earnestness in her manner i beg leave to proceed madam i have cast about twenty ways how to mention this before but never dared till now suffer me now that i have broken the ice to tender myself as your banker only i know you will not be obliged you need not you have sufficient of your own if it were in your hands and from that whether you live or die will i consent to be reimbursed i do assure you that the unhappy man shall never know either my offer or your acceptance only permit me this small and down behind her chair dropt a bank note of which i had brought with me intending some how or other to leave it behind me nor shouldst thou ever have known it had she favoured me with the acceptance of it as i told her you give me great pain mr belford said she by these instances of your humanity and yet considering the company i have seen you in i am not sorry to find you capable of such methinks i am glad for the sake of human nature that there could be but one such man in the world as he you and i know but as to your kind offer whatever it be if you take it not up you will greatly disturb me i have no need of your kindness i have effects enough which i never can want to supply my present occasion and if needful can have recourse to miss howe i have promised that i would so pray sir urge not upon me this favour take it up yourself if you mean me peace and ease of mind urge not this favour and she spoke with impatience i beg madam but one word not one sir till you have taken back what you have let fall i doubt not either the honour or the kindness of your offer but you must not say one word more on this subject i cannot bear it she was stooping but with pain i therefore prevented her and besought her to forgive me for a tender which i saw had been more discomposing to her than i had hoped from the purity of my intentions it would be but i could not bear to think that such a mind as hers should be distressed since the want of the conveniencies she was used to abound in might affect and disturb her in the divine course she was in you are very kind to me sir said she and very favourable in your opinion of me but i hope that i cannot now be easily put out of my present course my declining health will more and more confirm me in it those who arrested and confined me no doubt thought they had fallen upon the most ready method to distress me so as to bring me into all their measures but i presume to hope that i have a mind that cannot be debased in essential instances by temporal calamities little do those poor wretches know of the force of innate principles forgive my own implied vanity was her word who imagine that a prison or penury can bring a rightturned mind to be guilty of a wilful baseness in order to avoid such shortlived evils she then turned from me towards the window with a dignity suitable to her words and such as showed her to be more of soul than of body at that instant what magnanimity no wonder a virtue so solidly founded could baffle all thy arts and that it forced thee in order to carry thy accursed point to have recourse to those unnatural ones which robbed her of her charming senses the women were extremely affected mrs lovick especially who said whisperingly to mrs smith we have an angel not a woman with us mrs smith i repeated my offers to write to any of her friends and told her that having taken the liberty to acquaint dr h with the cruel displeasure of her relations as what i presumed lay nearest to her heart he had proposed to write himself to acquaint her friends how ill she was if she would not take it amiss it was kind in the doctor she said but begged that no step of that sort might be taken without her knowledge or consent she would wait to see what effects her letter to her sister would have all she had to hope for was that her father would revoke his malediction previous to the last blessing she should then implore for the rest her friends would think she could not suffer too much and she was content to suffer for now nothing could happen that could make her wish to live mrs smith went down and soon returning asked if the lady and i would not dine with her that day for it was her weddingday she had engaged mrs lovick she said and should have nobody else if we would do her that favour the charming creature sighed and shook her head weddingday repeated she i wish you mrs smith many happy weddingdays but you will excuse me mr smith came up with the same request they both applied to me on condition the lady would i should make no scruple and would suspend an engagement which i actually had she then desired they would all sit down you have several times mrs lovick and mrs smith hinted your wishes that i would give you some little history of myself now if you are at leisure that this gentleman who i have reason to believe knows it all is present and can tell you if i give it justly or not i will oblige your curiosity they all eagerly the man smith too sat down and she began an account of herself which i will endeavour to repeat as nearly in her own words as i possibly can for i know you will think it of importance to be apprized of her manner of relating your barbarity to her as well as what her sentiments are of it and what room there is for the hopes your friends have in your favour for her at first when i took these lodgings said she i thought of staying but a short time in them and so mrs smith i told you i therefore avoided giving any other account of myself than that i was a very unhappy young creature seduced from good and escaped from very vile wretches this account i thought myself obliged to give that you might the less wonder at seeing a young creature rushing through your shop into your back apartment all trembling and out of breath an ordinary garb over my own craving lodging and protection only giving my bare word that you should be handsomely paid all my effects contained in a pockethandkerchief my sudden absence for three days and nights together when arrested must still further surprise you and although this gentleman who perhaps knows more of the darker part of my story than i do myself has informed you as you mrs lovick tell me that i am only an unhappy not a guilty creature yet i think it incumbent upon me not to suffer honest minds to be in doubt about my character you must know then that i have been in one instance i had like to have said but in one instance but that was a capital one an undutiful child to the most indulgent of parents for what some people call cruelty in them is owing but to the excess of their love and to their disappointment having had reason to expect better from me i was visited at first with my friends connivance by a man of birth and fortune but of worse principles as it proved than i believed any man could have my brother a very headstrong young man was absent at that time and when he returned from an old grudge and knowing the gentleman it is plain better than i knew him entirely disapproved of his visits and having a great sway in our family brought other gentlemen to address me and at last several having been rejected he introduced one extremely disagreeable in every indifferent persons eyes disagreeable i could not love him they all joined to compel me to have him a rencounter between the gentleman my friends were set against and my brother having confirmed them all his enemies to be short i was confined and treated so very hardly that in a rash fit i appointed to go off with the man they hated a wicked intention youll say but i was greatly provoked nevertheless i repented and resolved not to go off with him yet i did not mistrust his honour to me neither nor his love because nobody thought me unworthy of the latter and my fortune was not to be despised but foolishly wickedly and contrivingly as my friends still think with a design as they imagine to abandon them giving him a private meeting i was tricked away poorly enough tricked away i must needs say though others who had been first guilty of so rash a step as the meeting of him was might have been so deceived and surprised as well as i after remaining some time at a farmhouse in the country and behaving to me all the time with honour he brought me to handsome lodgings in town till still better provision could be made for me but they proved to be as he indeed knew and designed at a vile a very vile creatures though it was long before i found her to be so for i knew nothing of the town or its ways there is no repeating what followed such unprecedented vile arts for i gave him no opportunity to take me at any disreputable advantage and here half covering her sweet face with her handkerchief put to her tearful eyes she stopt hastily as if she would fly from the hateful remembrance she resumed i made escape afterward from the abominable house in his absence and came to yours and this gentleman has almost prevailed on me to think that the ungrateful man did not connive at the vile arrest which was made no doubt in order to get me once more to those wicked lodgings for nothing do i owe them except i were to pay them she sighed and again wiped her charming eyes adding in a softer lower voice for being ruined indeed madam said i guilty abominably guilty as he is in all the rest he is innocent of this last wicked outrage well and so i wish him to be that evil heavy as it was is one of the slightest evils i have suffered but hence youll observe mrs lovick for you seemed this morning curious to know if i were not a wife that i never was married you mr belford no doubt knew before that i am no wife and now i never will be one yet i bless god that i am not a guilty creature as to my parentage i am of no mean family i have in my own right by the intended favour of my grandfather a fortune not contemptible independent of my father if i had pleased but i never will please my father is very rich i went by another name when i came to you first but that was to avoid being discovered to the perfidious man who now engages by this gentleman not to molest me my real name you now know to be harlowe clarissa harlowe i am not yet twenty years of age i have an excellent mother as well as father a woman of family and fine sense worthy of a better child they both doated upon me i have two good uncles men of great fortune jealous of the honour of their family which i have wounded i was the joy of their hearts and with theirs and my fathers i had three houses to call my own for they used to have me with them by turns and almost kindly to quarrel for me so that i was two months in the year with the one two months with the other six months at my fathers and two at the houses of others of my dear friends who thought themselves happy in me and whenever i was at any ones i was crowded upon with letters by all the rest who longed for my return to them in short i was beloved by every body the poor i used to make glad their hearts i never shut my hand to any distress wherever i was but now i am poor myself so mrs smith so mrs lovick i am not married it is but just to tell you so and i am now as i ought to be in a state of humiliation and penitence for the rash step which has been followed by so much evil god i hope will forgive me as i am endeavouring to bring my mind to forgive all the world even the man who has ungratefully and by dreadful perjuries poor wretch he thought all his wickedness to be wit reduced to this a young creature who had his happiness in her view and in her wish even beyond this life and who was believed to be of rank and fortune and expectations considerable enough to make it the interest of any gentleman in england to be faithful to his vows to her but i cannot expect that my parents will forgive me my refuge must be death the most painful kind of which i would suffer rather than be the wife of one who could act by me as the man has acted upon whose birth education and honour i had so much reason to found better expectations i see continued she that i who once was every ones delight am now the cause of grief to every one you that are strangers to me are moved for me tis kind but tis time to stop your compassionate hearts mrs smith and mrs lovick are too much touched for the women sobbed and the man was also affected it is barbarous in me with my woes thus to sadden your weddingday then turning to mr and mrs smith may you see many happy ones honest good couple how agreeable is it to see you both join so kindly to celebrate it after many years are gone over you i once but no more all my prospects of felicity as to this life are at an end my hopes like opening buds or blossoms in an overforward spring have been nipt by a severe frost blighted by an eastern wind but i can but once die and if life be spared me but till i am discharged from a heavy malediction which my father in his wrath laid upon me and which is fulfilled literally in every article relating to this world that and a last blessing are all i have to wish for and death will be welcomer to me than rest to the most wearied traveller that ever reached his journeys end and then she sunk her head against the back of her chair and hiding her face with her handkerchief endeavoured to conceal her tears from us not a soul of us could speak a word thy presence perhaps thou hardened wretch might have made us ashamed of a weakness which perhaps thou wilt deride me in particular for when thou readest this she retired to her chamber soon after and was forced it seems to lie down we all went down together and for an hour and a half dwelt upon her praises mrs smith and mrs lovick repeatedly expressing their astonishment that there could be a man in the world capable of offending much more of wilfully injuring such a lady and repeating that they had an angel in their house i thought they had and that as assuredly as there is a devil under the roof of good lord m i hate thee heartily by my faith i do every hour i hate thee more than the former j belford letter xxxii mr lovelace to john belford esq saturday july what dost hate me for belford and why more and more have i been guilty of any offence thou knewest not before if pathos can move such a heart as thine can it alter facts did i not always do this incomparable creature as much justice as thou canst do her for the heart of thee or as she can do herselfwhat nonsense then thy hatred thy augmented hatred when i still persist to marry her pursuant to word given to thee and to faith plighted to all my relations but hate if thou wilt so thou dost but write thou canst not hate me so much as i do myself and yet i know if thou really hatedst me thou wouldst not venture to tell me so well but after all what need of her history to these women she will certainly repent some time hence that she has thus needless exposed us both sickness palls every appetite and makes us hate what we loved but renewed health changes the scene disposes us to be pleased with ourselves and then we are in a way to be pleased with every one else every hope then rises upon us every hour presents itself to us on dancing feet and what mr addison says of liberty may with still greater propriety be said of health for what is liberty itself without health it makes the gloomy face of nature gay gives beauty to the sun and pleasure to the day and i rejoice that she is already so much better as to hold with strangers such a long and interesting conversation strange confoundedly strange and as perverse that is to say womanly as strange that she should refuse and sooner choose to die o the obscene word and yet how free does thy pen make with it to me than be mine who offended her by acting in character while her parents acted shamefully out of theirs and when i am now willing to act out of my own to oblige her yet i am not to be forgiven they to be faultless with her and marriage the only medium to repair all breaches and to salve her own honour surely thou must see the inconsistence of her forgiving unforgiveness as i may call it yet heavy varlet as thou art thou wantest to be drawn up after her and what a figure dost thou make with thy speeches stiff as hickmans ruffles with thy aspirations and protestations unused thy weak head to bear the sublimities that fall even in common conversation from the lips of this evercharming creature but the prettiest whim of all was to drop the bank note behind her chair instead of presenting it on thy knees to her hand to make such a woman as this doubly stoop by the acceptance and to take it from the ground what an ungrateful benefitconferrer art thou how awkward to take in into thy head that the best way of making a present to a lady was to throw the present behind her chair i am very desirous to see what she has written to her sister what she is about to write to miss howe and what return she will have from the harlowearabella canst thou not form some scheme to come at the copies of these letters or the substance of them at least and of that of her other correspondencies mrs lovick thou seemest to say is a pious woman the lady having given such a particular history of herself will acquaint her with every thing and art thou not about to reform wont this consent of minds between thee and the widow what age is she jack the devil never trumpt up a friendship between a man and a woman of any thing like years which did not end in matrimony or in the ruin of their morals wont it strike out an intimacy between ye that may enable thee to gratify me in this particular a proselyte i can tell thee has great influence upon your good people such a one is a saint of their own creation and they will water and cultivate and cherish him as a plant of their own raising and this from a pride truly spiritual one of my lovers in paris was a devote she took great pains to convert me i gave way to her kind endeavours for the good of my soul she thought it a point gained to make me profess some religion the catholic has its conveniencies i permitted her to bring a father to me my reformation went on swimmingly the father had hopes of me he applauded her zeal so did i and how dost thou think it ended not a girl in england reading thus far but would guess in a word very happily for she not only brought me a father but made me one and then being satisfied with each others conversation we took different routes she into navarre i into italy both well inclined to propagate the good lessons in which we had so well instructed each other but to return one consolation arises to me from the pretty regrets which this admirable creature seems to have in indulging reflections on the peoples weddingday i once thou makest her break off with saying she once what o belford why didst thou not urge her to explain what she once hoped what once a woman hopes in love matters she always hopes while there is room for hope and are we not both single can she be any mans but mine will i be any womans but hers i never will i never can and i tell thee that i am every day every hour more and more in love with her and at this instant have a more vehement passion for her than ever i had in my life and that with views absolutely honourable in her own sense of the word nor have i varied so much as in wish for this week past firmly fixed and wrought into my very nature as the life of honour or of generous confidence in me was in preference to the life of doubt and distrust that must be a life of doubt and distrust surely where the woman confides nothing and ties up a man for his good behaviour for life taking churchandstate sanctions in aid of the obligation she imposes upon him i shall go on monday to a kind of ball to which colonel ambrose has invited me it is given on a family account i care not on what for all that delights me in the thing is that mrs and miss howe are to be there hickman of course for the old lady will not stir abroad without him the colonel is in hopes that miss arabella harlowe will be there likewise for all the men and women of fashion round him are invited i fell in by accident with the colonel who i believe hardly thought i would accept of the invitation but he knows me not if he thinks i am ashamed to appear at any place where women dare show their faces yet he hinted to me that my name was up on miss harlowes account but to allude to one of lord ms phrases if it be i will not lie a bed when any thing joyous is going forward as i shall go in my lords chariot i would have had one of my cousins montague to go with me but they both refused and i shall not choose to take either of thy brethren it would look as if i thought i wanted a bodyguard besides one of them is too rough the other too smooth and too great a fop for some of the staid company that will be there and for me in particular men are known by their companions and a fop as tourville for example takes great pains to hang out a sign by his dress of what he has in his shop thou indeed art an exception dressing like a coxcomb yet a very clever fellow nevertheless so clumsy a beau that thou seemest to me to owe thyself a double spite making thy ungracefulness appear the more ungraceful by thy remarkable tawdriness when thou art out of mourning i remember when i first saw thee my mind laboured with a strong puzzle whether i should put thee down for a great fool or a smatterer in wit something i saw was wrong in thee by thy dress if this fellow thought i delights not so much in ridicule that he will not spare himself he must be plaguy silly to take so much pains to make his ugliness more conspicuous than it would otherwise be plain dress for an ordinary man or woman implies at least modesty and always procures a kind quarter from the censorious who will ridicule a personal imperfection in one that seems conscious that it is an imperfection who ever said an anchoret was poor but who would spare so very absurd a wronghead as should bestow tinsel to make his deformity the more conspicuous but although i put on these lively airs i am sick at my soul my whole heart is with my charmer with what indifference shall i look upon all the assembly at the colonels my beloved in my ideal eye and engrossing my whole heart letter xxxiii miss howe to miss arabella harlowe thursday july miss harlowe i cannot help acquainting you however it may be received coming from me that your poor sister is dangerously ill at the house of one smith who keeps a glovers and perfume shop in kingstreet coventgarden she knows not that i write some violent words in the nature of an imprecation from her father afflict her greatly in her weak state i presume not to direct you what to do in this case you are her sister i therefore could not help writing to you not only for her sake but for your own i am madam your humble servant anna howe letter xxxiv miss arabella harlowe in answer thursday july miss howe i have yours of this morning all that has happened to the unhappy body you mentioned is what we foretold and expected let him for whose sake she abandoned us be her comfort we are told he has remorse and would marry her we dont believe it indeed she may be very ill her disappointment may make her so or ought yet is she the only one i know who is disappointed i cannot say miss that the notification from you is the more welcome for the liberties you have been pleased to take with our whole family for resenting a conduct that it is a shame any young lady should justify excuse this freedom occasioned by greater i am miss your humble servant arabella harlowe letter xxxv miss howe in reply friday july miss arabella harlowe if you had half as much sense as you have illnature you would notwithstanding the exuberance of the latter have been able to distinguish between a kind intention to you all that you might have the less to reproach yourselves with if a deplorable case should happen and an officiousness i owed you not by reason of freedoms at least reciprocal i will not for the unhappy bodys sake as you call a sister you have helped to make so say all that i could say if what i fear happen you shall hear whether desired or not all the mind of anna howe letter xxxvi miss arabella harlowe to miss howe friday july miss anna howe your pert letter i have received you that spare nobody i cannot expect should spare me you are very happy in a prudent and watchful mother but else mine cannot be exceeded in prudence but we had all too good an opinion of somebody to think watchfulness needful there may possibly be some reason why you are so much attached to her in an error of this flagrant nature i help to make a sister unhappy it is false miss it is all her own doings except indeed what she may owe to somebodys advice you know who can best answer for that let us know your mind as soon as you please as we shall know it to be your mind we shall judge what attention to give it thats all from c ar h letter xxxvii miss howe to miss arabella harlowe sat july it may be the misfortune of some people to engage every bodys notice others may be the happier though they may be the more envious for nobodys thinking them worthy of any but one would be glad people had the sense to be thankful for that want of consequence which subject them not to hazards they would heartily have been able to manage under i own to you that had it not been for the prudent advice of that admirable somebody whose principal fault is the superiority of her talents and whose misfortune to be brotherd and sisterd by a couple of creatures who are not able to comprehend her excellencies i might at one time have been plunged into difficulties but pert as the superlatively pert may think me i thought not myself wiser because i was older nor for that poor reason qualified to prescribe to much less to maltreat a genius so superior i repeat it with gratitude that the dear creatures advice was of very great service to me and this before my mothers watchfulness became necessary but how it would have fared with me i cannot say had i had a brother or sister who had deemed it their interest as well as a gratification of their sordid envy to misrepresent me your admirable sister in effect saved you miss as well as me with this difference you against your will me with mine and but for your own brother and his own sister would not have been lost herself would to heaven both sisters had been obliged with their own wills the most admirable of her sex would never then have been out of her fathers house you miss i dont know what had become of you but let what would have happened you would have met with the humanity you have not shown whether you had deserved it or not nor at the worst lost either a kind sister or a pitying friend in the most excellent of sisters but why run i into length to such a poor thing why push i so weak an adversary whose first letter is all low malice and whose next is made up of falsehood and inconsistence as well as spite and illmanners yet i was willing to give you a part of my mind call for more of it it shall be at your service from one who though she thanks god she is not your sister is not your enemy but that she is not the latter is withheld but by two considerations one that you bear though unworthily a relation to a sister so excellent the other that you are not of consequence enough to engage any thing but the pity and contempt of ah letter xxxviii mrs harlowe to mrs howe sat july dear madam i send you enclosed copies of five letters that have passed between miss howe and my arabella you are a person of so much prudence and good sense and being a mother yourself can so well enter into the distresses of all our family upon the rashness and ingratitude of a child we once doated upon that i dare say you will not countenance the strange freedoms your daughter has taken with us all these are not the only ones we have to complain of but we were silent on the others as they did not as these have done spread themselves out upon paper we only beg that we may not be reflected upon by a young lady who knows not what we have suffered and do suffer by the rashness of a naughty creature who has brought ruin upon herself and disgrace upon a family which she had robbed of all comfort i offer not to prescribe to your known wisdom in this case but leave it to you to do as you think most proper i am madam your most humble servant charl harlowe letter xxxix mrs howe in answer sat july dear madam i am highly offended with my daughters letters to miss harlowe i knew nothing at all of her having taken such a liberty these young creatures have such romantic notions some of live some of friendship that there is no governing them in either nothing but time and dear experience will convince them of their absurdities in both i have chidden miss howe very severely i had before so just a notion of what your whole familys distress must be that as i told your brother mr antony harlowe i had often forbid her corresponding with the poor fallen angel for surely never did young lady more resemble what we imagine of angels both in person and mind but tired out with her headstrong ways i am sorry to say this of my own child i was forced to give way to it again and indeed so sturdy was she in her will that i was afraid it would end in a fit of sickness as too often it did in fits of sullens none but parents know the trouble that children give they are happiest i have often thought who have none and these womengrown girls bless my heart how ungovernable i believe however you will have no more such letters from my nancy i have been forced to use compulsion with her upon miss clarys illness and it seems she is very bad or she would have run away to london to attend upon her and this she calls doing the duty of a friend forgetting that she sacrifices to her romantic friendship her duty to her fond indulgent mother there are a thousand excellencies in the poor sufferer notwithstanding her fault and if the hints she has given to my daughter be true she has been most grievously abused but i think your forgiveness and her fathers forgiveness of her ought to be all at your own choice and nobody should intermeddle in that for the sake of due authority in parents and besides as miss harlowe writes it was what every body expected though miss clary would not believe it till she smarted for her credulity and fir these reasons i offer not to plead any thing in alleviation of her fault which is aggravated by her admirable sense and a judgment above her years i am madam with compliments to good mr harlowe and all your afflicted family your most humble servant annabella howe i shall set out for the isle of wight in a few days with my daughter i will hasten our setting out on purpose to break her mind from her friends distresses which afflict us as much nearly as miss clarys rashness has done you letter xl miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe sat july my dearest friend we are busy in preparing for our little journey and voyage but i will be ill i will be very ill if i cannot hear you are better before i go rogers greatly afflicted me by telling me the bad way you are in but now you have been able to hold a pen and as your sense is strong and clear i hope that the amusement you will receive from writing will make you better i dispatch this by an extraordinary way that it may reach you time enough to move you to consider well before you absolutely decide upon the contents of mine of the th on the subject of the two misses montagues visit to me since according to what you write must i answer them in your last conclude very positively that you will not be his to be sure he rather deserves an infamous death than such a wife but as i really believe him innocent of the arrest and as all his family are such earnest pleaders and will be guarantees for him i think the compliance with their entreaties and his own will be now the best step you can take your own family remaining implacable as i can assure you they do he is a man of sense and it is not impossible but he may make you a good husband and in time may become no bad man my mother is entirely of my opinion and on friday pursuant to a hint i gave you in my last mr hickman had a conference with the strange wretch and though he liked not by any means his behaviour to himself nor indeed had reason to do so yet he is of opinion that he is sincerely determined to marry you if you will condescend to have him perhaps mr hickman may make you a private visit before we set out if i may not attend you myself i shall not be easy except he does and he will then give you an account of the admirable character the surprising wretch gave of you and of the justice he does to your virtue he was as acknowledging to his relations though to his own condemnation as his two cousins told me all he apprehends as he said to mr hickman is that if you go on exposing him wedlock itself will not wipe off the dishonour to both and moreover that you would ruin your constitution by your immoderate sorrow and by seeking death when you might avoid it would not be able to escape it when you would wish to do so so my dearest friend i charge you if you can to get over your aversion to this vile man you may yet live to see many happy days and be once more the delight of all your friends neighbours and acquaintance as well as a stay a comfort and a blessing to your anna howe i long to have your answer to mine of the th pray keep the messenger till it be ready if he return on monday night it will be time enough for his affairs and to find me come back from colonel ambroses who gives a ball on the anniversary of mrs ambroses birth and marriage both in one the gentry all round the neighbourhood are invited this time on some good news they have received from mrs ambroses brother the governor my mother promised the colonel for me and herself in my absence i would fain have excused myself to her and the rather as i had exceptions on account of the day but she is almost as young as her daughter and thinking it not so well to go without me she told me and having had a few sparring blows with each other very lately i think i must comply for i dont love jingling when i can help it though i seldom make it my study to avoid the occasion when it offers of itself i dont know if either were not a little afraid of the other whether it would be possible that we could live together i all my father my mamma what all my mother what else should i say the th of july miss clarissa harlowes birthday o my dear how many things happen in this life to give us displeasure how few to give us joy i am sure i shall have none on this occasion since the true partner of my heart the principal of the one soul that it used to be said animated the pair of friends as we were called you my dear who used to irradiate every circle you set your foot into and to give me real significance in a second place to yourself cannot be there one hour of your company my ever instructive friend i thirst for it how infinitely preferable would it be to me to all the diversions and amusements with which our sex are generally most delighted adieu my dear a howe letter xli miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe sunday july what pain my dearest friend does your kind solicitude for my welfare give me how much more binding and tender are the ties of pure friendship and the union of like minds than the ties of nature well might the sweetsinger of israel when he was carrying to the utmost extent the praises of the friendship between him and his beloved friend say that the love of jonathan to him was wonderful that it surpassed the love of women what an exalted idea does it give of the soul of jonathan sweetly attempered for the sacred band if we may suppose it but equal to that of my anna howe for her fallen clarissa but although i can glory in your kind love for me think my dear what concern must fill a mind not ungenerous when the obligation lies all on one side and when at the same time that your light is the brighter for my darkness i must give pain to a dear friend to whom i delighted to give pleasure and not pain only but discredit for supporting my blighted fame against the busy tongues of uncharitable censures this is that makes me in the words of my admired exclaimer very little altered often repeat oh that i were as in months past as in the days when god preserved me when his candle shined upon my head and when by his light i walked through darkness as i was in the days of my childhood when the almighty was yet with me when i was in my fathers house when i washed my steps with butter and the rock poured me out rivers of oil you set before me your reasons enforced by the opinion of your honoured mother why i should think of mr lovelace for a husband see the preceding letter and i have before me your letter of the th containing the account of the visit and proposals and kind interposition of the two misses montague in the names of the good ladies sadleir and betty lawrance and in that of my lord m see letter ix of this vol also yours of the th demanding me as i may say of those ladies and of that family when i was so infamously and cruelly arrested and you knew not what was become of me see letter xi ibid the answer likewise of those ladies signed in so full and generous a manner by themselves and by that nobleman and those two venerable ladies and in his light way by the wretch himself see letter xiv ibid thse my dearest miss howe and your letter of the th which came when i was under arrest and which i received not till some days after are all before me see letter x of this volume and i have as well weighed the whole matter and your arguments in support of your advice as at present my head and my heart will let me weigh them i am moreover willing to believe not only from your own opinion but from the assurances of one of mr lovelaces friends mr belford a goodnatured and humane man who spares not to censure the author of my calamities i think with undissembled and undesigning sincerity that that man is innocent of the disgraceful arrest and even if you please in sincere compliment to your opinion and to that of mr hickman that overpersuaded by his friends and ashamed of his unmerited baseness to me he would in earnest marry me if i would have him well and now what is the result of all it is this that i must abide by what i have already declared and that is dont be angry at me my best friend that i have much more pleasure in thinking of death than of such a husband in short as i declared in my last that i cannot forgive me if i say i will not ever be his those parts of this letter which are marked with an inverted comma thus were afterwards transcribed by miss howe in letter lv written to the ladies of mr lovelaces family and are thus distinguished to avoid the necessity of repeating them in that letter but you will expect my reasons i know you will and if i give them not will conclude me either obstinate or implacable or both and those would be sad imputations if just to be laid to the charge of a person who thinks and talks of dying and yet to say that resentment and disappointment have no part in my determination would be saying a thing hardly to be credited for i own i have resentment strong resentment but not unreasonable ones as you will be convinced if already you are not so when you know all my story if ever you do know it for i begin to fear so many things more necessary to be thought of than either this man or my own vindication have i to do that i shall not have time to compass what i have intended and in a manner promised you see vol vi letter lxxiii i have one reason to give in support of my resolution that i believe yourself will allow of but having owned that i have resentments i will begin with those considerations in which anger and disappointment have too great a share in hopes that having once disburdened my mind upon paper and to my anna howe of those corroding uneasy passions i shall prevent them for ever from returning to my heart and to have their place supplied by better milder and more agreeable ones my pride then my dearest friend although a great deal mortified is not sufficiently mortified if it be necessary for me to submit to make that man my choice whose actions are and ought to be my abhorrence what shall i who have been treated with such premeditated and perfidious barbarity as is painful to be thought of and cannot with modesty be described think of taking the violator to my heart can i vow duty to one so wicked and hazard my salvation by joining myself to so great a profligate now i know him to be so do you think your clarissa harlowe so lost so sunk at least as that she could for the sake of patching up in the worlds eye a broken reputation meanly appear indebted to the generosity or perhaps compassion of a man who has by means so inhuman robbed her of it indeed my dear i should not think my penitence for the rash step i took any thing better than a specious delusion if i had not got above the least wish to have mr lovelace for my husband yes i warrant i must creep to the violator and be thankful to him for doing me poor justice do you not already see me pursuing the advice you give with a downcast eye appear before his friends and before my own supposing the latter would at last condescend to own me divested of that noble confidence which arises from a mind unconscious of having deserved reproach do you not see me creep about mine own house preferring all my honest maidens to myself as if afraid too to open my lips either by way of reproof or admonition lest their bolder eyes should bid me look inward and not expect perfection from them and shall i entitle the wretch to upbraid me with his generosity and his pity and perhaps to reproach me for having been capable of forgiving crimes of such a nature i once indeed hoped little thinking him so premeditatedly vile a man that i might have the happiness to reclaim him i vainly believed that he loved me well enough to suffer my advice for his good and the example i humbly presumed i should be enabled to set him to have weight with him and the rather as he had no mean opinion of my morals and understanding but now what hope is there left for this my prime hope were i to marry him what a figure should i make preaching virtue and morality to a man whom i had trusted with opportunities to seduce me from all my own duties and then supposing i were to have children by such a husband must it not think you cut a thoughtful person to the heart to look round upon her little family and think she had given them a father destined without a miracle to perdition and whose immoralities propagated among them by his vile example might too probably bring down a curse upon them and after all who knows but that my own sinful compliances with a man who might think himself entitled to my obedience might taint my own morals and make me instead of a reformer an imitator of him for who can touch pitch and not be defiled let me then repeat that i truly despise this man if i know my own heart indeed i do i pity him beneath my very pity as he is i nevertheless pity him but this i could not do if i still loved him for my dear one must be greatly sensible of the baseness and ingratitude of those we love i love him not therefore my soul disdains communion with him but although thus much is due to resentment yet have i not been so far carried away by its angry effects as to be rendered incapable of casting about what i ought to do and what could be done if the almighty in order to lengthen the time of my penitence were to bid me to live the single life at such times has offered to me as the life the only life to be chosen but in that must i not now sit brooding over my past afflictions and mourning my faults till the hour of my release and would not every one be able to assign the reason why clarissa harlowe chose solitude and to sequester herself from the world would not the look of every creature who beheld me appear as a reproach to me and would not my conscious eye confess my fault whether the eyes of others accused me or not one of my delights was to enter the cots of my poor neighbours to leave lessons to the boys and cautions to the elder girls and how should i be able unconscious and without pain to say to the latter fly the delusions of men who had been supposed to have run away with one what then my dear and only friend can i wish for but death and what after all is death tis but a cessation from mortal life tis but the finishing of an appointed course the refreshing inn after a fatiguing journey the end of a life of cares and troubles and if happy the beginning of a life of immortal happiness if i die not now it may possibly happen that i may be taken when i am less prepared had i escaped the evils i labour under it might have been in the midst of some gay promising hope when my heart had beat high with the desire of life and when the vanity of this earth had taken hold of me but now my dear for your satisfaction let me say that although i wish not for life yet would i not like a poor coward desert my post when i can maintain it and when it is my duty to maintain it more than once indeed was i urged by thoughts so sinful but then it was in the height of my distress and once particularly i have reason to believe i saved myself by my desperation from the most shocking personal insults from a repetition as far as i know of his vileness the base women with so much reason dreaded by me present to intimidate me if not to assist him o my dear you know not what i suffered on that occasion nor do i what i escaped at the time if the wicked man had approached me to execute the horrid purposes of his vile heart as i am of opinion that it would have manifested more of revenge and despair than of principle had i committed a violence upon myself when the villany was perpetrated so i should think it equally criminal were i now wilfully to neglect myself were i purposely to run into the arms of death as that man supposes i shall do when i might avoid it nor my dear whatever are the suppositions of such a shortsighted such a lowsouled man must you impute to gloom to melancholy to despondency nor yet to a spirit of faulty pride or still more faulty revenge the resolution i have taken never to marry this and if not this any man so far from deserving this imputation i do assure you my dear and only love that i will do every thing i can to prolong my life till god in mercy to me shall be pleased to call for it i have reason to think my punishment is but the due consequence of my fault and i will not run away from it but beg of heaven to sanctify it to me when appetite serves i will eat and drink what is sufficient to support nature a very little you know will do for that and whatever my physicians shall think fit to prescribe i will take though ever so disagreeable in short i will do every thing i can do to convince all my friends who hereafter may think it worth their while to inquire after my last behaviour that i possessed my soul with tolerable patience and endeavoured to bear with a lot of my own drawing for thus in humble imitation of the sublimest exemplar i often say lord it is thy will and it shall be mine thou art just in all thy dealings with the children of men and i know thou wilt not afflict me beyond what i can bear and if i can bear it i ought to bear it and thy grace assisting me i will bear it but here my dear is another reason a reason that will convince you yourself that i ought not to think of wedlock but of a preparation for a quite different event i am persuaded as much as that i am now alive that i shall not long live the strong sense i have ever had of my fault the loss of my reputation my disappointments the determined resentment of my friends aiding the barbarous usage i have met with where i least deserved it have seized upon my heart seized upon it before it was so well fortified by religious considerations as i hope it now is dont be concerned my dear but i am sure if i may say it with as little presumption as grief that god will soon dissolve my substance and bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living and now my dearest friend you know all my mind and you will be pleased to write to the ladies of mr lovelaces family that i think myself infinitely obliged to them for their good opinion of me and that it has given me greater pleasure than i thought i had to come in this life that upon the little knowledge they have of me and that not personal i was thought worthy after the ill usage i have received of an alliance with their honourable family but that i can by no means think of their kinsman for a husband and do you my dear extract from the above such reasons as you think have any weight with them i would write myself to acknowledge their favour had i not more employment for my head my heart and my fingers than i doubt they will be able to go through i should be glad to know when you set out on your journey as also your little stages and your time of stay at your aunt harmans that my prayers may locally attend you whithersoever you go and wherever you are clarissa harlowe letter xlii miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe sunday july the letter accompanying this being upon a very particular subject i would not embarrass it as i may say with any other and yet having some farther matters upon my mind which will want your excuse for directing them to you i hope the following lines will have that excuse my good mrs norton so long ago as in a letter dated the d of this month hinted to me that my relations took amiss some severe things you were pleased in love to me to say to them mrs norton mentioned it with that respectful love which she bears to my dearest friend but wished for my sake that you would rein in a vivacity which on most other occasions so charmingly becomes you this was her sense you know that i am warranted to speak and write freer to my anna howe than mrs norton would do see vol vi letter lxiii i durst not mention it to you at that time because appearances were so strong against me on mr lovelaces getting me again into his power after my escape to hampstead as made you very angry with me when you answered mine on my second escape and soon afterwards i was put under that barbarous arrest so that i could not well touch upon the subject till now now therefore my dearest miss howe let me repeat my earnest request for this is not the first time by several that i have been obliged to chide you on this occasion that you will spare my parents and other relations in all your conversations about me indeed i wish they had thought fit to take other measures with me but who shall judge for them the event has justified them and condemned me they expected nothing good of this vile man he had not therefore deceived them but they expected other things from me and i have and they have the more reason to be set against me if as my aunt hervey wrote formerly they intended not to force my inclinations in favour of mr solmes and if they believe that my going off was the effect of choice and premeditation see vol iii letter lii i have no desire to be received to favour by them for why should i sit down to wish for what i have no reason to expect besides i could not look them in the face if they would receive me indeed i could not all i have to hope for is first that my father will absolve me from his heavy malediction and next for a last blessing the obtaining of these favours are needful to my peace of mind i have written to my sister but have only mentioned the absolution i am afraid i shall receive a very harsh answer from her my fault in the eyes of my family is of so enormous a nature that my first application will hardly be encouraged then they know not nor perhaps will believe that i am so very ill as i am so that were i actually to die before they could have time to take the necessary informations you must not blame them too severely you must call it a fatality i know not what you must call it for alas i have made them as miserable as i am myself and yet sometimes i think that were they cheerfully to pronounce me forgiven i know not whether my concern for having offended them would not be augmented since i imagine that nothing can be more wounding to a spirit not ungenerous than a generous forgiveness i hope your mother will permit our correspondence for one month more although i do not take her advice as to having this man when catastrophes are winding up what changes changes that make ones heart shudder to think of may one short month produce but if she will not why then my dear it becomes us both to acquiesce you cant think what my apprehensions would have been had i known mr hickman was to have had a meeting on such a questioning occasion as must have been his errand from you with that haughty and uncontroulable man you give me hope of a visit from mr hickman let him expect to see me greatly altered i know he loves me for he loves every one whom you love a painful interview i doubt but i shall be glad to see a man whom you will one day and that on an early day i hope make happy whose gentle manners and unbounded love for you will make you so if it be not your own fault i am my dearest kindest friend the sweet companion of my happy hours the friend ever dearest and nearest to my fond heart your equally obliged and faithful clarissa harlowe letter xliii mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe monday july excuse my dearest young lady my long silence i have been extremely ill my poor boy has also been at deaths door and when i hoped that he was better he has relapsed alas my dear he is very dangerously ill let us both have your prayers very angry letters have passed between your sister and miss howe every one of your family is incensed against that young lady i wish you would remonstrate against her warmth since it can do no good for they will not believe but that her interposition had your connivance nor that you are so ill as miss howe assures them you are before she wrote they were going to send up young mr brand the clergyman to make private inquiries of your health and way of life but now they are so exasperated that they have laid aside their intention we have flying reports here and at harloweplace of some fresh insults which you have undergone and that you are about to put yourself into lady betty lawrances protection i believe they would not be glad as i should be that you would do so and this perhaps will make them suspend for the present any determination in your favour how unhappy am i that the dangerous way my son is in prevents my attendance on you let me beg of you to write to me word how you are both as to person and mind a servant of sir robert beachcroft who rides post on his masters business to town will present you with this and perhaps will bring me the favour of a few lines in return he will be obliged to stay in town several hours for an answer to his dispatches this is the anniversary that used to give joy to as many as had the pleasure and honour of knowing you may the almighty bless you and grant that it may be the only unhappy one that may ever be known by you my dearest young lady and by your ever affectionate judith norton letter xliv miss clarissa harlowe to mrs norton monday night july my dear mrs norton had i not fallen into fresh troubles which disabled me for several days from holding a pen i should not have forborne inquiring after your health and that of your son for i should have been but too ready to impute your silence to the cause to which to my very great concern i find it was owing i pray to heaven my dear good friend to give you comfort in the way most desirable to yourself i am exceedingly concerned at miss howes writing about me to my friends i do assure you that i was as ignorant of her intention so to do as of the contents of her letter nor has she yet let me know discouraged i suppose by her ill success that she did write it is impossible to share the delight which such charming spirits give without the inconvenience that will attend their volatility so mixed are our best enjoyments it was but yesterday that i wrote to chide the dear creature for freedoms of that nature which her unseasonablyexpressed love for me had made her take as you wrote me word in your former i was afraid that all such freedoms would be attributed to me and i am sure that nothing but my own application to my friends and a full conviction of my contrition will procure me favour least of all can i expect that either your mediation or hers both of whose fond and partial love of me is so well known will avail me she then gives a brief account of the arrest of her dejection under it of her apprehensions of being carried to her former lodgings of mr lovelaces avowed innocence as to that insult of her release by mr belford of mr lovelaces promise not to molest her of her clothes being sent her of the earnest desire of all his friends and of himself to marry her of miss howes advice to comply with their requests and of her declared resolution rather to die than be his sent to miss howe to be given to his relations but as the day before after which she thus proceeds now my dear mrs norton you will be surprised perhaps that i should have returned such an answer but when you have every thing before you you who know me so well will not think me wrong and besides i am upon a better preparation than for an earthly husband nor let it be imagined my dear and ever venerable friend that my present turn of mind proceeds from gloominess or melancholy for although it was brought on by disappointment the world showing me early even at my first rushing into it its true and ugly face yet i hope that it has obtained a better root and will every day more and more by its fruits demonstrate to me and to all my friends that it has i have written to my sister last friday i wrote so the die is thrown i hope for a gentle answer but perhaps they will not vouchsafe me any it is my first direct application you know i wish miss howe had left me to my own workings in this tender point it will be a great satisfaction to me to hear of your perfect recovery and that my fosterbrother is out of danger but why said i out of danger when can this be justly said of creatures who hold by so uncertain a tenure this is one of those forms of common speech that proves the frailty and the presumption of poor mortal at the same time dont be uneasy you cannot answer your wishes to be with me i am happier than i could have expected to be among mere strangers it was grievous at first but use reconciles every thing to us the people of the house where i am are courteous and honest there is a widow who lodges in it have i not said so formerly a good woman who is the better for having been a proficient in the school of affliction an excellent school my dear mrs norton in which we are taught to know ourselves to be able to compassionate and bear with one another and to look up to a better hope i have as humane a physician whose fees are his least regard and as worthy an apothecary as ever patient was visited by my nurse is diligent obliging silent and sober so i am not unhappy without and within i hope my dear mrs norton that i shall be every day more and more happy within no doubt it would be one of the greatest comforts i could know to have you with me you who love me so dearly who have been the watchful sustainer of my helpless infancy you by whose precepts i have been so much benefited in your dear bosom could i repose all my griefs and by your piety and experience in the ways of heaven should i be strengthened in what i am still to go through but as it must not be i will acquiesce and so i hope will you for you see in what respects i am not unhappy and in those that i am they lie not in your power to remedy then as i have told you i have all my clothes in my own possession so i am rich enough as to this world in common conveniencies you see my venerable and dear friend that i am not always turning the dark side of my prospects in order to move compassion a trick imputed to me too often by my hardhearted sister when if i know my own heart it is above all trick or artifice yet i hope at last i shall be so happy as to receive benefit rather than reproach from this talent if it be my talent at last i say for whose heart have i hitherto moved not one i am sure that was not predetermined in my favour as to the day i have passed it as i ought to pass it it has been a very heavy day to me more for my friends sake too than for my own how did they use to pass it what a festivity how have they now passed it to imagine it how grievous say not that those are cruel who suffer so much for my fault and who for eighteen years together rejoiced in me and rejoiced me by their indulgent goodness but i will think the rest adieu my dearest mrs norton adieu letter xlv miss clarissa harlowe to miss arabella harlowe friday july if my dearest sister i did not think the state of my health very precarious and that it was my duty to take this step i should hardly have dared to approach you although but with my pen after having found your censures so dreadfully justified as they have been i have not the courage to write to my father himself nor yet to my mother and it is with trembling that i address myself to you to beg of you to intercede for me that my father will have the goodness to revoke that heaviest part of the very heavy curse he laid upon me which relates to hereafter for as to the here i have indeed met with my punishment from the very wretch in whom i was supposed to place my confidence as i hope not for restoration to favour i may be allowed to be very earnest on this head yet will i not use any arguments in support of my request because i am sure my father were it in his power would not have his poor child miserable for ever i have the most grateful sense of my mothers goodness in sending me up my clothes i would have acknowledged the favour the moment i received them with the most thankful duty but that i feared any line from me would be unacceptable i would not give fresh offence so will decline all other commendations of duty and love appealing to my heart for both where both are flaming with an ardour that nothing but death can extinguish therefore only subscribe myself without so much as a name my dear and happy sister your afflicted servant a letter directed for me at mr smiths a glover in kingstreet coventgarden will come to hand letter xlvi mr belford to robert lovelace esq in answer to letters xxix xxxii of this volume edgware monday july what pains thou takest to persuade thyself that the ladys ill health is owing to the vile arrest and to the implacableness of her friends both primarily if they were to be laid at thy door what poor excuses will good hearts make for the evils they are put upon by bad hearts but tis no wonder that he who can sit down premeditatedly to do a bad action will content himself with a bad excuse and yet what fools must he suppose the rest of the world to be if he imagines them as easy to be imposed upon as he can impose upon himself in vain dost thou impute to pride or wilfulness the necessity to which thou hast reduced this lady of parting with her clothes for can she do otherwise and be the nobleminded creature she is her implacable friends have refused her the current cash she left behind her and wished as her sister wrote to her to see her reduced to want probably therefore they will not be sorry that she is reduced to such straights and will take it for a justification from heaven of their wicked hard heartedness thou canst not suppose she would take supplies from thee to take them from me would in her opinion be taking them from thee miss howes mother is an avaricious woman and perhaps the daughter can do nothing of that sort unknown to her and if she could is too noble a girl to deny it if charged and then miss harlowe is firmly of opinion that she shall never want nor wear the think she disposes of having heard nothing from town that obliges me to go thither i shall gratify poor belton with my company till tomorrow or perhaps till wednesday for the unhappy man is more and more loth to part with me i shall soon set out for epsom to endeavour to serve him there and reinstate him in his own house poor fellow he is most horribly low spirited mopes about and nothing diverts him i pity him at my heart but can do him no good what consolation can i give him either from his past life or from his future prospects our friendships and intimacies lovelace are only calculated for strong life and health when sickness comes we look round us and upon one another like frighted birds at the sight of a kite ready to souse upon them then with all our bravery what miserable wretches are we thou tallest me that thou seest reformation is coming swiftly upon me i hope it is i see so much difference in the behaviour of this admirable woman in her illness and that of poor belton in his that it is plain to me the sinner is the real coward and the saint the true hero and sooner or later we shall all find it to be so if we are not cut off suddenly the lady shut herself up at six oclock yesterday afternoon and intends not to see company till seven or eight this not even her nurse imposing upon herself a severe fast and why it is her birthday every birthday till this no doubt happy what must be her reflections what ought to be thine what sport dost thou make with my aspirations and my prostrations as thou callest them and with my dropping of the banknote behind her chair i had too much awe of her at the time to make it with the grace that would better have become my intention but the action if awkward was modest indeed the fitter subject for ridicule with thee who canst no more taste the beauty and delicacy of modest obligingness than of modest love for the same may be said of inviolable respect that the poet says of unfeigned affection i speak i know not what speak ever so and if i answer you i know not what it shows the more of love love is a child that talks in broken language yet then it speaks most plain the like may be pleaded in behalf of that modest respect which made the humble offerer afraid to invade the awful eye or the revered hand but awkwardly to drop its incense behind the altar it should have been laid upon but how should that soul which could treat delicacy itself brutally know any thing of this but i am still more amazed at thy courage to think of throwing thyself in the way of miss howe and miss arabella harlowe thou wilt not dare surely to carry this thought into execution as to my dress and thy dress i have only to say that the sum total of thy observation is this that my outside is the worst of me and thine the best of thee and what gettest thou by the comparison do thou reform the one ill try to mend the other i challenge thee to begin mrs lovick gave me at my request the copy of a meditation she showed me which was extracted by the lady from the scriptures while under arrest at rowlands as appears by the date the lady is not to know that i have taken a copy you and i always admired the noble simplicity and natural ease and dignity of style which are the distinguishing characteristics of these books whenever any passages from them by way of quotation in the works of other authors popt upon us and once i remember you even you observed that those passages always appeared to you like a rich vein of golden ore which runs through baser metals embellishing the work they were brought to authenticate try lovelace if thou canst relish a divine beauty i think it must strike transient if not permanent remorse into thy heart thou boastest of thy ingenuousness let this be the test of it and whether thou canst be serious on a subject too deep the occasion of it resulting from thyself meditation saturday july o that my grief were thoroughly weighed and my calamity laid in the balance together for now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea therefore my words are swallowed up for the arrows of the almighty are within me the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit the terrors of god do set themselves in array against me when i lie down i say when shall i arise when will the night be gone and i am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day my days are swifter than a weavers shuttle and are spent without hope mine eye shall no more see good wherefore is light given to her that is in misery and life unto the bitter in soul who longeth for death but it cometh not and diggeth for it more than for hid treasures why is light given to one whose way is hid and whom god hath hedged in for the thing which i greatly feared is come upon me i was not in safety neither had i rest neither was i quiet yet trouble came but behold god is mighty and despiseth not any he giveth right to the poor and if they be found in fetters and holden in cords of affliction then he showeth them their works and their transgressions i have a little leisure and am in a scribbing vein indulge me lovelace a few reflections on these sacred books we are taught to read the bible when children as a rudiment only and as far as i know this may be the reason why we think ourselves above it when at a maturer age for you know that our parents as well as we wisely rate our proficiency by the books we are advanced to and not by our understanding of those we have passed through but in my uncles illness i had the curiosity in some of my dull hours lighting upon one in his closet to dip into it and then i found wherever i turned that there were admirable things in it i have borrowed one on receiving from mrs lovick the above meditation for i had a mind to compare the passages contained in it by the book hardly believing they could be so exceedingly apposite as i find they are and one time or another it is very likely that i shall make a resolution to give the whole bible a perusal by way of course as i may say this meantime i will venture to repeat is certain that the style is that truly easy simple and natural one which we should admire in each other authors excessively then all the world join in an opinion of the antiquity and authenticity too of the book and the learned are fond of strengthening their different arguments by its sanctions indeed i was so much taken with it at my uncles that i was half ashamed that it appeared so new to me and yet i cannot but say that i have some of the old testament history as it is called in my head but perhaps am more obliged for it to josephus than to the bible itself odd enough with all our pride of learning that we choose to derive the little we know from the under currents perhaps muddy ones too when the clear the pellucid fountainhead is much nearer at hand and easier to be come at slighted the more possibly for that very reason but man is a pragmatical foolish creature and the more we look into him the more we must despise him lords of the creation who can forbear indignant laughter when we see not one of the individuals of that creation his perpetuallyeccentric self excepted but acts within its own natural and original appointment is of fancied and selfdependent excellence he is obliged not only for the ornaments but for the necessaries of life that is to say for food as well as raiment to all the other creatures strutting with their blood and spirits in his veins and with their plumage on his back for what has he of his own but a very mischievous monkeylike bad nature yet thinks himself at liberty to kick and cuff and elbow out every worthier creature and when he has none of the animal creation to hunt down and abuse will make use of his power his strength or his wealth to oppress the less powerful and weaker of his own species when you and i meet next let us enter more largely into this subject and i dare say we shall take it by turns in imitation of the two sages of antiquity to laugh and to weep at the thoughts of what miserable yet conceited beings men in general but we libertines in particular are i fell upon a piece at dorrells this very evening intituled the sacred classics written by one blackwell i took it home with me and had not read a dozen pages when i was convinced that i ought to be ashamed of myself to think how greatly i have admired less noble and less natural beauties in pagan authors while i have known nothing of this allexciting collection of beauties the bible by my faith lovelace i shall for the future have a better opinion of the good sense and taste of half a score of parsons whom i have fallen in with in my time and despised for magnifying as i thought they did the language and the sentiments to be found in it in preference to all the ancient poets and philosophers and this is now a convincing proof to me and shames as much an infidels presumption as his ignorance that those who know least are the greatest scoffers a pretty pack of wouldbe wits of us who censure without knowledge laugh without reason and are most noisy and loud against things we know least of letter xlvii mr belford to robert lovelace esq wednesday july i came not to town till this morning early poor belton clinging to me as a man destitute of all other hold i hastened to smiths and had but a very indifferent account of the ladys health i sent up my compliments and she desired to see me in the afternoon mrs lovick told me that after i went away on saturday she actually parted with one of her best suits of clothes to a gentlewoman who is her mrs lovicks benefactress and who bought them for a niece who is very speedily to be married and whom she fits out and portions as her intended heiress the lady was so jealous that the money might come from you or me that she would see the purchaser who owned to mrs lovick that she bought them for half their worth but yet though her conscience permitted her to take them at such an under rate the widow says her friend admired the lady as one of the loveliest of her sex and having been let into a little of her story could not help shedding tears at taking away her purchase she may be a good sort of woman mrs lovick says she is but self is an odious devil that reconciles to some people the most cruel and dishonest actions but nevertheless it is my opinion that those who can suffer themselves to take advantage of the necessities of their fellowcreatures in order to buy any thing at a less rate than would allow them the legal interest of their purchasemoney supposing they purchase before they want are no better than robbers for the difference to plunder a wreck and to rob at a fire are indeed higher degrees of wickedness but do not those as well as these heighten the distresses of the distressed and heap misery on the miserable whom it is the duty of every one to relieve about three oclock i went again to smiths the lady was writing when i sent up my name but admitted of my visit i saw a miserable alteration in her countenance for the worse and mrs lovick respectfully accusing her of too great assiduity to her pen early and late and of her abstinence the day before i took notice of the alteration and told her that her physician had greater hopes of her than she had of herself and i would take the liberty to say that despair of recovery allowed not room for cure she said she neither despaired nor hoped then stepping to the glass with great composure my countenance said she is indeed an honest picture of my heart but the mind will run away with the body at any time writing is all my diversion continued she and i have subjects that cannot be dispensed with as to my hours i have always been an early riser but now rest is less in my power than ever sleep has a long time ago quarreled with me and will not be friends although i have made the first advances what will be must she then stept to her closet and brought me a parcel sealed up with three seals be so kind said she as to give this to your friend a very grateful present it ought to be to him for sir this packet contains such letters of his to me as compared with his actions would reflect dishonour upon all his sex were they to fall into other hands as to my letters to him they are not many he may either keep or destroy them as he pleases i thought lovelace i ought not to forego this opportunity to plead for you i therefore with the packet in my hand urged all the arguments i could think of in your favour she heard me out with more attention than i could have promised myself considering her determined resolution i would not interrupt you mr belford said she though i am far from being pleased with the subject of your discourse the motives for your pleas in his favour are generous i love to see instances of generous friendship in either sex but i have written my full mind on this subject to miss howe who will communicate it to the ladies of his family no more therefore i pray you upon a topic that may lead to disagreeable recrimination her apothecary came in he advised her to the air and blamed her for so great an application as he was told she made to her pen and he gave it as the doctors opinion as well as his own that she would recover if she herself desired to recover and would use the means she may possibly write too much for her health but i have observed on several occasions that when the medical men are at a loss what to prescribe they inquire what their patients like best or are most diverted with and forbid them that but noble minded as they see this lady is they know not half her nobleness of mind nor how deeply she is wounded and depend too much upon her youth which i doubt will not do in this case and upon time which will not alleviate the woes of such a mind for having been bent upon doing good and upon reclaiming a libertine whom she loved she is disappointed in all her darling views and will never be able i fear to look up with satisfaction enough in herself to make life desirable to her for this lady had other views in living than the common ones of eating sleeping dressing visiting and those other fashionable amusements which fill up the time of most of her sex especially of those of it who think themselves fitted to shine in and adorn polite assemblies her grief in short seems to me to be of such a nature that time which alleviates most other persons afflictions will as the poet says give increase to hers thou lovelace mightest have seen all this superior excellence as thou wentest along in every word in every sentiment in every action is it visible but thy cursed inventions and intriguing spirit ran away with thee tis fit that the subject of thy wicked boast and thy reflections on talents so egregiously misapplied should be thy punishment and thy curse mr goddard took his leave and i was going to do so too when the maid came up and told her a gentleman was below who very earnestly inquired after her health and desired to see her his name hickman she was overjoyed and bid the maid desire the gentleman to walk up i would have withdrawn but i supposed she thought it was likely i should have met him upon the stairs and so she forbid it she shot to the stairshead to receive him and taking his hand asked half a dozen questions without waiting for any answer in relation to miss howes health acknowledging in high terms her goodness in sending him to see her before she set out upon her little journey he gave her a letter from that young lady which she put into her bosom saying she would read it byandby he was visibly shocked to see how ill she looked you look at me with concern mr hickman said she o sir times are strangely altered with me since i saw you last at my dear miss howes what a cheerful creature was i then my heart at rest my prospects charming and beloved by every body but i will not pain you indeed madam said he i am grieved for you at my soul he turned away his face with visible grief in it her own eyes glistened but she turned to each of us presenting one to the other him to me as a gentleman truly deserving to be called so me to him as your friend indeed how was i at that instant ashamed of myself but nevertheless as a man of humanity detesting my friends baseness and desirous of doing her all manner of good offices mr hickman received my civilities with a coldness which however was rather to be expected on your account than that it deserved exception on mine and the lady invited us both to breakfast with her in the morning he being obliged to return the next day i left them together and called upon mr dorrell my attorney to consult him upon poor beltons affairs and then went home and wrote thus far preparative to what may occur in my breakfastingvisit in the morning letter xlviii mr belford to robert lovelace esq thursday july i went this morning according to the ladys invitation to breakfast and found mr hickman with her a good deal of heaviness and concern hung upon his countenance but he received me with more respect than he did yesterday which i presume was owing to the ladys favourable character of me he spoke very little for i suppose they had all their talk out yesterday and before i came this morning by the hints that dropped i perceived that miss howes letter gave an account of your interview with her at col ambroses of your professions to miss howe and miss howes opinion that marrying you was the only way now left to repair her wrongs mr hickman as i also gathered had pressed her in miss howes name to let her on her return from the isle of wight find her at a neighbouring farmhouse where neat apartments would be made ready to receive her she asked how long it would be before they returned and he told her it was proposed to be no more than a fortnight out and in upon which she said she should then perhaps have time to consider of that kind proposal he had tendered her money from miss howe but could not induce her to take any no wonder i was refused she only said that if she had occasion she would be obliged to nobody but miss howe mr goddard her apothecary came in before breakfast was over at her desire he sat down with us mr hickman asked him if he could give him any consolation in relation to miss harlowes recovery to carry down to a friend who loved her as she loved her own life the lady said he will do very well if she will resolve upon it herself indeed you will madam the doctor is entirely of this opinion and has ordered nothing for you but weak jellies and innocent cordials lest you should starve yourself and let me tell you madam that so much watching so little nourishment and so much grief as you seem to indulge is enough to impair the most vigorous health and to wear out the strongest constitution what sir said she can i do i have no appetite nothing you call nourishing will stay on my stomach i do what i can and have such kind directors in dr h and you that i should be inexcusable if i did not ill give you a regimen madam replied he which i am sure the doctor will approve of and will make physic unnecessary in your case and that is go to rest at ten at night rise not till seven in the morning let your breakfast be watergruel or milkpottage or weak broths your dinner any thing you like so you will but eat a dish of tea with milk in the afternoon and sago for your supper and my life for yours this diet and a months country air will set you up we were much pleased with the worthy gentlemans disinterested regimen and she said referring to her nurse who vouched for her pray mr hickman let miss howe know the good hands i am in and as to the kind charge of the gentleman assure her that all i promised to her in the longest of my two last letters on the subject of my health i do and will to the utmost of my power observe i have engaged sir to mr goddard i have engaged sir to me to miss howe to avoid all wilful neglects it would be an unpardonable fault and very ill become the character i would be glad to deserve or the temper of mind i wish my friends hereafter to think me mistress of if i did not mr hickman and i went afterwards to a neighbouring coffeehouse and he gave me some account of your behaviour at the ball on monday night and of your treatment of him in the conference he had with you before that which he represented in a more favourable light than you had done yourself and yet he gave his sentiments of you with great freedom but with the politeness of a gentleman he told me how very determined the lady was against marrying you that she had early this morning set herself to write a letter to miss howe in answer to one he brought her which he was to call for at twelve it being almost finished before he saw her at breakfast and that at three he proposed to set out on his return he told me that miss howe and her mother and himself were to begin their little journey for the isle of wight on monday next but that he must make the most favourable representation of miss harlowes bad health or they should have a very uneasy absence he expressed the pleasure he had in finding the lady in such good hands he proposed to call on dr h to take his opinion whether it were likely she would recover and hoped he should find it favourable as he was resolved to make the best of the matter and as the lady had refused to accept of the money offered by mr hickman i said nothing of her parting with her clothes i thought it would serve no other end to mention it but to shock miss howe for it has such a sound with it that a woman of her rank and fortune should be so reduced that i cannot myself think of it with patience nor know i but one man in the world who can this gentleman is a little finical and formal modest or diffident men wear not soon off those little precisenesses which the confident if ever they had them presently get above because they are too confident to doubt any thing but i think mr hickman is an agreeable sensible man and not at all deserving of the treatment or the character you give him but you are really a strange mortal because you have advantages in your person in your air and intellect above all the men i know and a face that would deceive the devil you cant think any man else tolerable it is upon this modest principle that thou deridest some of us who not having thy confidence in their outside appearance seek to hide their defects by the tailors and perukemakers assistance mistakenly enough if it be really done so absurdly as to expose them more and sayest that we do but hang out a sign in our dress of what we have in the shop of our minds this no doubt thou thinkest is smartly observed but prythee lovelace let me tell thee if thou canst what sort of a sign must thou hang out wert thou obliged to give us a clear idea by it of the furniture of thy mind mr hickman tells me he should have been happy with miss howe some weeks ago for all the settlements have been some time engrossed but that she will not marry she declares while her dear friend is so unhappy this is truly a charming instance of the force of female friendship which you and i and our brother rakes have constantly ridiculed as a chimerical thing in women of equal age and perfections but really lovelace i see more and more that there are not in the world with our conceited pride narrowersouled wretches than we rakes and libertines are and ill tell thee how it comes about our early love of roguery makes us generally run away from instruction and so we become mere smatterers in the sciences we are put to learn and because we will know no more think there is no more to be known with an infinite deal of vanity unreined imaginations and no judgments at all we next commence halfwits and then think we have the whole field of knowledge in possession and despise every one who takes more pains and is more serious than ourselves as phlegmatic stupid fellows who have no taste for the most poignant pleasures of life this makes us insufferable to men of modesty and merit and obliges us to herd with those of our own cast and by this means we have no opportunities of seeing or conversing with any body who could or would show us what we are and so we conclude that we are the cleverest fellows in the world and the only men of spirit in it and looking down with supercilious eyes on all who gave not themselves the liberties we take imagine the world made for us and for us only thus as to useful knowledge while others go to the bottom we only skim the surface are despised by people of solid sense of true honour and superior talents and shutting our eyes move round and round like so many blind millhorses in one narrow circle while we imagine we have all the world to range in i threw myself in mr hickmans way on his return from the lady he was excessively moved at taking leave of her being afraid as he said to me though he would not tell her so that he should never see her again she charged him to represent every thing to miss howe in the most favourable light that the truth would bear he told me of a tender passage at parting which was that having saluted her at her closetdoor he could not help once more taking the same liberty in a more fervent manner at the stairshead whither she accompanied him and this in the thought that it was the last time he should ever have that honour and offering to apologize for his freedom for he had pressed her to his heart with a vehemence that he could neither account for or resist excuse you mr hickman that i will you are my brother and my friend and to show you that the good man who is to be happy with my beloved miss howe is very dear to me you shall carry to her this token of my love offering her sweet face to his salute and pressing his hand between hers and perhaps her love of me will make it more agreeable to her than her punctilio would otherwise allow it to be and tell her said she dropping on one knee with clasped hands and uplifted eyes that in this posture you see me in the last moment of our parting begging a blessing upon you both and that you may be the delight and comfort of each other for many very many happy years tears said he fell from my eyes i even sobbed with mingled joy and sorrow and she retreating as soon as i raised her i went down stairs highly dissatisfied with myself for going yet unable to stay my eyes fixed the contrary way to my feet as long as i could behold the skirts of her raiment i went to the backshop continued the worthy man and recommended the angelic lady to the best care of mrs smith and when i was in the street cast my eye up at her window there for the last time i doubt said he that i shall ever behold her i saw her and she waved her charming hand to me and with such a look of smiling goodness and mingled concern as i cannot describe prythee tell me thou vile lovelace if thou hast not a notion even from these jejune descriptions of mine that there must be a more exalted pleasure in intellectual friendship than ever thou couldst taste in the gross fumes of sensuality and whether it may not be possible for thee in time to give that preference to the infinitely preferable which i hope now that i shall always give i will leave thee to make the most of this reflection from thy true friend j belford letter xlix miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe thursday july text error should be tuesday your two affecting letters were brought to me as i had directed any letter from you should be to the colonels about an hour before we broke up i could not forbear dipping into them there and shedding more tears over them than i will tell you of although i dried my eyes as well as i could that the company i was obliged to return to and my mother should see as little of my concern as possible i am yet and was then still more excessively fluttered the occasion i will communicate to you byandby for nothing but the flutters given by the stroke of death could divert my first attention from the sad and solemn contents of your last favour these therefore i must begin with how can i bear the thoughts of losing so dear a friend i will not so much as suppose it indeed i cannot such a mind as yours was not vested in humanity to be snatched away from us so soon there must still be a great deal for you to do for the good of all who have the happiness to know you you enumerate in your letter of thursday last the particulars in which your situation is already mended let me see by effects that you are in earnest in that enumeration and that you really have the courage to resolve to get above the sense of injuries you could not avoid and then will i trust to providence and my humble prayers for your perfect recovery and glad at my heart shall i be on my return from the little island to find you well enough to be near us according to the proposal mr hickman has to make to you see vol vii letter xxv you chide me in yours of sunday on the freedom i take with your friends ibid letter xlii i may be warm i know i am too warm yet warmth in friendship surely cannot be a crime especially when our friend has great merit labours under oppression and is struggling with undeserved calamity i have no opinion of coolness in friendship be it dignified or distinguished by the name of prudence or what it will you may excuse your relations it was ever your way to do so but my dear other people must be allowed to judge as they please i am not their daughter nor the sister of your brother and sister i thank heaven i am not but if you are displeased with me for the freedoms i took so long ago as you mention i am afraid if you knew what passed upon an application i made to your sister very lately in hopes to procure you the absolution your heart is so much set upon that you would be still more concerned but they have been even with me but i must not tell you all i hope however that these unforgivers my mother is among them were always good dutiful passive children to their parents once more forgive me i owned i was too warm but i have no example to the contrary but from you and the treatment you meet with is very little encouragement to me to endeavour to imitate you in your dutiful meekness you leave it to me to give a negative to the hopes of the noble family whose only disgrace is that so very vile a man is so nearly related to them but yet alas my dear i am so fearful of consequences so selfishly fearful if this negative must be given i dont know what i should say but give me leave to suspend however this negative till i hear from you again this earnest courtship of you into their splendid family is so very honourable to you they so justly admire you you must have had such a noble triumph over the base man he is so much in earnest the world knows so much of the unhappy affair you may do still so much good your will is so inviolate your relations are so implacable think my dear and rethink and let me leave you to do so while i give you the occasion of the flutter i mentioned at the beginning of this letter in the conclusion of which you will find the obligation i have consented to lay myself under to refer this important point once more to your discussion before i give in your name the negative that cannot when given be with honour to yourself repented of or recalled know then my dear that i accompanied my mother to colonel ambroses on the occasion i mentioned to you in my former many ladies and gentlemen were there whom you know particularly miss kitty doily miss lloyd miss biddy dollyffe miss biddulph and their respective admirers with the colonels two nieces fine women both besides many whom you know not for they were strangers to me but by name a splendid company and all pleased with one another till colonel ambrose introduced one who the moment he was brought into the great hall set the whole assembly into a kind of agitation it was your villain i thought i should have sunk as soon as i set my eyes upon him my mother was also affected and coming to me nancy whispered she can you bear the sight of that wretch without too much emotion if not withdraw into the next apartment i could not remove every bodys eyes were glanced from him to me i sat down and fanned myself and was forced to order a glass of water oh that i had the eye the basilisk is reported to have thought i and that his life were within the power of it directly would i kill him he entered with an air so hateful to me but so agreeable to every other eye that i could have looked him dead for that too after the general salutations he singled out mr hickman and told him he had recollected some parts of his behaviour to him when he saw him last which had made him think himself under obligation to his patience and politeness and so indeed he was miss doily upon his complimenting her among a knot of ladies asked him in their hearing how miss clarissa harlowe did he heard he said you were not so well as he wished you to be and as you deserved to be o mr lovelace said she what have you to answer for on that young ladys account if all be true that i have heard i have a great deal to answer for said the unblushing villain but that dear lady has so many excellencies and so much delicacy that little sins are great ones in her eye little sins replied miss doily mr lovelaces character is so well known that nobody believes he can commit little sins you are very good to me miss doily indeed i am not then i am the only person to whom you are not very good and so i am the less obliged to you he turned with an unconcerned air to miss playford and made her some genteel compliments i believe you know her not she visits his cousins montague indeed he had something in his specious manner to say to every body and this too soon quieted the disgust each person had at his entrance i still kept my seat and he either saw me not or would not yet see me and addressing himself to my mother taking her unwilling hand with an air of high assurance i am glad to see you here madam i hope miss howe is well i have reason to complain greatly of her but hope to owe to her the highest obligation that can be laid on man my daughter sir is accustomed to be too warm and too zealous in her friendships for either my tranquility or her own there had indeed been some late occasion given for mutual displeasure between my mother and me but i think she might have spared this to him though nobody heard it i believe but the person to whom it was spoken and the lady who told it me for my mother spoke it low we are not wholly madam to live for ourselves said the vile hypocrite it is not every one who had a soul capable of friendship and what a heart must that be which can be insensible to the interests of a suffering friend this sentiment from mr lovelaces mouth said my mother forgive me sir but you can have no end surely in endeavouring to make me think as well of you as some innocent creatures have thought of you to their cost she would have flung from him but detaining her hand less severe dear madam said he be less severe in this place i beseech you you will allow that a very faulty person may see his errors and when he does and owns them and repents should he not be treated mercifully your air sir seems not to be that of a penitent but the place may as properly excuse this subject as what you call my severity but dearest madam permit me to say that i hope for your interest with your charming daughter was his syncophant word to have it put in my power to convince all the world that there never was a truer penitent and why why this anger dear madam for she struggled to get her hand out of his these violent airs so maidenly impudent fellow may i not ask if miss howe be here she would not have been here replied my mother had she known whom she had been to see and is she here then thank heaven he disengaged her hand and stept forward into company dear miss lloyd said he with an air taking her hand as he quitted my mothers tell me tell me is miss arabella harlowe here or will she be here i was informed she would and this and the opportunity of paying my compliments to your friend miss howe were great inducements with me to attend the colonel superlative assurance was it not my dear miss arabella harlowe excuse me sir said miss lloyd would be very little inclined to meet you here or any where else perhaps so my dear miss lloyd but perhaps for that very reason i am more desirous to see her miss harlowe sir and miss biddulph with a threatening air will hardly be here without her brother i imagine if one comes both will come heaven grant they both may said the wretch nothing miss biddulph shall begin from me to disturb this assembly i assure you if they do one calm halfhours conversation with that brother and sister would be a most fortunate opportunity to me in presence of the colonel and his lady or whom else they should choose then turning round as if desirous to find out the one or the other he spied me and with a very low bow approached me i was all in a flutter you may suppose he would have taken my hand i refused it all glowing with indignation every bodys eyes upon us i went down from him to the other end of the room and sat down as i thought out of his hated sight but presently i heard his odious voice whispering behind my chair he leaning upon the back of it with impudent unconcern charming miss howe looking over my shoulder one request i started up from my seat but could hardly stand neither for very indignation o this sweet but becoming disdain whispered on the insufferable creature i am sorry to give you all this emotion but either here or at your own house let me entreat from you one quarter of an hours audience i beseech you madam but one quarter of an hour in any of the adjoining apartments not for a kingdom fluttering my fan i knew not what i did but i could have killed him we are so much observed else on my knees my dear miss howe would i beg your interest with your charming friend shell have nothing to say to you i had not then your letters my dear killing words but indeed i have deserved them and a dagger in my heart besides i am so conscious of my demerits that i have no hope but in your interposition could i owe that favour to miss howes mediation which i cannot hope for on any other account my mediation vilest of men my mediation i abhor you from my soul i abhor you vilest of men three or four times i repeated these words stammering too i was excessively fluttered you can tell me nothing madam so bad as i will call myself i have been indeed the vilest of men but now i am not so permit me every bodys eyes are upon us but one moments audience to exchange but ten words with you dearest miss howe in whose presence you please for your dear friends sake but ten words with you in the next apartment it is an insult upon me to presume that i would exchange with you if i could help it out of my way out of my sight fellow and away i would have flung but he took my hand i was excessively disordered every bodys eyes more and more intent upon us mr hickman whom my mother had drawn on one side to enjoin him a patience which perhaps needed not to have been enforced came up just then with my mother who had him by his leadingstrings by his sleeve i should say mr hickman said the bold wretch be my advocate but for ten words in the next apartment with miss howe in your presence and in yours madam to my mother hear nancy what he has to say to you to get rid of him hear his ten words excuse me madam his very breath unhand me sir he sighed and looked o how the practised villain sighed and looked he then let go my hand with such a reverence in his manner as brought blame upon me from some that i would not hear him and this incensed me the more o my dear this man is a devil this man is indeed a devil so much patience when he pleases so much gentleness yet so resolute so persisting so audacious i was going out of the assembly in great disorder he was at the door as soon as i how kind this is said the wretch and ready to follow me opened the door for me i turned back upon this and not knowing what i did snapped my fan just in his face as he turned short upon me and the powder flew from his hair every body seemed as much pleased as i was vexed he turned to mr hickman nettled at the powder flying and at the smiles of the company upon him mr hickman you will be one of the happiest men in the world because you are a good man and will do nothing to provoke this passionate lady and because she has too much good sense to be provoked without reason but else the lord have mercy upon you this man this mr hickman my dear is too meek for a man indeed he is but my patient mother twits me that her passionate daughter ought to like him the better for that but meek men abroad are not always meek at home i have observed that in more instances than one and if they were i should not i verily think like them the better for being so he then turned to my mother resolved to be even with her too where good madam could miss howe get all this spirit the company around smiled for i need not tell you that my mothers high spiritedness is pretty well known and she sadly vexed said sir you treat me as you do the rest of the world but i beg pardon madam interrupted he i might have spared my question and instantly i retiring to the other end of the hall he turned to miss playford what would i give madam to hear you sing that song you obliged us with at lord ms he then as if nothing had happened fell into a conversation with her and miss dollyffe upon music and whisperingly sung to miss playford holding her two hands with such airs of genteel unconcern that it vexed me not a little to look round and see how pleased half the giddy fools of our sex were with him notwithstanding his notorious wicked character to this it is that such vile fellows owe much of their vileness whereas if they found themselves shunned and despised and treated as beasts of prey as they are they would run to their caverns there howl by themselves and none but such as sad accident or unpitiable presumption threw in their way would suffer by them he afterwards talked very seriously at times to mr hickman at times i say for it was with such breaks and starts of gaiety turning to this lady and to that and then to mr hickman again resuming a serious or a gay air at pleasure that he took every bodys eye the womens especially who were full of their whispering admirations of him qualified with ifs and buts and what pitys and such sort of stuff that showed in their very dispraises too much liking well may our sex be the sport and ridicule of such libertines unthinking eyegoverned creatures would not a little reflection teach us that a man of merit must be a man of modesty because a diffident one and that such a wretch as this must have taken his degrees in wickedness and gone through a course of vileness before he could arrive at this impenetrable effrontery an effrontery which can produce only from the light opinion he has of us and the high one of himself but our sex are generally modest and bashful themselves and are too apt to consider that which in the main is their principal grace as a defect and finely do they judge when they think of supplying that defect by choosing a man that cannot be ashamed his discourse to mr hickman turned upon you and his acknowledged injuries of you though he could so lightly start from the subject and return to it i have no patience with such a devil man he cannot be called to be sure he would behave in the same manner any where or in any presence even at the altar itself if a woman were with him there it shall ever be a rule with me that he who does not regard a woman with some degree of reverence will look upon her and occasionally treat her with contempt he had the confidence to offer to take me out but i absolutely refused him and shunned him all i could putting on the most contemptuous airs but nothing could mortify him i wished twenty times i had not been there the gentlemen were as ready as i to wish he had broken his neck rather than been present i believe for nobody was regarded but he so little of the fop yet so elegant and rich in his dress his person so specious his air so intrepid so much meaning and penetration in his face so much gaiety yet so little affectation no mere toupetman but all manly and his courage and wit the one so known the other so dreaded you must think the petitsmatres of which there were four or five present were most deplorably off in his company and one grave gentleman observed to me pleased to see me shun him as i did that the poets observation was too true that the generality of ladies were rakes in their hearts or they could not be so much taken with a man who had so notorious a character i told him the reflection both of the poet and applier was much too general and made with more illnature than good manners when the wretch saw how industriously i avoided him shifting from one part of the hall to another he at last boldly stept up to me as my mother and mr hickman were talking to me and thus before them accosted me i beg your pardon madam but by your mothers leave i must have a few moments conversation with you either here or at your own house and i beg you will give me the opportunity nancy said my mother hear what he has to say to you in my presence you may and better in the adjoining apartment if it must be than to come to you at our own house i retired to one corner of the hall my mother following me and he taking mr hickman under his arm following her well sir said i what have you to say tell me here i have been telling mr hickman said he how much i am concerned for the injuries i have done to the most excellent woman in the world and yet that she obtained such a glorious triumph over me the last time i had the honour to see her as with my penitence ought to have abated her former resentments but that i will with all my soul enter into any measures to obtain her forgiveness of me my cousins montague have told you this lady betty and lady sarah and my lord m are engaged for my honour i know your power with the dear creature my cousins told me you gave them hopes you would use it in my behalf my lord m and his two sisters are impatiently expecting the fruits of it you must have heard from her before now i hope you have and will you be so good as to tell me if i may have any hopes if i must speak on this subject let me tell you that you have broken her heart you know not the value of the lady you have injured you deserve her not and she despises you as she ought dear miss howe mingle not passion with denunciations so severe i must know my fate i will go abroad once more if i find her absolutely irreconcileable but i hope she will give me leave to attend upon her to know my doom from her own mouth it would be death immediate for her to see you and what must you be to be able to look her in the face i then reproached him with vehemence enough you may believe on his baseness and the evils he had made you suffer the distress he had reduced you to all your friends made your enemies the vile house he had carried you to hinted at his villanous arts the dreadful arrest and told him of your present deplorable illness and resolution to die rather than to have him he vindicated not any part of his conduct but that of the arrest and so solemnly protested his sorrow for his usage of you accusing himself in the freest manner and by deserved appellations that i promised to lay before you this part of our conversation and now you have it my mother as well as mr hickman believes from what passed on this occasion that he is touched in conscience for the wrongs he has done you but by his whole behaviour i must own it seems to me that nothing can touch him for half an hour together yet i have no doubt that he would willingly marry you and it piques his pride i could see that he should be denied as it did mine that such a wretch had dared to think it in his power to have such a woman whenever he pleased and that it must be accounted a condescension and matter of obligation by all his own family at least that he would vouchsafe to think of marriage now my dear you have before you the reason why i suspend the decisive negative to the ladies of his family my mother miss lloyd and miss biddulph who were inquisitive after the subject of our retired conversation and whose curiosity i thought it was right in some degree to gratify especially as these young ladies are of our select acquaintance are all of opinion that you should be his you will let mr hickman know your whole mind and when he acquaint me with it i will tell you all my own mean time may the news he will bring me of the state of your health be favourable prays with the utmost fervency your ever faithful and affectionate anna howe letter l miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe thursday july my dearest miss howe after i have thankfully acknowledged your favour in sending mr hickman to visit me before you set out upon your intended journey i must chide you in the sincerity of that faithful love which could not be the love it is if it would not admit of that cementing freedom for suspending the decisive negative which upon such full deliberation i had entreated you to give to mr lovelaces relations i am sorry that i am obliged to repeat to you my dear who know me so well that were i sure i should live many years i would not have mr lovelace much less can i think of him as it is probable i may not live one as to the world and its censures you know my dear that however desirous i always was of a fair fame yet i never thought it right to give more than a second place to the worlds opinion the challenges made to mr lovelace by miss doily in public company are a fresh proof that i have lost my reputation and what advantage would it be to me were it retrievable and were i to live long if i could not acquit myself to myself having in my former said so much on the freedoms you have taken with my friends i shall say the less now but your hint that something else has newly passed between some of them and you gives me great concern and that as well for my own sake as for theirs since it must necessarily incense them against me i wise my dear that i had been left to my own course on an occasion so very interesting to myself but since what is done cannot be helped i must abide the consequences yet i dread more than before what may be my sisters answer if an answer will be at all vouchsafed will you give me leave my dear to close this subject with one remark it is this that my beloved friend in points where her own laudable zeal is concerned has ever seemed more ready to fly from the rebuke than from the fault if you will excuse this freedom i will acknowledge thus far in favour of your way of thinking as to the conduct of some parents in these nice cases that indiscreet opposition does frequently as much mischief as giddy love as to the invitation you are so kind as to give me to remove privately into your neighbourhood i have told mr hickman that i will consider of it but believe if you will be so good as to excuse me that i shall not accept of it even should i be able to remove i will give you my reasons for declining it and so i ought when both my love and my gratitude would make a visit nowandthen from my dear miss howe the most consolate thing in the world to me you must know then that this great town wicked as it is wants not opportunities of being better having daily prayers at several churches in it and i am desirous as my strength will permit to embrace those opportunities the method i have proposed to myself and was beginning to practise when that cruel arrest deprived me of both freedom and strength is this when i was disposed to gentle exercise i took a chair to st dunstans church in fleetstreet where are prayers at seven in the morning i proposed if the weather favoured to walk if not to take chair to lincolnsinn chapel where at eleven in the morning and at five in the afternoon are the same desirable opportunities and at other times to go no farther than coventgarden church where are early morning prayers likewise this method pursued i doubt not will greatly help as it has already done to calm my disturbed thoughts and to bring me to that perfect resignation after which i aspire for i must own my dear that sometimes still my griefs and my reflections are too heavy for me and all the aid i can draw from religious duties is hardly sufficient to support my staggering reason i am a very young creature you know my dear to be left to my own conduct in such circumstances as i am in another reason why i choose not to go down into your neighbourhood is the displeasure that might arise on my account between your mother and you if indeed you were actually married and the worthy man who would then have a title to all your regard were earnestly desirous of near neighbourhood i know not what i might do for although i might not perhaps intend to give up my other important reasons at the time i should make you a congratulatory visit yet i might not know how to deny myself the pleasure of continuing near you when there i send you enclosed the copy of my letter to my sister i hope it will be thought to be written with a true penitent spirit for indeed it is i desire that you will not think i stoop too low in it since there can be no such thing as that in a child to parents whom she has unhappily offended but if still perhaps more disgusted than before at your freedom with them they should pass it by with the contempt of silence for i have not yet been favoured with an answer i must learn to think it right in them to do so especially as it is my first direct application for i have often censured the boldness of those who applying for a favour which it is in a persons option to grant or refuse take the liberty of being offended if they are not gratified as if the petitioned had not as good a right to reject as the petitioner to ask but if my letter should be answered and that in such terms as will make me loth to communicate it to so warm a friend you must not my dear take it upon yourself to censure my relations but allow for them as they know not what i have suffered as being filled with just resentments against me just to them if they think them just and as not being able to judge of the reality of my penitence and after all what can they do for me they can only pity me and what will that but augment their own grief to which at present their resentment is an alleviation for can they by their pity restore to me my lost reputation can they by it purchase a sponge that will wipe out from the year the past fatal four months of my life she takes in the time that she appointed to meet mr lovelace your account of the gay unconcerned behaviour of mr lovelace at the colonels does not surprise me at all after i am told that he had the intrepidity to go there knowing who were invited and expected only this my dear i really wonder at that miss howe could imagine that i could have a thought of such a man for a husband poor wretch i pity him to see him fluttering about abusing talents that were given him for excellent purposes taking in consideration for courage and dancing fearless of danger on the edge of a precipice but indeed his threatening to see me most sensibly alarms and shocks me i cannot but hope that i never never more shall see him in this world since you are so loth my dear to send the desired negative to the ladies of his family i will only trouble you to transmit the letter i shall enclose for that purpose directed indeed to yourself because it was to you that those ladies applied themselves on this occasion but to be sent by you to any one of the ladies at your own choice i commend myself my dearest miss howe to your prayers and conclude with repeated thanks for sending mr hickman to me and with wishes for your health and happiness and for the speedy celebration of your nuptials your ever affectionate and obliged clarissa harlowe letter li miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe enclosed in the preceding thursday july my dearest miss howe since you seem loth to acquiesce in my determined resolution signified to you as soon as i was able to hold a pen i beg the favour of you by this or by any other way you think most proper to acquaint the worthy ladies who have applied to you in behalf of their relation that although i am infinitely obliged to their generous opinion of me yet i cannot consent to sanctify as i may say mr lovelaces repeated breaches of all moral sanctions and hazard my future happiness by a union with a man through whose premeditated injuries in a long train of the basest contrivances i have forfeited my temporal hopes he himself when he reflects upon his own actions must surely bear testimony to the justice as well as fitness of my determination the ladies i dare say would were they to know the whole of my unhappy story be pleased to acquaint them that i deceive myself if my resolution on this head however ungratefully and even inhumanely he has treated me be not owing more to principle than passion nor can i give a stronger proof of the truth of this assurance on this one easy condition that he will never molest me more in whatever way you choose to make this declaration be pleased to let my most respectful compliments to the ladies of that noble family and to my lord m accompany it and do you my dear believe that i shall be to the last moment of my life your ever obliged and affectionate clarissa harlowe letter lii mr lovelace to john belford esq friday july i have three letters of thine to take notice of but am divided in my mind whether to quarrel with thee on thy unmerciful reflections or to thank thee for thy acceptable particularity and diligence but several of my sweet dears have i indeed in my time made to cry and laugh before the cry could go off the other why may i not therefore curse and applaud thee in the same moment so take both in one and what follows as it shall rise from my pen letters xlvi xlvii and xlviii of this volume how often have i ingenuously confessed my sins against this excellent creature yet thou never sparest me although as bad a man as myself since then i get so little by my confessions i had a good mind to try to defend myself and that not only from antient and modern story but from common practice and yet avoid repeating any thing i have suggested before in my own behalf i am in a humour to play the fool with my pen briefly then from antient story first dost thou not think that i am as much entitled to forgiveness on miss harlowes account as virgils hero was on queen didos for what an ungrateful varlet was that vagabond to the hospitable princess who had willingly conferred upon him the last favour stealing away whence i suppose the ironical phrase of trusty trojan to this day like a thief pretendedly indeed at the command of the gods but could that be when the errand he went upon was to rob other princes not only of their dominions but of their lives yet this fellow is at every word the pious neas with the immortal bard who celebrates him should miss harlowe even break her heart which heaven forbid for the usage she has received to say nothing of her disappointed pride to which her death would be attributable more than to reason what comparison will her fate hold to queen didos and have i half the obligation to her that neas had to the queen of carthage the latter placing a confidence the former none in her man then whom else have i robbed whom else have i injured her brothers worthless life i gave him instead of taking any mans while the trojan vagabond destroyed his thousands why then should it not be the pious lovelace as well as the pious neas for dost thou think had a conflagration happened and had it been in my power that i would not have saved my old anchises as he did his from the ilion bonfire even at the expense of my cresa had i a wife of that name but for a more modern instance in my favour have i used miss harlowe as our famous maiden queen as she was called used one of her own blood a sisterqueen who threw herself into her protection from her rebelsubjects and whom she detained prisoner eighteen years and at last cut off her head yet do not honest protestants pronounce her pious too and call her particularly their queen as to common practice who let me ask that has it in his power to gratify a predominant passion be it what it will denies himself the gratification leaving it to cooler deliberation and if he be a great man to his flatterers to find a reason for it afterwards then as to the worst part of my treatment of this lady how many men are there who as well as i have sought by intoxicating liquors first to inebriate then to subdue what signifies what the potations were when the same end was in view let me tell thee upon the whole that neither the queen of carthage nor the queen of scots would have thought they had any reason to complain of cruelty had they been used no worse than i have used the queen of my heart and then do i not aspire with my whole soul to repair by marriage would the pious neas thinkest thou have done such a piece of justice by dido had she lived come come belford let people run away with notions as they will i am comparatively a very innocent man and if by these and other like reasonings i have quieted my own conscience a great end is answered what have i to do with the world and now i sit me peaceably down to consider thy letters i hope thy pleas in my favour when she gave thee so generously gave thee for me my letters were urged with an honest energy but i suspect thee much for being too ready to give up thy client then thou hast such a misgiving aspect an aspect rather inviting rejection than carrying persuasion with it and art such an hesitating such a humming and hawing caitiff that i shall attribute my failure if i do fail rather to the inability and ill looks of my advocate than to my cause again thou art deprived of the force men of our cast give to arguments for she wont let thee swearart moreover a very heavy thoughtless fellow tolerable only at a second rebound a horrid dunce at the impromptu these encountering with such a lady are great disadvantages and still a greater is thy balancing as thou dost at present between old rakery and new reformation since this puts thee into the same situation with her as they told me at leipsick martin luther was in at the first public dispute which he held in defence of his supposed new doctrines with eckius for martin was then but a linseywolsey reformer he retained some dogmas which by natural consequence made others that he held untenable so that eckius in some points had the better of him but from that time he made clear work renouncing all that stood in his way and then his doctrines ran upon all fours he was never puzzled afterwards and could boldly declare that he would defend them in the face of angels and men and to his friends who would have dissuaded him from venturing to appear before the emperor charles at spires that were there as many devils at spires as tiles upon the houses he would go an answer that is admired by every protestant saxon to this day see letter xlvii of this volume since then thy unhappy awkwardness destroys the force of thy arguments i think thou hadst better for the present however forbear to urge her on the subject of accepting the reparation i offer lest the continual teasing of her to forgive me should but strengthen her in her denials of forgiveness till for consistency sake shell be forced to adhere to a resolution so often avowed whereas if left to herself a little time and better health which will bring on better spirits will give her quicker resentments those quicker resentments will lead her into vehemence that vehemence will subside and turn into expostulation and parley my friends will then interpose and guaranty for me and all our trouble on both sides will be over such is the natural course of things i cannot endure thee for thy hopelessness in the ladys recovery and that in contradiction to the doctor and apothecary see letter xlvii of this volume time in the words of congreve thou sayest will give increase to her afflictions but why so knowest thou not that those words so contrary to common experience were applied to the case of a person while passion was in its full vigour at such a time every one in a heavy grief thinks the same but as enthusiasts do by scripture so dost thou by the poets thou hast read any thing that carries the most distant allusion from either to the case in hand is put down by both for gospel however incongruous to the general scope of either and to that case so once in a pulpit i heard one of the former very vehemently declare himself to be a dead dog when every man woman and child were convinced to the contrary by his howling i can tell thee that if nothing else will do i am determined in spite of thy buskinairs and of thy engagements for me to the contrary to see her myself face to face have i known many a quarrel made up which distance would have kept alive and widened thou wilt be a madder jack than he in the tale of a tub if thou givest an active opposition to this interview in short i cannot bear the thought that a woman whom once i had bound to me in the silken cords of love should slip through my fingers and be able while my heart flames out with a violent passion for her to despise me and to set both love and me at defiance thou canst not imagine how much i envy thee and her doctor and her apothecary and every one who i hear are admitted to her presence and conversation and wish to be the one or the other in turn wherefore if nothing else will do i will see her ill tell thee of an admirable expedient just come cross me to save thy promise and my own mrs lovick you say is a good woman if the lady be worse you shall advise her to send for a parson to pray by her unknown to her unknown to the lady unknown to thee for so it may pass i will contrive to be the man petticoated out and vested in a gown and cassock i once for a certain purpose did assume the canonicals and i was thought to make a fine sleek appearance my broad rosebound beaver became me mightily and i was much admired upon the whole by all who saw me methinks it must be charmingly a propos to see me kneeling down by her bedside i am sure i shall pray heartily beginning out of the commonprayer book the sickoffice for the restoration of the languishing lady and concluding with an exhortation to charity and forgiveness for myself i will consider of this matter but in whatever shape i shall choose to appear of this thou mayest assure thyself i will apprize thee beforehand of my visit that thou mayst contrive to be out of the way and to know nothing of the matter this will save thy word and as to mine can she think worse of me than she does at present an indispensable of true love and profound respect in thy wise opinion is absurdity or awkwardness tis surprising that thou shouldst be one of those partial mortals who take their measures of right and wrong from what they find themselves to be and cannot help being so awkwardness is a perfection in the awkward at this rate no man ever can be in the wrong but i insist upon it that an awkward fellow will do every thing awkwardly and if he be like thee will when he has done foolishly rack his unmeaning brain for excuses as awkward as his first fault respectful love is an inspirer of actions worthy of itself and he who cannot show it where he most means it manifests that he is an unpolite rough creature a perfect belford and has it not in him see letter xlvi of this volume but here thoult throw out that notable witticism that my outside is the best of me thine the worst of thee and that if i set about mending my mind thou wilt mend thy appearance but prythee jack dont stay for that but set about thy amendment in dress when thou leavest off thy mourning for why shouldst thou prepossess in thy disfavour all those who never saw thee before it is hard to remove earlytaken prejudices whether of liking or distaste people will hunt as i may say for reasons to confirm first impressions in compliment to their own sagacity nor is it every mind that has the ingenuousness to confess itself half mistaken when it finds itself to be wrong thou thyself art an adept in the pretended science of reading men and whenever thou art out wilt study to find some reasons why it was more probable that thou shouldst have been right and wilt watch every motion and action and every word and sentiment in the person thou hast once censured for proofs in order to help thee to revive and maintain thy first opinion and indeed as thou seldom errest on the favourable side human nature is so vile a thing that thou art likely to be right five times in six on what thou findest in thine own heart to have reason to compliment thyself on thy penetration here is preachment for thy preachment and i hope if thou likest thy own thou wilt thank me for mine the rather as thou mayest be the better for it if thou wilt since it is calculated for thy own meridian well but the lady refers my destiny to the letter she has written actually written to miss howe to whom it seems she has given her reasons why she will not have me i long to know the contents of this letter but am in great hopes that she has so expressed her denials as shall give room to think she only wants to be persuaded to the contrary in order to reconcile herself to herself i could make some pretty observations upon one or two places of the ladys mediation but wicked as i am thought to be i never was so abandoned as to turn into ridicule or even to treat with levity things sacred i think it the highest degree of ill manners to jest upon those subjects which the world in general look upon with veneration and call divine i would not even treat the mythology of the heathen to a heathen with the ridicule that perhaps would fairly lie from some of the absurdities that strike every common observer nor when at rome and in other popish countries did i ever behave indecently at those ceremonies which i thought very extraordinary for i saw some people affected and seemingly edified by them and i contented myself to think though they were any good end to the many there was religion enough in them or civil policy at least to exempt them from the ridicule of even a bad man who had common sense and good manners for the like reason i have never given noisy or tumultuous instances of dislike to a new play if i thought it ever so indifferent for i concluded first that every one was entitled to see quietly what he paid for and next as the theatre the epitome of the world consisted of pit boxes and gallery it was hard i thought if there could be such a performance exhibited as would not please somebody in that mixed multitude and if it did those somebodies had as much right to enjoy their own judgments undisturbedly as i had to enjoy mine this was my way of showing my disapprobation i never went again and as a man is at his option whether he will go to a play or not he has not the same excuse for expressing his dislike clamorously as if he were compelled to see it i have ever thou knowest declared against those shallow libertines who could not make out their pretensions to wit but on two subjects to which every man of true wit will scorn to be beholden profaneness and obscenity i mean which must shock the ears of every man or woman of sense without answering any end but of showing a very low and abandoned nature and till i came acquainted with the brutal mowbray no great praise to myself from such a tutor i was far from making so free as i do now with oaths and curses for then i was forced to outswear him sometimes in order to keep him in his allegiance to me his general nay i often check myself to myself for this empty unprofitable liberty of speech in which we are outdone by the sons of the commonsewer all my vice is women and the love of plots and intrigues and i cannot but wonder how i fell into those shocking freedoms of speech since generally speaking they are far from helping forward my main end only nowandthen indeed a little novice rises to ones notice who seems to think dress and oaths and curses the diagnostics of the rakish spirit she is inclined to favour and indeed they are the only qualifications that some who are called rakes and pretty fellows have to boast of but what must the women be who can be attracted by such emptysouled profligates since wickedness with wit is hardly tolerable but without it is equally shocking and contemptible there again is preachment for thy preachment and thou wilt be apt to think that i am reforming too but no such matter if this were new light darting in upon me as thy morality seems to be to thee something of this kind might be apprehended but this was always my way of thinking and i defy thee or any of thy brethren to name a time when i have either ridiculed religion or talked obscenely on the contrary thou knowest how often i have checked that bear in lovematters mowbray and the finical tourville and thyself too for what ye have called the doubleentendre in love as in points that required a manlyresentment it has always been my maxim to act rather than to talk and i do assure thee as to the first the women themselves will excuse the one sooner than the other as to the admiration thou expressest for the books of scripture thou art certainly right in it but tis strange to me that thou wert ignorant of their beauty and noble simplicity till now their antiquity always made me reverence them and how was it possible that thou couldest not for that reason if for no other give them a perusal ill tell thee a short story which i had from my tutor admonishing me against exposing myself by ignorant wonder when i should quit college to go to town or travel the first time drydens alexanders feast fell into his hands he told me he was prodigiously charmed with it and having never heard any body speak of it before thought as thou dost of the bible that he had made a new discovery he hastened to an appointment which he had with several wits for he was then in town one of whom was a noted critic who according to him had more merit than good fortune for all the little nibblers in wit whose writings would not stand the test of criticism made it he said a common cause to run him down as men would a mad dog the young gentleman for young he then was set forth magnificently in the praises of that inimitable performance and gave himself airs of secondhand merit for finding out its beauties the old bard heard him out with a smile which the collegian took for approbation till he spoke and then it was in these mortifying words sdeath sir where have you lived till now or with what sort of company have you conversed young as you are that you have never before heard of the finest piece in the english language this story had such an effect upon me who had ever a proud heart and wanted to be thought a clever fellow that in order to avoid the like disgrace i laid down two rules to myself the first whenever i went into company where there were strangers to hear every one of them speak before i gave myself liberty to prate the other if i found any of them above my match to give up all title to new discoveries contenting myself to praise what they praised as beauties familiar to me though i had never heard of them before and so by degrees i got the reputation of a wit myself and when i threw off all restraint and books and learned conversation and fell in with some of our brethren who are now wandering in erebus and with such others as belton mowbray tourville and thyself i set up on my own stock and like what we have been told of sir richard in his latter days valued myself on being the emperor of the company for having fathomed the depth of them all and afraid of no rival but thee whom also i had got a little under by my gaiety and promptitude at least i proudly like addisons cato delighted to give laws to my little senate proceed with thee byandby letter liii mr lovelace to john belford esq but now i have cleared myself of any intentional levity on occasion of my beloveds meditation which as you observe is finely suited to her case that is to say as she and you have drawn her case i cannot help expressing my pleasure that by one or two verses of it the arrow jack and what she feared being come upon her i am encouraged to hope what it will be very surprising to me if it do not happen that is in plain english that the dear creature is in the way to be a mamma this cursed arrest because of the ill effects the terror might have had upon her in that hopedfor circumstance has concerned me more than on any other account it would be the pride of my life to prove in this charming frostpiece the triumph of nature over principle and to have a young lovelace by such an angel and then for its sake i am confident she will live and will legitimate it and what a meritorious little cherub would it be that should lay an obligation upon both parents before it was born which neither of them would be able to repay could i be sure it is so i should be out of all pain for her recovery pain i say since were she to die die abominable word how i hate it i verily think i should be the most miserable man in the world as for the earnestness she expresses for death she has found the words ready to her hand in honest job else she would not have delivered herself with such strength and vehemence her innate piety as i have more than once observed will not permit her to shorten her own life either by violence or neglect she has a mind too noble for that and would have done it before now had she designed any such thing for to do it like the roman matron when the mischief is over and it can serve no end and when the man however a tarquin as some may think me in this action is not a tarquin in power so that no national point can be made of it is what she has too much good sense to think of then as i observed in a like case a little while ago the distress when this was written was strong upon her and she saw no end of it but all was darkness and apprehension before her moreover has she it not in her power to disappoint as much as she has been disappointed revenge jack has induced many a woman to cherish a life to which grief and despair would otherwise have put an end and after all death is no such eligible thing as job in his calamities makes it and a death desired merely from worldly disappointments shows not a right mind let me tell this lady whatever she may think of it you and i jack although not afraid in the height of passion or resentment to rush into those dangers which might be followed by a sudden and violent death whenever a point of honour calls upon us would shudder at his cool and deliberate approach in a lingering sickness which had debilitated the spirits mr lovelace could not know that the lady was so thoroughly sensible of the solidity of this doctrine as she really was for in her letter to mrs norton letter xliv of this volume she says nor let it be imagined that my present turn of mind proceeds from gloominess or melancholy for although it was brought on by disappointment the world showing me early even at my first rushing into it its true and ugly face yet i hope that it has obtained a better root and will every day more and more by its fruits demonstrate to me and to all my friends that it has so we read of a famous french general i forget as well the reign of the prince as the name of the man who having faced with intrepidity the ghastly varlet on an hundred occasions in the field was the most dejected of wretches when having forfeited his life for treason he was led with all the cruel parade of preparation and surrounding guards to the scaffold the poet says well tis not the stoic lesson got by rote the pomp of words and pedant dissertation that can support us in the hour of terror books have taught cowards to talk nobly of it but when the trial comes they start and stand aghast very true for then it is the old man in the fable with his bundle of sticks the lady is well read in shakspeare our english pride and glory and must sometimes reason with herself in his words so greatly expressed that the subject affecting as it is cannot produce any thing greater ay but to die and go we know not where to lie in cold obstruction and to rot this sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods or to reside in thrilling regions of thickribbed ice to be imprisond in the viewless winds or blown with restless violence about the pendant worlds or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and uncertain thought imagines howling tis too horrible the weariest and most loaded worldly life that pain age penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death i find by one of thy three letters that my beloved had some account from hickman of my interview with miss howe at col ambroses i had a very agreeable time of it there although severely rallied by several of the assembly it concerns me however not a little to find our affair so generally known among the flippanti of both sexes it is all her own fault there never surely was such an odd little soul as this not to keep her own secret when the revealing of it could answer no possible good end and when she wants not one would think to raise to herself either pity or friends or to me enemies by the proclamation why jack must not all her own sex laugh in their sleeves at her weakness what would become of the peace of the world if all women should take it into their heads to follow her example what a fine time of it would the heads of families have their wives always filling their ears with their confessions their daughters with theirs sisters would be every day setting their brothers about cutting of throats if the brothers had at heart the honour of their families as it is called and the whole world would either be a scene of confusion or cuckoldom as much the fashion as it is in lithuania in lithuania the women are said to have so allowedly their gallants called adjutores that the husbands hardly ever enter upon any part of pleasure without them i am glad however that miss howe as much as she hates me kept her word with my cousins on their visit to her and with me at the colonels to endeavour to persuade her friend to make up all matters by matrimony which no doubt is the best nay the only method she can take for her own honour and that of her family i had once thoughts of revenging myself on that vixen and particularly as thou mayest remember had planned something to this purpose on the journey she is going to take which had been talked of some time but i think let me see yet i think i will let this hickman have her safe and entire as thou believest the fellow to be a tolerable sort of a mortal and that i have made the worst of him and i am glad for his own sake he has not launched out too virulently against me to thee see vol iv letter liv but thou seest jack by her refusal of money from him or miss howe that the dear extravagant takes a delight in oddnesses choosing to part with her clothes though for a song dost think she is not a little touched at times i am afraid she is a little spice of that insanity i doubt runs through her that she had in a stronger degree in the first week of my operations her contempt of life her proclamations her refusal of matrimony and now of money from her most intimate friends are sprinklings of this kind and no other way i think to be accounted for see letter xlviii of this volume her apothecary is a good honest fellow i like him much but the silly dears harping so continually upon one string dying dying dying is what i have no patience with i hope all this melancholy jargon is owing entirely to the way i would have her to be in and it being as new to her as the bible beauties to thee no wonder she knows not what to make of herself and so fancies she is breeding death when the event will turn out quite the contrary see letter xlvi of this volume thou art a sorry fellow in thy remarks on the education and qualification of smarts and beaux of the rakish order if by thy wes and uss thou meanest thyself or me for i pretend to say that the picture has no resemblance of us who have read and conversed as we have done it may indeed and i believe it does resemble the generality of the fops and coxcombs about town but that let them look to for if it affects not me to what purpose thy random shot if indeed thou findest by the new light darted in upon thee since thou hast had the honour of conversing with this admirable creature that the cap fits thy own head why then according to the qui capit rule een take and clap it on and i will add a string of bells to it to complete thee for the forehorse of the idiot team ibid and letter lxviii although i just now said a kind thing or two for this fellow hickman yet i can tell thee i could to use one of my noble peers humble phrases eat him up without a corn of salt when i think of his impudence to salute my charmer twice at parting and have still less patience with the lady herself for presuming to offer her cheek or lip thou sayest not which to him and to press his clumsy fist between her charming hands an honour worth a kings ransom and what i would give what would i not give to have and then he in return to press her as thou sayest he did to his stupid heart at that time no doubt more sensible than ever it was before see letter xlviii of this volume by thy description of their parting i see thou wilt be a delicate fellow in time my mortification in this ladys displeasure will be thy exaltation from her conversation i envy thee as well for thy opportunities as for thy improvements and such an impression has thy concluding paragraph made upon me that i wish i do not get into a reformationhumour as well as thou and then what a couple of lamentable puppies shall we make howling in recitative to each others discordant music ibid let me improve upon the thought and imagine that turned hermits we have opened the two old caves at hornsey or dug new ones and in each of our cells set up a deaths head and an hourglass for objects of contemplation i have seen such a picture but then jack had not the old penitent fornicator a suffocating long grey beard what figures would a couple of brocaded or lacedwaistcoated toupets make with their sour screwd up halfcockd faces and more than half shut eyes in a kneeling attitude recapitulating their respective rogueries this scheme were we only to make trial of it and return afterwards to our old ways might serve to better purpose by far than horners in the country wife to bring the pretty wenches to us let me see the author of hudibras has somewhere a description that would suit us when met in one of our caves and comparing our dismal notes together this is it suppose me described he sat upon his rump his head like one in doleful dump betwixt his knees his hands applyd unto his cheeks on either side and by him in another hole sat stupid belford cheek by jowl i know thou wilt think me too ludicrous i think myself so it is truly to be ingenuous a forced put for my passions are so wound up that i am obliged either to laugh or cry like honest drunken jack daventry poor fellow what an unhappy end was his thou knowest i used to observe that whenever he rose from an entertainment which he never did sober it was his way as soon as he got to the door to look round him like a carrier pigeon just thrown up in order to spy out his course and then taking to his heels he would run all the way home though it were a mile or two when he could hardly stand and must have tumbled on his nose if he had attempted to walk moderately this then must be my excuse in this my unconverted estate for a conclusion so unworthy of the conclusion to thy third letter what a length have i run thou wilt own that if i pay thee not in quality i do in quantity and yet i leave a multitude of things unobserved upon indeed i hardly at this present know what to do with myself but scribble tired with lord m who in his recovery has played upon me the fable of the nurse the crying child and the wolf tired with my cousins montague though charming girls were they not so near of kin tired with mowbray and tourville and their everlasting identity tired with the country tired of myself longing for what i have not i must go to town and there have an interview with the charmer of my soul for desperate diseases must have desperate remedies and i only wait to know my doom from miss howe and then if it be rejection i will try my fate and receive my sentence at her feet but i will apprize thee of it beforehand as i told thee that thou mayest keep thy parole with the lady in the best manner thou canst letter liv miss howe to miss clarissa harlowe in answer to hers of july see letters l li of this volume friday night july i will now my dearest friend write to you all my mind without reserve on your resolution not to have this vilest of men you gave me in yours of sunday the d reasons so worthy of the pure mind of my clarissa in support of this your resolution that nothing but selflove lest i should lose my everamiable friend could have prevailed upon me to wish you to alter it indeed i thought it was impossible there could be however desirable so noble an instance given by any of our sex of a passion conquered when there were so many inducements to give way to it and therefore i was willing to urge you once more to overcome your just indignation and to be prevailed upon by the solicitations of his friends before you carried your resentments to so great a height that it would be more difficult for you and less to your honour to comply than if you had complied at first but now my dear that i see you fixed in your noble resolution and that it is impossible for your pure mind to join itself with that of so perjured a miscreant i congratulate you most heartily upon it and beg your pardon for but seeming to doubt that theory and practice were not the same thing with my beloved clarissa i have only one thing that saddens my heart on this occasion and that is the bad state of health mr hickman unwillingly owns you are in hitherto you have well observed the doctrine you always laid down to me that a cursed person should first seek the worlds opinion of her and in all cases where the two could not be reconciled have preferred the first to the last and are of consequence well justified to your own heart as well as to your anna howe let me therefore beseech you to endeavour by all possible means to recover your health and spirits and this as what if it can be effected will crown the work and show the world that you were indeed got above the base wretch and though put out of your course for a little while could resume it again and go on blessing all within your knowledge as well by your example as by your precepts for heavens sake then for the worlds sake for the honour of our sex and for my sake once more i beseech you try to overcome this shock and if you can overcome it i shall then be as happy as i wish to be for i cannot indeed i cannot think of parting with you for many many years to come the reasons you give for discouraging my wishes to have you near us are so convincing that i ought at present to acquiesce in them but my dear when your mind is fully settled as now you are so absolutely determined in it with regard this wretch i hope it will soon be i shall expect you with us or near us and then you shall chalk out every path that i will set my foot in nor will i turn aside either to the right hand or to the left you wish i had not mediated for you to your friends i wish so too because my mediation was ineffectual because it may give new ground for the malice of some of them to work upon and because you are angry with me for doing so but how as i said in my former could i sit down in quiet when i knew how uneasy their implacableness made you but i will tear myself from the subject for i see i shall be warm again and displease you and there is not one thing in the world that i would do however agreeable to myself if i thought it would disoblige you nor any one that i would omit to do if i knew it would give you pleasure and indeed my dear halfsevere friend i will try if i cannot avoid the fault as willingly as i would the rebuke for this reason i forbear saying any thing on so nice a subject as your letter to your sister it must be right because you think it so and if it be taken as it ought that will show you that it is but if it beget insults and revilings as it is but too likely i find you dont intend to let me know it you were always so ready to accuse yourself for other peoples faults and to suspect your own conduct rather than the judgment of your relations that i have often told you i cannot imitate you in this it is not a necessary point of belief with me that all people in years are therefore wise or that all young people are therefore rash and headstrong it may be generally the case as far as i know and possibly it may be so in the case of my mother and her girl but i will venture to say that it has not yet appeared to be so between the principals of harloweplace and their second daughter you are for excusing them beforehand for their expected cruelty as not knowing what you have suffered nor how ill you are they have heard of the former and are not sorry for it of the latter they have been told and i have most reason to know how they have taken it but i shall be far from avoiding the fault and as surely shall incur the rebuke if i say any more upon this subject i will therefore only add at present that your reasonings in their behalf show you to be all excellence their returns to you that they are alldo my dear let me end with a little bit of spiteful justice but you wont i know so i have done quite done however reluctantly yet if you think of the word i would have said dont doubt the justice of it and fill up the blank with it you intimate that were i actually married and mr hickman to desire it you would think of obliging me with a visit on the occasion and that perhaps when with me it would be difficult for you to remove far from me lord my dear what a stress do you seem to lay upon mr hickmans desiring it to be sure he does and would of all things desire to have you near us and with us if we might be so favoured policy as well as veneration for you would undoubtedly make the man if not a fool desire this but let me tell you that if mr hickman after marriage should pretend to dispute with me my friendships as i hope i am not quite a fool i should let him know how far his own quiet was concerned in such an impertinence especially if they were such friendships as were contracted before i knew him i know i always differed from you on this subject for you think more highly of a husbands prerogative than most people do of the royal one these notions my dear from a person of your sense and judgment are no way advantageous to us inasmuch as they justify the assuming sex in their insolence when hardly one out of ten of them their opportunities considered deserves any prerogative at all look through all the families we know and we shall not find onethird of them have half the sense of their wives and yet these are to be vested with prerogatives and a woman of twice their sense has nothing to do but hear tremble and obey and for consciencesake too i warrant but mr hickman and i may perhaps have a little discourse upon these sorts of subjects before i suffer him to talk of the day and then i shall let him know what he has to trust to as he will me if he be a sincere man what he pretends to expect from me but let me tell you my dear that it is more in your power than perhaps you think it to hasten the day so much pressed for by my mother as well as wished for by you for the very day that you can assure me that you are in a tolerable state of health and have discharged your doctor and apothecary at their own motions on that account some day in a month from that desirable news shall be it so my dear make haste and be well and then this matter will be brought to effect in a manner more agreeable to your anna howe than it otherwise ever can i sent this day by a particular hand to the misses montague your letter of just reprobation of the greatest profligate in the kingdom and hope i shall not have done amiss that i transcribe some of the paragraphs of your letter of the d and send them with it as you at first intended should be done you are it seems and that too much for your health employed in writing i hope it is in penning down the particulars of your tragical story and my mother has put me in mind to press you to it with a view that one day if it might be published under feigned names it would be as much use as honour to the sex my mother says she cannot help admiring you for the propriety of your resentment of the wretch and she would be extremely glad to have her advice of penning your sad story complied with and then she says your noble conduct throughout your trials and calamities will afford not only a shining example to your sex but at the same time those calamities befalling such a person a fearful warning to the inconsiderate young creatures of it on monday we shall set out on our journey and i hope to be back in a fortnight and on my return will have one pull more with my mother for a london journey and if the pretence must be the buying of clothes the principal motive will be that of seeing once more my dear friend while i can say i have not finally given consent to the change of a visiter into a relation and so can call myself my own as well as your anna howe letter lv miss howe to the two misses montague sat july dear ladies i have not bee wanting to use all my interest with my beloved friend to induce her to forgive and be reconciled to your kinsman though he has so ill deserved it and have even repeated my earnest advice to her on this head this repetition and the waiting for her answer having taken up time have bee the cause that i could not sooner do myself the honour of writing to you on this subject you will see by the enclosed her immovable resolution grounded on noble and highsouled motives which i cannot but regret and applaud at the same time applaud for the justice of her determination which will confirm all your worthy house in the opinion you had conceived of her unequalled merit and regret because i have but too much reason to apprehend as well by that as by the report of a gentleman just come from her that she is in a declining way as to her health that her thoughts are very differently employed than on a continuance here the enclosed letter she thought fit to send to me unsealed that after i had perused it i might forward it to you and this is the reason it is superscribed by myself and sealed with my seal it is very full and peremptory but as she had been pleased in a letter to me dated the d instant as soon as she could hold a pen to give me more ample reasons why she could not comply with your pressing requests as well as mine i will transcribe some of the passages in that letter which will give one of the wickedest men in the world if he sees them reason to think himself one of the most unhappy in the loss of so incomparable a wife as he might have gloried in had he not been so superlatively wicked these are the passages see for these passages miss harlowes letter no xli of this volume dated july marked with a turned comma thus and now ladies you have before you my beloved friends reasons for her refusal of a man unworthy of the relation he bears to so many excellent persons and i will add for i cannot help it that the merit and rank of the person considered and the vile manner of his proceedings there never was a greater villany committed and since she thinks her first and only fault cannot be expiated but by death i pray to god daily and will hourly from the moment i shall hear of that sad catastrophe that he will be pleased to make him the subject of his vengeance in some such way as that all who know of his perfidious crime may see the hand of heaven in the punishment of it you will forgive me ladies i love not mine own soul better than i do miss clarissa harlowe and the distresses she has gone through the persecution she suffers from all her friends the curse she lies under for his sake from her implacable father her reduced health and circumstances from high health and affluence and that execrable arrest and confinement which have deepened all her other calamities and which must be laid at his door as it was the act of his vile agents that whether from his immediate orders or not naturally flowed from his preceding baseness the sex dishonoured in the eye of the world in the person of one of the greatest ornaments of it the unmanly methods whatever they were for i know not all as yet by which he compassed her ruin all these considerations join to justify my warmth and my execrations of a man whom i think excluded by his crimes from the benefit even of christian forgiveness and were you to see all she writes and to know the admirable talents she is mistress of you yourselves would join with me to admire her and execrate him believe me to be with a high sense of your merits dear ladies your most obedient and humble servant anna howe letter lvi mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe friday july my dearest young lady i have the consolation to tell you that my son is once again in a hopeful way as to his health he desires his duty to you he is very low and weak and so am i but this is the first time that i have been able for several days past to sit up to write or i would not have been so long silent your letter to your sister is received and answered you have the answer by this time i suppose i wish it may be to your satisfaction but am afraid it will not for by betty barnes i find they were in a great ferment on receiving yours and much divided whether it should be answered or not they will not yet believe that you are so ill as to my infinite concern i find you are what passed between miss harlowe and miss howe has been as i feared it would be an aggravation i showed betty two or three passages in your letter to me and she seemed moved and said she would report them favourably and would procure me a visit from miss harlowe if i would promise to show the same to her but i have heard no more of that methinks i am sorry you refuse the wicked man but doubt not nevertheless that your motives for doing so are more commendable than my wishes that you would not but as you would be resolved as i may say on life if you gave way to such a thought and as i have so much interest in your recovery i cannot forbear showing this regard to myself and to ask you if you cannot get over your just resentments but i dare say no more on this subject what a dreadful thing indeed was it for my dearest tender young lady to be arrested in the streets of london how does my heart go over again and again for you what yours must have suffered at that time yet this to such a mind as yours must be light compared to what you had suffered before o my dearest miss clary how shall we know what to pray for when we pray but that gods will may be done and that we may be resigned to it when at nine years old and afterwards at eleven you had a dangerous fever how incessantly did we grieve and pray and put up our vows to the throne of grace for your recovery for all our lives were bound up in your life yet now my dear as it has proved especially if we are soon to lose you what a much more desirable event both for you and for us would it have been had we then lost you a sad thing to say but as it is in pure love to you that i say it and in full conviction that we are not always fit to be our own choosers i hope it may be excusable and the rather as the same reflection will naturally lead both you and me to acquiesce under the dispensation since we are assured that nothing happens by chance and the greatest good may for aught we know be produced from the heaviest evils i am glad you are with such honest people and that you have all your effects restored how dreadfully have you been used that one should be glad of such a poor piece of justice as that your talent at moving the passions is always hinted at and this betty of your sisters never comes near me that she is not full of it but as you say whom has it moved that you wished to move yet were it not for this unhappy notion i am sure your mother would relent forgive me my dear miss clary for i must try one way to be convinced if my opinion be not just but i will not tell you what that is unless it succeeds i will try in pure duty and love to them as to you may heaven be your support in all your trials is the constant prayer my dearest young lady of your ever affectionate friend and servant judith norton letter lvii mrs norton to mrs harlowe friday july honoured madam being forbid without leave to send you any thing i might happen to receive from my beloved miss clary and so ill that i cannot attend you to ask your leave i give you this trouble to let you know that i have received a letter from her which i think i should hereafter be held inexcusable as things may happen if i did not desire permission to communicate to you and that as soon as possible applications have been made to the dear young lady from lord m from the two ladies his sisters and from both his nieces and from the wicked man himself to forgive and marry him this in noble indignation for the usage she has received from him she has absolutely refused and perhaps madam if you and the honoured family should be of opinion that to comply with their wishes is now the properest measure that can be taken the circumstances of things may require your authority or advice to induce her to change her mind i have reason to believe that one motive for her refusal is her full conviction that she shall not long be a trouble to any body and so she would not give a husband a right to interfere with her family in relation to the estate her grandfather devised to her but of this however i have not the least intimation from her nor would she i dare say mention it as a reason having still stronger reasons from his vile treatment of her to refuse him the letter i have received will show how truly penitent the dear creature is and if i have your permission i will send it sealed up with a copy of mine to which it is an answer but as i resolve upon this step without her knowledge and indeed i do i will not acquaint her with it unless it be attended with desirable effects because otherwise besides making me incur her displeasure it might quite break her already halfbroken heart i am honoured madam your dutiful and everobliged servant judith norton letter lviii mrs harlowe to mrs judith norton sunday july we all know your virtuous prudence worthy woman we all do but your partiality to this your rash favourite is likewise known and we are no less acquainted with the unhappy bodys power of painting her distresses so as to pierce a stone every one is of opinion that the dear naughty creature is working about to be forgiven and received and for this reason it is that betty has been forbidden not by me you may be assured to mention any more of her letters for she did speak to my bella of some moving passages you read to her this will convince you that nothing will be heard in her favour to what purpose then should i mention any thing about her but you may be sure that i will if i can have but one second however that is not at all likely until we see what the consequences of her crime will be and who can tell that she may how can i speak it and my once darling daughter unmarried she may be with child this would perpetuate her stain her brother may come to some harm which god forbid one childs ruin i hope will not be followed by anothers murder as to her grief and her present misery whatever it be she must bear with it and it must be short of what i hourly bear for her indeed i am afraid nothing but her being at the last extremity of all will make her father and her uncles and her other friends forgive her the easy pardon perverse children meet with when they have done the rashest and most rebellious thing they can do is the reason as is pleaded to us every day that so may follow their example they depend upon the indulgent weakness of their parents tempers and in that dependence harden their own hearts and a little humiliation when they have brought themselves into the foretold misery is to be a sufficient atonement for the greatest perverseness but for such a child as this i mention what others hourly say but what i must sorrowfully subscribe to to lay plots and stratagems to deceive her parents as well as herself and to run away with a libertine can there be any atonement for her crime and is she not answerable to god to us to you and to all the world who knew her for the abuse of such talents as she has abused you say her heart is halfbroken is it to be wondered at was not her sin committed equally against warning and the light of her own knowledge that he would now marry her or that she would refuse him if she believed him in earnest as she has circumstanced herself is not at all probable and were i inclined to believe it nobody else here would he values not his relations and would deceive them as soon as any others his aversion to marriage he has always openly declared and still occasionally declares it but if he be now in earnest which every one who knows him must doubt which do you think hating us too as he professes to hate and despise us all would be most eligible here to hear of her death or of her marriage to such a vile man to all of us yet i cannot say for o my good mrs norton you know what a mothers tenderness for the child of her heart would make her choose notwithstanding all that childs faults rather than lose her for ever but i must sail with the tide my own judgment also joining with the general resentment or i should make the unhappiness of the more worthy still greater my dear mr harlowes particularly which is already more than enough to make them unhappy for the remainder of their days this i know if i were to oppose the rest our son would fly out to find this libertine and who could tell what would be the issue of that with such a man of violence and blood as that lovelace is known to be all i can expect to prevail for her is that in a week or so mr brand may be sent up to inquire privately about her present state and way of life and to see she is not altogether destitute for nothing she writes herself will be regarded her father indeed has at her earnest request withdrawn the curse which in a passion he laid upon her at her first wicked flight from us but miss howe it is a sad thing mrs norton to suffer so many ways at once had made matters so difficult by her undue liberties with us all as well by speech in all companies as by letters written to my bella that we could hardly prevail upon him to hear her letter read these liberties of miss howe with us the general cry against us abroad wherever we are spoken of and the visible and not seldom audible disrespectfulness which high and low treat us with to our faces as we go to and from church and even at church for no where else have we the heart to go as if none of us had been regarded but upon her account and as if she were innocent we all in fault are constant aggravations you must needs think to the whole family she has made my lot heavy i am sure that was far from being light before to tell you truth i am enjoined not to receive any thing of hers from any hand without leave should i therefore gratify my yearnings after her so far as to receive privately the letter you mention what would the case be but to torment myself without being able to do her good and were it to be known mr harlowe is so passionate and should it throw his gout into his stomach as her rash flight did indeed indeed i am very unhappy for o my good woman she is my child still but unless it were more in my power yet do i long to see the letter you say it tells of her present way and circumstances the poor child who ought to be in possession of thousands and will for her father will be a faithful steward for her but it must be in his own way and at his own time and is she really ill so very ill but she ought to sorrow she has given a double measure of it but does she really believe she shall not long trouble us but o my norton she must she will long trouble us for can she think her death if we should be deprived of her will put an end to our afflictions can it be thought that the fall of such a child will not be regretted by us to the last hour of our lives but in the letter you have does she without reserve express her contrition has she in it no reflecting hints does she not aim at extenuations if i were to see it will it not shock me so much that my apparent grief may expose me to harshnesses can it be contrived but to what purpose dont send it i charge you dont i dare not see it yet but alas oh forgive the almost distracted mother you can you know how to allow for all this so i will let it go i will not write over again this part of my letter but i choose not to know more of her than is communicated to us all no more than i dare own i have seen and what some of them may rather communicate to me than receive from me and this for the sake of my outward quiet although my inward peace suffers more and more by the compelled reserve i was forced to break off but i will now try to conclude my long letter i am sorry you are ill but if you were well i could not for your own sake wish you to go up as betty tells us you long to do if you went nothing would be minded that came from you as they already think you too partial in her favour your going up would confirm it and do yourself prejudice and her no good and as every body values you here i advise you not to interest yourself too warmly in her favour especially before my bellas betty till i can let you know a proper time yet to forbid you to love the dear naughty creature who can o my norton you must love her and so must i i send you five guineas to help you in your present illness and your sons for it must have lain heavy upon you what a sad sad thing my dear good woman that all your pains and all my pains for eighteen or nineteen years together have in so few months been rendered thus deplorably vain yet i must be always your friend and pity you for the very reason that i myself deserve every ones pity perhaps i may find an opportunity to pay you a visit as in your illness and then may weep over the letter you mention with you but for the future write nothing to me about the poor girl that you think may not be communicated to us all and i charge you as you value my friendship as you wish my peace not to say any thing of a letter you have from me either to the naughty one or to any body else it was with some little relief the occasion given to write to you who must in so particular a manner share my affliction a mother mrs norton cannot forget her child though that child could abandon her mother and in so doing run away with all her mothers comforts as i truly say is the case of your unhappy friend charlotte harlowe letter lix miss clarissa harlowe to mrs judith norton sat july i congratulate you my dear mrs norton with all my heart on your sons recovery which i pray to god with all your own health to perfect i write in some hurry being apprehensive of the sequence of the hints you give of some method you propose to try in my favour with my relations i presume you mean but you will not tell me what you say if it prove unsuccessful now i must beg of you that you will not take any step in my favour with which you do not first acquaint me i have but one request to make to them besides what is contained in my letter to my sister and i would not methinks for the sake of their own future peace of mind that they should be teased so by your wellmeant kindness and that of miss howe as to be put upon denying me that and why should more be asked for me than i can partake of more than is absolutely necessary for my own peace you suppose i should have my sisters answer to my letter by the time yours reached my hand i have it and a severe one a very severe one it is yet considering my fault in their eyes and the provocations i am to suppose they so newly had from my dear miss howe i am to look upon it as a favour that it was answered at all i will send you a copy of it soon as also of mine to which it is an answer i have reason to be very thankful that my father has withdrawn that heavy malediction which affected me so much a parents curse my dear mrs norton what child could die in peace under a parents curse so literally fulfilled too as this has been in what relates to this life my heart is too full to touch upon the particulars of my sisters letter i can make but one atonement for my fault may that be accepted and may it soon be forgotten by every dear relation that there was such an unhappy daughter sister or niece as clarissa harlowe my cousin morden was one of those who was so earnest in prayer for my recovery at nine and eleven years of age as you mention my sister thinks he will be one of those who wish i never had had a being but pray when he does come let me hear of it with the first you think that were it not for that unhappy notion of my moving talent my mother would relent what would i give to see her once more and although unknown to her to kiss but the hem of her garment could i have thought that the last time i saw her would have been the last with what difficulty should i have been torn from her embraced feet and when screened behind the yewhedge on the th of april last i saw my father and my uncle antony and my brother and sister how little did i think that that would be the last time i should ever see them and in so short a space that so many dreadful evils would befal me see vol ii letter xxxvi but i can write nothing but what must give you trouble i will therefore after repeating my desire that you will not intercede for me but with my previous consent conclude with the assurance that i am and ever will be your most affectionate and dutiful clarissa harlowe letter lx miss ar harlowe to miss cl harlowe in answer to hers of friday july letter xlv of this volume thursday july o my unhappy lost sister what a miserable hand have you made of your romantic and giddy expedition i pity you at my heart you may well grieve and repent lovelace has left you in what way or circumstances you know best i wish your conduct had made your case more pitiable but tis your own seeking god help you for you have not a friend will look upon you poor wicked undone creature fallen as you are against warning against expostulation against duty but it signifies nothing to reproach you i weep over you my poor mother your rashness and folly have made her more miserable than you can be yet she has besought my father to grant your request my uncles joined with her for they thought there was a little more modesty in your letter than in the letters of your pert advocate and my father is pleased to give me leave to write but only these words for him and no more that he withdraws the curse he laid upon you at the first hearing of your wicked flight so far as it is in his power to do it and hopes that your present punishment may be all that you will meet with for the rest he will never own you nor forgive you and grieves he has such a daughter in the world all this and more you have deserved from him and from all of us but what have you done to this abandoned libertine to deserve what you have met with at his hands i fear i fear sister but no more a blessed four months work have you made of it my brother is now at edinburgh sent thither by my father though he knows not this to be the motive that he may not meet your triumphant deluder we are told he would be glad to marry you but why then did he abandon you he had kept you till he was tired of you no question and it is not likely he would wish to have you but upon the terms you have already without all doubt been his you ought to advise your friend miss howe to concern herself less in your matters than she does except she could do it with more decency she has written three letters to me very insolent ones your favourer poor mrs norton thinks you know nothing of the pert creatures writing i hope you dont but then the more impertinent the writer but believing the fond woman i sat down the more readily to answer your letter and i write with less severity i can tell you than otherwise i should have done if i had answered it all monday last was your birthday think poor ungrateful wretch as you are how we all used to keep it and you will not wonder to be told that we ran away from one another that day but god give you true penitence if you have it not already and it will be true if it be equal to the shame and the sorrow you have given us all your afflicted sister arabella harlowe your cousin morden is every day expected in england he as well as others of the family when he comes to hear what a blessed piece of work you have made of it will wish you never had had a being letter lxi miss clarissa harlowe to miss howe sunday july you have given me great pleasure my dearest friend by your approbation of my reasonings and of my resolution founded upon them never to have mr lovelace this approbation is so right a thing give me leave to say from the nature of the case and from the strict honour and true dignity of mind which i always admired in my anna howe that i could hardly tell to what but to my evil destiny which of late would not let me please any body to attribute the advice you gave me to the contrary but let not the ill state of my health and what that may naturally tend to sadden you i have told you that i will not run away from life nor avoid the means that may continue it if god see fit and if he do not who shall repine at his will if it shall be found that i have not acted unworthy of your love and of my own character in my greater trials that will be a happiness to both on reflection the shock which you so earnestly advise me to try to get above was a shock the greatest that i could receive but my dear as it was not occasioned by my fault i hope i am already got above it i hope i am i am more grieved at times however for others than for myself and so i ought for as to myself i cannot but reflect that i have had an escape rather than a loss in missing mr lovelace for a husband even had he not committed the vilest of all outrages let any one who knows my story collect his character from his behaviour to me before that outrage and then judge whether it was in the least probable that such a man should make me happy but to collect his character from his principles with regard to the sex in general and from his enterprizes upon many of them and to consider the cruelty of his nature and the sportiveness of his invention together with the high opinion he has of himself it will not be doubted that a wife of his must have been miserable and more miserable if she loved him than she could have been were she to be indifferent to him a twelvemonth might very probably have put a period to my life situated as i was with my friends persecuted and harassed as i had been by my brother and sister and my very heart torn in pieces by the wilful and as it is now apparent premeditated suspenses of the man whose gratitude i wished to engage and whose protection i was the more entitled to expect as he had robbed me of every other and reduced me to an absolute dependence upon himself indeed i once thought that it was all his view to bring me to this as he hated my family and uncomfortable enough for me if it had been all can it be thought my dear that my heart was not more than half broken happy as i was before i knew mr lovelace by a grievous change in my circumstances indeed it was nor perhaps was the wicked violence wanting to have cut short though possibly not so very short a life that he has sported with had i been his but a month he must have possessed the estate on which my relations had set their hearts the more to their regret as they hated him as much as he hated them have i not reason these things considered to think myself happier without mr lovelace than i could have been with him my will too unviolated and very little nay not any thing as to him to reproach myself with but with my relations it is otherwise they indeed deserve to be pitied they are and no doubt will long be unhappy to judge of their resentments and of their conduct we must put ourselves in their situation and while they think me more in fault than themselves whether my favourers are of their opinion or not and have a right to judge for themselves they ought to have great allowances made for them my parents especially they stand at least selfacquitted that i cannot and the rather as they can recollect to their pain their past indulgencies to me and their unquestionable love your partiality for the friend you so much value will not easily let you come into this way of thinking but only my dear be pleased to consider the matter in the following light here was my mother one of the most prudent persons of her sex married into a family not perhaps so happily tempered as herself but every one of which she had the address for a great while absolutely to govern as she pleased by her directing wisdom at the same time that they knew not but her prescriptions were the dictates of their own hearts such a sweet heart had she of conquering by seeming to yield think my dear what must be the pride and the pleasure of such a mother that in my brother she could give a son to the family she distinguished with her love not unworthy of their wishes a daughter in my sister of whom she had no reason to be ashamed and in me a second daughter whom every body complimented such was their partial favour to me as being the still more immediate likeness of herself how self pleased could she smile round upon a family she had so blessed what compliments were paid her upon the example she had given us which was followed with such hopeful effects with what a noble confidence could she look upon her dear mr harlowe as a person made happy by her and be delighted to think that nothing but purity streamed from a fountain so pure now my dear reverse as i daily do this charming prospect see my dear mother sorrowing in her closet endeavouring to suppress her sorrow at her table and in those retirements where sorrow was before a stranger hanging down her pensive head smiles no more beaming over her benign aspect her virtue made to suffer for faults she could not be guilty of her patience continually tried because she has more of it than any other with repetitions of faults she is as much wounded by as those can be from whom she so often hears of them taking to herself as the fountainhead a taint which only had infected one of the undercurrents afraid to open her lips were she willing in my favour lest it should be thought she has any bias in her own mind to failings that never could have been suspected in her robbed of that pleasing merit which the mother of wellnurtured and hopeful children may glory in every one who visits her or is visited by her by dumb show and looks that mean more than words can express condoling where they used to congratulate the affected silence wounding the compassionating look reminding the halfsuppressed sigh in them calling up deeper sighs from her and their averted eyes while they endeavour to restrain the rising tear provoking tears from her that will not be restrained when i consider these things and added to these the pangs that tear in pieces the stronger heart of my father because it cannot relieve itself by those which carry the torturing grief to the eyes of softer spirits the overboiling tumults of my impatient and uncontroulable brother piqued to the heart of his honour in the fall of a sister in whom he once gloried the pride of an elder sister who had given unwilling way to the honours paid over her head to one born after her and lastly the dishonour i have brought upon two uncles who each contended which should most favour their then happy niece when i say i reflect upon my fault in these strong yet just lights what room can there be to censure any body but my unhappy self and how much reason have i to say if i justify myself mine own heart shall condemn me if i say i am perfect it shall also prove me perverse here permit me to lay down my pen for a few moments you are very obliging to me intentionally i know when you tell me it is in my power to hasten the day of mr hickmans happiness but yet give me leave to say that i admire this kind assurance less than any other paragraph of your letter in the first place you know it is not in my power to say when i can dismiss my physician and you should not put the celebration of a marriage intended by yourself and so desirable to your mother upon so precarious an issue nor will i accept of a compliment which must mean a slight to her if any thing could give me a relish for life after what i have suffered it would be the hopes of the continuance of the more than sisterly love which has for years uninterruptedly bound us together as one mind and why my dear should you defer giving by a tie still stronger another friend to one who has so few i am glad you have sent my letter to miss montague i hope i shall hear no more of this unhappy man i had begun the particulars of my tragical story but it is so painful a task and i have so many more important things to do and as i apprehend so little time to do them in that could i avoid it i would go no farther in it then to this hour i know not by what means several of his machinations to ruin me were brought about so that some material parts of my sad story must be defective if i were to sit down to write it but i have been thinking of a way that will answer the end wished for by your mother and you full as well perhaps better mr lovelace it seems had communicated to his friend mr belford all that has passed between himself and me as he went on mr belford has not been able to deny it so that as we may observe by the way a poor young creature whose indiscretion has given a libertine power over her has a reason she little thinks of to regret her folly since these wretches who have no more honour in one point than in another scruple not to make her weakness a part of their triumph to their brother libertines i have nothing to apprehend of this sort if i have the justice done me in his letters which mr belford assures me i have and therefore the particulars of my story and the base arts of this vile man will i think be best collected from those very letters of his if mr belford can be prevailed upon to communicate them to which i dare appeal with the same truth and fervour as he did who says o that one would hear me and that mine adversary had written a book surely i would take it upon my shoulders and bind it to me as a crown for i covered not my transgressions as adam by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom there is one way which may be fallen upon to induce mr belford to communicate these letters since he seems to have and declares he always had a sincere abhorrence of his friends baseness to me but that youll say when you hear it is a strange one nevertheless i am very earnest upon it at present it is no other than this i think to make mr belford the executor of my last will dont be surprised and with this view i permit his visits with the less scruple and every time i see him from his concern for me am more and more inclined to do so if i hold in the same mind and if he accept the trust and will communicate the materials in his power those joined with what you can furnish will answer the whole end i know you will start at my notion of such an executor but pray my dear consider in my present circumstances what i can do better as i am empowered to make a will and have considerable matters in my own disposal your mother i am sure would not consent that you should take this office upon you it might subject mr hickman to the insults of that violent man mrs norton cannot for several reasons respecting herself my brother looks upon what i ought to have as his right my uncle harlowe is already one of my trustees as my cousin morden is the other for the estate my grandfather left me but you see i could not get from my own family the few guineas i left behind me at harloweplace and my uncle antony once threatened to have my grandfathers will controverted my father to be sure my dear i could not expect that my father would do all i wish should be done and a will to be executed by a father for a daughter parts of it perhaps absolutely against his own judgment carries somewhat daring and prescriptive in the very word if indeed my cousin morden were to come in time and would undertake this trust but even him it might subject to hazards and the more as he is a man of great spirit and as the other man of as great looks upon me unprotected as i have long been as his property now mr belford as i have already mentioned knows every thing that has passed he is a man of spirit and it seems as fearless as the other with more humane qualities you dont know my dear what instances of sincere humanity this mr belford has shown not only on occasion of the cruel arrest but on several occasions since and mrs lovick has taken pains to inquire after his general character and hears a very good one of him his justice and generosity in all his concerns of meum and tuum as they are called he has a knowledge of lawmatters and has two executorships upon him at this time in the discharge of which his honour is unquestioned all these reasons have already in a manner determined me to ask this favour of him although it will have an odd sound with it to make an intimate friend of mr lovelace my executor this is certain my brother will be more acquiescent a great deal in such a case with the articles of the will as he will see that it will be to no purpose to controvert some of them which else i dare say he would controvert or persuade my other friends to do so and who would involve an executor in a lawsuit if they could help it which would be the case if any body were left whom my brother could hope to awe or controul since my father has possession of all and is absolutely governed by him angry spirits my dear as i have often seen will be overcome by more angry ones as well as sometimes be disarmed by the meek nor would i wish you may believe to have effects torn out of my fathers hands while mr belford who is a man of fortune and a good economist in his own affairs would have no interest but to do justice then he exceedingly presses for some occasion to show his readiness to serve me and he would be able to manage his violent friend over whom he has more influence than any other person but after all i know not if it were not more eligible by far that my story and myself too should be forgotten as soon as possible and of this i shall have the less doubt if the character of my parents you will forgive my my dear cannot be guarded against the unqualified bitterness which from your affectionate zeal for me has sometimes mingled with your ink a point that ought and i insist upon it must be well considered of if any thing be done which your mother and you are desirous to have done the generality of the world is too apt to oppose a duty and general duties my dear ought not to be weakened by the justification of a single person however unhappily circumstanced my father has been so good as to take off the heavy malediction he laid me under i must be now solicitous for a last blessing and that is all i shall presume to petition for my sisters letter communicating this grace is a severe one but as she writes to me as from every body how could i expect it to be otherwise if you set out tomorrow this letter cannot reach you till you get to your aunt harmans i shall therefore direct it thither as mr hickman instructed me i hope you will have met with no inconveniencies in your little journey and voyage and that you will have found in good health all whom you wish to see well if your relations in the little island join their solicitations with your mothers commands to have your nuptials celebrated before you leave them let me beg of you my dear to oblige them how grateful will the notification that you have done so be to your ever faithful and affectionate cl harlowe letter lxii miss clarissa harlowe to miss harlowe saturday july i repine not my dear sister at the severity you have been pleased to express in the letter you favoured me with because that severity was accompanied with the grace i had petitioned for and because the reproaches of mine own heart are stronger than any other persons reproaches can be and yet i am not half so culpable as i am imagined to be as would be allowed if all the circumstances of my unhappy story were known and which i shall be ready to communicate to mrs norton if she be commissioned to inquire into them or to you my sister if you can have patience to hear them i remembered with a bleeding heart what day the th of july was i began with the eve of it and i passed the day itself as it was fit i should pass it nor have i any comfort to give to my dear and everhonoured father and mother and to you my bella but this that as it was the first unhappy anniversary of my birth in all probability it will be the last believe me my dear sister i say not this merely to move compassion but from the best grounds and as on that account i think it of the highest importance to my peace of mind to obtain one farther favour i would choose to owe to your intercession as my sister the leave i beg to address half a dozen lines with the hope of having them answered as i wish to either or to both my honoured parents to beg their last blessing this blessing is all the favour i have now to ask it is all i dare to ask yet am i afraid to rush at once though by letter into the presence of either and if i did not ask it it might seem to be owing to stubbornness and want of duty when my heart is all humility penitence only be so good as to embolden me to attempt this task write but this one line clary harlowe you are at liberty to write as you desire this will be enough and shall to my last hour be acknowledged as the greatest favour by your truly penitent sister clarissa harlowe letter lxiii mrs norton to miss clarissa harlowe monday july my dearest young lady i must indeed own that i took the liberty to write to your mother offering to enclose to her if she gave me leave yours of the th by which i thought she would see what was the state of your mind what the nature of your last troubles was from the wicked arrest what the people are where you lodge what proposals were made you from lord ms family also your sincere penitence and how much miss howes writing to them in the terms she wrote in disturbed you but as you have taken the matter into your own hands and forbid me in your last to act in this nice affair unknown to you i am glad the letter was not required of me and indeed it may be better that the matter lie wholly between you and them since my affection for you is thought to proceed from partiality they would choose no doubt that you should owe to themselves and not to my humble mediation the favour for which you so earnestly sue and of which i would not have your despair for i will venture to assure you that your mother is ready to take the first opportunity to show her maternal tenderness and this i gather from several hints i am not at liberty to explain myself upon i long to be with you now i am better and now my son is in a fair way of recovery but is it not hard to have it signified to me that at present it will not be taken well if i go i suppose while the reconciliation which i hope will take place is negotiating by means of the correspondence so newly opened between you and your sister but if you will have me come i will rely on my good intentions and risque every ones displeasure mr brand has business in town to solicit for a benefice which it is expected the incumbent will be obliged to quit for a better preferment and when there he is to inquire privately after your way of life and of your health he is a very officious young man and but that your uncle harlowe who has chosen him for this errand regards him as an oracle your mother had rather any body else had been sent he is one of those puzzling overdoing gentlemen who think they see farther into matters than any body else and are fond of discovered mysteries where there are none in order to be thought shrewd men i cant say i like him either in the pulpit or out of it i who had a father one of the soundest divines and finest scholars in the kingdom who never made an ostentation of what he knew but loved and venerated he gospel he taught preferring it to all other learning to be obliged to hear a young man depart from his text as soon as he has named it so contrary too to the example set him by his learned and worthy principal when his health permits him to preach and throwing about to a christian and country audience scraps of latin and greek from the pagan classics and not always brought in with great propriety neither if i am to judge by the only way given me to judge of them by the english he puts them into is an indication of something wrong either in his head or his heart or both for otherwise his education at the university must have taught him better you know my dear miss clary the honour i have for the cloth it is owing to that that i say what i do dr lewen i know not the day he is to set out and as his inquiries are to be private be pleased to take no notice of this intelligence i have no doubt that your life and conversation are such as may defy the scrutinies of the most officious inquirer i am just now told that you have written a second letter to your sister but am afraid they will wait for mr brands report before farther favour will be obtained from them for they will not yet believe you are so ill as i fear you are but you would soon find that you have an indulgent mother were she at liberty to act according to her own inclination and this gives me great hopes that all will end well at last for i verily think you are in the right way to a reconciliation god give a blessing to it and restore your health and you to all your friends prays your ever affectionate judith norton your mother has privately sent me five guineas she is pleased to say to help us in the illness we have been afflicted with but more likely that i might send them to you as from myself i hope therefore i may send them up with ten more i have still left i will send you word of mr mordens arrival the moment i know it if agreeable i should be glad to know all that passes between your relations and you letter lxiv miss clarissa harlowe to mrs norton wednesday aug you give me my dear mrs norton great pleasure in hearing of yours and your sons recovery may you continue for many many years a blessing to each other you tell me that you did actually write to my mother offering to enclose to her mine of the th past and you say it was not required of you that is to say although you cover it over as gently as you could that your offer was rejected which makes it evident that no plea could be made for me yet you bid me hope that the grace i sued for would in time be granted the grace i then sued for was indeed granted but you are afraid you say that they will wait for mr brands report before favour will be obtained in return to the second letter which i wrote to my sister and you add that i have an indulgent mother were she at liberty to act according to her own inclination and that all will end well at last but what my dear mrs norton what is the grace i sue for in my second letter it is not that they will receive me into favour if they think it is they are mistaken i do not i cannot expect that nor as i have often said should i if they would receive me bear to live in the eye of those dear friends whom i have so grievously offended tis only simply a blessing i ask a blessing to die with not to lie with do they know that and do they know that their unkindness will perhaps shorten my date so that their favour if ever they intend to grant it may come too late once more i desire you not to think of coming to me i have no uneasiness now but what proceeds from the apprehension of seeing a man i would not see for the world if i could help it and from the severity of my nearest and dearest relations a severity entirely their own i doubt for you tell me that my brother is at edinburgh you would therefore heighten their severity and make yourself enemies besides if you were to come to me dont you see you would mr brand may come if he will he is a clergyman and must mean well or i must think so let him say of me what he will all my fear is that as he knows i am in disgrace with a family whose esteem he is desirous to cultivate and as he has obligations to my uncle harlowe and to my father he will be but a languid acquitter not that i am afraid of what he or any body in the world can hear as to my conduct you may my revered and dear friend indeed you may rest satisfied that that is such as may warrant me to challenge the inquiries of the most officious i will send you copies of what passes as you desire when i have an answer to my second letter i now begin to wish that i had taken the heart to write to my father himself or to my mother at least instead of to my sister and yet i doubt my poor mother can do nothing for me of herself a strong confederacy my dear mrs norton a strong confederacy indeed against a poor girl their daughter sister niece my brother perhaps got it renewed before he left them he needed not his work is done and more than done dont afflict yourself about moneymatters on my account i have no occasion for money i am glad my mother was so considerate to you i was in pain for you on the same subject but heaven will not permit so good a woman to want the humble blessings she was always satisfied with i wish every individual of our family were but as rich as you o my mamma norton you are rich you are rich indeed the true riches are such content as you are blessed with and i hope in god that i am in the way to be rich too adieu my everindulgent friend you say all will be at last happy and i know it will i confide that it will with as much security as you may that i will be to my last hour your ever grateful and affectionate cl harlowe letter lxv mr lovelace to john belford esq tuesday aug i am most confoundedly chagrined and disappointed for here on saturday arrived a messenger from miss howe with a letter to my cousins which i knew nothing of till yesterday when lady sarah and lady betty were procured to be here to sit in judgment upon it with the old peer and my two kinswomen and never was bear so miserably baited as thy poor friend and for what why for the cruelty of miss harlowe for have i committed any new offence and would i not have reinstated myself in her favour upon her own terms if i could and is it fair to punish me for what is my misfortune and not my fault such eventjudging fools as i have for my relations i am ashamed of them all see letter lv of this volume in that of miss howe was enclosed one to her from miss harlowe to be transmitted to my cousins containing a final rejection of me and that in very vehement and positive terms yet she pretends that in this rejection she is governed more by principle than passion dd lie as ever was told and as a proof that she is says that she can forgive me and does on this one condition that i will never molest her more the whole letter so written as to make herself more admired me more detested see letter xli of this volume what we have been told of the agitations and workings and sighings and sobbings of the french prophets among us formerly was nothing at all to the scene exhibited by these maudlin souls at the reading of these letters and of some affecting passages extracted from another of my fair implacables to miss howe such lamentations for the loss of so charming a relation such applaudings of her virtue of her exaltedness of soul and sentiment such menaces of disinherisons i not needing their reproaches to be stung to the heart with my own reflections and with the rage of disappointment and as sincerely as any of them admiring her what the devil cried i is all this for is it not enough to be despised and rejected can i help her implacable spirit would i not repair the evils i have made her suffer then was i ready to curse them all herself and miss howe for company and heartily swore that she should yet be mine i now swear it over again to thee were her death to follow in a week after the knot is tied by the lord of heaven it shall be tied and she shall die a lovelace tell her so if thou wilt but at the same time tell her that i have no view to her fortune and that i will solemnly resign that and all pretensions to it in whose favour she pleases if she resign life issueless i am not so lowminded a wretch as to be guilty of any sordid views to her fortune let her judge for herself then whether it be not for her honour rather to leave this world a lovelace than a harlowe but do not think i will entirely rest a cause so near my heart upon an advocate who so much more admires his clients adversary than his client i will go to town in a few days in order to throw myself at her feet and i will carry with me or have at hand a resolute wellprepared parson and the ceremony shall be performed let what will be the consequence but if she will permit me to attend her for this purpose at either of the churches mentioned in the license which she has by her and thank heaven has not returned me with my letters then will i not disturb her but meet her at the altar in either church and will engage to bring my two cousins to attend her and even lady sarah and lady betty and my lord m in person shall give her to me or if it be still more agreeable to her i will undertake that either lady sarah or lady betty or both shall go to town and attend her down and the marriage shall be celebrated in their presence and in that of lord m either here or elsewhere at her own choice do not play me booty belford but sincerely and warmly use all the eloquence thou art master of to prevail upon her to choose one of these three methods one of them she must choose by my soul she must here is charlotte tapping at my closetdoor for admittance what a devil wants charlotte i will hear no more reproaches come in girl my cousin charlotte finding me writing on with too much earnestness to have any regard for politeness to her and guessing at my subject besought me to let her see what i had written i obliged her and she was so highly pleased on seeing me so much in earnest that she offered and i accepted her offer to write a letter to miss harlowe with permission to treat me in it as she thought fit i shall enclose a copy of her letter when she had written it she brought it to me with apologies for the freedom taken with me in it but i excused it and she was ready to give me a kiss for it telling her i had hopes of success from it and that i thought she had luckily hit it off every one approves of it as well as i and is pleased with me for so patiently submitting to be abused and undertaken for if it do not succeed all the blame will be thrown upon the dear creatures perverseness her charitable or forgiving disposition about which she makes such a parade will be justly questioned and the piety of which she is now in full possession will be transferred to me putting therefore my whole confidence in this letter i postpone all my other alternatives as also my going to town till my empress send an answer to my cousin montague but if she persist and will not promise to take time to consider of the matter thou mayest communicate to her what i had written as above before my cousin entered and if she be still perverse assure her that i must and will see her but this with all honour all humility and if i cannot move her in my favour i will then go abroad and perhaps never more return to england i am sorry thou art at this critical time so busily employed as thou informest me thou art in thy watford affairs and in preparing to do belton justice if thou wantest my assistance in the latter command me though engrossed by this perverse beauty and plagued as i am i will obey thy first summons i have great dependence upon thy zeal and thy friendship hasten back to her therefore and resume a task so interesting to me that it is equally the subject of my dreams as of my waking hours letter lxvi miss montague to miss clarissa harlowe tuesday aug dearest madam all our family is deeply sensible of the injuries you have received at the hands of one of it whom you only can render in any manner worthy of the relation he stands in to us all and if as an act of mercy and charity the greatest your pious heart can show you will be pleased to look over his past wickedness and ingratitude and suffer yourself to be our kinswoman you will make us the happiest family in the world and i can engage that lord m and lady sarah sadleir and lady betty lawrance and my sister who are all admirers of your virtues and of your nobleness of mind will for ever love and reverence you and do every thing in all their powers to make you amends for what you have suffered from mr lovelace this madam we should not however dare to petition for were we not assured that mr lovelace is most sincerely sorry for his past vileness to you and that he will on his knees beg your pardon and vow eternal love and honour to you wherefore my dearest cousin how you will charm us all if this agreeable style may be permitted for all our sakes for his souls sake you must i am sure be so good a lady as to wish to save a soul and allow me to say for your own fames sake condescend to our joint request and if by way of encouragement you will but say you will be glad to see and to be as much known personally as you are by fame to charlotte montague i will in two days time from the receipt of your permission wait upon you with or without my sister and receive your farther commands let me our dearest cousin we cannot deny ourselves the pleasure of calling you so let me entreat you to give me your permission for my journey to london and put it in the power of lord m and of the ladies of the family to make you what reparation they can make you for the injuries which a person of the greatest merit in the world has received from one of the most audacious men in it and you will infinitely oblige us all and particularly her who repeatedly presumes to style herself your affectionate cousin and obliged servant charlotte montague letter lxvii mr belford to robert lovelace esq thursday morning aug six oclock i have been so much employed in my own and beltons affairs that i could not come to town till last night having contented myself with sending to mrs lovick to know from time to time the state of the ladys health of which i received but very indifferent accounts owing in a great measure to letters or advices brought her from her implacable family i have now completed my own affairs and next week shall go to epsom to endeavour to put beltons sister into possession of his own house for him after which i shall devote myself wholly to your service and to that of the lady i was admitted to her presence last night and found her visibly altered for the worse when i went home i had your letter of tuesday last put into my hands let me tell thee lovelace that i insist upon the performance of thy engagement to me that thou wilt not personally molest her mr belford dates again on thursday morning ten oclock and gives an account of a conversation which he had just held with the lady upon the subject of miss montagues letter to her preceding and upon mr lovelaces alternatives as mentioned in letter lxv which mr belford supported with the utmost earnestness but as the result of this conversation will be found in the subsequent letters mr belfords pleas and arguments in favour of his friend and the ladys answers are omitted letter lxviii miss clarissa harlowe to miss montague thursday aug dear madam i am infinitely obliged to you for your kind and condescending letter a letter however which heightens my regrets as it gives me a new instance of what a happy creature i might have been in an alliance so much approved of by such worthy ladies and which on their accounts and on that of lord m would have been so reputable to myself and was once so desirable but indeed indeed madam my heart sincerely repulses the man who descended from such a family could be guilty first of such premeditated violence as he has been guilty of and as he knows farther intended me on the night previous to the day he set out for berkshire and next pretending to spirit could be so mean as to wish to lift into that family a person he was capable of abasing into a companionship with the most abandoned of her sex allow me then dear madam to declare with favour that i think i never could be ranked with the ladies of a family so splendid and so noble if by vowing love and honour at the altar to such a violator i could sanctify as i may say his unprecedented and elaborate wickedness permit me however to make one request to my good lord m and to lady betty and lady sarah and to your kind self and your sister it is that you will all be pleased to join your authority and interests to prevail upon mr lovelace not to molest me farther be pleased to tell him that if i am designed for life it will be very cruel in him to attempt to hunt me out of it for i am determined never to see him more if i can help it the more cruel because he knows that i have nobody to defend me from him nor do i wish to engage any body to his hurt or to their own if i am on the other hand destined for death it will be no less cruel if he will not permit me to die in peace since a peaceable and happy end i wish him indeed i do every worldly good attend you dear madam and every branch of the honourable family is the wish of one whose misfortune it is that she is obliged to disclaim any other title than that of dear madam your and their obliged and faithful servant clarissa harlowe letter lxix mr belford to robert lovelace esq thursday afternoon aug i am just now agreeably surprised by the following letter delivered into my hands by a messenger from the lady the letter she mentions as enclosed i have returned without taking a copy of it the contents of it will soon be communicated to you i presume by other hands they are an absolute rejection of thee poor lovelace see miss harlowes letter no lxviii to john belford esq aug sir you have frequently offered to oblige me in any thing that shall be within your power and i have such an opinion of you as to be willing to hope that at the times you made these offers you meant more than mere compliment i have therefore two requests to make to you the first i will now mention the other if this shall be complied with otherwise not it behoves me to leave behind me such an account as may clear up my conduct to several of my friends who will not at present concern themselves about me and miss howe and her mother are very solicitous that i will do so i am apprehensive that i shall not have time to do this and you will not wonder that i have less and less inclination to set about such a painful task especially as i find myself unable to look back with patience on what i have suffered and shall be too much discomposed by the retrospection were i obliged to make it to proceed with the requisite temper in a task of still greater importance which i have before me it is very evident to me that your wicked friend has given you from time to time a circumstantial account of all his behaviour to me and devices against me and you have more than once assured me that he has done my character all the justice i could wish for both by writing and speech now sir if i may have a fair a faithful specimen from his letters or accounts to you written upon some of the most interesting occasions i shall be able to judge whether there will or will not be a necessity for me for my honours sake to enter upon the solicited task you may be assured from my enclosed answer to the letter which miss montague has honoured me with and which youll be pleased to return me as soon as read that it is impossible for me ever to think of your friend in the way i am importuned to think of him he cannot therefore receive any detriment from the requested specimen and i give you my honour that no use shall be made of it to his prejudice in law or otherwise and that it may not after i am no more i assure you that it is a main part of my view that the passages you shall oblige me with shall be always in your own power and not in that of any other person if sir you think fit to comply with my request the passages i would wish to be transcribed making neither better nor worse of the matter are those which he has written to you on or about the th and th of june when i was alarmed by the wicked pretence of a fire and what he has written from sunday june to the th and in doing this you will much oblige your humble servant clarissa harlowe now lovelace since there are no hopes for thee of her returning favour since some praise may lie for thy ingenuousness having neither offered as more diminutiveminded libertines would have done to palliate thy crimes by aspersing the lady or her sex since she may be made easier by it since thou must fare better from thine own pen than from hers and finally since thy actions have manifested that thy letters are not the most guilty part of what she knows of thee i see not why i may not oblige her upon her honour and under the restrictions and for the reasons she has given and this without breach of the confidence due to friendly communication especially as i might have added since thou gloriest in thy pen and in thy wickedness and canst not be ashamed but be this as it may she will be obliged before thy remonstrances or clamours against it can come so prythee now make the best of it and rave not except for the sake of a pretence against me and to exercise thy talent of execration and if thou likest to do so for these reasons rave and welcome i long to know what the second request is but this i know that if it be any thing less than cutting thy throat or endangering my own neck i will certainly comply and be proud of having it in my power to oblige her and now i am actually going to be busy in the extracts letter lxx mr belford to miss clarissa harlowe aug madam you have engaged me to communicate to you upon my honour making neither better nor worse of the matter what mr lovelace has written to me in relation to yourself in the period preceding your going to hampstead and in that between the th and th of june and you assure me you have no view in this request but to see if it be necessary for you from the account he gives to touch upon the painful subjects yourself for the sake of your own character your commands madam are of a very delicate nature as they may seem to affect the secrets of private friendship but as i know you are not capable of a view the motives to which you will not own and as i think the communication may do some credit to my unhappy friends character as an ingenuous man though his actions by the most excellent woman in the world have lost him all title to that of an honourable one i obey you with the greater cheerfulness he then proceeds with his extracts and concludes them with an address to her in his friends behalf in the following words and now madam i have fulfilled your commands and i hope have not disserved my friend with you since you will hereby see the justice he does to your virtue in every line he writes he does the same in all his letters though to his own condemnation and give me leave to add that if this everamiable sufferer can think it in any manner consistent with her honour to receive his vows on the altar on his truly penitent turn of mind i have not the least doubt but that he will make her the best and tenderest of husbands what obligation will not the admirable lady hereby lay upon all his noble family who so greatly admire her and i will presume to say upon her own when the unhappy family aversion which certainly has been carried to an unreasonable height against him shall be got over and a general reconciliation takes place for who is it that would not give these two admirable persons to each other were not his morals an objection however this be i would humbly refer to you madam whether as you will be mistress of very delicate particulars from me his friend you should not in honour think yourself concerned to pass them by as if you had never seen them and not to take advantage of the communication not even in an argument as some perhaps might lie with respect to the premeditated design he seems to have had not against you as you but as against the sex over whom i am sorry i can bear witness myself it is the villanous aim of all libertines to triumph and i would not if any misunderstanding should arise between him and me give him room to reproach me that his losing of you and through his usage of you of his own friends were owing to what perhaps he would call breach of trust were he to judge rather by the event than by my intention i am madam with the most profound veneration your most faithful humble servant j belford letter lxxi miss clarissa harlowe to john belford esq friday aug sir i hold myself extremely obliged to you for your communications i will make no use of them that you shall have reason to reproach either yourself or me with i wanted no new lights to make the unhappy mans premeditated baseness to me unquestionable as my answer to miss montagues letter might convince you see letter lxviii of this volume i must own in his favour that he has observed some decency in his accounts to you of the most indecent and shocking actions and if all his strangelycommunicative narrations are equally decent nothing will be rendered criminally odious by them but the vile heart that could meditate such contrivances as were much stronger evidences of his inhumanity than of his wit since men of very contemptible parts and understanding may succeed in the vilest attempts if they can once bring themselves to trample on the sanctions which bind man to man and sooner upon an innocent person than upon any other because such a one is apt to judge of the integrity of others hearts by its own i find i have had great reason to think myself obliged to your intention in the whole progress of my sufferings it is however impossible sir to miss the natural inference on this occasion that lies against his predetermined baseness but i say the less because you shall not think i borrow from what you have communicated aggravations that are not needed and now sir that i may spare you the trouble of offering any future arguments in his favour let me tell you that i have weighed every thing thoroughly all that human vanity could suggest all that a desirable reconciliation with my friends and the kind respects of his own could bid me hope for the enjoyment of miss howes friendship the dearest consideration to me now of all the worldly ones all these i have weighed and the result is and was before you favoured me with these communications that i have more satisfaction in the hope that in one month there will be an end of all with me than in the most agreeable things that could happen from an alliance with mr lovelace although i were to be assured he would make the best and tenderest of husbands but as to the rest if satisfied with the evils he has brought upon me he will forbear all further persecutions of me i will to my last hour wish him good although he hath overwhelmed the fatherless and digged a pit for his friend fatherless may she well be called and motherless too who has been denied all paternal protection and motherly forgiveness and now sir acknowledging gratefully your favour in the extracts i come to the second request i had to make you which requires a great deal of courage to mention and which courage nothing but a great deal of distress and a very destitute condition can give but if improper i can but be denied and dare to say i shall be at least excused thus then i preface it you see sir that i am thrown absolutely into the hands of strangers who although as kind and compassionate as strangers can be wished to be are nevertheless persons from whom i cannot expect any thing more than pity and good wishes nor can my memory receive from them any more protection than my person if either should need it if then i request it of the only person possessed of materials that will enable him to do my character justice and who has courage independence and ability to oblige me to be the protector or my memory as i may say and to be my executor and to see some of my dying requests performed and if i leave it to him to do the whole in his own way manner and time consulting however in requisite cases my dear miss howe i presume to hope that this my second request may be granted and if it may these satisfactions will accrue to me from the favour done me and the office undertaken it will be an honour to my memory with all those who shall know that i was so well satisfied of my innocence that having not time to write my own story i could intrust it to the relation which the destroyer of my fame and fortunes has given of it i shall not be apprehensive of involving any one in my troubles or hazards by this task either with my own relations or with your friend having dispositions to make which perhaps my own friends will not be so well pleased with as it were to be wished they would be as i intend not unreasonable ones but you know sir where self is judge matters even with good people will not always be rightly judged of i shall also be freed from the pain of recollecting things that my soul is vexed at and this at a time when its tumults should be allayed in order to make way for the most important preparation and who knows but that mr belford who already from a principle of humanity is touched at my misfortunes when he comes to revolve the whole story placed before him in one strong light and when he shall have the catastrophe likewise before him and shall become in a manner interested in it who knows but that from a still higher principle he may so regulate his future actions as to find his own reward in the everlasting welfare which is wished him by his obliged servant clarissa harlowe letter lxxii mr belford to miss clarissa harlowe friday aug madam i am so sensible of the honour done me in yours of this day that i would not delay for one moment the answering of it i hope you will live to see many happy years and to be your own executrix in those points which your heart is most set upon but in the case of survivorship i most cheerfully accept of the sacred office you are pleased to offer me and you may absolutely rely upon my fidelity and if possible upon the literal performance of every article you shall enjoin me the effect of the kind wish you conclude with had been my concern ever since i have been admitted to the honour of your conversation it shall be my whole endeavour that it be not vain the happiness of approaching you which this trust as i presume will give me frequent opportunities of doing must necessarily promote the desired end since it will be impossible to be a witness of your piety equanimity and other virtues and not aspire to emulate you all i beg is that you will not suffer any future candidate or event to displace me unless some new instances of unworthiness appear either in the morals or behaviour of madam your most obliged and faithful servant j belford letter lxxiii mr belford to robert lovelace esq friday night aug i have actually delivered to the lady the extracts she requested me to give her from your letters i do assure you that i have made the very best of the matter for you not that conscience but that friendship could oblige me to make i have changed or omitted some free words the warm description of her person in the firescene as i may call it i have omitted i have told her that i have done justice to you in the justice you have done to her by her unexampled virtue but take the very words which i wrote to her immediately following the extracts and now madam see the paragraph marked with an inverted comma thus letter lxx of this volume the lady is extremely uneasy at the thoughts of your attempting to visit her for heavens sake your word being given and for pitys sake for she is really in a very weak and languishing way let me beg of you not to think of it yesterday afternoon she received a cruel letter as mrs lovick supposes it to be by the effect it had upon her from her sister in answer to one written last saturday entreating a blessing and forgiveness from her parents she acknowledges that if the same decency and justice are observed in all of your letters as in the extracts i have obliged her with as i have assured her they are she shall think herself freed from the necessity of writing her own story and this is an advantage to thee which thou oughtest to thank me for but what thinkest thou is the second request she had to make to me no other than that i would be her executor her motives will appear before thee in proper time and then i dare to answer will be satisfactory you cannot imagine how proud i am of this trust i am afraid i shall too soon come into the execution of it as she is always writing what a melancholy pleasure will be the perusal and disposition of her papers afford me such a sweetness of temper so much patience and resignation as she seems to be mistress of yet writing of and in the midst of present distresses how much more lively and affecting for that reason must her style be her mind tortured by the pangs of uncertainty the events then hidden in the womb of fate than the dry narrative unanimated style of persons relating difficulties and dangers surmounted the relater perfectly at ease and if himself unmoved by his own story not likely greatly to affect the reader saturday morning aug i am just returned from visiting the lady and thanking her in person for the honour she has done me and assuring her if called to the sacred trust of the utmost fidelity and exactness i found her very ill i took notice of it she said she had received a second hardhearted letter from her sister and she had been writing a letter and that on her knees directly to her mother which before she had not had the courage to do it was for a last blessing and forgiveness no wonder she said that i saw her affected now that i had accepted of the last charitable office for her for which as well as for complying with her other request she thanked me i should one day have all these letters before me and could she have a kind one in return to that she had been now writing to counterbalance the unkind one she had from her sister she might be induced to show me both together otherwise for her sisters sake it were no matter how few saw the poor bellas letter i knew she would be displeased if i had censured the cruelty of her relations i therefore only said that surely she must have enemies who hoped to find their account in keeping up the resentments of her friends against her it may be so mr belford said she the unhappy never want enemies one fault wilfully committed authorizes the imputation of many more where the ear is opened to accusations accusers will not be wanting and every one will officiously come with stories against a disgraced child where nothing dare be said in her favour i should have been wise in time and not have needed to be convinced by my own misfortunes of the truth of what common experience daily demonstrates mr lovelaces baseness my fathers inflexibility my sisters reproaches are the natural consequences of my own rashness so i must make the best of my hard lot only as these consequences follow one another so closely while they are new how can i help being anew affected i asked if a letter written by myself by her doctor or apothecary to any of her friends representing her low state of health and great humility would be acceptable or if a journey to any of them would be of service i would gladly undertake it in person and strictly conform to her orders to whomsoever she should direct me to apply she earnestly desired that nothing of this sort might be attempted especially without her knowledge and consent miss howe she said had done harm by her kindlyintended zeal and if there were room to expect favour by mediation she had ready at hand a kind friend mrs norton who for piety and prudence had few equals and who would let slip no opportunity to endeavour to do her service i let her know that i was going out of town till monday she wished me pleasure and said she should be glad to see me on my return adieu letter lxxiv miss ar harlowe to miss cl harlowe in answer to hers of july see letter lxii of this volume thursday morn aug sister clary i wish you would not trouble me with any more of your letters you had always a knack at writing and depended upon making every one do what you would when you wrote but your wit and folly have undone you and now as all naughty creatures do when they cant help themselves you come begging and praying and make others as uneasy as yourself when i wrote last to you i expected that i should not be at rest and so youd creep on by little and little till youll want to be received again but you only hope for forgiveness and a blessing you say a blessing for what sister clary think for what however i read your letter to my father and mother i wont tell you what my father said one who has the true sense you boast to have of your misdeeds may guess without my telling you what a justlyincensed father would say on such an occasion my poor mother o wretch what has not your ungrateful folly cost my poor mother had you been less a darling you would not perhaps have been so graceless but i never in my life saw a cockered favourite come to good my heart is full and i cant help writing my mind for your crimes have disgraced us all and i am afraid and ashamed to go to any public or private assembly or diversion and why i need not say why when your actions are the subjects either of the open talk or of the affronting whispers of both sexes at all such places upon the whole i am sorry i have no more comfort to send you but i find nobody willing to forgive you i dont know what time may do for you and when it is seen that your penitence is not owing more to disappointment than to true conviction for it is too probable miss clary that had not your featherheaded villain abandoned you we should have heard nothing of these moving supplications nor of any thing but defiances from him and a guilt gloried in from you and this is every ones opinion as well as that of your afflicted sister arabella harlowe i send this by a particular hand who undertakes to give it you or leave it for you by tomorrow night letter lxxv miss clarissa harlowe to her mother saturday aug honoured madam no selfconvicted criminal ever approached her angry and just judge with greater awe nor with a truer contrition than i do you by these lines indeed i must say that if the latter of my humble prayer had not respected my future welfare i had not dared to take this liberty but my heart is set upon it as upon a thing next to god almightys forgiveness necessary for me had my happy sister known my distresses she would not have wrung my heart as she has done by a severity which i must needs think unkind and unsisterly but complaint of any unkindness from her belongs not to me yet as she is pleased to write that it must be seen that my penitence is less owing to disappointment than to true conviction permit me madam to insist upon it that if such a plea can be allowed me i an actually entitled to the blessing i sue for since my humble prayer is founded upon a true and unfeigned repentance and this you will the readier believe if the creature who never to the best of her remembrance told her mamma a wilful falsehood may be credited when she declares as she does in the most solemn manner that she met the seducer with a determination not to go off with him that the rash step was owing more to compulsion than to infatuation and that her heart was so little in it that she repented and grieved from the moment she found herself in his power and for every moment after for several weeks before she had any cause from him to apprehend the usage she met with wherefore on my knees my everhonoured mamma for on my knees i write this letter i do most humbly beg your blessing say but in so many words i ask you not madam to call me your daughter lost unhappy wretch i forgive you and may god bless you this is all let me on a blessed scrap of paper but see one sentence to this effect under your dear hand that i may hold it to my heart in my most trying struggles and i shall think it a passport to heaven and if i do not too much presume and it were we instead of i and both your honoured names subjoined to it i should then have nothing more to wish then would i say great and merciful god thou seest here in this paper thy poor unworthy creature absolved by her justlyoffended parents oh join for my redeemers sake thy allgracious fiat and receive a repentant sinner to the arms of thy mercy i can conjure you madam by no subject of motherly tenderness that will not in the opinion of my severe censurers before whom this humble address must appear

miss montague to miss clarissa harlowe in answer to hers of aug see letter lxviii of this volume monday aug dear madam we were all of opinion before your letter came that mr lovelace was utterly unworthy of you and deserved condign punishment rather than to be blessed with such a wife and hoped far more from your kind consideration for us than any we supposed you could have for so base an injurer for we were all determined to love you and admire you let his behaviour to you be what it would but after your letter what can be said i am however commanded to write in all the subscribing names to let you know how greatly your sufferings have affected us to tell you that my lord m has forbid him ever more to enter the doors of the apartments where he shall be and as you labour under the unhappy effects of your friends displeasure which may subject you to inconveniencies his lordship and lady sarah and lady betty beg of you to accept for your life or at least till you are admitted to enjoy your own estate of one hundred guineas per quarter which will be regularly brought you by an especial hand and of the enclosed bankbill for a beginning and do not dearest madam we all beseech you do not think you are beholden for this token of lord ms and lady sarahs and lady bettys love to you to the friends of this vile man for he has not one friend left among us we each of us desire to be favoured with a place in your esteem and to be considered upon the same foot of relationship as if what once was so much our pleasure to hope would be had been and it shall be our united prayer that you may recover health and spirits and live to see many happy years and since this wretch can no more be pleaded for that when he is gone abroad as he now is preparing to do we may be permitted the honour of a personal acquaintance with a lady who has no equal these are the earnest requests dearest young lady of your affectionate friends and most faithful servants m sarah sadleir eliz lawrance charl montague marth montague you will break the hearts of the three firstnamed more particularly if you refuse them your acceptance dearest young lady punish not them for his crimes we send by a particular hand which will bring us we hope your accepting favour mr lovelace writes by the same hand but he knows nothing of our letter nor we of his for we shun each other and one part of the house holds us another him the remotest from each other letter lxxvii mr lovelace to john belford esq sat aug i am so disturbed at the contents of miss harlowes answer to my cousin charlottes letter of tuesday last which was given her by the same fellow that gave me yours that i have hardly patience or consideration enough to weigh what you write she had need indeed to cry out for mercy for herself from her friends who knows not how to show any she is a true daughter of the harlowes by my soul jack she is a true daughter of the harlowes yet has she so many excellencies that i must love her and fool that i am love her the more for despising me thou runnest on with thy cursed nonsensical reformado rote of dying dying dying and having once got the word by the end canst not help foisting it in at every period the devil take me if i dont think thou wouldst rather give her poison with thy own hands rather than she should recover and rob thee of the merit of being a conjurer but no more of thy cursed knell thy changes upon deaths candlestick turned bottomupwards shell live to bury me i see that for by my soul i can neither eat drink nor sleep nor what is still worse love any woman in the world but her nor care i to look upon a woman now on the contrary i turn my head from every one i meet except by chance an eye an air a feature strikes me resembling hers in some glancingby face and then i cannot forbear looking again though the second look recovers me for there can be nobody like her but surely belford the devils in this woman the more i think of her nonsense and obstinacy the less patience i have with her is it possible she can do herself her family her friends so much justice any other way as by marrying me were she sure she should live but a day she ought to die a wife if her christian revenge will not let her wish to do so for her own sake ought she not for the sake of her family and of her sex which she pretends sometimes to have so much concern for and if no sake is dear enough to move her harlowespirit in my favour has she any title to the pity thou so pitifully art always bespeaking for her as to the difference which her letter has made between me and the stupid family here and i must tell thee we are all broke in pieces i value not that of a button they are fools to anathematize and curse me who can give them ten curses for one were they to hold it for a day together i have one half of the house to myself and that the best for the great enjoy that least which costs them most grandeur and use are two things the common part is theirs the state part is mine and here i lord it and will lord it as long as i please while the two pursy sisters the old gouty brother and the two musty nieces are stived up in the other half and dare not stir for fear of meeting me whom thats the jest of it they have forbidden coming into their apartments as i have them into mine and so i have them all prisoners while i range about as i please pretty dogs and doggesses to quarrel and bark at me and yet whenever i appear afraid to pop out of their kennels or if out before they see me at the sight of me run growling in again with their flapt ears their sweeping dewlaps and their quivering tails curling inwards and here while i am thus worthily waging war with beetles drones wasps and hornets and am all on fire with the rage of slighted love thou art regaling thyself with phlegm and rockwater and art going on with thy reformationscheme and thy exultations in my misfortunes the devil take thee for an insensible doughbaked varlet i have no more patience with thee than with the lady for thou knowest nothing either of love or friendship but art as unworthy of the one as incapable of the other else wouldst thou not rejoice as thou dost under the grimace of pity in my disappointments and thou art a pretty fellow art thou not to engage to transcribe for her some parts of my letters written to thee in confidence letters that thou shouldest sooner have parted with thy cursed tongue than have owned that thou ever hadst received such yet these are now to be communicated to her but i charge thee and woe be to thee if it be too late that thou do not oblige her with a line of mine if thou hast done it the least vengeance i will take is to break through my honour given to thee not to visit her as thou wilt have broken through thine to me in communicating letters written under the seal of friendship i am now convinced too sadly for my hopes by her letter to my cousin charlotte that she is determined never to have me unprecedented wickedness she calls mine to her but how does she know what love in its flaming ardour will stimulate men to do how does she know the requisite distinctions of the words she uses in this case to think the worst and to be able to make comparisons in these very delicate situations must she not be less delicate than i had imagined her to be but she has head that the devil is black and having a mind to make one of me brays together in the mortar of her wild fancy twenty chimneysweepers in order to make one sootier than ordinary rise out of the dirty mass but what a whirlwind does she raise in my soul by her proud contempts of me never never was mortal mans pride so mortified how does she sink me even in my own eyes her heart sincerely repulses me she says for my meanness yet she intends to reap the benefit of what she calls so curse upon her haughtiness and her meanness at the same time her haughtiness to me and her meanness to her own relations more unworthy of kindred with her than i can be or i am mean indeed yet who but must admire who but must adore her oh that cursed cursed house but for the women of that then their dd potions but for those had her unimpaired intellects and the majesty of her virtue saved her as once it did by her humble eloquence another time by her terrifying menaces against her own life in the firescene vol v letter xvi vol vi letter xxxvi in the penknifescene yet in both these to find her power over me and my love for her and to hate to despise and to refuse me she might have done this with some show of justice had the lastintended violation been perpetrated but to go away conqueress and triumphant in every light well may she despise me for suffering her to do so she left me low and mean indeed and the impression holds with her i could tear my flesh that i gave her not cause that i humbled her not indeed or that i staid not in town to attend her motions instead of lord ms till i could have exalted myself by giving to myself a wife superior to all trial to all temptation i will venture one more letter to her however and if that dont do or procure me an answer then will i endeavour to see her let what will be the consequence if she get out of my way i will do some noble mischief to the vixen girl whom she most loves and then quit the kingdom for ever and now jack since thy hand is in at communicating the contents of private letters tell her this if thou wilt and add to it that if she abandon me god will and what then will be the fate of her lovelace letter lxxviii mr lovelace to john belford esq in answer to letter lxv of this volume monday aug and so you have actually delivered to the fair implacable extracts of letters written in the confidence of friendship take care take care belford i do indeed love you better than i love any man in the world but this is a very delicate point the matter is grown very serious to me my heart is bent upon having her and have her i will though i marry her in the agonies of death she is very earnest you say that i will not offer to molest her that let me tell her will absolutely depend upon herself and the answer she returns whether by pen and ink or the contemptuous one of silence which she bestowed upon my last four to her and i will write it in such humble and in such reasonable terms that if she be not a true harlowe she shall forgive me but as to the executorship which she is for conferring upon thee thou shalt not be her executor let me perish if thou shalt nor shall she die nobody shall be any thing nobody shall dare to be any thing to her but i thy happiness is already too great to be admitted daily to her presence to look upon her to talk to her to hear her talk while i am forbid to come within view of her window what a reprobation is this of the man who was once more dear to her than all the men in the world and now to be able to look down upon me while her exalted head is hid from me among the stars sometimes with scorn at other times with pity i cannot bear it this i tell thee that if i have not success in my effort by letter i will overcome the creeping folly that has found its way to my heart or i will tear it out in her presence and throw it at hers that she may see how much more tender than her own that organ is which she and you and every one else have taken the liberty to call callous give notice of the people who live back and edge and on either hand of the cursed mother to remove their best effects if i am rejected for the first vengeance i shall take will be to set fire to that den of serpents nor will there be any fear of taking them when they are in any act that has the relish of salvation in it as shakspeare says so that my revenge if they perish in the flames i shall light up will be complete as to them letter lxxix mr lovelace to miss clarissa harlowe monday aug little as i have reason to expect either your patient ear or forgiving heart yet cannot i forbear to write to you once more as a more pardonable intrusion perhaps than a visit would be to beg of you to put it in my power to atone as far as it is possible to atone for the injuries i have done you your angelic purity and my awakened conscience are standing records of your exalted merit and of my detestable baseness but your forgiveness will lay me under an eternal obligation to you forgive me then my dearest life my earthly good the visible anchor of my future hope as you who believe you have something to be forgiven for hope for pardon yourself forgive me and consent to meet me upon your own conditions and in whose company you please at the holy altar and to give yourself a title to the most repentant and affectionate heart that ever beat in a human bosom but perhaps a time of probation may be required it may be impossible for you as well from indisposition as doubt so soon to receive me to absolute favour as my heart wishes to be received in this case i will submit to your pleasure and there shall be no penance which you can impose that i will not cheerfully undergo if you will be pleased to give me hope that after an expiation suppose of months wherein the regularity of my future life and actions shall convince you of my reformation you will at last be mine let me beg then the favour of a few lines encouraging me in this conditional hope if it must not be a still nearer hope and a more generous encouragement if you refuse me this you will make me desperate but even then i must at all events throw myself at your feet that i may not charge myself with the omission of any earnest any humble effort to move you in my favour for in you madam in your forgiveness are centred my hopes as to both worlds since to be reprobated finally by you will leave me without expectation of mercy from above for i am now awakened enough to think that to be forgiven by injured innocents is necessary to the divine pardon the almighty putting into the power of such as is reasonable to believe the wretch who causelessly and capitally offends them and who can be entitled to this power if you are not your cause madam in a word i look upon to be the cause of virtue and as such the cause of god and may i not expect that he will assert it in the perdition of a man who has acted by a person of the most spotless purity as i have done if you by rejecting me show that i have offended beyond the possibility of forgiveness i do most solemnly assure you that no temporal or worldly views induce me to this earnest address i deserve not forgiveness from you nor do my lord m and his sisters from me i despise them from my heart for presuming to imagine that i will be controuled by the prospect of any benefits in their power to confer there is not a person breathing but yourself who shall prescribe to me your whole conduct madam has been so nobly principled and your resentments are so admirably just that you appear to me even in a divine light and in an infinitely more amiable one at the same time than you could have appeared in had you not suffered the barbarous wrongs that now fill my mind with anguish and horror at my own recollected villany to the most excellent of women i repeat that all i beg for the present is a few lines to guide my doubtful steps and if possible for you so far to condescend to encourage me to hope that if i can justify my present vows by my future conduct i may be permitted the honour to style myself eternally yours r lovelace letter lxxx miss clarissa harlowe to lord m and to the ladies of his house in reply to miss montagues of aug see letter lxxvi of this volume tuesday aug excuse me my good lord and my everhonoured ladies from accepting of your noble quarterly bounty and allow me to return with all grateful acknowledgement and true humility the enclosed earnest of your goodness to me indeed i have no need of the one and cannot possibly want the other but nevertheless have such a sense of your generous favour that to my last hour i shall have pleasure in contemplating upon it and be proud of the place i hold in the esteem of such venerable persons to whom i once had the ambition to hope to be related but give me leave to express my concern that you have banished your kinsman from your presence and favour since now perhaps he will be under less restraint than ever and since i in particular who had hoped by your influence to remain unmolested for the remainder of my days may again be subjected to his persecutions he has not my good lord and my dear ladies offended against you as he has against me yet you could all very generously intercede for him with me and shall i be very improper if i desire for my own peacesake for the sake of other poor creatures who may still be injured by him if he be made quite desperate and for the sake of all your worthy family that you will extend to him that forgiveness which you hope for from me and this the rather as i presume to think that his daring and impetuous spirit will not be subdued by violent methods since i have no doubt that the gratifying of a present passion will be always more prevalent with him than any future prospects however unwarrantable the one or beneficial the other your resentments on my account are extremely generous as your goodness to me is truly noble but i am not without hope that he will be properly affected by the evils he has made me suffer and that when i am laid low and forgotten your whole honourable family will be enabled to rejoice in his reformation and see many of those happy years together which my good lord and my dear ladies you so kindly wish to your evergrateful and obliged clarissa harlowe letter lxxxi mr belford to robert lovelace esq thursday night aug you have been informed by tourville how much beltons illness and affairs have engaged me as well as mowbray and him since my former i called at smiths on monday in my way to epsom the lady was gone to chapel but i had the satisfaction to hear she was not worse and left my compliments and an intimation that i should be out of town for three or four days i refer myself to tourville who will let you know the difficulty we had to drive out this meek mistress and frugal manager with her cubs and to give the poor fellows sister possession for him of his own house he skulking mean while at an inn at croydon too dispirited to appear in his own cause but i must observe that we were probably but just in time to save the shattered remains of his fortune from this rapacious woman and her accomplices for as he cannot live long and she thinks so we found she had certainly taken measures to set up a marriage and keep possession of all for herself and her sons tourville will tell you how i was forced to chastise the quondam hostler in her sight before i could drive him out of the house he had the insolence to lay hands on me and i made him take but one step from the top to the bottom of a pair of stairs i thought his neck and all his bones had been broken and then he being carried out neckandheels thomasine thought fit to walk out after him charming consequences of keeping the state we have been so fond of extolling whatever it may be thought of in strong health sickness and declining spirits in the keeper will bring him to see the difference she should soon have him she told a confidant in the space of six foot by five meaning his bed and then she would let nobody come near him but whom she pleased this hostlerfellow i suppose would then have been his physician his will ready made for him and widows weeds probably ready provided who knows but she to appear in them in his own sight as once i knew an instance in a wicked wife insulting a husband she hated when she thought him past recovery though it gave the man such spirits and such a turn that he got over it and lived to see her in her coffin dressed out in the very weeds she had insulted him in so much for the present for belton and his thomasine i begin to pity thee heartily now i see thee in earnest in the fruitless love thou expressest to this angel of a woman and the rather as say what thou wilt it is impossible she should get over her illness and her friends implacableness of which she has had fresh instances i hope thou art not indeed displeased with the extracts i have made from thy letters for her the letting her know the justice thou hast done to her virtue in them is so much in favour of thy ingenuousness a quality let me repeat that gives thee a superiority over common libertines that i think in my heart i was right though to any other woman and to one who had not known the worst of thee that she could know it might have been wrong if the end will justify the means it is plain that i have done well with regard to ye both since i have made her easier and thee appear in a better light to her than otherwise thou wouldst have done but if nevertheless thou art dissatisfied with my having obliged her in a point which i acknowledge to be delicate let us canvas this matter at our first meeting and then i will show thee what the extracts were and what connections i gave them in thy favour but surely thou dost not pretend to say what i shall or shall not do as to the executorship i am my own man i hope i think thou shouldst be glad to have the justification of her memory left to one who at the same time thou mayest be assured will treat thee and thy actions with all the lenity the case will admit i cannot help expressing my surprise at one instance of thy selfpartiality and that is where thou sayest she has need indeed to cry out for mercy herself from her friends who knows not how to show any surely thou canst not think the cases alike for she as i understand desires but a last blessing and a last forgiveness for a fault in a manner involuntary if a fault at all and does not so much as hope to be received thou to be forgiven premeditated wrongs which nevertheless she forgives on condition to be no more molested by thee and hopest to be received into favour and to make the finest jewel in the world thy absolute property in consequence of that forgiveness i will now briefly proceed to relate what has passed since my last as to the excellent lady by the account i shall give thee thou wilt see that she has troubles enough upon her all springing originally from thyself without needing to add more to them by new vexations and as long as thou canst exert thyself so very cavalierly at m hall where every one is thy prisoner i see not but the bravery of thy spirit may be as well gratified in domineering there over half a dozen persons of rank and distinction as it could be over an helpless orphan as i may call this lady since she has not a single friend to stand by her if i do not and who will think herself happy if she can refuge herself from thee and from all the world in the arms of death my last was dated on saturday on sunday in compliance with her doctors advice she took a little airing mrs lovick and mr smith and his wife were with her after being at highgate chapel at divine service she treated them with a little repast and in the afternoon was at islington church in her way home returning tolerably cheerful she had received several letters in my absence as mrs lovick acquainted me besides yours yours it seems much distressed her but she ordered the messenger who pressed for an answer to be told that it did not require an immediate one on wednesday she received a letter from her uncle harlowe in answer to one she had written to her mother on saturday on her knees it must be a very cruel one mrs lovick says by the effects it had upon her for when she received it she was intending to take an afternoon airing in a coach but was thrown into so violent a fit of hysterics upon it that she was forced to lie down and being not recovered by it to go to bed about eight oclock see letter lxxxiv of this volume on thursday morning she was up very early and had recourse to the scriptures to calm her mind as she told mrs lovick and weak as she was would go in a chair to lincolnsinn chapel about eleven she was brought home a little better and then sat down to write to her uncle but was obliged to leave off several times to struggle as she told mrs lovick for an humble temper my heart said she to the good woman is a proud heart and not yet i find enough mortified to my condition but do what i can will be for prescribing resenting things to my pen i arrived in town from beltons this thursday evening and went directly to smiths she was too ill to receive my visit but on sending up my compliments she sent me down word that she should be glad to see me in the morning mrs lovick obliged me with the copy of a meditation collected by the lady from the scriptures she has entitled it poor mortals the cause of their own misery so entitled i presume with intention to take off the edge of her repinings at hardships so disproportioned to her fault were her fault even as great as she is inclined to think it we may see by this the method she takes to fortify her mind and to which she owes in a great measure the magnanimity with which she bears her undeserved persecutions meditation poor mortals the cause of their own misery say not thou it is through the lord that i fell away for thou oughtest not to do the thing that he hateth say not thou he hath caused me to err for he hath no need of the sinful man he himself made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel if thou wilt to keep the commandments and to perform acceptable faithfulness he hath set fire and water before thee stretch forth thine hand to whither thou wilt he hath commanded no man to do wickedly neither hath he given any man license to sin and now lord what is my hope truly my hope is only in thee deliver me from all my offences and make me not a rebuke unto the foolish when thou with rebuke dost chasten man for sin thou makest his beauty to consume away like as it were a moth fretting a garment every man therefore is vanity turn thee unto me and have mercy upon me for i am desolate and afflicted the troubles of my heart are enlarged o bring thou me out of my distresses mrs smith gave me the following particulars of a conversation that passed between herself and a young clergyman on tuesday afternoon who as it appears was employed to make inquiries about the lady by her friends he came into the shop in a ridinghabit and asked for some spanish snuff and finding only mrs smith there he desired to have a little talk with her in the backshop he beat about the bush in several distant questions and at last began to talk more directly about miss harlowe he said he knew her before her fall that was his impudent word and gave the substance of the following account of her as i collected it from mrs smith she was then he said the admiration and delight of every body he lamented with great solemnity her backsliding another of his phrases mrs smith said he was a fine scholar for he spoke several things she understood not and either in latin or greek she could not tell which but was so good as to give her the english of them without asking a fine thing she said for a scholar to be so condescending he said her going off with so vile a rake had given great scandal and offence to all the neighbouring ladies as well as to her friends he told mrs smith how much she used to be followed by every ones eye whenever she went abroad or to church and praised and blessed by every tongue as she passed especially by the poor that she gave the fashion to the fashionable without seeming herself to intend it or to know she did that however it was pleasant to see ladies imitate her in dress and behaviour who being unable to come up to her in grace and ease exposed but their own affectation and awkwardness at the time that they thought themselves secure of general approbation because they wore the same things and put them on in the same manner that she did who had every bodys admiration little considering that were her person like theirs or if she had their defects she would have brought up a very different fashion for that nature was her guide in every thing and ease her study which joined with a mingled dignity and condescension in her air and manner whether she received or paid a compliment distinguished her above all her sex he spoke not he said his own sentiments only on this occasion but those of every body for that the praises of miss clarissa harlowe were such a favourite topic that a person who could not speak well upon any other subject was sure to speak well upon that because he could say nothing but what he had heard repeated and applauded twenty times over hence it was perhaps that this novice accounted for the best things he said himself though i must own that the personal knowledge of the lady which i am favoured with made it easy to me to lick into shape what the good woman reported to me as the character given her by the young levite for who even now in her decline of health sees not that all these attributes belong to her i suppose he has not been long come from college and now thinks he has nothing to do but to blaze away for a scholar among the ignorant as such young fellows are apt to think those who cannot cap verses with them and tell us how an antient author expressed himself in latin on a subject upon which however they may know how as well as that author to express themselves in english mrs smith was so taken with him that she would fain have introduced him to the lady not questioning but it would be very acceptable to her to see one who knew her and her friends so well but this he declined for several reasons as he call them which he gave one was that persons of his cloth should be very cautious of the company they were in especially where sex was concerned and where a woman had slurred her reputation i wish i had been there when he gave himself these airs another that he was desired to inform himself of her present way of life and who her visiters were for as to the praises mrs smith gave the lady he hinted that she seemed to be a goodnatured woman and might though for the ladys sake he hoped not be too partial and shortsighted to be trusted to absolutely in a concern of so high a nature as he intimated the task was which he had undertaken nodding out words of doubtful import and assuming airs of great significance as i could gather throughout the whole conversation and when mrs smith told him that the lady was in a very bad state of health he gave a careless shrug she may be very ill says he her disappointments must have touched her to the quick but she is not bad enough i dare say yet to atone for her very great lapse and to expect to be forgiven by those whom she has so much disgraced a starched conceited coxcomb what would i give he had fallen in my way he departed highly satisfied with himself no doubt and assured of mrs smiths great opinion of his sagacity and learning but bid her not say any thing to the lady about him or his inquiries and i for very different reasons enjoined the same thing i am glad however for her peace of minds sake that they begin to think it behoves them to inquire about her letter lxxxii mr belford to robert lovelace esq friday aug mr belford acquaints his friend with the

against it and so i am to tell you that your letters joined to the occasion of them almost break the hearts of us all were we sure you had seen your folly and were truly penitent and at the same time that you were so very ill as you pretend i know not what might be done for you but we are all acquainted with your moving ways when you want to carry a point unhappy girl how miserable have you made us all we who used to visit with so much pleasure now cannot endure to look upon one another if you had not know upon an hundred occasions how dear you once was to us you might judge of it now were you to know how much your folly has unhinged us all naughty naughty girl you see the fruits of preferring a rake and libertine to a man of sobriety and morals against full warning against better knowledge and such a modest creature too as you were how could you think of such an unworthy preference your mother cant ask and your sister knows not in modesty how to ask and so i ask you if you have any reason to think yourself with child by this villain you must answer this and answer it truly before any thing can be resolved upon about you you may well be touched with a deep remorse for your misdeeds could i ever have thought that my dotingpiece as every one called you would have done thus to be sure i loved you too well but that is over now yet though i will not pretend to answer

meditation o that thou wouldst hide me in the grave that thou wouldst keep me secret till thy wrath be past my face is foul with weeping and on my eyelid is the shadow of death my friends scorn me but mine eye poureth out tears unto god a dreadful sound is in my ears in prosperity the destroyer came upon me i have sinned what shall i do unto thee o thou preserver of men why hast thou set me as a mark against thee so that i am a burden to myself when i say my bed shall comfort me my couch shall ease my complaint then thou scarest me with dreams and terrifiest me through visions so that my soul chooseth strangling and death rather than life i loath it i would not live always let me alone for my days are vanity he hath made me a byeword of the people and aforetime i was as a tabret my days

last scene with comfort without seeking at least to obtain the blessing i petitioned for and that with a contrition so deep that i deserved not were it known to be turned over from the tender nature of a mother to the upbraiding pen of an uncle and to be wounded by a cruel question put by him in a shocking manner and which a little a very little time will better answer than i can for i am not
